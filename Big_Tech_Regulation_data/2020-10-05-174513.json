More than a billion people are eligible to vote in national polls in Thailand, India, Indonesia and the Philippines over the next two months, creating huge opportunities for the creation of divisive online content. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tempers run high at election time, and the risks that social media can exacerbate existing political tensions is now abundantly clear. Given its scandal-prone record, Facebook, in particular, will be lucky to escape without further damage to its image. But now there is a further danger, given that any further missteps risk a new round of regulatory retaliation, at a time when a backlash against foreign \"big tech\" companies is brewing around Asia. </p><p>Facebook is of course hardly alone. Its social media rivals, including Google and Twitter, are also under intense pressure to show they are beginning to reverse the relentless tide of fake news and malicious posts that have marred polls in the U.S., Brazil and elsewhere. But Facebook, along with its sister messenger service WhatsApp, has endured particularly severe scrutiny since revelations last year that the group shared data on millions of users with Cambridge Analytica, a British consulting company. In Asia, its platforms stand accused of everything from spreading online disinformation and facilitating lynchings in India to fomenting ethnic violence in Myanmar and Sri Lanka. </p><p>Worries about the electoral influence of social media are driven partly by media consumption patterns, which have changed drastically since India and Indonesia, by far the largest countries now voting, last held national elections in 2014. More than half a billion Indians are now online. Both Facebook and WhatsApp boast well over 200 million users in the country, with 115 million more for Facebook in Indonesia. The platforms are especially important for burgeoning groups of younger voters. </p><p>Self-evidently there are plenty of things that could go wrong. Political parties in both countries are increasingly adept at online skulduggery, as are civic and religious groups. Foreign interference cannot be ruled out. In mid-March, Indonesia complained of election meddling by both China and Russia. Relatively weak institutions, both in terms of old-fashioned broadcast media and the country's electoral bodies, provide few safeguards. </p><p>The big social media groups are only too aware of these threats. Google says it has tightened up rules to restrict who can advertise on its platforms. Facebook is setting up election \"war rooms\" in Singapore and Dublin, while also beefing the number of staff employed to monitor problematic content. A Facebook spokesperson said its preparations for India and Indonesia included \"setting a new standard for ads transparency, cracking down on fake accounts, working with third-party fact checkers [and] taking down coordinated inauthentic networks.\" </p><p>In truth, though, the platforms face a quandary. Elections require free speech. Platforms like Twitter, WhatsApp and YouTube are where much of that speech now happens. Restrictions on content sharing and advertisements are likely to limit legitimate communication too. Even so, the sheer volume of malicious material spread over their services are likely to overwhelm even these new attempts to respond. </p><p>Facebook favors automated systems to detect and remove problems. The approach works reasonably well in areas like pornography or fake accounts, hundreds of millions of which are automatically deactivated each quarter. Yet the recent tragic events in New Zealand showed how hard it is to stop even totally unacceptable content, as Facebook, YouTube and others struggled to remove violent video footage as its spread across their networks. </p><p>Political speech is even more complicated. It is hard to judge in advance which posts are malicious or intentionally inaccurate, or which cross a line into hate speech. Managing content in myriad local languages -- India officially has 22 -- is also tricky. </p><p>Facebook's systems for managing these issues remain reactive, meaning they respond by reviewing complaints. The results often appear slow and under-resourced. A recent report claimed its outsourced content moderators were paid on average $28,000 a year, compared to the roughly $240,000 Facebook says it gave its median employee in 2017. </p><p>Ultimately Facebook and its rivals are struggling to overcome a tension built into their businesses, which are custom-designed to spread content and sell advertising. Facebook has so far taken minor steps to limit political adverts from foreign-funded or anonymous groups. But, it and other social media groups still hope to make tidy sums over the coming months selling ads that bounce off excitement about Asia's various polls. </p><p>The most promising recent sign that these social media groups are beginning to grapple seriously with these tensions came via WhatsApp. In January, the message service unveiled new global rules stopping users forwarding messages to more than five people or groups at a time -- a limit it first introduced in India in 2018 following a clamor of concern about the unchecked forwarding of incendiary content. Whatsapp's move dramatically cut the \"virality\" of messages on its platform, restricting fake news in the process. </p><p>This kind of far-reaching voluntary self-restriction by social media platforms remains rare, however. The upcoming elections also come at a bad time for the companies politically. In India, there is a growing protectionist turn against foreign tech giants, as domestic entrepreneurs worry that their country has failed to create domestic national champions in the vein of China's Alibaba and Tencent. India, Indonesia and Vietnam are pushing restrictive new data localization laws too. </p><p>All this marks a growing business threat. Facebook and Google remain barred from China, so their hopes for future growth rely on Asia's other emerging giants. At its most recent results, Facebook said India, Indonesia and the Philippines were now the most important engines of growth for its 1.5 billion daily users. </p><p>If Facebook and its rivals are perceived to stumble in Asia's upcoming polls they now face a double risk: new restrictions targeting their role in politics, as well as other nationalist-inspired measures aimed at their limiting their businesses more generally. If they don't act firmly to reign in their algorithms, Asia's lawmakers are ever-more likely to do it for them. </p><p>James Crabtree is an associate professor in practice at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore.

The company is working on a coin that users of WhatsApp, which Facebook owns, could send to friends and family instantly, said five people briefed on the effort who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality agreements.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Facebook project is far enough along that the social networking giant has held conversations with cryptocurrency exchanges about selling the Facebook coin to consumers, said four people briefed on the negotiations.</p><p>Telegram, which has an estimated 300 million users worldwide, is also working on a digital coin. A coin is in the works that will work with Signal, an encrypted messaging service that is popular among technologists and privacy advocates. And so do the biggest messaging applications in South Korea and Japan, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kakaos-ground-x-unveils-its-blockchain-platform-klaytn-300726770.html\">Kakao</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://linecorp.com/en/pr/news/en/2018/2399\">Line</url>.</p><p>The messaging companies have a reach that dwarfs the backers of earlier cryptocurrencies. Facebook and Telegram can make the digital wallets used for cryptocurrencies available, in an instant, to hundreds of millions of users.</p><p>All of the new projects are going after a market that has already proved popular with consumers. Venmo has taken off in the United States by making it easier to send payments by phone. And in China, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/16/business/china-cash-smartphone-payments.html\">many consumers use</url> the payment system that operates inside the hugely popular WeChat messaging system.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty much the most fascinating thing happening in crypto right now,\u201d said Eric Meltzer, a co-founder of a cryptocurrency-focused venture capital firm, Primitive Ventures. \u201cThey each have their own advantage in this battle, and it will be insane to watch it go down.\u201d</p><p>In a statement, Facebook did not directly address its work on a digital coin. The other companies declined to comment on their projects. Most of them appear to be working on digital coins that could exist on a decentralized network of computers, independent to some degree of the companies that created them.</p><p>Like Bitcoin, the new cryptocurrencies would make it easier to move money between countries, particularly in the developing world where it is hard for ordinary people to open bank accounts and buy things online. The current designs being discussed generally do away with the energy-guzzling mining process that Bitcoin relies on.</p><p>But the messaging companies are likely to face many of the same regulatory and technological hurdles that have kept Bitcoin from going mainstream. The lack of a central authority over cryptocurrencies \u2014 a government or a bank \u2014 has made them useful to criminals and scammers, and the designs of the computer networks that manage them make it hard to handle significant numbers of transactions.</p><p>\u201cThey are all going to run up against these same types of technological limits,\u201d said Richard Ma, the chief executive of Quantstamp, a firm that provides security audits for new cryptocurrencies.</p><p>The companies are throwing significant resources into their projects, even as the prices of cryptocurrencies have plunged over the last year.</p><p>Facebook has more than 50 engineers working on its project, three people familiar with the effort said. An industry website, The Block, has been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theblockcrypto.com/tiny/facebook-grows-blockchain-team-as-it-looks-to-onboard-13-new-staff/\">keeping track</url> of the steady flow of new job listings for the Facebook project.</p><p>The Facebook effort, which is being run by a former president of PayPal, David Marcus, started last year after <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/04/technology/telegram-initial-coin-offering.html\">Telegram raised an eye-popping $1.7 billion</url> to fund its cryptocurrency project.</p><p>Facebook has been coy about what it is building.

The company is working on a coin that users of WhatsApp, which Facebook owns, could send to friends and family instantly, said five people briefed on the effort who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality agreements.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Facebook project is far enough along that the social networking giant has held conversations with cryptocurrency exchanges about selling the Facebook coin to consumers, said four people briefed on the negotiations.</p><p>Telegram, which has an estimated 300 million users worldwide, is also working on a digital coin. Signal, an encrypted messaging service that is popular among technologists and privacy advocates, has its own coin in the works. And so do the biggest messaging applications in South Korea and Japan, Kakao and Line.</p><p>The messaging companies have a reach that dwarfs the backers of earlier cryptocurrencies. Facebook and Telegram can make the digital wallets used for cryptocurrencies available, in an instant, to hundreds of millions of users.</p><p>All of the new projects are going after a market that has already proved popular with consumers. Venmo has taken off in the United States by making it easier to send payments by phone. And in China, many consumers use the payment system that operates inside the hugely popular WeChat messaging system.</p><p>\"It's pretty much the most fascinating thing happening in crypto right now,\" said Eric Meltzer, a co-founder of a cryptocurrency-focused venture capital firm, Primitive Ventures. \"They each have their own advantage in this battle, and it will be insane to watch it go down.\"</p><p>In a statement, Facebook did not directly address its work on a digital coin. The other companies declined to comment on their projects. Most of them appear to be working on digital coins that could exist on a decentralized network of computers, independent to some degree of the companies that created them.</p><p>Like Bitcoin, the new cryptocurrencies would make it easier to move money between countries, particularly in the developing world where it is hard for ordinary people to open bank accounts and buy things online. The current designs being discussed generally do away with the energy-guzzling mining process that Bitcoin relies on.</p><p>But the messaging companies are likely to face many of the same regulatory and technological hurdles that have kept Bitcoin from going mainstream. The lack of a central authority over cryptocurrencies - a government or a bank - has made them useful to criminals and scammers, and the designs of the computer networks that manage them make it hard to handle significant numbers of transactions.</p><p>\"They are all going to run up against these same types of technological limits,\" said Richard Ma, the chief executive of Quantstamp, a firm that provides security audits for new cryptocurrencies.</p><p>The companies are throwing significant resources into their projects, even as the prices of cryptocurrencies have plunged over the last year.</p><p>Facebook has more than 50 engineers working on its project, three people familiar with the effort said. An industry website, The Block, has been keeping track of the steady flow of new job listings for the Facebook project.</p><p>The Facebook effort, which is being run by a former president of PayPal, David Marcus, started last year after Telegram raised an eye-popping $1.7 billion to fund its cryptocurrency project.</p><p>Facebook has been coy about what it is building. The team is in an office with separate key-card access so other Facebook employees cannot get in, according to two Facebook employees.</p><p>Facebook is looking at several ways to use the blockchain, the technology introduced by Bitcoin that makes it possible to keep shared records of financial transactions on several computers, rather than relying on one big central player like PayPal or Visa.</p><p>The five people who have been briefed on the Facebook team's work said the company's most immediate product was likely to be a coin that would be pegged to the value of traditional currencies, as Bloomberg first reported.</p><p>A digital token with a stable value would not be attractive to speculators - the main audience for cryptocurrencies so far - but it would allow consumers to hold it and pay for things without worrying about the value of the coin rising and falling.</p><p>Several other companies have recently introduced so-called stablecoins, linked to the value of the dollar. JPMorgan Chase even said it was experimenting with the concept last month.</p><p>Facebook is looking at pegging the value of its coin to a basket of different foreign currencies, rather than just the dollar, three people briefed on the plans said. Facebook could guarantee the value of the coin by backing every coin with a set number of dollars, euros and other national currencies held in Facebook bank accounts.</p><p>The company is overhauling its messaging infrastructure, which would connect three of its properties - Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram. That integration, which could take more than a year, would extend the reach of Facebook's digital currency across the 2.7 billion people who use one of the three apps each month.</p><p>The big question facing Facebook is how much control it would retain over the digital coin. If Facebook is responsible for approving every transaction and keeping track of every user, it is not clear why it would need a blockchain system, rather than a traditional, centralized system like PayPal.</p><p>Working with cryptocurrency exchanges would take at least some of the regulatory burden off Facebook, since the exchanges would be responsible for holding the digital coins and vetting customers.</p><p>But if Facebook goes with a coin it does not entirely control, it will be harder for the company to make money from transaction fees and easier for criminals to use the coin for illegal purposes.</p><p>Facebook employees have told the exchanges that they are hoping to get a product out in the first half of the year.</p><p>The coins from the other messaging companies are likely to look more like traditional cryptocurrencies, with fluctuating values and a decentralized design that would give users more control.</p><p>Telegram, which was started by a team of Russian exiles, has prided itself on thumbing its nose at governments.

She may be the most prominent\u00a0denier of Big Tech's new role,\u00a0but she's not the only one. Sandberg's colleague,\u00a0Andrew Bosworth, Facebook's head of consumer hardware, echoed\u00a0her position\u00a0on Twitter[2]\u00a0this week. Their argument goes like this: because tech companies generally don't employ journalists who report and write the news, they can't be media companies. </p><p>But that\u00a0position ignores the facts of how the media business has changed and how people today consume news, information and entertainment. Facebook's news feed has become what the front page of the newspaper was for older generations of people;\u00a0at least 66% of the social network's\u00a02 billion users rely on it as a news source, according to a 2016 Pew study[3]. Meanwhile, consumers turn to Twitter for breaking news, and they search Google for news updates.\u00a0 But consumers didn't just change their media habits on their own. The tech companies argument also\u00a0conveniently disregards how the big tech companies themselves have purposefully and intentionally tried to become go-to news destinations.  Facebook purposely designed its algorithms to customize users' news feeds to\u00a0show them the stories and other information they're mostly likely to engage with, whether by clicking on\u00a0a\u00a0headline or typing in a comment.\u00a0Google not only operates Google News and touts live news events on YouTube, but it's even altered its core search feature to show links to relevant articles above search\u00a0results\u00a0when users search for newsworthy items. And Twitter has launched numerous features, including a \"What's Happening Now\" page and a \"Moments,\" to highlight news stories and information.\u00a0 Perhaps most damning to Big Tech's line of argument is the impact those companies, particularly Facebook and Google, have had on the rest of the media business. Advertising is the lifeblood of media companies. And with ads increasingly shifting away from traditional media such as newspapers and television to digital ones such as the web and mobile devices, old media companies have been trying to move in that direction too. But they're failing, thanks to Big Tech. Last year,\u00a0Facebook and Google\u00a0accounted for 99% of all the growth[4]\u00a0in digital advertising, according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau, leaving\u00a0peanuts for the rest of online media platforms. That dynamic will almost certainly repeat itself this year.\u00a0 And that's not to mention Big Tech's broader effort to become Big Media. Facebook, Google and Twitter, as well as Apple and Amazon, are all all aiming at Hollywood by investing in originally produced entertainment videos, television shows and movies.\u00a0 In a very real way, Facebook and the other companies are deciding what news millions of people see. There's just no disputing the fact that Big Tech has massive influence\u00a0over the way people consume media. But it's also become increasingly clear that the big tech companies aren't shouldering the responsibility that comes hand in hand with that influence.\u00a0 The denials from Sandberg and others about even being in the media business are just a piece of that.\u00a0A bigger, more important example is how the companies have reacted to the growing pile of evidence that propagandists linked to Russia manipulated their sites and systems in an effort to influence last year's election.\u00a0 In the days after the election, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg gave his infamous \"pretty crazy\" comment[5]\u00a0about the notion that his company influenced the result by distributing propagandistic fake news. (He recently took those comments back.) While Google CEO Sundar Pichai acknowledged[6] that such fake news could possibly have swayed voters and said the company needed to crack down it, his company and the other members of Big Tech, have done\u00a0little to solve it[7]\u00a011 months later. And it's not clear if\u00a0the tech companies will ever fix\u00a0the fake news and propaganda problem on their own, despite the public outcry. In recent months, executives\u00a0at Google and other companies have\u00a0argued\u00a0\u2014 privately \u2014 that the problem was just too big to solve. Much of the value these companies believe they have comes from allowing users to post pretty much whatever they want to their sites. If the companies were to more thoroughly police what users post, they worry they would lose that openness and undermine their sites' appeal.\u00a0 But Big Tech\u00a0will likely\u00a0only be able to duck from its duties for so long. If it\u00a0won't accept the responsibility that comes from it's transformation into Big Media on its own, it may be forced to.\u00a0 Already there are rumblings among different governments that they may step in.\u00a0A pair of senators concerned\u00a0that Russian-backed groups surreptitiously tried to influence last year's election are working on a bill that would force companies like Facebook to track and, in some cases, publicly disclose the purchasers of political ads. Meanwhile, the\u00a0UK is considering formally reclassifying[8]\u00a0Facebook and Google as media companies, which would subject them to new legal responsibilities.  So whatever Sandberg might say, it's clear that tech has taken over media. And Big Tech is running out of excuses\u00a0for why it should see the benefits that go along with that change \u2014 but not bear the burdens.NOW WATCH: The 5 most annoying changes in the new iPhone

Lindsey Graham was backing the Green New Deal championed by  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other Democrats whom President Donald Trump has labeled socialists?</p><p>Neither is true. But you wouldn't necessarily know that if you saw ads on Facebook trumpeting such lies. And founder Mark Zuckerberg has made it clear in hearings and statements in recent weeks that he has no intention whatsoever of helping Facebook's millions of U.S. subscribers determine what is true and what is false in ads on his platform during the 2020 presidential campaign, which is already well on its way with candidates having spent more than $60 million in ads on Facebook and Google.</p><p>At that pace, such spending is sure to surpass the $80 million spent in 2016, the bulk of it from Mr. Trump's campaign. And that doesn't count the tens of millions spent by foreign countries and other groups to spread disinformation, propaganda, conspiracy theories and lies.</p><p>The last month has been filled with news about Facebook and its unwillingness to police itself, to act with any shred of the kind of editorial accountability demanded of broadcasters since the Communications Act of 1934.</p><p>Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren has been blasting away at Mr. Zuckerberg and Facebook on the campaign trail for the decision to carry ads like the one cited at the start of this column from the Trump campaign lying about Mr. Biden and an alleged billion-dollar payoff in connection with his son. </p><p>(There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Mr. Biden in connection with his son Hunter, who sat on the board of the Ukrainian energy firm, which is one of the reasons CNN refused to air the ad.)</p><p>\"Facebook holds incredible power to affect elections and our national debate. They've decided to let political figures lie to you - even about Facebook itself - while their executives and their investors get even richer off the ads containing these lies,\" Sen. Warren wrote in one of several tweets.</p><p>\"If Trump tries to lie in a TV ad, most networks will refuse to air it,\" she wrote in another. \"But Facebook just cashes Trump's checks.\"</p><p>Sen.  Warren has vowed to break up big tech firms like Facebook. Mr. Zuckerberg, in remarks made to his employees, has vowed to fight her tooth and nail with a \"major lawsuit\" if she tries.</p><p> Rep. Ocasio-Cortez has also become a very public critic of Mr. Zuckerberg over his unwillingness to take down political ads that contain lies. Last week, she confronted him at a congressional hearing asking him pointedly what it would take for him to remove political ads that contained material that had been shown to be false.</p><p>The core of his dissembling answer: Facebook will not remove a politician's speech even if it is clearly false.</p><p>The false Facebook ad alleging that Sen. Graham backed the Green New Deal was posted in the wake of that exchange by a political action committee named The Really Online Lefty League to test, highlight and possibly mock Facebook's policy on political lies.</p><p>The ad was taken down Saturday with Facebook saying it will take down lies from political groups but not from politicians.</p><p>It is not just politicians and groups on the left that have called out Facebook for the way its policies imperil democracy.</p><p>The New York Times reported Monday that more than 250 Facebook employees signed a letter to Mr. Zuckerberg protesting his decision to let politicians lie in ads on the platform. The letter says Mr. Zuckerberg's decision \"allows politicians to weaponize our platform by targeting people who believe that content posted by political figures is trustworthy.\"</p><p>And yet, for all of the criticism, outrage and documentation of disinformation that Facebook has published in the last three years, nothing has changed for the better since 2016. In fact, things are worse: The biggest liar in the history of the American presidency has the largest media platform in the history of the world to spread his propaganda, misinformation, lies, innuendo, smears and conspiracy theories as we plunge deeper into the 2020 race. And you wonder why our information ecosystem is so polluted - and we are such a confused and agitated country.</p><p>Early in 2018, I wrote a column asking how close we were going to skate to the edge of losing our democracy before we decided to regulate social media platforms like Facebook.</p><p>If this isn't the edge, it's more than close enough for me.</p><p>David Zurawik is The Sun's media critic.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:david.zurawik@baltsun.com\">david.zurawik@baltsun.com</email>;

People are willing to pay a premium figuring that Facebook has more opportunity to increase revenue and earnings.</p><p>This valuation gap started to shrink late last year, and briefly flipped during Facebook's Cambridge Analytica crisis in March - to the point where, for the first time, Alphabet's stock was consistently more expensive than Facebook's relative to the companies' profits. Different measures of earnings also show narrowing valuation gaps.</p><p>Facebook's ebbing valuation is owing in part to concerns - encapsulated by the controversy over Facebook data harvested by Cambridge Analytica - that the company will have its wings clipped by regulators or its profits will be crimped by the costs to clamp down on abuses of its social network.</p><p>Of course, one person's squeezed valuation is another person's buying opportunity, and the shrinking gap isn't a secret to savvy tech investors. Slightly more of the analysts who follow Facebook recommend buying those shares today, versus the beginning of the year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.</p><p>Facebook's valuation parity to Alphabet might in fact be a temporary blip. But if the company's earnings power or growth are diminished, its shrinking market appraisal may be proved correct in the future. This may be Facebook's new normal.</p><p>And that brings me to the other tech stock oddball. Twitter has always been pricey relative to its (until recently non-existent) earnings, but the recent share recovery has made its valuation inexplicable.</p><p>Under generally accepted accounting principles, Twitter's enterprise value - or the market value of its stock minus cash plus debt - is 2,074 times its net income over the 12 months ended March 31, according to calculations derived from Bloomberg data. Allow me to provide a sophisticated analysis: That is bonkers. On the same measure, perennial crazily valued Amazon is trading at 221 times its trailing net income.</p><p>Yes, Twitter doesn't tend to be valued on conventional metrics.</p><p>Based on earnings excluding interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization - but including the cost of stock compensation for employees - Twitter's enterprise value is 55 times this measure.</p><p>That's still nuts. (Bloomberg produces a video-news network called TicToc for Twitter.)</p><p>Since Twitter went public nearly five years ago, its stock price relative to earnings generally has been lower than Facebook's. The discount was warranted. Twitter had far fewer users, advertisers didn't love it, there was no profit and revenue was significantly smaller. Now, the roles have reversed. While Twitter trades at 55 times its EBITDA for the past 12 months, Facebook investors are paying 21 times. (The picture is similar for forecasted EBITDA; I'm not using those figures because some analysts strip out Twitter stock compensation from estimates, and they don't for Facebook.)</p><p>Twitter's outsized valuation gets lost sometimes in the narrative about the company's recovery. Twitter isn't an utter mess any more. It is making genuinely smart changes to products for users and advertisers, and it slashed spending - including for its infamously high stock compensation.</p><p>But the rapidly climbing stock means Twitter's market value already reflects expectations of the company becoming both significantly more profitable, and rebounding from the days of shrinking revenue. Even if Twitter gets there, how much more can its valuation, and therefore its share price, keep rising?</p><p>Short-term stock market quirks have a way of sorting themselves out. For Facebook, a return to normal valuation may be welcome. For Twitter, not so much.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOBML-GAM20180713rbbcfacebookfbandtwitters</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOBML2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SSS-6521-F06S-317X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303830</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"799\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

The Singapore government \"is asking for platform-level changes that will have a global effect.\" </p><p>Designed to stem the viral spread of fake news online, companies will be required to respond rapidly to ministerial directives declaring a social media post or online news story to be untrue. </p><p>If the offending content is not taken down, or a correction is not displayed prominently alongside it, then companies face fines of up to SG$1 million ($740,000). Individuals who post content deemed untrue could face fines of up to SG$20,000 and/or 12 months in jail. </p><p>Appeals against directives can only be launched after the fact, first to the minister who issued the directive, and then to the High Court, a process that is likely to be time consuming and costly. </p><p>Expected to face little opposition in parliament where the ruling People's Action Party enjoys an overwhelming majority, the new laws are likely to come into effect in the second half of this year. </p><p>What worries big tech most \"is fragmentation,\" said Dexter Thillien, a technology analyst at Fitch Solutions, adding that building technical fixes to comply with individual laws would not be prohibitively expensive if only Singapore enacted such laws. </p><p>\"They're global businesses and they want to have more or less the same type of services everywhere,\" Thillien said. \"If you have a rule in Australia, a rule in New Zealand, a rule in Canada, a rule in Europe, a rule in the US, a rule in Singapore, and they're slightly different, obviously that increases the cost of compliance.\" </p><p>Singapore, which ranks 151 out of 180 countries on Reporters Without Borders' 2018 press freedom index, already has several legal tools to force content to be taken offline or blocked, and regularly uses swingeing defamation and sedition laws to target critics. </p><p>Still, the city-state also serves as the Asia-Pacific headquarters for many tech and social media companies, including Facebook, Twitter and Google. Facebook is also in the process of building a $1 billion data center in Singapore that is due to open in 2022. </p><p>\"The new law is designed to give [the government] a precision tool to tackle the specific issues related to online content,'' said Eugene Tan, an associate professor of law at Singapore Management University and a former nominated member of parliament. Forcing platforms and websites to post \"corrections\" while leaving the original content in the public domain gives the government a more \"calibrated approach,\" said Tan. </p><p>Under the proposed laws, sites or users deemed to be repeat offenders may be blacklisted, with internet service providers and \"intermediaries\" such as social media platforms required to shut off access to paid content from blacklisted sites in order to prevent them from deriving revenue from readers in Singapore. </p><p>Social media companies have consistently argued that although their platforms carry content, they are not publishers and are not directly accountable for it. Singapore's legislation could turn that on its head, forcing them to carry the burden and the cost of dealing with fake news, and creating a precedent that could be emulated elsewhere. </p><p>According to Tan, the change in the law of most concern to platform companies is that \"the law does not treat them\" as being intermediaries. \"I wouldn't say that it treats them as a publisher, but it treats them akin to a publisher, in that they have responsibility for what appears on their platform,\" Tan said. </p><p>While Facebook and Google declined to comment directly, a statement by the Asia Internet Coalition said, \"Prescriptive legislation should not be the first solution in addressing what is a highly nuanced and complex issue.\" </p><p>\"We are also concerned that the proposed legislation gives the Singapore government full discretion over what is considered true or false,\" the statement added. \"As the most far-reaching legislation of its kind to date, this level of overreach poses significant risks to freedom of expression and speech, and could have severe ramifications both in Singapore and around the world,\" the statement said. </p><p>\"Twitter recognizes the importance of the Select Committee's work on 'Deliberate Online Falsehoods,' and we have appreciated the opportunity to engage with the Singapore government throughout this process,\" a spokesperson for the company said. \"We only saw the law in its entirety for the first time [earlier this month], and our teams are still reviewing to assess its implications.\" </p><p>Civil society groups have also expressed concern that the law could have a chilling effect on free speech in Singapore. This Sunday a rare public protest against the proposed laws is set to take place, where organizers are calling on people to come and mourn the death of free speech. </p><p>And last weekend a group of 83 academics specializing in Asian studies signed letters to the government expressing concern at the scope of the proposed fake news laws. </p><p>\"Just like other media laws in Singapore, the act itself does not reveal all of the government's teeth, because there are powers that will be left to subsidiary legislation,\" said Cherian George, a Singaporean academic and now professor of journalism at Hong Kong Baptist University, who is one of the signatories to the letter. </p><p>\"What we need to watch out for is the likelihood that there will be subsidiary regulation that won't go through parliament that will impose additional obligations on mass media, including foreign publications that are influential in Singapore,\" George said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NIKKEI-RSI069129818042019</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NIKKEI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VYR-CWV1-JBWB-X005-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8002</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1039\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Nikkei Asian Review (Japan)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 25, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00073V9</classCode><className>FITCH RATINGS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Dow Jones has done absolutely nothing. Barely changed, it's four points -- five points closed lower. All the major indices are down for the day. Yes, thank you, I thought it was going to be a pathetic gavel. But no, right at the last minute he pulled it out of the hat. Trading is over. The week is finished. It's Friday. It's September the 22nd.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight, they changed the world and the world is fighting back. Facebook and Uber are facing the music.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Theresa May wants two years of extra time before Brexit is complete. Will the Europeans go along with that?</p><p>And the U.S. travel band expires this weekend. Now new restrictions are coming.</p><p>I'm Richard Quest live in the world's financial capital, New York City. And of course, I mean business.</p><p>Good evening. Tonight, Uber and Facebook. Two of the largest companies of the digital revolution. They revolutionize their industries, I think we can all agree, they've change the way we travel and interact. Millions of customers, tens of millions of times, and two of the world's most powerful and popular tech companies. Now, both are facing urgent challenges to the business model that's got them so far.</p><p>Let's start with Uber. The company has promised to contest a decision by Transport for London to strip it of its license to operate. Transport for London has ruled Uber is not fit and proper to operate a licensed Company in the British capital. And has done so on a basis of a lack of corporate responsibility around safety and security issues. Uber's license expires barely a week or so's time at the end of the month. It can, of course, continue to serve its 3.5 million London customers as the appeals process continues. 300,000 people have signed a have signed a petition Protesting against Transport for London's decision to declare it not fit and proper. London's mayor is not among them. Sadiq Khan says he fully supports the regulators decision. He spoke to CNN's Erin McLaughlin who sent this report from London.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ERIN MCLAUGHLIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I'm told this decision involved a lengthy and meticulous review process by Transport for London or TFL, the regulatory body which governs London's transport networks. There were several reasons for this decision. Primarily relating to safety and security of Uber. It's approach to be background checks, extensive background checks of its drivers, as well as the way it reports criminality. Earlier I spoke to London's mayor, Sadiq Khan, who says he supports this decision. Take a listen.</p><p>SADIQ KHAN, MAYOR OF LONDON: If you're an Uber driver, if you're an Uber user, you're right to be angry at Uber for failing to play by the rules. The question you should be asking, why is Uber not playing by the rules? And Uber has said they're going to appeal this decision. Uber employees, and army of lawyers and public relations teams, and they've already set out there plans to appeal this decision.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: London's black cabbies are likely to be celebrating this decision. They have long protested Uber's presence in the city. They're union actually backs one of the Mayor Sadiq Khan. Although, he told me that this had nothing to do with his decision or any sort of political involvement that TFL is an independent body. The people who are probably are very upset by this decision, of course, some 40,000 Uber drivers, registered Uber drivers, as well as the millions of people within the city that use their services. We spoke to some of them and they're pretty upset.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I am like shattered. What will I do want to Sunday night now.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I use one like every day. It's just an easier, better way to get around. A black cab fare is so expensive.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: At the end of the day it's a reliable service. Not only in London, if you are foreigner -- if I fly out to New York or go to somewhere else, and I know exactly by pushing a button I'm getting a reliable driver. He is checked. I know him. We talk and they're all friendly, all of them. And they also have their families.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: Uber hitting back at the allegation saying quote, the Mayor and Transport for London have caved into a small number of people who want to restrict consumer choice.</p><p>[16:05:00] It does plan to appeal and to continue to function while the appeal process is underway. Erin McLaughlin, CNN London.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: The issues facing Uber, now to Facebook. President Trump says news that Russian groups try to influence the U.S. election through placing ads on Facebook, he called it a hoax. Meanwhile, Facebook itself is pledging to turn over the contents of those ads to U.S. congressional investigators. It's a nine-point plan Facebook's putting forward to combat election interference. Facebook will now disclose which groups paid for political ads. Mark Zuckerberg says, that will make Facebook as more transparent than those on television.</p><p>The company will also strengthen its add review process adding 250 members to its election integrity team. And it wants to use its existing anti- bullying technology to combat political harassment. CNN's Dylan Byers is in Los Angeles. Let's do the practicalities and then will do the philosophy. The practicalities, 250 people. So, real live human beings as opposed to algorithms are going to be introduced -- which can only be probably a blessing. But this idea that they're going to identify political ads. That's not going to be so easy when is not as straightforward as an ad for a particular position or obviously, a candidate.</p><p>DYLAN BYERS, CNNMONEY SENIOR REPORTER FOR MEDIA AND POLITICS: No, it's not going to be easy. And if you look at what CEO, Mark Zuckerberg said just yesterday, even he's leaving open the door for the possibility that Facebook is not going to be able to catch everything ahead of time. Part of that has to do with the complicated nature of advertising on Facebook.</p><p>It's not like you buy a 30 second spot the way you might on television or on radio. Very often when you buy and add, what you're actually buying is the ability to sponsor a post. And what in this day and age, Richard, is not political? So, it doesn't have to be about Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton. It can be about an issue, like immigration, LGBTQ. What happens when you get into that murky territory between business and politics, tech and politics, media and politics? It's a very tricky space. And that is why you see the addition of this 250-member team because they know that an algorithm can't do this. They know there has to be a human element here.</p><p>QUEST: So, that's the practicalities. Whether it's going to work only time will tell -- to use the old phrase. But on the philosophical, Facebook wanted nothing to do with this issue. They done nothing wrong. Then they weren't going to hand over. Now they're handing over. It's the same thing again with this issue of are they a media company. Are they a news company? And where does Facebook now stand?</p><p>BYERS: Well, they always seem to be a few weeks late whenever there's a controversy. A few weeks late to accountability, to full transparency. The issue here is that there's differences of opinion even inside the company. Initially they thought of themselves as a platform. And in that regard, they were morally agnostic. They said look, here's the platform. Humanity does what humanity does with it. Now they understand they are so big. They have so much influence. There is even a question of among some people on both the right and the left as to whether or not Facebook or other major social media companies or digital companies should be public utilities. It comes with a lot of responsibility. And so, Facebook's in this very murky space now where they simultaneously want to be an open platform that doesn't police speech, doesn't police political advertising, but also knows that may not be a choice for them going forward in light of what happened in 2016.</p><p>QUEST: All right. Since you cover digital and media and all of these areas, let me take you right to the heart of our lead stories tonight. You may have heard us talking about Uber and how London's banning Uber, because it says basically, you know, this idea of it being a platform, no. Your transport company. Now Facebook is facing the same problem. They always said were just a platform, as you said. But now, no. You're not. You're a news or media company. Are these digital companies like Uber and Facebook in their different areas, they've got to grow up and realize, the world is not going to change its rules just for them. Or will the world change the rules?</p><p>BYERS: Well, this is -- this is the big question. And when you talk about growing up, that's exactly what it is. These are young companies. This whole digital world that we live in now is a young world. We are in this transitory period in which the rules are being defined as these companies develop. That's a very important question. It's the same question for Uber. It's the same question for Facebook. We don't know yet. I think what you're seeing now is were dealing with companies that are so big. And the question really is, do they have the power? Do they have the influence on sort of override the ambitions that Congress may have or that any government around the world may have for regulation?</p><p>[16:10:01] QUEST: Dylan, thank you, sir. Have a good weekend.</p><p>BYERS: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: Marietje Schaake says Facebook has downplayed its influence on voters. She's also questioned Uber's attempts to avoid scrutiny from police and regulators. She's a member of the European Parliament and the EU's chief observer in the election monitoring mission in Kenya. She joins me now from Nairobi. On this Facebook question, does the European Union -- are you in favor of more restrictions or at least more information from Facebook, Twitter, all of the social medias, when they take advertising that can be regarded as political?</p><p>MARIETJE SCHAAKE, MEMBER OF EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Well, I believe firmly that the rule of law should apply online as well, whether it's to Facebook or to Uber. They have a great responsibility. And with greater economic power -- and many of these big tech companies are more influential in terms of economic scale than some small countries. I think comes greater responsibility. So yes, the rule of law should apply online, and these companies should be adhering to those fundamental rights and values just as other companies.</p><p>QUEST: But were not just talking -- I mean it's fine to talk about the rule of law, which is a sort of wonderfully nebulous phrase that often means most things to many people. But what about when individual laws are out of touch clearly this new revolution in information technology. I'm not talking about honesty, truth and justice. I'm talking about practicality, say for example, as in London with Uber.</p><p>SCHAAKE: So, if you agree that, for example, competition should be fair. Which might sound like a generic principle, but it's actually a very fundamental principle in our open economies. It should also apply online. So, when we look at the case of Uber, they have deliberately misled the lawmakers and the regulators by tweaking their algorithms in such a way that those people who they thought would be regulators would get a different Uber experience. And so, to say as the previous speaker did, that this is a young company that still has to get used to what laws mean. I think is actually is completely misguided. They know what the law is and they deliberately try to circumvent it. And that doesn't make sense to me.</p><p>QUEST: Are you in a difficult position, in the sense that I can see where you're coming from. And you're right, you have a duty and a responsibility to ensure a level playing field. But when you've got 3.5 million people using Uber and you've got 1 billion people using Facebook, do you risk looking out-of-date and Luddite trying to commute, hold back the tide.</p><p>SCHAAKE: No. Actually, I think what we have to do is upgrade the laws. Some of them are principled and should already apply online. But where it's necessary. For example, in dealing with algorithms. We have to look at whether laws need to be updated to be in sync with the digital age. So, if we agree on the principles of freedom of expression, access to information, fair competition online, we have to make sure that the rule of law applies wherever that is relevant. Online or offline.</p><p>QUEST: Now, we need to talk about the Kenyan election. The reality is that you all signed off -- not you personally -- but monitor signed off on the election. Yes, there was some qualifications if you read between the lines when it finally came down. But it was the Kenyan Supreme Court that said this wasn't fair. Did monitoring fail the last time? And if it did, will you get it right this time?</p><p>SCHAAKE: Well, I think it's a simplification to say that we signed off on the elections. We offer a lot of critical points and recommendations. In the argumentation by the Supreme Court that essentially the forms did not substantiate the digital account of the votes. Is very much in line with the observation that my mission made. So now, I think it is essential that all Kenyans come together and prepare for the next election.</p><p>QUEST: Right. But on this question, what are you going to be looking for? I mean, free and fair is again, a great phrase like the rule of law. But you all said that the last lot were free and fair. So, will you be looking at -- which part of this election will you be concentrating on in determining whether this time is truly free and fair?</p><p>SCHAAKE: Well, European observers like myself and my mission of hundreds of people, never used the words \"free and fair.\" We never do. We never have. And we won't in the future. Instead, we look at the different elements of these elections. Whether the police conducts itself proportionately and evenhandedly. Whether there are bribes being paid or state resources being abused.</p><p>[16:15:00] Whether there is ballot stuffing or whether people's rights are respected in the fullest extent. From campaign to election day, to tallying and the results process. And we must learn from past lessons that we've learned through the Supreme Court and our own observations. But of course, in the next elections there might be other vulnerable points to look at. So, we're going to go in the same way we did as last time to look at these elections impartially and independently to see whether the rights of Kenyan people have been served.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you for joining us. We'll talk, no doubt, many more times as these elections -- and were grateful to you talking to us tonight from Nairobi. Have a good weekend.</p><p>To Wall Street now and the Dow Jones Industrials. You know, frankly, it's barely worth a bell. Minuscule gains for the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq. The Dow is just off, well, 9, 10 points.</p><p>As we continue tonight, the British Prime Minister delivers a major Brexit speech in Florence. It's a city famous for Machiavelli. And in the words of the diplomat, Renaissance writer, there is nothing more difficult, more perilous, more uncertain then to take the lead in a new order of things.</p><p>QUEST: The head of the European Commission welcome Theresa May's overtures to find a good Brexit deal. Michel Barnier again, called on Britain to spell out exactly what it wants. For the first time, the British Prime Minister agreed to honor the so-called divorce bill. She does that by paying its budget commitment, or the U.K. pain is budget commitments to the European Union through to 2020. Her speech in Florence was a decidedly upbeat one.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>THERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: The British people have decided to leave the EU. And to be a global free trading nation able to chart our own way in the world. To many, this is an exciting time, full of promise. For others, it is a worrying one. I look ahead with optimism. Believing that if we use this moment to change not just our relationship with Europe, but also the way we do things at home. This will be a defining moment in the history of our nation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Now, in the same weeks that Europe's largest airline Ryanair has canceled flights galore because of mismanagement and incompetence. It seems a good opportunity for us to look at May's speech through the lens -- I've got my luggage -- of the EU departure lounge. Join me in the lounge. We seem to be -- or at least the U.K. -- seems to be the only passenger that's actually leaving at the moment. And we need to know at what point Brexit is going to happen. Oh, there we are. Where in the lounge. Now, I see that Brexit departure is get scheduled for March 29, 2019. Well, that's the expected date. But listening to what Theresa May said, we now need to know how much this departure is going to cost.</p><p>[16:20:00] She didn't really say, but the sort of price were seeing is 24 billion -- 20 billion euros, nearly $24 billion. And in this departure, we need to know how long were going to be waiting for Brexit. Well, Mrs. may has admitted that there should be this transition period, which could be two extra years or however long as needed. Now that's one issue. The price, the date, but when it comes to moving around in the issue of cargo back and forth to Europe, Theresa May wants trade to continue. Thank you, with border controls. She insists when it comes to Ireland they'll be no physical border between the North and the South.</p><p>And she's ruled out specific membership of the European economic area. No Norway solution, fearing that the loss of democratic control. And no Canada style free-trade agreement. Basically saying, that's just not good enough to replace with the U.K. already has. All in all, she's promised Europeans in Britain can carry on as before.</p><p>So, we see the departure lounge and we now turn to Carl Bildt, former prime minister of Sweden. He joins me now from the departure lounge in Stockholm. Carl Bildt, his Mrs. may deluding herself when she says, firstly, that she wants to transitional period, perhaps two years or plus, under the same terms and conditions of single market access and customs union?</p><p>CARL BILDT, FORMER PRIME MINISTER SWEDEN: I think that is to put it very mildly ambitious. That is a very diplomatic way of putting it. But I think the key point, which you alluded to in the departure lounge. If you're in the departure lounge, you must decide where to fly. And we still don't know her destination. I mean, as you pointed out, she says no to single market, no to customs union, no to Norway style agreement, no to Canada style free-trade agreement. So, there were a lot of noes. But where's the yes? What's the destination? And if there's going to be in implementation, transition phase, which that might be necessary, it's a question of what to implement. Where is the flight heading? We don't know that.</p><p>QUEST: Right. Well, she does say in the speech, when she rejects EEA and she rejects the Norway and she -- she says there needs to be a creative solution. Her words, for this deep and special relationship or a deep relationship. So, what she's looking for is, I suppose, the closest you can get to single market without having single market. Again, is that realistic?</p><p>BILDT: Well, it sounds like she wants to depart without departing. And she's unable to define the destination. As you pointed out, she says, no to all of the existing options that are there. And then she says we have to be creative. Fine, but why isn't she creative? And she indicates really -- sort of implicitly and nearly explicitly that things are going to be roughly as they are. That unfortunately, I have to say, is not going to be the case. I mean, there are couple of steps in terms of -- in the direction of a more realistic approach. But I fear that she will have to deliver more speeches in Florence or elsewhere. You know, to clarify things.</p><p>QUEST: So, the issue of the money -- I mean that's going to be settled one way or the other. Whether is 24 billion, whether it's 50 billion. I mean, that in many ways, is the least contentious. They will agree a figure. Which of all these issues do you think is really going to truly scoff up the talks? Is it Northern Ireland? Is it the future trade relationships?</p><p>BILDT: Well, I think the future trade relationship, which is more than trade, more than trade and goods. It is trade in services. It is trade in digital, the free flow of data, those sorts of issues, that are really important from the point of view of the economic development of the U.K. and of the European Union. We have a mutual interest. We are going to go from a relationship that is very, very close to something that is more or less significantly less close. And of course, that's a price to be paid for that. And we need to be, regrettably, honest about that. Then she talked today, somewhat more about the security relationship. That's also a tricky one. But I think it was good she brought it up in a constructive tone.</p><p>QUEST: Carl Bildt, thank you, sir. I look forward to talking more about this -- next time I promise we'll both be in the business lounge. Where it will be a bit more comfortable and we can have a proper drink. Thank you very much, indeed.</p><p>BILDT: Absolutely.</p><p>QUEST: Carl Bildt, joining me from Stockholm.</p><p>[16:25:00] Now while Theresa May's political future is unclear, Angela Merkel seems to be cruising towards reelection, fourth term, if she's reelected over the weekend. The German Chancellor spent the day campaigning in Munich ahead of the countries general election on Sunday. The nation's auto industry is politically toxic after its major emissions scandal. Angela Merkel, who has been a friend of the industry so far, acknowledged the crisis in confidence in autos.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANGELA MERKEL, GERMAN CHANCELLOR (through translator): That's why the car industry must do everything it can to win back credibility and trust. Which is both in their own interest and in the interest of the employees, as well as the entire German economy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: The top representative of the German auto industry told me today that the industry can overcome its current crisis. It does so by investing heavily in digital technology and electric vehicles. Matthias Wissman joined me on the line from Berlin and I needed to know if he agrees with the Chancellor. The need to rebuild trust and credibility for Germany's automobile industry.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATTHIAS WISSMAN, PRESIDENT, GERMAN AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION: If one differentiates, yes. There are some companies, no doubt, which made serious mistakes. But it's not the whole industry. We are standing for some 600 companies. OEMs and suppliers, and most of them are have no difficulties, not with trust, not with technical reasons. And the others learn out of the mistakes and do the necessary, you know, look to the last tests of nitrogen oxides in Europe. Five of the best companies are German, and five of the worst ones are not from Germany.</p><p>QUEST: So, what do you think the industry needs to do more to rebuild that trust with the people and with politicians?</p><p>WISSMAN: You know, the most important thing is that we follow the big two challenges of tomorrow in the future. The one is digitalization. The company which is not digitalizing its automotive components will not succeed in the future. And the second is electric vehicle. Some 35 percent of the patrons of electric mobility are at the moment in the hands, as well, of German suppliers and OEMs. That means we invest heavily into the future. And we know we have to, because we are standing for some 80 percent of the world's cars premium market. And companies who are at the top and have to do the utmost to invest into the future.</p><p>QUEST: You have to admit the last 12 months have been extraordinary for the German car industry, with a major scandal that seems to be bad. Difficult times in terms of, you know, with Brexit. And an election where one of the industry's leading supporters, Chancellor Merkel, has been calling for change in the industry. Not easy times, Matthias. Would you agree?</p><p>WISSMAN: Not easy times, no doubt. But on the other hand, that Chancellor Merkel at the Frankfurt motor show, Vice Chancellor Gabriel at the Frankfurt motor show, and the opposition candidate Schultz, very clearly speaking out for the industry were all critics. Some of them justified, no doubt. We are making it clear that that they want a combustion engine for the long run besides the electric vehicle. And that they are supporting the industry, because all of them understand the core of German industry is automotive.</p><p>Not only the OEMs, but also the suppliers. Hundreds of them are world champions. Don't forget, we are standing for not only 80 percent of the world's car premium market. We are also standing for three of the five top suppliers in the world are German companies. That means there's much more than criticism. There is a lot of recognition of the real strengths of the industry, which learns out of mistakes and invest heavily into the future.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: As we continue tonight, hurricane Maria is hammering the northern Caribbean at the moment. It totally devastated Puerto Rico. At least six people have died in the U.S. territory. We'll have a full report after the break.</p><p>[16:30:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: Hello, I'm Richard Quest. There's a lot more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in just a moment. Will have information on the new U.S. plans to replace the travel ban once it expires this weekend.</p><p>Nigeria's top trade negotiator will be in the C suite, as a country emerges from his worst recession in years.</p><p>This is CNN, and on this network the news always comes first.</p><p>The escalation in the bombastic rhetoric between the U.S. and North Korea continues. President Trump has called the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, a madman on Friday morning. It follows a threat by North Korea to test a powerful nuclear weapon, a hydrogen bomb, over the Pacific Ocean.</p><p>New drone video shows rescue efforts at a Mexican textile factory were workers have pulled at least 20 bodies from the rubble. The government says it will keep searching for survivors for at least the next two weeks. The earthquake has now killed almost 300 people.</p><p>A major evacuation operation is underway in Western Puerto Rico as heavy rains from hurricane Maria have caused a dam to fail. And that's led to flash flooding downstream. Officials are warning it's a very dangerous situation.</p><p>Senator John McCain has dealt a major blow to the latest proposal to overall Obamacare. The senator says he cannot support the bill without knowing how many people would lose coverage. His opposition makes it very unlikely the Republicans will be able to repeal Obamacare when they vote this month.</p><p>It's Friday, and hurricane Maria is now kidding more islands that are reeling and getting ready, Turks and Caicos. The storm is moving towards the Bahamas. It's been from Puerto Rico. It whisked past the Dominican Republic. The Turks and Caicos got it last. And now the Bahamas are in its path. The storm is category three. Annual be well aware, it's weaved a lethal path through the Caribbean. It's believed two dozen deaths have been confirmed as a result of the hurricane. And look at the numbers as it goes -- it's down here at the moment. It still at level 3 and is heading up toward the Northeast of the United States where it will be probably a tropical storm. CNN correspondents have been following the deadly storm as it tears across the Caribbean. CNN's Nick Payton Walsh is in U.S. Virgin Island of St. Croix. There officials are saying the entire island is without power, in the main hospital is evacuating patients because of storm damage.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[16:35:00] NICK PAYTON WALSH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: This is where it starts in the in the west of St. Croix, U.S. territory, and obviously behind me, you can the devastation caused here. They're out of power, and this is a city center that would normally be thriving with tourists. We flew in by helicopter about an hour from Puerto Rico, and from above, devastation to the east of the island looks not that awful here. It looks a lot worse. And on the ground, it is quite frankly, devastating. And there are people here that are beginning to get quite angry. What they see as the lack of attention given towards them. In fact, some were of the statements from the governor of St. Croix. People on the street here have been saying, that sounded like there wasn't too much of a problem. Well, here their lives have been devastated.</p><p>One man behind me screaming, I would much rather spend another year at war in Iraq than stick around here much longer. It's devastating, really, to see this whole business community torn to pieces. The Lost Dog bar around the corner that has its back torn clean off. The owners they're not sure when they can begin serving drinks here again. There is a bees nest that was blown straight into their refrigerator. Quite a devastating series of stories we've been hearing here.</p><p>The relief effort, well, we saw ourselves. It's beginning to slowly get underway. FEMA brought food to the school, not so far from where I'm standing. But it ran out very fast. 500 or 600 people formed a huge queue there to get it and then it ran out. A bit of discontent growing there as well. It may soon be alleviated, because we just saw recently an enormous C-17 cargo plane landing at the airfield here. But still, this U.S. territory without power potentially for months now. It's life utterly transformed by hurricane Maria. Also battered by Irma too. And a sense I think of anger growing here that they feel their lives are transformed. And they need so much more help than they feel is coming their way.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: Nick Payton Walsh. As we continue our program and conversation tonight, President Trump is tinkering with his travel ban. A replacement is on the way. It's no longer a one-size-fits-all. Jessica Schneider in Washington will help us understand what this new ban looks like.</p><p>QUEST: Donald Trump is expected to sign a replacement for his controversial travel ban by Sunday, according to senior administration officials. There will be new tailor-made restrictions varying by country. Jessica Schneider's in Washington. Oh, this is going to get complicated isn't it, Jessica? So, the one-size-fits-all against the six predominantly Muslim countries is going and we don't know what's coming in its place. Is that the just?</p><p>JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: That is the gist, Richard. Right now, the world is just waiting for any official proclamation from the president. So, homeland security officials, they talk to reporters on a call today, but they really didn't get much information. All that they said is throughout this past summer they been coordinating with countries all over the world. Working with them to make sure that there are travel security measures and vetting were proper. They said that there were a handful of countries who at the end of that 50-day process, they still weren't in compliance.</p><p>[16:40:00] So, homeland security officials are saying they are looking for a number of things from these countries. They're looking to see how countries establish the identity of travelers. They want countries who are also willing to give any information about any terrorist or criminals who emanate from the country. But if those countries don't cooperate, then yes, they will be put on the list that either bans people from traveling from their country to the United States, or maybe restricts some of the travel.</p><p>So, the question is, which countries will be on this list when the last executive order expires on Sunday? That's what were still waiting to see. We don't know if these six countries that were on the list previously, whether they'll be on again. If there will be additional countries added? What exactly the restrictions will be? So once again, the White House sort of waiting on this, keeping everyone in limbo. And Richard, were just wondering if we're going to see the same sort of chaos or confusion that we saw the last two times these executive orders were rolled out.</p><p>QUEST: So, that begs the question, if when the list comes out, I'm asking -- I realize Jessica -- I'm asking you questions to which you probably do not have the detailed answers. But help me understand. Whether or not it comes in immediately on the Sunday. In which case you are looking at perhaps chaos and confusion, or is there some grace period?</p><p>SCHNEIDER: Well, the executive order currently expires on Sunday. So, if they were to let that lapse, then we would let travelers come in from all those countries again. The word is from the White House that the president will in fact issue some proclamation, either Saturday or Sunday. So right now, Richard, it doesn't look like there would be any lapse in time where things might go haywire. What will be interesting to see is what countries will have restrictions on them. And then what exactly the restrictions will be. Because it wasn't quite clear last time. The administration said that no one could come from those countries. But then of course, the Supreme Court redefined it, saying only if you didn't have a bona fide connection to this country could you not come in. So, we'll see what exactly homeland security has been working with these other countries to improve their vetting procedures and of course, if they don't comply with that, that's when some of those restrictions will take place as to either how visas are issued or if there is a complete ban from any countries in particular that haven't cooperated at all. But yes, it's sort of were in limbo right now. It's a wait and see to see what the president issues this weekend, which the White House says he will.</p><p>QUEST: Something tells me you're going to have a busy weekend, Jessica Schneider.</p><p>SCHNEIDER: Probably.</p><p>QUEST: Hope you didn't have plans. Well, you do now. Thank you very much, Jessica. Have a lovely weekend.</p><p>SCHNEIDER: Thank you.</p><p>Now, this suit is the right outfit work in an office, a serious office. It's a rather nice little number, where you can present a television program. In New York's steamy summers though, it's not much better than wearing a winter coat. One company founded by MIT students wants to change how we buy suits, how they're made and how they feel. Is the first in our series highlighting traders around the world. We joined the ministry of supply.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In the corporate world, the epitome of work attire has traditionally been the suit. Today, science has been used to redefine workwear at the Ministry of Supply.</p><p>GIHAN AMARASIRIWARDENA, COFOUNDER, MINISTRY OF SUPPLY: Our mission is to invent apparel, our work clothes and life clothes are no longer defined. When you get up at 7 AM you take your shower, feeling fresh and by the time you get to the office after you commute you are sweating through your armpits, and you are now and then an over-ACed office though and so you start to shiver. So, we said let's actually solve this with interesting material that NASA actually used for space suits. And it is called a phase change material.</p><p>And it acts kind of like a thermal battery, so it absorbs heat when you are too hot, stores it in the shirt, and then when you are cold it releases that heat back to you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Shirts, Ts, blazers and knits analyzed, reinvented, even the humble sock rebooted.</p><p>AMAN ADVANI, COFOUNDER, MINISTRY OF SUPPLY: We can rapidly prototype, we can bring concepts to market significantly faster, always a help of modern technology tools.</p><p>AMARASIRIWARDENA: With 3D Print Knit unlocks many different things, there are ways we save money in terms of sustainability, in terms of using less material, but also looking at less overproduction.</p><p>ADVANI: The jacket I am wearing started off his yarn, in 93 minutes later with the blazer that I am wearing right now.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The trade-onomics a fashion is experiencing a style change, faster fashion cycles, currency fluctuations and tech changes have exposing multitrillion dollar apparel industry to decline in sales have exposed a multitrillion dollar apparel industry to decline in sales. Sports inspired fashion or ath-leisure is outpacing every other category. Earning $78 billion.</p><p>But wearing a sports gear doesn't necessarily mean you want to walk to the store. With online sales increasing their share of the market. With e- commerce dominating the routes to a global market MOS uses customer engagement to determine brand direction.</p><p>[16:45:00] ADVANI: We have decided to go almost entirely direct to consumer. We said let us approach it differently, let's approach it more like a car company where we have models come out every year. Let's continue to look at the feedback we get, every single piece of feedback we have ever gotten since our company started is logged in a single document, and categorized ruthlessly.</p><p>So that we can take those insights and when we build our next garment we can act upon them, and so they continue to get better and better over time.</p><p>AMARASIRIWARDENA: Our roots we are engineers at heart, but we also are designers and innovation is at the intersection of those. And that is what we are really trying to do is bring together design and technology, and create a product that allows us to perform better but also feel better as well.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: Breaking news on the business front to bring to you, the ratings agency Moody's has downgraded the U.K.'s long-term debt from AA1 to AA2, and in doing so it has changed the outlook. Which is perhaps the most important part from stable to -- to change the outlook to stable from negative, which suggests that there won't be any further deterioration.</p><p>Now, it cited weakening public finances, higher budget deficit, along with the pressure to raise spending. The gist though, the headline if you like, the U.K. continues to have economic issues and now one of the ratings agencies downgraded Britain's debt, which will increase borrowing costs on the mountain of debt that the U.K. has.</p><p>As we continue tonight, still to come Christine Lagarde tells me she's got the answer to South African corruption, sunshine.</p><p>QUEST: KPMG is being called out in South Africa. The finance minister there says all work with the company should not be under review because of its ties to the Gupta family which has been accused of improperly influencing the South African government.</p><p>Speaking to me on Wednesday, the IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said, South Africa should deal with its sprawling corruption scandal in ways that will help put things right.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHRISTINE LAGARDE, IMF MANAGING DIRECTOR CHRISTINE: As we know, corruption is not a one-way street, and I am not here passing judgment on who has done what in relation to any South African case, and connections with the authorities. But it is a two-way street, where somebody gives a bribe, and somebody receives a bribe. And while we are not directly involved with the private sectors ourselves we are directly concerned about what use is made of public finance.</p><p>If somebody builds a completely unnecessary airport or bridge, which goes to nowhere, or a massive stadium, or the convention center that will never be used, there is public money spent on something that is unnecessary, which is going to be helpful for all sorts of kickbacks, in all sorts of funny ways offshore in general. And through funny shadow accounts, that is where we can be involved as soon as we are informed. Because we can raise the flag, we can just disclose that, we can redraft our program.</p><p>[16:50:00] QUEST: Are you prepared to do that? Are you prepared to do that because, you know, the thing we've discovered in South Africa and elsewhere with corruption, if that usually involves people at the top? It usually involves naming and shaming. And it always ends up as a nasty sewer of a mess. So, are you prepared for that?</p><p>LAGARDE: Not only are we prepared for that but there have been cases where we have actually stopped financing a program until such time when what was covered up, what was done in the shadows comes out transparently and is disclosed in the public account. And then transparency just like the sun is the best disinfectant. People understand what is going on and who has done what. That is where our job stops, beyond that it is for people to decide what they want to do in terms of government, in terms of elections in terms of steps to be taken.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: Turning to Nigeria, the country says it is not producing too much oil for OPEC to start getting annoyed. The old group met in Vienna today. The old group suggested that Nigeria is producing too much oil along with Libya. Joining me here in the C Suite it is Nigeria's chief negotiator of trade. Good to see you, Sir.</p><p>CHIEDU OSAKWE, CHIEF NEGOTIATOR, NIGERIAN OFFICER TRADE NEGOTIATIONS: Thank you, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: Come on, you are producing too much oil, I am not saying cheating on OPEC quotas but cheating on OPEC quotas.</p><p>OSAKWE: I don't think we are. The country is coming out of a recession but it's a low growth environment, we need cash and reserves and stability in the foreign exchange market, to stabilize the economy and give some propulsion to growth in the economy. So not too much for the circumstances and vulnerabilities of the economy.</p><p>QUEST: But the overproduction, sir, of say Libya and yourself, one of the factors is keeping the oil price down according to OPEC.</p><p>OSAKWE: I think it is much more than that. There is a move now to move away from a fossil economy from a hydrocarbon economy. I think that economies basically are re-gearing their minds to grow their economies beyond the oil age.</p><p>QUEST: When I was in Nigeria earlier this year, besides of getting into Jollof rice mess, when I was there the issue was always diversification. But you are a country addicted to oil wealth. Would you agree with me?</p><p>OSAKWE: In the past, yes, but now we have a plan and we have to improve our play, and we have to execute that plan to diversify the economy. And if you want to talk about that plan I am happy to talk about it with you.</p><p>QUEST: Yes, we've got a couple minutes, so this idea of diversification, but you need infrastructure spending on roads. And you need more spending on telco and power. You need spending on airports. How do you diversify when you still need to spend on the basics?</p><p>OSAKWE: It's the market, Richard, it is the market, you have got to basically take the government out economy. And just let the government do what governments do best regulate in pro-competitive, pro-market, pro- business environment. This creates an abundance of opportunities for diversification.</p><p>QUEST: Let's turn that to what Christine Lagarde was just talking about, transparency and sunshine as it relates to the issue of corruption. I know huge steps have been taken and more needs to be done. Anticorruption commission is looking into this but there still needs to be more prosecutions, there still needs to be more of them. Would you agree with me?</p><p>OSAKWE: I would agree with you completely. Nigerians accept that corruption is systemic, and it is one of the major demons that we have been dealing with it in Nigeria, it is one of the top three agenda items of President Buhari, you know that well enough. It is a key priority for the chairman of the economic management team of Nigeria, the vice president, Professor Osinbajo. And we are doing this institutionally, there must be prosecutions, more of them. More people going to jail. But we have to build them into our institutions and do a lot more. And do it consistently. And do it in a nonpartisan way and do it across different governments.</p><p>QUEST: All of that, sir. And you will succeed, thank you very much indeed. Not a mention of Jollof rice anywhere.</p><p>[16:55:00] OSAKWE: Come back to Nigeria, you know you are a star in that country.</p><p>QUEST: I am not sure after the Jollof rice incident. Thank you very much indeed. We will have a Profitable Moment after the break.</p><p>QUEST: Tonight's Profitable Moment, Uber and Facebook, two companies that have revolutionized the world are now facing the back lash because of their business practices. In the case of Uber, transport for London saying they are not fit and proper to operate in London. In the case of Facebook, over the appetizing ads and Russia.</p><p>It is really very simple, yes, by all means change the world. But don't expect the world to change for you. In what we heard tonight on the program is the rule of law remains paramount, and there may need to be tinkering of laws to accommodate the new economy. But fundamental truths remain throughout.</p><p>And that means you have to know who your customers are, you have to be transparent, you have to deal fairly, and you have to follow the rules. Both of these companies have learned to their cost that they cannot just railroad past regulators and past rules as they exist today.</p><p>And that is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, for tonight and for this week, I am Richard Quest in New York, whatever you are up to in the hours ahead, I hope it is profitable. I will see you on Monday.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2017092201cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PJ7-K201-DXH2-655D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7541\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 22, 2017 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001Y2C</classCode><className>DOW JONES &amp;

The complaint filed at the U.S. District Court in San Jose, California, marked the first of what may be many lawsuits seeking damages over Facebook's ability to protect user data, and exploitation of the information by the Cambridge Analytica consultancy to help President <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>election campaign. Facebookhas been rocked this week by a whistleblower who said Cambridge Analytica, which Trump hired for the 2016 campaign, improperly accessed information on Facebookusers to build detailed profiles on American voters. This revelation has knocked nearly US$50 billion off Facebook's stock market value in two days and hit the shares of Twitter and Snap over fears that a failure by big tech firms to protect personal data could deter advertisers and users and invite tougher regulation. </p><p><person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>Facebook's founder and chief executive, who has been quiet on the controversy, is to address the revelations later on Wednesday, a source at the company told Reuters. The proposed class-action complaint was filed late on Tuesday by Lauren Price, a Maryland resident. \"Every Facebookuser has an interest in this lawsuit, and the enforcement of their privacy rights,\" John Yanchunis, a lawyer for Price, told Reuters on Wednesday. The complaint seeks unspecified damages, including possible punitive damages. Facebookand Cambridge Analytica did not immediately respond on Wednesday to requests for comment. A former Facebookmanager who was responsible for policing the network's data handling procedures in 2011-2012 said he had warned senior executives about the issue. The manager, Sandy Parakilas, said he had told them that Facebook's failure to police how outside software developers used its data put the company at risk of major data breaches. \"There was very little detection or enforcement,\" he told a British parliamentary committee via videolink. SWING VOTERS The academic who provided the data, psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, told the BBC that Cambridge Analytica had greatly exaggerated its role in Trump's victory. Facebookand Cambridge Analytica have both blamed Kogan, who gathered the data by running a survey app on Facebook. Kogan combines the roles of an academic at Cambridge University and a web entrepreneur based in San Francisco. U.S. political campaigns collect large amounts of data, hoping to target swing voters sympathetic to their message. Cambridge Analytica stood out for the scale of claims in its marketing materials to \"collect up to 5,000 data points on over 220 million Americans\" in all its activities. It uses techniques based on personality traits and then applies analytic tools to pinpoint supporters. However, Kogan said the services provided by the consultancy had been greatly exaggerated. \"I think what Cambridge Analytica has tried to sell is magic, and they've made claims that this is incredibly accurate and it tells you everything there is to tell about you. But I think the reality is it's not that,\" he said. Arron Banks, who campaigned for Britain to leave the European Union in a 2016 referendum, also questioned the value of psychologically-based data. Banks told Reuters that Cambridge Analytica had unsuccessfully pitched for work with his Leave.eu campaign group. \"I think they are nothing more than a company that places Facebookads and shrouds in a sort of mystery,\" he said. Kogan's application, \"thisisyourdigitallife,\" offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebookas \"a research app used by psychologists\". Kogan said he had gathered the data in 2014. He was then approached by Cambridge Analytica who provided the legal advice around its use, he added. Facebooksays Kogan then violated its policies by passing the data to Cambridge Analytica for commercial use, saying on Friday he \"lied to us\". Cambridge Analytica said it destroyed the data once it realised the information did not adhere to data protection rules. \"My view is that I'm being basically used as a scapegoat by both Facebookand Cambridge Analytica,\" said Kogan. \"We were assured by Cambridge Analytica that everything was perfectly legal and within the limits of the terms of service.\" Cambridge Analytica has denied various allegations made about its business practices in recent media reports. British Prime Minister Theresa May said she backed an investigation into the consultancy, while the German government also expressed its concern. In Europe the tax affairs of tech giants have become a hot political issue. On Wednesday the European Commission proposed rules to make digital companies pay their fair share of tax, with Facebookand its peers set to foot much of the bill. PERSONALITY TEST Alexander Nix, the head of Cambridge Analytica, said in a secretly recorded video broadcast on Tuesday that his company had played a decisive role in Trump's election victory. He was suspended by the company shortly before the video was shown on Britain's Channel 4 News. Around 270,000 people downloaded the app, Facebooksaid. The app scored the results of each quiz and gathered up data from test-takers' Facebookaccounts. However, it also pulled down the data of their Facebookfriends, vastly increasing the size of the sample. Kogan put the number of app users as closer to 200,000. The researcher said, in total, he passed the data of around 30 million American Facebookusers to SCL, a government and military contractor that is the parent of Cambridge Analytica. Media reports have put the total number of Facebookprofiles collected at around 50 million users. U.S. and European lawmakers have demanded an explanation of how Cambridge Analytica gained access to user data in 2014 and why Facebookfailed to inform its users. Facebooksaid it had been told by the Federal Trade Commission, the leading U.S. consumer regulator, that it would receive a letter this week with questions about the data acquired by Cambridge Analytica. It said it had no indication of a formal investigation.

If successful, it would make the likes of Facebook and YouTube responsible for the toxic content on their platforms, which could dramatically upend their business models.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[1] A Republican senator just took a swing at Silicon Valley by introducing a bill which could make tech giants like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube liable for the tide of harmful content they are currently struggling to hold back. Sen. Josh Hawley introduced the bill on Wednesday, which proposes removing tech companies' protection under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (CDA), which prevents them from being held responsible for any illegal content posted to their platforms by users. The bill would only apply to companies with more than 30 million active users in the US, more than 300 million users worldwide, or more than $500 million in global annual revenue. The big players of Silicon Valley all fit comfortably into these categories. Read more: Big tech's time of reckoning: It looks like Trump is making good on his threat to take on Google and Amazon[2] If successful, it could dramatically upend the business models of social media platforms like Facebook. Currently, they monitor and remove harmful content after it is posted, while Hawley's bill could mean thay have to apply this scrutiny to posts before they go live, or risk being held liable for anything illegal or libellous. Stripping big tech of its protection under the CDA has garnered in popularity on both sides of the aisle. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Recode's Kara Swisher[3] in April that the tech giants were abusing the Section 230 privilege. \"It is not out of the question that that could be removed,\" she said. However, Hawley's bill seems to come with a very specific goal popular among Republicans \u2014 forcing the tech giants submit themselves for review to see if their content moderation enforces any kind of political bias. The stated aim of the bill is to\"encourage providers of interactive computer services to provide content moderation that is politically neutral.\" Under the terms of the bill, companies could be granted immunity from liability so long as they obtain certification from the FTC that their algorithms and content moderation are not politically biased. They would have to reapply for this certification every two years. Over the past year, the Republican party has been vehement in questioning big tech companies over whether they have an anti-conservative bias. In August last year, President Donald Trump accused Google of rigging search results to surface more critical articles about him[4]. Last month, Trump said at a White House press conference that Facebook and Twitter discriminate against conservatives[5]. Fellow Republicans have similarly taken up the line of attack. In April, Sen. Ted Cruz accused Facebook and Google of \"censor[ing] political speech\"[6] during a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing. The tech giants deny that they build anti-conservative bias into their platforms and President Trump's initial accusation that Google rigs search results against him was unsubstantiated.NOW WATCH:

It's working. In the video above, Fox News' Tucker Carlson talks about the damage wrought at Bretibart, Prager U, Daily Caller, IJR, and Fox. </p><p>All have sudden and significant declines in traffic. Of course, legacy Leftist media are unaffected. The second half of the video covers YouTube's (Google's) efforts to stifle legitimate firearms owners' attempts to share information on firearms safety, operation, and maintenance. Leftists, who love to pay lip service to 'free speech' and 'net neutrality,' must be so proud! Somewhere out there, existing and potential new media platforms are eyeing the market void that YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter are creating. It is that kind of void that boosted the growth of the Fox News Network. Competition is the optimal remedy to perverted 'sharing' media like Facebook, and conservatives can only hope that major new platform initiatives will appear soon and grow rapidly. Does Zuckerberg care about all this? In response to complaints and calls for government action, Zuckerberg has publicly said 'Well, okay, go ahead and regulate me.' Any time a monopolist says something like that, watch out! Facebook is so large, rich, and dominant that the Zuck can hire gaggles of $700-per-hour lawyers to work Facebook's way through and around regulations. He knows that smaller, not-so-wealthy competitors cannot do that. Indeed, his lawyers will helpwrite those regulations to keep away the competition. Have you seen those Animal Planet videos where an old silver-back gorilla murders an infant gorilla to avoid a future competitor for his dominance? Zuckerberg is that silver back. Watch too for a revolving door between Big Tech social media and the new social-media regulatory agency. It's another Big-Govt politician's dream come true, including huge continuing campaign donations. Meanwhile, as they have for years, Zuckerberg's post-pubescent censor squads will continue to harass and strangle individual authors who write for conservative-friendly websites like WesternFreePress.com. Facebook censors will continue to label legitimate political commentary as 'spam'. They will feign 'temporary technical problems'. And they will claim violation of 'community standards.' Authors will complain for a while and try to fight back, but they'll be ignored. And after a while they will just get tired and go elsewhere. Every author that gives up is another win for Zuckerberg and his Leftist buddies. In the near-term, is there anything good-faith conservatives can do? Yes. If you administer a legitimate, conservative-friendly Facebook group, consider 'cloning' your group onto other platforms like MeWe.com that so far donot censor. Invite your members to join your group there as well. And watch out for Leftist trolls who will post false-flag articles in an attempt to pervert your new presence on the new platform. If you're an admin on a current conservative Facebook group, you probably already know how to deal with those keyboard-bound gutter-snipes!Afterword: Of course, this article is itself red meat to Zuckerberg's and YouTube's thought police. Facebook censors will almost surely restrict circulation of this article and may suspend my account for a period of a few hours to 30 days. I will report what they do at this link[1].

It's working. In the video above, Fox News' Tucker Carlson talks about the damage wrought at Bretibart, Prager U, Daily Caller, IJR, and Fox. </p><p>All have sudden and significant declines in traffic. Of course, legacy Leftist media are unaffected. The second half of the video covers YouTube's (Google's) efforts to stifle legitimate firearms owners' attempts to share information on firearms safety, operation, and maintenance. Leftists, who love to pay lip service to 'free speech' and 'net neutrality,' must be so proud! Somewhere out there, existing and potential new media platforms are eyeing the market void that YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter are creating. It is that kind of void that boosted the growth of the Fox News Network. Competition is the optimal remedy to perverted 'sharing' media like Facebook, and conservatives can only hope that major new platform initiatives will appear soon and grow rapidly. Does Zuckerberg care about all this? In response to complaints and calls for government action, Zuckerberg has publicly said 'Well, okay, go ahead and regulate me.' Any time a monopolist says something like that, watch out! Facebook is so large, rich, and dominant that the Zuck can hire gaggles of $700-per-hour lawyers to work Facebook's way through and around regulations. He knows that smaller, not-so-wealthy competitors cannot do that. Indeed, his lawyers will help\u00a0write those regulations to keep away the competition. Have you seen those Animal Planet videos where an old silver-back gorilla murders an infant gorilla to avoid a future competitor for his dominance? Zuckerberg is that silver back. Watch too for a revolving door between Big Tech social media and the new social-media regulatory agency. It's another Big-Govt politician's dream come true, including huge continuing campaign donations. Meanwhile, as they have for years, Zuckerberg's post-pubescent censor squads will continue to harass and strangle individual authors who write for conservative-friendly websites like WesternFreePress.com. Facebook censors will continue to label legitimate political commentary as 'spam'. They will feign 'temporary technical problems'. And they will claim violation of 'community standards.' Authors will complain for a while and try to fight back, but they'll be ignored. And after a while they will just get tired and go elsewhere. Every author that gives up is another win for Zuckerberg and his Leftist buddies. In the near-term, is there anything good-faith conservatives can do? Yes. If you administer a legitimate, conservative-friendly Facebook group, consider 'cloning' your group onto other platforms like MeWe.com that so far do\u00a0not censor. Invite your members to join your group there as well. And watch out for Leftist trolls who will post false-flag articles in an attempt to pervert your new presence on the new platform. If you're an admin on a current conservative Facebook group, you probably already know how to deal with those keyboard-bound gutter-snipes!Afterword: Of course, this article is itself red meat to Zuckerberg's and YouTube's thought police. Facebook censors will almost surely restrict circulation of this article and may suspend my account for a period of a few hours to 30 days. I will report what they do at this link[1].

Mr Zuckerberg and other company executives remain eager to enter new areas of growth and launch new products such as libra. But three years after the 2016 election exposed the platform's vulnerability to abuse, many politicians are increasingly uneasy about the company's ambitions.</p><p>In his testimony, Mr Zuckerberg defended Facebook's goal to offer financial services to more than a billion consumers around the world through libra, a digital coin designed to be used to buy things online and off and send money domestically and overseas, while acknowledging the risks to meeting that goal.</p><p>\"I actually don't know if libra is going to work,\" Mr Zuckerberg said during the roughly six-hour hearing. Still, he pledged to refrain from participating in libra's launch anywhere in the world unless US regulators approved of it.</p><p>Since Facebook announced its vision for libra in June with a group of 27 other companies, US politicians and regulators have voiced concerns about its effect on financial stability and data privacy. European officials have tried to halt its launch. That criticism continued on Wednesday, with many Democrats and some Republicans blasting the project, while others praised Facebook for trying to innovate.</p><p>\"As I have examined Facebook's various problems, I have come to the conclusion that it would be beneficial for all if Facebook concentrates on addressing its many existing deficiencies and failures before proceeding any further on the libra project,\" said Democrat Maxine Waters, the committee's chairwoman.</p><p>Patrick McHenry, the committee's top Republican, said he had his \"own qualms about Facebook and libra and the shortcomings of Big Tech\". But, he added, \"if history has taught us anything, it's better to be on the side of American innovation\".</p><p>Mr Zuckerberg also heard rebukes about Facebook's credibility broadly, which underpin many Washington policymakers' concerns about its move into financial services. The company has been harshly criticised for its handling of users' personal data and its role in the spread of misinformation.</p><p>Several politicians questioned Facebook's ambitions to launch libra and whether it could safely manage to do so given its poor track record on handling user data and battling misinformation.</p><p>A number of Democrats asked Mr Zuckerberg about Facebook's decision to exempt politicians from fact-checking and other community standards, and how those rules reconciled with Facebook's stated desire to minimise false information on the platform.</p><p>At one point, the vice-chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, Democrat Joyce Beatty, called the testimony \"appalling and disgusting\" after Mr Zuckerberg gave a halting answer about details of the company's work with civil rights leaders.</p><p>\"Have you learned that you should not lie?\" asked Nydia Velazquez, another Democrat, pointing to a fine Facebook paid European regulators, who accused the company of providing misleading information.</p><p>Mr Zuckerberg said he disagreed with her characterisation, but added, \"I understand that we have work to build trust on this\".</p><p>Facebook has said it would exempt politicians from fact-checks on the grounds that such comments are newsworthy.The group of companies that Facebook assembled to launch libra, the Libra Association, has lost one-quarter of its original members, including Visa, Mastercard and PayPal since the June announcement. Those companies faced pressure to explain how libra could be prevented from being used to launder money or finance terrorism.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-13c36830f5e611e9a55f8d30b523562b2e5abf5e7c3439ffd37fc976c2444fba</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XBM-8871-JD3N-52FD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"655\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 25, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Estas actividades no han pasado inadvertidas para los \u00f3rganos reguladores. En Europa, las pr\u00e1cticas relacionadas con la explotaci\u00f3n de datos, han sido examinadas con especial escrutinio tanto por las autoridades supervisoras de la protecci\u00f3n de datos, como por aquellas garantes del derecho a la competencia y libre concurrencia.       Ilustraci\u00f3n: David Pe\u00f3n   Recapitulaci\u00f3n y an\u00e1lisis del caso   Tras una investigaci\u00f3n de tres a\u00f1os, en febrero de 2019 la autoridad alemana de competencia ( Bundeskartellamt ) calific\u00f3 a Facebook como un agente dominante en el mercado de redes sociales e impuso una serie de lineamientos cuyo prop\u00f3sito era que la empresa no abusara de su poder de mercado \u2014que abarcaba a su vez el de la publicidad en l\u00ednea\u2014, no coaccionara a los usuarios a entregar sus datos en forma indiscriminada y, en suma, prohibir que Facebook continuara con el combinando de datos e informaci\u00f3n de las cuentas de sus usuarios sin su consentimiento. 3    La Bundeskartellamt no buscaba imponer una multa a Facebook (como en el caso de la Autorit\u00e9 de la concurrence contra Google en Francia 4 ), sino establecer medidas ex ante frente a posibles abusos de dominancia que incluso impactaban el \u00e1mbito de aplicaci\u00f3n de la normativa de privacidad, el Reglamento General de Protecci\u00f3n de Datos (GDPR, por sus siglas en ingl\u00e9s).    Facebook apel\u00f3 la decisi\u00f3n frente a la Corte Regional de Dusseldorf, 5 quien le otorg\u00f3 la suspensi\u00f3n a esa empresa para efecto de no implementar el plan de acci\u00f3n ordenado por la autoridad de competencia. El expediente pas\u00f3 a las salas del Tribunal Federal de Justicia ( Bundesgerichtshof ) en Karlsruhe, donde sus jueces se pronunciaron el pasado 23 de junio confirmando la resoluci\u00f3n de la Bundeskartellamt . 6    Para la autoridad de competencia el gigante tecnol\u00f3gico abus\u00f3 sistem\u00e1ticamente de su poder de mercado, al reducir las opciones de productos ofertados a sus usuarios como resultado de una personalizaci\u00f3n de publicidad no solicitada. Dicho profiling , construido a partir del an\u00e1lisis de datos tanto de \u00edndole personal como del comportamiento de los usuarios, sin que la empresa tuviera consentimiento expreso para hacerlo.    La autoridad alemana estim\u00f3 que el Big Data en manos de Facebook le permit\u00eda no s\u00f3lo generar publicidad altamente personalizada sino tambi\u00e9n fortalecer las barreras de entrada al mercado de redes sociales a trav\u00e9s de efectos de red y lock-in . 7    Derivado de un an\u00e1lisis de GDPR, la Bundeskartellamt identific\u00f3 que los usuarios no podr\u00edan proporcionar su consentimiento libremente, de manera informada y con el prop\u00f3sito espec\u00edfico de autorizar la combinaci\u00f3n de datos. Facebook condicionaba el uso de la red social a aceptar los t\u00e9rminos de uso.    Aunque Facebook presentaba en su pol\u00edtica de privacidad y en la de cookies , tanto las finalidades del tratamiento de los datos personales, como la base legal para hacerlo, 8 no proporcionaba una alternativa ( opt-out ) para que el usuario se negase al combinado de datos.    Esta combinaci\u00f3n no ten\u00eda como \u00fanica fuente la p\u00e1gina o aplicaci\u00f3n de Facebook, sino tambi\u00e9n a las diferentes formas de integraci\u00f3n de su plataforma. Esto es, a trav\u00e9s del uso de interfaces conectadas con Facebook y por conducto de sitios web de terceros enlazados a trav\u00e9s de plugins como el bot\u00f3n Me gusta o la opci\u00f3n Compartir . Las alianzas con terceros adem\u00e1s levantaban un riesgo adicional de filtrado de datos del usuario, que derivar\u00eda en una violaci\u00f3n a su expectativa razonable de privacidad.    La doctrina a la que la Bundeskartellamt acudi\u00f3 para fundamentar su caso, proviene de sentencias del Tribunal Federal de Justicia respecto t\u00e9rminos comerciales abusivos. Los cuales se dan cuando una de las partes de un contrato tenga tanto poder que l\u00edmite o anule la capacidad de negociar de la otra parte. Desde esta \u00f3ptica, el Tribunal deber\u00eda intervenir cuando, como consecuencia de la falta de autonom\u00eda contractual, se pudiesen transgredir derechos constitucionales (como el de autodeterminaci\u00f3n informativa) de la parte vulnerable de la negociaci\u00f3n.    En suma, la autoridad de competencia estimaba que las Big Tech deben ser examinadas tambi\u00e9n en t\u00e9rminos de sus actividades de tratamiento de datos y que las leyes de privacidad deben utilizarse durante sus investigaciones pues su prop\u00f3sito es salvaguardar derechos constitucionalmente reconocidos.   \u00bfQu\u00e9 hacer con las Big Tech en M\u00e9xico?   Un caso como el descrito se antoja dif\u00edcil de presenciar en agencias de competencia del continente americano, aunque es indudable que el procedimiento alem\u00e1n proporciona gu\u00edas valiosas a tomar en cuenta.    Las posibles divergencias entre casos como el de la Bundeskartellamt y los nuestros, radica en buena medida en que, en materia de abuso de poder de mercado, hemos seguido el modelo estadounidense bajo el cual la Comisi\u00f3n Federal de Competencia Econ\u00f3mica (COFECE) y el Instituto Federal de Telecomunicaciones (IFT) intervienen s\u00f3lo cuando se presentan ciertas conductas prohibidas para los agentes econ\u00f3micos que tienen como objeto o efecto desplazar o impedir la entrada de otros a cierto mercado.    La autoridad alemana anticip\u00f3 pr\u00e1cticas como las descritas, bajo un modelo que incluye la prohibici\u00f3n de conductas explotativas , vinculando la violaci\u00f3n de derechos de privacidad con la reducci\u00f3n de opciones para los consumidores derivados de la \u201cpersonalizaci\u00f3n\u201d de ofertas para los usuarios.    Tanto la Bundeskartellamt como el Bundesgerichtshof aportaron elementos muy valiosos para el an\u00e1lisis de mercados digitales en nuestras jurisdicciones, entre ellos: (i) la definici\u00f3n de un mercado de dos lados: el de redes sociales que ofrecen experiencias sociales enriquecidas y el de publicidad a trav\u00e9s de la red social; (ii) el planteamiento de un da\u00f1o a los usuarios derivado de la publicidad personalizada con la consecuente reducci\u00f3n de opciones; (iii) el fortalecimiento de las barreras de entrada en el mercado de redes sociales derivado de la acumulaci\u00f3n de datos; (iv) la existencia de altos costos para hacer switch con otras redes sociales (pocas opciones de portabilidad del dato), as\u00ed como; (v) potenciales efectos adversos a la competencia en los mercados en que participan los anunciantes (considerando a la red social como un canal de comercializaci\u00f3n).    Si bien la COFECE o el IFT no podr\u00edan emprender un caso id\u00e9ntico contra Facebook en M\u00e9xico, el Instituto Nacional de Transparencia y Acceso a la Informaci\u00f3n y Protecci\u00f3n de Datos Personales (INAI) podr\u00eda revisar si bajo una perspectiva proteccionista Facebook est\u00e1 excedi\u00e9ndose en el tratamiento de datos de los usuarios mexicanos. Un paso m\u00e1s all\u00e1, que en el marco de la econom\u00eda digital suena cada vez m\u00e1s sensato, es abrir caminos para intervenciones de car\u00e1cter regulatorio cuando se est\u00e1 en presencia de empresas con tal cantidad de datos (ya sea a trav\u00e9s de facultades incrementales de las autoridades de competencia o de regulaci\u00f3n del propio INAI).    \u00bfEstamos listos para las investigaciones en mercados digitales? Los frutos de la experiencia y la discusi\u00f3n en los foros de competencia se empiezan a hacer tangibles en M\u00e9xico. Por ejemplo, el pasado 3 de julio se cre\u00f3 la direcci\u00f3n general de mercados digitales 9 en la COFECE, con la encomienda de vigilar el funcionamiento de los mercados digitales y fungir como \u00f3rgano de consulta para la autoridad investigadora y la direcci\u00f3n general de concentraciones de esta comisi\u00f3n.    Otro parteaguas en materia de mercados digitales es la resoluci\u00f3n judicial sobre la competencia para conocer la concentraci\u00f3n Uber-Cornershop . Aunque la COFECE le gan\u00f3 el primer round al IFT en torno a cu\u00e1l de estas instituciones ten\u00eda facultades para conocer de este asunto, la resoluci\u00f3n no es la \u00faltima palabra al respecto; en su momento, se evaluar\u00e1 si COFECE debe conocer de casos que involucren servicios de telecomunicaciones como los de mensajer\u00eda instant\u00e1nea que ofrecen WhatsApp, Instagram y Facebook. En mercados de dos lados, el panorama es a\u00fan m\u00e1s incierto.

As part of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/technology/facebook-antitrust-germany.html\">a settlement</url>, the company was also ordered to create a new privacy committee on its board and to make other structural changes to increase the transparency and accountability of its data practices.</p><p>But the agreement was criticized for failing to limit Facebook\u2019s gathering, sharing and use of people\u2019s personal information, a practice that has repeatedly raised privacy questions. And the F.T.C.\u2019s commissioners were divided on partisan lines this month when they voted<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/technology/facebook-antitrust-germany.html\">3-to-2 to approve</url>the measures, which provide immunity to Facebook\u2019s officers and directors and shield the company from known claims of violations through last month \u2014 essentially giving it a pass on its past.</p><p>At the same time, the Securities and Exchange Commission said on Wednesday that it had imposed a $100 million penalty against Facebook for making misleading disclosures to investors about the risks of misuse of user data. The S.E.C. said Facebook had known for two years about that misuse, but had presented those risks to investors as merely hypothetical.</p><p>Hours later, Facebook also disclosed that it was the target of an antitrust investigation by the F.T.C. While the agency was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/technology/facebook-antitrust-germany.html\">known to be looking into the company</url> and whether it had used its reach and clout to reduce competition, a formal investigation starts a more intensive phase of examination. The company also confirmed that the Justice Department had contacted it this month as part of the agency\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/technology/facebook-antitrust-germany.html\">sweeping antitrust review</url> of the tech giants, which it made public on Tuesday.</p><p>The developments highlighted the new reality for big tech companies: Scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers has become a constant.</p><p>For the past few years, American regulators appeared to be lagging as authorities around the world have stepped up their actions to crimp the power of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple. The contrast was starkest with European officials, who have passed laws and imposed a series of large penalties against big tech companies. But in recent months, American lawmakers and regulators have also ramped up their activity.</p><p>\u201cThe online technology industry and our company have received increased regulatory scrutiny in the past quarter,\u201d Facebook said in a statement on Wednesday.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, said at an employee meeting at the company\u2019s headquarters in Silicon Valley that he supported the privacy settlement with the F.T.C. and that it would change the way the social network operated because \u201cif we don\u2019t, then we\u2019re going to be held accountable for it.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg did not specifically address the antitrust concerns but said on a conference call with investors, \u201cwith the guidance and expectations from regulators, we have a clearer path forward.\u201d He called for more government oversight of the tech industry at large.</p><p>The F.T.C. confirmed the antitrust investigation against Facebook and declined to comment further.</p><p>The agency\u2019s five commissioners put out dueling statements on the privacy settlement. The three Republican commissioners \u2014 including the F.T.C. chairman, Joseph J. Simons \u2014 who voted to approve the deal said they were \u201cproud\u201d of the agreement and believed the measures \u201cwill provide significant deterrence not just to Facebook, but to every other company that collects or uses consumer data.\u201d</p><p>But the two Democratic commissioners disagreed. One of them, Rohit Chopra, warned that the terms of the settlement legally shielded Facebook from liability for a wide range of past problematic practices. \u201cThis shield represents a major win for Facebook, but leaves the public in the dark as to how the company violated the law and what violations, if any, are going unaddressed,\u201d he said.</p><p>Even as the scrutiny around Facebook has grown, its business has remained strong. It said on Wednesday that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/technology/facebook-antitrust-germany.html\">revenue for its second quarter</url> rose 28 percent from a year ago to $16.9 billion. While profits fell 49 percent to $2.6 billion because of a one-time $2 billion charge to pay the F.T.C.\u2019s fine and an accounting charge related to tax deductions, Facebook still performed better than Wall Street had expected.</p><p>\u201cFacebook, with all of its missteps over the past two years, is going to remain a strong stock over the next few years,\u201d said Shawn Riegsecker, chief executive of the ad-technology company Centro.</p><p>The F.T.C.\u2019s privacy settlement with Facebook follows an investigation over the past year into whether the company had violated a 2011 privacy agreement with the agency. Under that earlier agreement, the social network had said it would not deceive people over how their information was used and shared.</p><p>Then last year, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/technology/facebook-antitrust-germany.html\">a report from The New York Times and The Observer of London</url> revealed how Facebook had allowed Cambridge Analytica, a British consulting firm to the Trump campaign, to harvest the personal information of its users. Cambridge Analytica had used the data to build profiles of American voters without the consent of Facebook users.</p><p>In its settlement with Facebook on Wednesday, the F.T.C. said it had mandated that the social network create an independently appointed privacy committee on its board to review decisions affecting user privacy. That would reduce the ability of Mr. Zuckerberg and others to unilaterally make decisions, the agency said.</p><p>The F.T.C. also ordered Facebook to designate compliance officers to oversee a privacy program, undergo regular privacy audits that Mr. Zuckerberg and others must submit to, and appoint an outside assessor to monitor the handling of data. All of these would increase Facebook\u2019s transparency and accountability, the agency said.</p><p>Yet the F.T.C.\u2019s two Democratic commissioners said the measures were inadequate. Facebook\u2019s officers should be held personally liable for privacy transgressions, they argued, and more needed to be done to curb the company\u2019s data-mining practices. They also said that a $5 billion fine was a drop in the bucket.</p><p>\u201cWhen companies can violate the law, pay big penalties and still turn a profit while keeping their business model intact, enforcement agencies cannot claim victory,\u201d Mr. Chopra said in his dissent.</p><p>The three Republican commissioners said that the $5 billion fine was \u201crecord breaking\u201d and that it reset the baseline for privacy cases.</p><p>They also said the F.T.C. did not have a strong enough case to move forward with any litigation against Facebook. Ultimately, Mr. Simons and the other two Republican commissioners, Noah Phillips and Christine Wilson, said the concessions they were able to extract with a settlement were more valuable \u2014 and far more certain \u2014 than what might be achieved with a drawn-out legal battle.</p><p>\u201cIs the relief we would obtain through this settlement equal to or better than what we could reasonably obtain through litigation?\u201d they said. \u201cIf the answer had been \u2018no,\u2019 it would have made sense to aggressively move forward in court. The answer, however, was \u2018yes.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Lawmakers were sharply critical. The F.T.C. agreement \u201cutterly fails to penalize Facebook in any effective way,\u201d said Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican of Missouri.</p><p>Andrew I. Gavil, a law professor at Howard University, said the F.T.C.\u2019s antitrust investigation represented a commitment of staff and agency resources. \u201cIt also suggests there is reason to believe there is anticompetitive behavior to look at,\u201d he said.</p><p>The F.T.C.\u2019s lengthy privacy inquiry into Facebook could well have brought out evidence that helped persuade the agency to pursue an antitrust investigation, said Mr. Gavil, who is a former senior F.T.C. official.</p><p>Investigations can take months or even years. They result in staff presentations, by the agency\u2019s economic bureau and by its competition bureau, made in private to the five commissioners. The politically appointed commissioners then decide whether to bring a case or not, or try to reach a settlement.</p><p>Unlike with the privacy case, there is no provision for fines in a civil antitrust case. But what can happen, if a corporate defendant is found to have violated the nation\u2019s antitrust law, is follow-on cases by private plaintiffs such as other companies.</p><p>Follow Mike Isaac and Natasha Singer on Twitter: @MikeIsaac and @natashanyt.

As part of a settlement, the company was also ordered to create a new privacy committee on its board and to make other structural changes to increase the transparency and accountability of its data practices.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the agreement was criticized for failing to limit Facebook's gathering, sharing and use of people's personal information, a practice that has repeatedly raised privacy questions. And the F.T.C.'s commissioners were divided on partisan lines this month when they voted 3-to-2 to approve the measures, which provide immunity to Facebook's officers and directors and shield the company from known claims of violations through last month - essentially giving it a pass on its past.</p><p>At the same time, the Securities and Exchange Commission said on Wednesday that it had imposed a $100 million penalty against Facebook for making misleading disclosures to investors about the risks of misuse of user data. The S.E.C. said Facebook had known for two years about that misuse, but had presented those risks to investors as merely hypothetical.</p><p>Hours later, Facebook also disclosed that it was the target of an antitrust investigation by the F.T.C. While the agency was known to be looking into the company and whether it had used its reach and clout to reduce competition, a formal investigation starts a more intensive phase of examination. The company also confirmed that the Justice Department had contacted it this month as part of the agency's sweeping antitrust review of the tech giants, which it made public on Tuesday.</p><p>The developments highlighted the new reality for big tech companies: Scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers has become a constant.</p><p>For the past few years, American regulators appeared to be lagging as authorities around the world have stepped up their actions to crimp the power of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple. The contrast was starkest with European officials, who have passed laws and imposed a series of large penalties against big tech companies. But in recent months, American lawmakers and regulators have also ramped up their activity.</p><p>\"The online technology industry and our company have received increased regulatory scrutiny in the past quarter,\" Facebook said in a statement on Wednesday.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, said at an employee meeting at the company's headquarters in Silicon Valley that he supported the privacy settlement with the F.T.C. and that it would change the way the social network operated because \"if we don't, then we're going to be held accountable for it.\"</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg did not specifically address the antitrust concerns but said on a conference call with investors, \"with the guidance and expectations from regulators, we have a clearer path forward.\" He called for more government oversight of the tech industry at large.</p><p>The F.T.C. confirmed the antitrust investigation against Facebook and declined to comment further.</p><p>The agency's five commissioners put out dueling statements on the privacy settlement. The three Republican commissioners - including the F.T.C. chairman, Joseph J. Simons - who voted to approve the deal said they were \"proud\" of the agreement and believed the measures \"will provide significant deterrence not just to Facebook, but to every other company that collects or uses consumer data.\"</p><p>But the two Democratic commissioners disagreed. One of them, Rohit Chopra, warned that the terms of the settlement legally shielded Facebook from liability for a wide range of past problematic practices. \"This shield represents a major win for Facebook, but leaves the public in the dark as to how the company violated the law and what violations, if any, are going unaddressed,\" he said.</p><p>Even as the scrutiny around Facebook has grown, its business has remained strong. It said on Wednesday that revenue for its second quarter rose 28 percent from a year ago to $16.9 billion. While profits fell 49 percent to $2.6 billion because of a one-time $2 billion charge to pay the F.T.C.'s fine and an accounting charge related to tax deductions, Facebook still performed better than Wall Street had expected.</p><p>\"Facebook, with all of its missteps over the past two years, is going to remain a strong stock over the next few years,\" said Shawn Riegsecker, chief executive of the ad-technology company Centro.</p><p>The F.T.C.'s privacy settlement with Facebook follows an investigation over the past year into whether the company had violated a 2011 privacy agreement with the agency. Under that earlier agreement, the social network had said it would not deceive people over how their information was used and shared.</p><p>Then last year, a report from The New York Times and The Observer of London  revealed how Facebook had allowed Cambridge Analytica, a British consulting firm to the Trump campaign, to harvest the personal information of its users. Cambridge Analytica had used the data to build profiles of American voters without the consent of Facebook users.</p><p>In its settlement with Facebook on Wednesday, the F.T.C. said it had mandated that the social network create an independently appointed privacy committee on its board to review decisions affecting user privacy. That would reduce the ability of Mr. Zuckerberg and others to unilaterally make decisions, the agency said.</p><p>The F.T.C. also ordered Facebook to designate compliance officers to oversee a privacy program, undergo regular privacy audits that Mr. Zuckerberg and others must submit to, and appoint an outside assessor to monitor the handling of data. All of these would increase Facebook's transparency and accountability, the agency said.</p><p>Yet the F.T.C.'s two Democratic commissioners said the measures were inadequate. Facebook's officers should be held personally liable for privacy transgressions, they argued, and more needed to be done to curb the company's data-mining practices. They also said that a $5 billion fine was a drop in the bucket.</p><p>\"When companies can violate the law, pay big penalties and still turn a profit while keeping their business model intact, enforcement agencies cannot claim victory,\" Mr. Chopra said in his dissent.</p><p>The three Republican commissioners said that the $5 billion fine was \"record breaking\" and that it reset the baseline for privacy cases.</p><p>They also said the F.T.C. did not have a strong enough case to move forward with any litigation against Facebook. Ultimately, Mr. Simons and the other two Republican commissioners, Noah Phillips and Christine Wilson, said the concessions they were able to extract with a settlement were more valuable - and far more certain - than what might be achieved with a drawn-out legal battle.</p><p>\"Is the relief we would obtain through this settlement equal to or better than what we could reasonably obtain through litigation?\" they said. \"If the answer had been 'no,' it would have made sense to aggressively move forward in court. The answer, however, was 'yes.'\"</p><p>Lawmakers were sharply critical. The F.T.C. agreement \"utterly fails to penalize Facebook in any effective way,\" said Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican of Missouri.</p><p>Andrew I. Gavil, a law professor at Howard University, said the F.T.C.'s antitrust investigation represented a commitment of staff and agency resources. \"It also suggests there is reason to believe there is anticompetitive behavior to look at,\" he said.</p><p>The F.T.C.'s lengthy privacy inquiry into Facebook could well have brought out evidence that helped persuade the agency to pursue an antitrust investigation, said Mr. Gavil, who is a former senior F.T.C. official.</p><p>Investigations can take months or even years. They result in staff presentations, by the agency's economic bureau and by its competition bureau, made in private to the five commissioners. The politically appointed commissioners then decide whether to bring a case or not, or try to reach a settlement.</p><p>Unlike with the privacy case, there is no provision for fines in a civil antitrust case. But what can happen, if a corporate defendant is found to have violated the nation's antitrust law, is follow-on cases by private plaintiffs such as other companies.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Follow Mike Isaac and Natasha Singer on Twitter: @MikeIsaac and @natashanyt.

We've got a big three hours, coming up.</p><p>And we turn now -- right now, we kick it off with Wall Street markets.  We're looking to see a rebound this morning.  Take a look at Futures actually have just turned negative once again.  Futures down just fractionally, about 6 points on the Dow Industrials; 1-1/2 points lower on the S&amp;P; and the NASDAQ down 13 points.  This, after stocks finished lower yesterday on China growth fears along with weak guidance from Nvidia and Caterpillar.  We told you -- the Caterpillar numbers right here.  And of course, it did worsen throughout the day as investors react to a weaker-than-expected earnings and guidance.</p><p>Joining me right now is Federated Investors Chief Equity Market Strategist, Phil Orlando.  And Phil, it's good to see you this morning.</p><p>PHIL ORLANDO, CHIEF EQUITY MARKET STRATEGIST, FEDERATED INVESTORS:  Thanks for having me back, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All indications that we are seeing a slowdown and worries around China, among other issues, how do you see the markets here as more earnings have come into play?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, you had this 20 percent waterfall decline in stock prices in the fourth quarter of last year, we thought the market was attempting to price in the prospect of recession this year.  Multiples contracted from 18 times earnings down to 14 times earnings.  In our view, there's no risk of recession this year.  So, the rally that we've seen over the last month, 14 percent rally, the market is starting to price in the fact that maybe we're not going to have a recession.  But we've had a 14 percent rally in a month.  That's very, very powerful.  We would absolutely expect some consolidation here over the next month or two particularly as we've got these critical sign posts coming up in the month of March, but as we look out over the balance of the year, we do think that multiples will return to that 18 level, and we're going to end up with a pretty good year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  To what do you attribute the slowdown?  We've got earnings in focus and we're looking at a number of companies out that give weaker-than-expected guidance or miss on the top line.  Lockheed Martin, Pfizer, and Verizon are reporting this morning.  Apple is, of course, out after the bell, so when you look at the earnings picture, where in terms of industry are you seeing the most slowdown?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, I think in a word, uncertainty is what's impacting earnings and guidance to some degree.  You've got the Fed flip-flops that we saw in the fourth quarter last year, the uncertainty about whether or not the United States and China are going to be able to consummate this trade deal.  You've got Brexit overhanging on the global market and certainly the government shutdown, which was up there for 35 days, and it was just temporarily resolved last Friday.  You've got a number of issues there, all of which are impacting companies in some way, shape or form.  So, with earnings up 25 percent year-over-year in the first three quarters of last year, this fourth quarter is a little softer, I think we're up about 13 percent.  So far, we're about a quarter of the way through the earnings season.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>ORLANDO:  And I think what companies are pointing to are some combination of those four issues that I just mentioned.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you mentioned the shutdown.  The shutdown apparently costing the economy $11 billion according to new analysis from the Congressional Budget Office, although Larry Kudlow is disputing that number, and he's going to join us this morning live to talk about it.  The report says that it hit $3 billion, that's one-tenth of a percent of economic activity in the fourth quarter alone.  So, are there sectors that were -- that were hit hardest in that regard, or do you want to look at those companies that are largely tied to the China trade as one area of the real weakness?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the council of economic advisers under Trump had advised us that the shutdown was going to take about one-tenth of one percent out of GDP per week.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, remember, the shutdown started right around Christmas, so that makes sense that we lost, you know, a tenth of a percent in the fourth quarter, you know, maybe a half a percent here in the first quarter.  We're at 1.7 percent GDP growth in the first quarter, consensus blue chip is around 22, 23.  So, we think this pretext a little high and there will be, you know, sort of a downward revision as we get later in the quarter.  But in terms of industries, I think it's really across the board.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Across the board.</p><p>ORLANDO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about technology because it's big week for tech, Apple, of course, the big story today, reporting after the close tonight -- the only big tech reporting.  Microsoft, Facebook out tomorrow, Amazon is out on Thursday.  This is the week that we'll focus on technology and that's where really the growth stories have been.  Would you want to put new money to work in any of these names ahead of their earnings?</p><p>ORLANDO:  Short answer is probably no.  Again, you've had this 14 percent rally here in the last month, you've got concerns about slowing economic growth both in the U.S. and China.  We think that those issues will be resolved as we get into the back half of the year, but right now, you know, why run the risk of putting new money to work after you've had a big rally in some of these names ahead of what could be a disappointing earnings number or perhaps conservative guidance.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, the stock has come down because people were worried about it.  So, we'll see what the numbers are.  Would you, at some point, go back in to tech?  What's your favorite group right now, Phil?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, the areas that we like best in the U.S. markets are energy, financial services, industrials, and health care.  In terms of looking overseas, emerging markets look very attractive to us.  So, the areas that have really gotten hit the most are the ones that we've been attracted to.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there.  So, the valuations are better, I guess, is what you're saying.</p><p>ORLANDO:  The valuations are much more attractive.  We think the fundamentals are still very strong.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Phil, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>ORLANDO:  Great to see you.  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Phil Orlando joining us there.  Meanwhile, a bug in Apple's FaceTime app lets users listen in someone's phone without even the person knowing.  Dagen McDowell, what's happening this morning?  Good morning to you, Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well, Apple has some explaining to do, but particularly on this earnings call this afternoon.  So, there's a bug in the Apple iPhone that would allow people to eavesdrop on FaceTime users' calls.  A FaceTime user calling another person could listen in while the recipients phone is still ringing even if the person never accepts the call.  This was -- it involves several steps in the Group FaceTime feature on the iPhone.</p><p>Apple has disabled that Group FaceTime while it tries to come up with a fix for this, but you can eavesdrop in on somebody, essentially listening through the microphone, even if a person never takes that call, you could eavesdrop on rooms with unattended devices and even receive unauthorized video from the phone.  And again, it would take several steps to do this, but this is coming from a company, Maria, that loves to brag about its privacy protections and even throws shade at the likes of Facebook and other technology companies.</p><p>And adding embarrassment to embarrassment, yesterday was International Data Privacy Day and Tim Cook was tweeting about that.  Here's what he said on Twitter yesterday before this bug, this eavesdropping bug was disclosed.  We must keep fighting for the kind of world we want to live in.  On this Data Privacy Day, let us all insist on action and reform for vital privacy protections.  The dangers are real and the consequences are too important.  Big whoops for Apple, and of course, everything that happens in the business world is a political opportunity.  The Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo had to weigh in on this as well, putting out a statement late yesterday, say, \"Urging FaceTime users to temporarily disable the app.  So, Apple beat him to it, they're trying to fix it.  Embarrassment nonetheless.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible because you don't even know -- I mean, the phone could be ringing and you don't even know that they're listening.  I mean, that's the worst part of it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  I can explain later as the show goes on how this work, but you'd have to place a FaceTime call, go to the group, add yourself to the call and then the recipient of the call would have to hit maybe one like the on-button on the phone in order to activate it, but it was possible, and it was all over the internet yesterday how to do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, if -- so, if it's -- if it's not on and you say -- and you do -- and you decline the phone call, they can't listen in?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Unless you -- but you can't touch the phone at all.  Like, it's not even declining the phone.  Like, if you hit the up -- the up volume button on the phone, and so if I was playing this trick on you, it would activate it, and they could essentially hear what was going on in the room.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Unbelievable.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  I want to hear more about that, for sure.  Meanwhile, there's this, as expected, PG&amp;E filed for bankruptcy protection following those devastating wildfires in California.  Cheryl Casone on that in headlines right now.  Cheryl, good morning to you.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  Well, PG&amp;E is facing roughly about 30 billion in potential liabilities, as investigators are looking into whether the company's equipment played a role in starting California's deadliest fire.  More than 100 people died following a series of wildfires that burned hundreds of thousands of acres over a two-year period.  The utility providing energy service to 60 million people, we should add.  Taking a look at shares of PG&amp;E, look at that, in the premarket down nearly nine percent.  And those loses have actually paired back in the last hour or so, folks.</p><p>Well, China's Vice Premier has arrived in Washington for high-level trade talks that are going to start tomorrow.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and trade representative Robert Lighthizer will attend the two-day meeting.  Yesterday, the Trump administration announced a pair of indictments against Chinese telecom giant, Huawei.  The U.S. is accusing the company of trying to steal trade secrets from T-Mobile.  The Justice Department also charging Huawei with conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran.</p><p>And the China story continues, folks, shares of Nvidia are lower this morning.  The chipmaker is warning investors, and expects much weaker sales thanks in part, yes, to China's slowing economy.  It also previously cautioned the sales of its graphics processors that are used in video games PCs would be disappointing.  The China effect continues.  Chips for video gaming account for more than half of their business, they lost half their market value since hitting their peak back on October 1st, Maria.  So, Goldman Sachs had to come out last Friday, Maria, warning that a lot of these chip companies that have massive exposure to China are going to have really rough reports.  Micron Technology, even Wynn Resorts, the casino company, has got big China exposure, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, for sure.  All right, Cheryl, thanks so much.  Coming up next, five police officers are injured this morning, four of them shot while serving a search warrant.  The very latest coming up.  And then a venti-size disaster for Howard Schultz last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire (BLEEP).</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Former Starbucks CEO having a rough time exploring a 2020 Presidential run as he gets heckled.  We break it down right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Live from Washington, we are eyeing 2020, former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz facing backlash last night on his first stop of his book tour.  It was his first public appearance after announcing a possible Independent Presidential run.  It did not begin smoothly.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire (BLEEP).  Go back to getting ratio'd on Twitter.  Go back to Davos with the other billionaire elite who think they know how to run the world.  That's not what democracy needs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, my goodness.  Schultz is also facing backlash from former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.  Here's what he tweeted: \"In 2020, the great likelihood is that an Independent would just split the anti-Trump vote and end up re-electing the President.  That's a risk I refused to run in 2016, and we can't afford to run it now.\"</p><p>Here with me this morning to talk more about all of that is Dagen McDowell back in New York, Wall Street Journal Global Economics Editor Jon Hilsenrath here in D.C. with me, along with the American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp.  Gentlemen, it's good to see you.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Welcome to Washington.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, thank you so much.  And welcome to presidential politics, Howard Schultz.  What do you think about that?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Well, I'm going to get some popcorn.  This could be a real interesting Democratic primary, and whatever this Independent thing is, don't you love Michael Bloomberg who has probably spent a million dollars on polling, trying to figure out every way to become the President.  Publicly chastising Schultz for running as an Independent when that's exactly what Bloomberg would just love to do if he could.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  You know, on the one hand, Dagen, I feel like there is an opening for an Independent because there's such extremes and radical conversation going on certainly on the left.  And on the other hand, I don't know, how much is a cup of coffee at Starbucks?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Again, that $18.00 cup of Joe, I'm joking, I'm exaggerating.  It's helping --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think it's like $6.00.  I mean, seriously.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, we love cart coffee around this place.  But again, that's helping fund this run.  But Michael Bloomberg -- you know what, Michael Bloomberg should run for the Democratic nomination if he thinks he can win, it's just hilarious to have this multibillionaire lecturing Howard Schultz about an Independent run when actually a cup of Starbucks coffee has more charisma than Michael Bloomberg, number one.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Number two, it's going to be really interesting to see the narrative in the spring of 1992 with Ross Perot was -- Ross Perot was going to divide the Democratic vote, that it wouldn't hurt the Republican.  This could very well -- I mean, it depends on who -- what Howard Schultz says on the campaign trail and how far-left the Democrats go when they're running for the nomination.  But I'll say this, what he said so far about pay -- how to pay for Medicare For All and how that's impossible, I would be really interested to hear him talk about how to fix the health care system, because he might come to the table with some really interesting ideas and force the Democrats to answer the hard questions about paying for this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that is the thing, I mean, this party unfortunately, it's very hard for someone who's a centrist to actually have a shot.  You had Tim Ryan from Ohio, he wanted to do it, he's an economic thinker, he doesn't have a shot because of the same thing, you've got the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's 70 percent tax rate, the loudest voice in the room.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I mean, there's no question that these primaries are starting out very much from the left, you know, you have talk about a wealth tax, and 70 percent high-income tax threshold.  You have Elizabeth Warren who is going around beating up on the banks.  This is definitely a left-leaning primary season that we're going to be going into.  What I find so fascinating is the journeys that these different billionaires are traveling.  You know, you had President Trump who supported a lot of Democrats as a businessman in New York City traveling over to Republican Party, now you have Michael Bloomberg who started out as a Republican Mayor --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- traveling over to the Democratic Party, and Howard Schultz doesn't know where to go.  He doesn't know where he fits in.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He doesn't know where -- and what about Senator Kamala Harris?  Let's listen to her, because she held a CNN Townhall meeting in Iowa last night.  Harris is vowing to eliminate private health insurance with Medicare For All if elected president.  What's your take, Matt?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Making insurance companies illegal.  Look, the Democratic Party has become quite radicalized.  Think about this, less choices for the patient is the solution to our problems.  That seems insane.  Also, do we really think the government, when you get your tags to drive your car, or when you pay your taxes at the IRS, do you really think all the solutions to our problems are there?  I don't.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Let me ask you this, who does President Trump want to see come out of this whole --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think he wants Howard Schultz to run.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think -- he was taunting him yesterday.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH:  No, besides Howard Schultz, among the Democrats, who does he -- who does he want to (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>SCHLAPP:  I think most Republicans -- I'm not going to speak for the President -- but I think most Republicans believe that Elizabeth Warren is so far out there on the loony left, basically Marxism, socialism that I think they find that a delicious opportunity.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Can I --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- call the confiscation, Dagen.  He called it (INAUDIBLE) I mean, this two or three percent tax on assets, confiscation.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It is wealth confiscation.  It's totally communist and then to try and find people when they hand in their U.S. citizenship when other countries come calling, wanting you move there because they won't come and take your hard-earned money.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  One thing I want to point out that Jon Hilsenrath said that Howard Schultz doesn't know where to go.  President Trump should be worried about a Howard Schultz, because what if he comes to the table, like I said, with ideas that appeal to voters in this country who feel left out.  Who left out from the Republican Party and certainly left out by the left-leaning Democrats in this environment.  So, be very, very careful.  And one other thing I'll add with Howard Schultz at that -- at that bookstore, that's just the New York City welcome wagon.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's the way they treat all tourists in this city.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, I think you make a good point because there is that path.  That path of centrism.  I mean, that path of the center, because people do feel like it's gone wacky all the way on the left, for sure.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  It's a centrist country, but don't forget Hillary.  She's making noises.  Maybe that's the President's favorite opponent.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH:  We haven't seen any --</p><p>SCHLAPP:  She's making noises.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  We haven't seen anyone travel that centrist path as an Independent to presidency.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  So, it was a smart move on Howard Schultz's part.  We'll see.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Or a risky one for all those billions --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, certainly risky.  Take a quick break.  Extreme weather warning meanwhile on the other side of this break, millions of people across the country are gearing up for an Arctic blast as temperatures are plummeting, that's next.</p><p>Then showing their cards, British Prime Minister Theresa May asking Parliament to put up its plans from Britain's exit from the E.U.  Details on the historic debate.  And the vote happening later today, back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  It is cold out, and the deep freeze is setting in, hitting millions of Americans with subzero and dangerous temperatures.  Fox News Senior Meteorologist Janice Dean in the Fox Weather Center right now with the very latest.  Janice, tell us about it.</p><p>JANICE DEAN, FOX NEWS SENIOR METEOROLOGIST:  Hi, Maria, yes, we could be dealing with historic lows.  These are current windchills, what it feels like when you go outside and you are not protected.  Dangerous, potentially life-threatening windchills of -41 in International Falls, -18 in Chicago, but we still have another blast behind this.  So, these are morning lows, these are not windchill temperatures: Chicago -25 on Thursday, -31 in Minneapolis, -16 in Detroit.  Again, those are not windchill values.  Those are actual air temperatures.  But with the windchill, in some cases, we could get windchill values of -40 to -50.  If you go outside, your skin is going to freeze in minutes.</p><p>So, here's Chicago, Illinois.  Your all-time record low is -28.  So, we're going to flirt with historic lows, Maria.  This is a big deal.  The good news is it won't be long lasting.  By the weekend, we'll start to rebound, but I also want to make mention with this arctic cold front as we have snow across the deep south.  Snow that could cripple travel across portions of Atlanta, Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, and towards the southeast, so that's another dangerous part of the storm is the -- not only extreme cold but the snow as far as south as the gulf coast.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Janice.  Wow, what a story, thank you so much.</p><p>DEAN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will be watching.  Janice Dean.  Coming up next, the State of the Union is back on, it is February 5th.  Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi extending an invitation to the President, he accepted the offer.  Then, we're taking a look at the enormous cost of the shutdown.  What is the real number?  Plus, place your bets, Super Bowl fans getting ready to throw down an enormous amount of cash.  So, bet on the big game Sunday.  We break down all the numbers.  Stay with us.  Live from Washington this morning.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us.  We are coming to you live from Washington this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, January 29th, your top stories right now 6:31 on the east coast right now.  Earnings season is in full swing, a lot of big names reporting their fourth quarter today.  Xerox and Pfizer set to report in just a few moments, we'll bring you the numbers as soon as they hit the tape, and tell you how they are impacting markets.  Rising tensions with China, the U.S. is bringing charges against Huawei, as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will be my special guest, in about 90 minutes time.  We will break it all down with the Treasury Secretary, coming up.  So, stay with us.</p><p>Meanwhile, Futures relatively flat this morning, take a look at markets, down 20 points on the Dow Industrials, down 4 points on the S&amp;P, down 18 points on the NASDAQ.  We are expecting some pressure at the start of trading this morning, after all the major indices finished lower, yesterday, on Wall Street.</p><p>In fact, at 4:00, the Dow Industrials gave up 208 points, that was almost 1 percent lower, the S&amp;P 500 down 21, that was three quarters of a percent lower, and the NASDAQ with a 79-point decline yesterday, at the close, down better than 1 percent.</p><p>Investors are watching some big news this week, J.P. Morgan, calling this week the most important week of the first quarter, and here is why, you've got earnings, you've got the British vote, you've got U.S.-China trade talks, you've got a Federal Reserve decision, we're not expecting a Fed hike.</p><p>We've got fourth quarter GDP coming out.  And, of course, at the end of the week, the job's report for the month of January, a big week, investors want to watch it and will be covering it all.</p><p>European indices this morning look like this, in terms of trading.  We are looking at gains in Europe.  The FT-100 up one and a quarter percent, 86 points higher, the CAC Quarante in Paris is up a half a percent, 26 points higher, and the DAX Index in Germany, higher by a fraction, as you can see there.</p><p>Asian markets overnight, flat, take a look.  No real moves there, because mover was the KOSPI Index in Korea, up a quarter of a percent.</p><p>Well, there is tragedy in Houston to report, five police officers injured.  Four of them shot, while serving a search warrant.  We have the very latest, coming up.</p><p>And a debate in parliament, British lawmakers set to vote on the latest plan for the U.K. to leave the European Union.  We are previewing that and we will take a look at the impact across the world.</p><p>We've got a big program this morning from D.C., U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is coming up this morning, along National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow, they will take a look at all of these expectations that the economy is slowing.</p><p>Plus, House Minority Leader and California Congressman, Kevin McCarthy, is with us, along with Michigan Congresswoman, Debbie Dingell.  Plus, AFL CIO, President Richard Trumpa, here as well, big show, don't miss a moment of it, big three hours, coming up. And we are kicking off this half an hour right now, with this top story, feeling the effects of the shutdown, Washington, D.C. back in business for now, President Trump will give his State of the Union of Address on February 5th, Tuesday.  The address was originally supposed to be today.</p><p>Even though the shutdown is over, the U.S. is still feeling effects, new numbers from the Congressional Budget Office to report.  The U.S. GDP will be $3 billion lower during the fourth quarter of 2018, because of this shutdown.  On the immigration front, backlogs of immigration courts grew by at least 10 percent, according to Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about all of that is Americans for Tax Reform President, Grover Norquist, Grover, good to see you.</p><p>GROVER NORQUIST, PRESIDENT, AMERICANS FOR TAX REFORM:  Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So, the CBO is talking about a $3 billion-dollar hit, in fact, as a result of the shutdown, Larry Kudlow is having an issue with this.  He says, frequently disagrees with the CBO anyway.  What's your take in terms of what the shutdown cost the economy?</p><p>NORQUIST:  Look, the key thing is that the economy continues to grow and we're looking at a three percent rate of growth for the year, so $3 billion is a big number, unless you compare it to the GDP of the United States in the fourth quarter.</p><p>So, actually, we're doing fairly well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You don't think it had much of an impact then, Grover?</p><p>NORQUIST:  No, it's a small impact and we have a tremendous growth for the year, which is way beyond what the CBO said was possible, when they scored this.  The CBO needs to spend a little more time going back to explain why they were so wrong on all of their recent predictions, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  Go ahead.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Grover, the Federal Reserve and most of the economist that we surveyed at the Wall Street Journal are saying that the economy is slowing down in 2019.  We had a nice burst in 2018 in part, because of tax cuts and in part, because there's more spending, $300 billion of additional spending.</p><p>But now, they say the economy is slowing along with the global economy, what does that say about the impact of these tax cuts, are the tax cuts really created the long-run growth that Republicans said was going to happen?</p><p>NORQUIST:  The tax cuts do two things.  We were at 35 percent rate, which is the highest in the world.  It made sense for an American company like Burger King to be bought by Canadian company, because even though they're selling the same hamburgers, the same number of employees, it was worth more, because we had a worldwide tax system at 35 percent.</p><p>By taking 35 down to 21, we became competitive with Europe.  I mean, our friends, the Germans were at 25, the Japanese were at 25.  I'm sorry, the Japanese were at 30.  The Chinese were at 25.  And we were at 35.  We weren't even close to being competitive.  It's a huge change in the direction for the country.</p><p>And if the CBO tells you they're pessimistic, they didn't think you could do three percent, they laughed at three percent growth, said you could never do more than --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  The question is, is that three percent growth.  I think a lot of people understand that the corporate tax rate was uncompetitive, even some Democrats wanted to lower their corporate tax rate, but the question is, this new tax code that we've got, is that sufficient to sustain the three percent growth in 2019?</p><p>NORQUIST:  It's a good first start.  We also need to do something about the workforce.  We need more workers and frankly, there's more tax reduction that needs to be done and spending restraint is very important at the end of the day.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  I want to go back to this question about a shutdown, Grover, which is, people are saying, they're almost using the reason why you couldn't cut government, because somehow, that would have a negative impact on our economic growth.  That seems like a very dangerous road to go down.</p><p>Isn't it true that all of this money that they are saying didn't get put into the economy, are you worried that the government actually won't spend all of that by the time that the authority over the money, expires?</p><p>NORQUIST:  For the government to -- I was taught this (INAUDIBLE) economics in college also.  The government takes your money, and then spends it.  It's much better for the economy than if it lets you spend it.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Right.</p><p>NORQUIST:  Because you would waste some of it by investing it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because they can spend money better than you, of course.</p><p>NORQUIST:  And that's the oddest thing because, of course, that's nonsense.  East Germany should have done very well, under this theory, but it doesn't, so --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  What the government is doing is borrowing other people's money and spending it, right?  I mean, we're talking about deficits that are nearing a trillion dollars.</p><p>NORQUIST:  The (INAUDIBLE) cost the government is how much the government spends, whether they borrowed or take it, it's still gone from the -- from the real economy.  The cost of government is total government spending.  We should have taxes low, and then the least destructive way possible, all taxes are somewhat destructive.  And you have less borrowing if you have less spending.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what about all of these new plans?  And by the way, we are getting earnings right now, as we're talking 3M and Xerox, both beat expectations, although 3M is cutting its forecast for the year.  What about all of these ideas about taxing the wealthy?  New York Congressman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez claims for a 70 percent marginal tax rate on the tippy top, as she calls it.</p><p>Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts senator, hopeful, for 2020, two percent tax on Americans whose assets exceed 50 million.  If you're a billionaire, three percent, what's the impact?</p><p>NORQUIST:  OK, magicians like to do this, so you're not looking at, you know -- watch my right hand, don't look at the left hand.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NORQUIST:  The reason they talk about high tax rates on rich people, is that they want to gouge the middle class.  The difference between the United States and Sweden, Finland, Denmark, the countries that Cortez talked about is, they don't have the 70 percent rate, just back up for sec -- there isn't a country in the world with a 70 percent income tax rate.</p><p>Many countries used to, the Beatle song, 19 for me, one for you, 95 percent tax rate, and then the Beatles moved to United States, and everybody who could pay tennis, left Sweden.  And all the countries of the world realize that tax rates that high were stupid and destructive and didn't help equality or growth or anything like that.</p><p>So, they got rid of them.  The whole world got rid of them.  We did it, it was stupid.  We back offed it and had strong economic growth as a result, so 70 percent stupid and destructive.  It's not America saying, the world says that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You probably showed the op-ed today, in the Journal, in California, and taxes as well.  The Journal, this week, by Cypress founder, T.J. Rodgers, which was very good, Another California Tax Grab, he writes.  In it, the politicians have fueled an affordability crisis that drives away businesses and exacerbates homelessness.</p><p>California Governor, Gavin Newsom, called for even higher taxes in his inauguration speech earlier this month.</p><p>NORQUIST:  California is a good example of 70 percent play.  They have a 13 percent rate on people making a million dollars, but they have 8 percent rate on people making $42,000.  So, they want the middle class people in California to think you're OK, because we're really screwing the other guy.</p><p>And point of fact, Florida has a zero percent first income tax, Texas has a zero percent first income tax, 8 percent looks good compared to 13.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NORQUIST:  Looks lousy compared to zero percent.  They want the middle class to think somebody else is paying the freight.  That's why they have those phoney high tax rates that don't raise much money.  It's to fool the middle class.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it is talking point, and it works for the populist.  Let me bring in Dagen McDowell on this, because we hear this every time we go into the tax discussion and we have a Democrat on which takes out another one of those talking points on taxes, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And I want to say that Senator Kamala Harris said that the first thing -- she said it last night, in the town hall, he first thing she do is to cut taxes for the middle class.  Well, roughly half this country pays no net federal income tax, number one, and the Republicans just did that particularly, doubling the standard deduction.</p><p>So, I don't know who she's going to cut taxes for.  But this is the ruse and this is the big liberal lie that all of these big new welfare state initiatives, whether it's green energy, even single payer, it's all going to be paid for by the super rich.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And that it's not going to be -- that the paying won't be spread across every person in this country to fund this welfare state.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And by the way, the numbers don't add up even if you tax all the rich, you're not going to get the amount of money you need for this green deal, Grover.</p><p>NORQUIST:  You don't even balance the budget if you do that, never mind half money for new things.  Look, the big difference between United States and Denmark, United States and Sweden, it's not how much money higher income people pay, it's what happens to middle-income people.</p><p>Denmark, Finland, Sweden, the tax rate on middle income people is 10, 15, 20 points higher than an American middle class person.  And, you add to that the value added tax.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NORQUIST:  The difference between United States and Europe is how heavily taxed middle income people are, and they have those (INAUDIBLE) high rates that very few people pay, to make people in the middle class think that they are getting a deal.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Speaking of middle income tax -- a lot of Democrats want a carbon tax, gasoline tax and even some big American business.  That's the way to address the issue of climate change.  Do you see any path towards a carbon tax that would be acceptable to your point --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I guess, but real quick, Grover.</p><p>NORQUIST:  No.  No, absolutely not.  And the reason is, you can look at Washington State, very deep blue Washington State.  They have twice had it on the ballot and twice defeated a carbon dioxide tax, gasoline taxes lose overwhelmingly.  This is too obvious tax on middle-income people.  It's a loser up.  They are having this fight in -- our dear friends in France or loggerhead down the subject.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We know how that played out.</p><p>NORQUIST:  We had the Ontario government and the Alberta government collapsed as a result of this, and three times, in Australia.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Grover, thank you.  Yes.</p><p>NORQUIST:  Bad politics and lousy economics.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Grover, thank you for the facts, we appreciate it, Grover Norquist, joining us there.</p><p>Five officers injured in a shooting in Texas, meanwhile, Cheryl Casone in New York, with the details, there.  Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  That's right, Maria.  Four officers were shot and another officer suffered a knee injury in Houston.  They were serving a search warrant at a suspected drug house.  Police say two of them were hit in the neck.  Those officers are in critical but stable condition.  Two suspects were killed at the scene.</p><p>Well, a key E.U. negotiator, warning the risk of Britain leaving the European Union without a deal, is very high, as parliament votes on amendments in Theresa May's exit plan today.  Lawmakers set to consider more than 10 different amendments before taking votes.  That's going to be at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>And those votes come after May's plan to leave the European Union was overwhelmingly rejected earlier this month, a lot of those votes against her from her own party.</p><p>Well, Americans will be betting an estimated $6 billion on the Super Bowl, that's according to the survey by the American Gaming Association.  About 22.7 million U.S. adults plan to place a bet on the upcoming Atlanta game, of those bets, 94.47 percent, reportedly illegal, but let the games begin, Maria, and those are your headlines.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Be there to watch it all, front-row seat.</p><p>CASONE:  I'm there for you, Maria.  I've got surprises for you, coming up.  You're going to love them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK, looking forward to it.  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, crisis in Venezuela to take a look at, new sanctions have been placed on the country's oil.  Plus, National Security Advisor, John Bolton, may have inadvertently revealed the administration's next move.  Why his notes are raising eyebrows this morning.</p><p>Then, farming in America, why farmers are being forced to rent water.  That's up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A look at some of the big headlines across America this morning.  The Chicago Tribune reporting on the Pension Agency criticizing Sears Chairman Eddie Lampert's plan to acquire the bankrupt retailer.  The article explaining that the agency sets to takeover Sears.  Pensions objects to the bid, calling it the final fulfillment of a year-long's scheme to deprive Sears and its creditors of assets and its employees of jobs while lining Lampert's on owns pockets.</p><p>The Daily Camera in Colorado, reporting on how Boulder County farmers are increasingly renting water.  The report explains how ownership from agricultural interests has dropped from 85 percent in the late 1950s to just 30 percent.  The water increasingly moving to municipal control.</p><p>And the Mercury News writing that how in one California city you can text 911 for emergency help.  According to the paper, the police department there announced that the service is now available in the city.  It is meant to help people who are hearing or voice impaired.  The police are also recommending that you not send emojis.  Well, yes, I would think not.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  What are we coming to?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  My God, but it is good that you can text 911.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  That's a good step, just don't text person emoji.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, crisis in Venezuela new sanctions placed on the country's oil, plus National Security Advisor John Bolton may have inadvertently revealed the administration's next move, why his notes on his legal pad are raising eyebrows this morning?  We're breaking that down when we come right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A framework for peace.  The U.S. and Taliban negotiators making a preliminary on key issues to end the war in Afghanistan -- the longest war in American history.  The two top points American troop withdrawal and insurgence vowing to end terrorist attacks abroad, that's according to the Wall Street Journal.  Many hurdles remain to ensure the peace is in place.  Joining me right now is Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst, General Jack Keane.  General, it's always a pleasure to see you.</p><p>GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST:  Good to see you, Maria, and welcome to Washington again.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  And what do you think about this?  I mean, are we supposed to be trusting the Taliban?</p><p>KEANE:  No, we can never ever trust the Taliban, that doesn't mean that we can't have a treaty with them.  But here's what I think is going on, a couple of things have changed: one is the Taliban in the last couple of years have gone all out as we have so dramatically reduced our forces, thinking that they will going to be able to overthrow the regime, because the only thing the United States is really doing is training and assisting the ground forces -- no longer doing the fighting, however provide an air power.  That didn't work.  They retook some territory but never took capitals or provinces and they never took -- they never able to secure a province.  So, what has happened?  The war stalemated.  The Taliban cannot take over the government and the government cannot defeat Taliban, even with our assistance.</p><p>Second thing, and this is crucial, Pakistan has gotten involved in this in a way they've never have before.  They forced the Taliban to go to the peace negotiation table, why?  Pakistan knows it's no longer in national interest to keep this thing stalemated.  There's growing al-Qaeda and growing ISIS presence in Afghanistan which gives the Pakistanis some concern.  So, those are the new things that are happening.  That's why the negotiations have some momentum.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's the thing, though.  I mean, so many people were worried when the president said: we were withdrawing the troops.  And where do you stand on that now?  I mean, do you feel better about it given this peace deal?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, let me answer it this way -- I mean, it is an essential question: the Taliban themselves, we are trying to get an agreement with them that, one, they'll stop trying to overthrow the government and number two, they'll power share with them and also, they will assist in taking down the al-Qaeda and the ISIS.  I don't think we can trust them to do that, based on the fact that they provided safe haven for Osama bin Laden for almost 10 years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  So, what do we do?</p><p>KEANE:  So, we leave in place, after we bring out the troops that are providing the training and assistance.  We leave in place a counterterrorism force and an intelligence capability indefinitely.  We're doing that in Yemen, we're doing it in Libya and we're doing it in Africa.  The one in Africa is off the coast.  It's a Maritime Joint Task Force.  That is what we need to do, that is the guaranty against the Taliban because the issue in Afghanistan has always been, we would never intervene in the civil war in Afghanistan between the northern alliance and Taliban for one reason only, we didn't evade, because they attacked the United States.  That's the reason we're there.  We don't want that to happen again and we cannot trust the Taliban to provide that guarantee for us.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, let me move on and ask you about sanctions on the Venezuelan oil industry.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin who will be here shortly this morning along with Security Adviser John Bolton, explain the decision in a briefing yesterday and issued warning for disputed President Nicolas Maduro.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN BOLTON, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR:  The president has made it very clear on this -- on this matter that all options are on the table.</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY:  There's no reason why these resources shouldn't be used for the economic benefit of the people there.  There's no reason for the poverty and the starvation and the humanitarian crisis.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to this announcement yesterday?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, increased pressure on Maduro regime is certainly a welcome thing.  I mean, this really comes down to the loyalty of the military to Maduro.  As long as that loyalty is there, it's unlikely that Maduro is going the leave.  If that loyalty starts to fall apart, I hope we're working a 'plan b', which is engineering right now some kind of exit path for Maduro, where he can go into exile with recriminations in Venezuela.  The Reagan administration did this very successfully on Ferdinand Marcos, back in 1986, overwhelming popular opposition to him, hundreds of thousands of people.  We engineered his exit.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me squeeze in this question before you go general.  This image from the briefing going viral and it shows John Bolton's notepad with the notation: \"5,000 troops to Colombia.\"  Whoa, do you think we should be sending troops to the region?  What do you think about this?  Caught on camera.</p><p>KEANE:  Look, when we deposed Noriega in 1989 operation just cost Panama, 26,000 troops, is what it took.  When we deposed a dictator in Haiti, 28,000.  The ease of troops that would only be in there, move into Venezuela, if there's a problem at the embassy to our diplomat.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How significance is revealing such a secret?</p><p>KEANE:  I think he'd probably wanted to reveal it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  General Jack Keane, good to see you sir.  Thank you so much.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Show: MORNINGS WITH MARIA][Date: January 29, 2019][Time: 07:00:00][Tran: 012902cb.231][Type: SHOW][Head: Interview with Rep.

Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo coming to you live this morning from Washington, D.C.  It is Tuesday, January 29th.</p><p>Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>It is a busy day on the earnings calendar this morning.  3M among the Dow components reporting their fourth quarter.  The company cut its forecast for 2019.  Pfizer also cut this morning.  The stock under pressure this morning after the guidance came in below expectations.

Join us live as the Treasury Secretary will join the program, coming up.</p><p>Markets are under pressure this morning.  Futures pointing to a lower opening for the broader averages although right now it is more like a flat showing than lower.</p><p>The Dow Industrials are up 3 points right now.  S&amp;P 500 pretty much flat, up a quarter point.  And the Nasdaq is down 4 points.  It's been back and forth on futures this after declines across the board yesterday, of course.</p><p>Stocks finished off of the lows of the day but nonetheless, the Dow Industrials were down 209 points, almost 1 percent.  S&amp;P was down 20.  The Nasdaq was down 79, better than 1 percent lower.</p><p>Global markets this morning.  Take a look at European indices, higher across the board.  This right here, this is the high of the morning.  FT 100 up 1.5 percent, 97 points higher.  CAC 40 in Paris up 39 points, almost 1 percent.

Take a look, the social media service eyeing a major change to better compete with Instagram.  We'll tell you all about it coming up.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning.  And joining me to break it all down -- Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell in New York; the \"Wall Street Journal's\" global economics editor Jon Hilsenrath here in D.C. with me; and the American Conservative Union chairman, Matt Schlapp.  Great to see you -- guys.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Great to be here.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen -- good morning to you.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning.  We were talking about the shutdown.  So it's over for the time being.</p><p>The Democrats have actually been hurt by it as well.  Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows that positive feelings about the Democratic Party have fallen to 35 percent this month.  That's down 4 percentage points since December.  And that is essentially in line with the positive feelings that people have about Republicans.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean that's a really good point because the President really did not get hurt certainly on his base, from his base, by the shutdown.  What do you guys think?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Two things.  First is that the President's base was actually energized that he would make a spending fight.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Remember, immigration is a spending fight because if he can stop illegal immigration or reduce it, you don't have all these social services costs.</p><p>But the second thing is, the President's brand is that he will fight, he will fight harder than any politician on the field and he reiterated that brand.  So if he can increase that reputation, I think it appeals to Independents.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They said dig in.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  But isn't his brand also -- it's about fighting and continuing to fight and winning.  And he didn't win the wall in this case.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  I don't agree with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We don't know if he won the wall yet.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  There's three steps to this - -</p><p>HILSENRATH:  In this case, right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  In this case.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  -- there's three really important things.  Number one, the bill he signed has $1.3 billion in barrier funding annualized.</p><p>Number two, he's got to exhaust all legislative efforts if he's going to go the emergency route in order to have a good case in court.</p><p>And number three, the American people when it comes to immigration, he is on the right side of this policy argument.  And Democrats who are against border security, they're going to be sorry for this eventually.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  But you know what.  You better be --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, go ahead -- Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- but you better be careful about what you do and this goes to all politicians because I was flying on Friday and that was an utter nightmare.  If you want to anger everybody in the electorate, you pull another fast one like that where people are grounded and you've got an hour and-a-half plane flight where you're at 8,000 feet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But who are you blaming?</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They were blaming (INAUDIBLE) and blaming the Democrats because --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They were blaming everybody.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- Nancy Pelosi dug in.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They were blaming everybody.  But TSA agents down in Raleigh, Durham were going to food banks because they were spending what little money they had on gas trying to get to and from work.  So again, I don't care who is responsible for it.  They're all responsible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, businesses did start, you know, putting the uncertainty out there, sitting on cash, making decisions later.  We know.  I mean the SEC closed, can't get any IPOs through.  FDA closed, got to worry about obvious food shortages or food issues.</p><p>So we were beginning to see some real impact.  And Dagen saw it firsthand at the airport.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  That's true.  But if you're a federal employee in this town, let's face it, you make a little bit of a bargain.  Yes, every year you might have to go through a shutdown with your salary.</p><p>But you know, the other thing, Maria, that we don't talk about, it's almost impossible to fire a federal employee.  There's some pretty cushy gigs --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good point.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  -- in THIS town where you basically have an insurance policy against ever getting fired unless you do something just awful.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  And you can read all the GAO reports that's backed that up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're talking about all of that this morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But there are people barely making ends meet who are trying to drive to work, and spending all their money on gasoline and going to food banks who were working for the TSA and not getting paid.</p><p>And when the Republicans stop thinking about them and start talking about the workers who aren't needed, the ones who are furloughed you have really missed the boat.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, maybe.  But how about the fact that we've got a border wall in Nancy Pelosi's state?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that immoral, the wall that separates Tijuana from San Diego --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  But --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- is that immoral?  I don't think so.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They need to start asking all of these Democrats who think that the wall is immoral or don't want to fund it, ok, let's take down the walls that are there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's how you put --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will the three million people in Tijuana assimilate with the three million people in San Diego if that wall is torn down?  I think so.  And we're going to talk about that this morning.</p><p>We've got a big show this morning from D.C., live.  Coming up Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is here, live.  National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow has a thing or two to say about the CBO protections about what exactly the impact is on the economy from that shutdown.</p><p>House Minority Leader and California Congressman Kevin McCarthy will walk us through what these next three weeks look like with his colleagues in terms of this negotiating on border wall funding.</p><p>Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell is here.</p><p>Along with AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka.</p><p>Don't miss a moment of it.  A big two hours coming up.</p><p>And we kick it off this hour right now with markets.  Futures are pointing to a flat opening this morning amid all of this uncertainty over China trade, earnings.  It's an enormous week this week.</p><p>This after stocks finished to the downside yesterday on the China growth fears, the weak guidance from Nvidia and Caterpillar as well, and of course these worries about what happens with China and the U.S.  There's conversations happening tomorrow.</p><p>Joining us right now is the founder, CEO and chief investment strategist at Mainstay Capital Management David Kudla.  David -- good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>DAVID KUDLA, FOUNDER/CEO/CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, MAINSTAY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So we've been talking about what a week this is with the fourth quarter earnings coming out.  That's been pretty much driving the story.  We have a jobs report coming out at the end of the week on Friday.  Brexit discussions, the vote today.  U.S./China discussions tomorrow.  A fourth quarter GDP number.  How do you want to invest with all of this?</p><p>KUDLA:  I think investors should be looking at stocks right now that they want to own.  We've been invested through -- the past month has been very good for stock investors.  13 percent rise through Friday from the lows of December 24th.  And that's in both growth stocks and value stocks, so a broad market advance.</p><p>We're going to see some give and take here now after this nice advance of last month but investors should be picking, you know, their points here, have their list out on stocks they want to own.  We look for a good 2019 for stock investors.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is it good news, Jon Hilsenrath, that the Fed gave us a pivot that we know that the Fed is on pause right now and that we know that they're even ready to consider slowing down the unwind of the bond portfolio?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  I don't think it's good news.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I think it shows that the Fed is becoming less confident about how strong and sustainable the economy is.  I mean it is a sign that inflation isn't picking up and that's good news.  But you see some real trepidation coming out of the Fed right now with the global economy slowing, with markets being unstable and volatile.</p><p>I think the Fed is a little worried about the outlook and that shouldn't really give us a lot of encouragement.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about that, David?  I mean the economy's slowing.</p><p>KUDLA:  But Jon this -- yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLA:  But John -- the important thing here is what happened in the fourth quarter is we had mixed messages out of fed chair Jerome Powell.  We had on October 3rd we were far away from neutral.  Then by November we were close to neutral rates.  Then on the 16th in the Fed meeting they were going to do what's right no matter what.</p><p>Then he came in on January 4th and finally said we're going to be considerate of market and economic conditions and now we're seeing a more consistent and accommodative message out of the Fed.  And that's very important for the markets.</p><p>That's music to the market's ears and that's why we've now seen a sustained advance.  So the markets and investors are now looking at a Fed that seems as though they are going to be considerate of or accommodative or take into account what's happening with the markets, with the economy, and not just normalize rates for the sake of normalizing rates.</p><p>They won't have $50 billion rolling off the balance sheet on auto pilot and they won't raise rates just to raise rates to get to a normalized rate structure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that was the worry in the fourth quarter.</p><p>KUDLA:  -- in pause like in 2016 if the market and economy warrants it.  That's important.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That was they worry in the fourth quarter -- that they were on auto pilot-- Jon.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  Yes, I make two points.</p><p>KUDLA:  That drove volatility in the fourth quarter, the Fed.  .</p><p>HILSENRATH:  David makes a really important point, you know.  So this has been Jerome Powell's first year at the Fed.  He's had a bit of a honeymoon with the market.  And then what the market has discovered in the last month or two is that Mr. Powell, you know, he kind of prides himself on being a plain-spoken communicator but his communication has confused a lot of people in the market.  And he's really had to do a lot of corrections over the last few weeks --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- so that raised some questions about him.</p><p>But the other thing about -- you know, the market wants to see the Fed on an easier path.  Ok.  But the underlying message there is that this economy can't sustain very high rates.</p><p>So it doesn't send a really encouraging message about economic growth and the economic outlook when we see that the Fed is starting to recognize it just can't sustain a tighter monetary policy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But look, we're getting the news from the companies themselves with the fourth quarter numbers coming out.  Verizon just reported mixed earnings.  They beat on earnings, but they missed on revenue.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Caterpillar.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Technology reporting late today, Apple.  And we heard from Apple already.  Facebook, Amazon -- all reporting this week, Microsoft.  It's going to be a big week for technology.  And of course you mentioned Caterpillar.  That was the big kahuna yesterday that really set the tone for the markets because Caterpillar is a great indicator of economic activity across the world, in particular China.</p><p>So stay on earnings for a second, David.  Give me your take on technology.  Because you've got Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft coming out this week.</p><p>KUDLA:  Well, you know, tech stocks got beat up very bad in the fourth quarter.  They've come back in this rally and we think that tech stocks have further to go.</p><p>Look, we think that investors should stay with tech stocks.  We have an opportunity here to add value stocks to the portfolio.  Cyclicals came into 2019 at their lowest valuation relative to the S&amp;P 500 ever.</p><p>So investors now can diversify their portfolio in an opportunistic way, holding both growth stocks.  Those tech stocks that we think still have some rebound and some further runway ahead of them, and by adding value stocks that are very opportunistic.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  David -- it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>KUDLA:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Still bullish on this market.  David Kudla joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, the State of the Union is back on, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi extended officially the invitation to President Trump to do the State of the Union in the House Chamber.  He accepted the offer.</p><p>Plus we're taking a look at the enormous cost of the shutdown, what exactly is the number?  A lot of people say it wasn't very much at all.</p><p>Then, Snapchat's unthinkable change, how the photo sharing app is attempting to compete with Instagram by changing a key feature.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>New revelations in the sexual misconduct claims against the former CEO of Wynn Resorts.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with headlines now in New York -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Maria.  The \"Wall Street Journal\" is reporting that executives at Wynn Resort ignored allegations of sexual misconduct by Steve Wynn over more than a decade.  According to a regulator's report Wynn was accused of sexually assaulting or harassing salon workers, cocktail servers and flight attendants who worked for his company.</p><p>Under a proposed settlement, the Nevada Gaming Control Board won't try to revoke Wynn's regulatory licenses but Wynn is going to pay a fine.  Steve Wynn has denied any claims of misconduct.  There's a one year chart of Wynn's in front of you right there.</p><p>Well, Snapchat has named Lara Sweet as its interim CFO.  This is another shift in leadership at Snap as the company has lost several high profile employees over the last year.  Meanwhile Snap is reportedly considering allowing longer lasting or even permanent videos on Snapchat.  It will apply the Snap shared publicly on this story's features.  Snap is down 52 percent from one year ago.  There's that chart for you.</p><p>Well, Porsche is speeding past Tesla in a fast charging race.  The car maker says it new Porsche Taycan is going to be able to add more than 60 miles of charge in just four minutes.  That will be the fastest available today, exceeding Tesla's super charging stations which needs about 30 minutes to charge a vehicle's battery to at least 80 percent.  Charging times are a key selling point obviously for these car makers and now Porsche is giving Taycan owners three years of free charging.</p><p>And obviously we're going to be hearing from Tesla this week, Maria.  Earnings are coming out from Elon Musk and company.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Cheryl -- thank you so much.</p><p>Coming up next, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi challenged over her words describing a border wall as immoral.  We will break it down when we come back.</p><p>Then support on the links, fans rallying around a pro golfer whose two shot penalty was deemed unfair.  More on that.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Keeping America safe, the government is back open but the focus now is whether President Trump can make a deal with Democratic leadership on funding for the border wall.</p><p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has called it immoral, any wall is immoral.  But her home state of California protects the southern border in some places with an actual wall -- the wall separating Tijuana and San Diego.</p><p>Joining me right now is Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell.  And the last time you were on you said you wanted to look at this again.  Congresswoman -- it's good to see you.</p><p>REP. DEBBIE DINGELL (D), MICHIGAN:  It's good to see you.  Welcome to Washington.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.</p><p>What's your take on this?  I mean can Nancy Pelosi really get away with calling a wall immoral when she has a wall in her own state, separating Tijuana from San Diego?</p><p>DINGELL:  Here is what I think is going to happen.  You've got strong countries (ph), both sides of the aisle, both houses.  They're going to go into that room and they want to cut a deal that's going to keep our nation safe.  I don't think anybody wants to see what we just went through for 35 days.</p><p>It hurt the economy.  It hurt -- and I do believe -- this is going to sound corny but I don't -- you know, why do we point -- why do we need to have a Trump win, a Pelosi win.  We need an American win.</p><p>So I'm hoping they're going to go in that room.  I've talked to my colleagues on both sides.  I've talked to Roy Blunt.  I've talked to all my Democratic colleagues in the House.  They want to win.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DINGELL:  They want to go in and put together a package that's going to keep --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So how do you win?  What's the position in terms of wall funding?  Because they may very well -- your colleagues may very well come back and say ok, here's $5 billion towards border security, not a dime toward a wall.</p><p>DINGELL:  I don't know -- if people are really working together, that may not happen.  You know, there may be money, if there are appropriate places for a wall or fence or --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is there a movement within your party, do you think, among your colleagues that they feel that, yes, some money should go for an actual barrier?</p><p>DINGELL:  I think what I hear among my colleagues is let's go into a room and do something that makes sense.  Let's come up with -- we need to -- I've said this to you a million times.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DINGELL:  We need to strengthen our borders at both sides.  Everybody talks about the southern border.  I've got this northern border too which just had a huge human trafficking problem again in the last few --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But there are areas of the southern border that are very dense.  In other words like when you just look at the wall in Nancy's state and that is three million people on one side in Tijuana, three million people on the other side in San Diego.  If you tear that wall down -- I mean isn't it obvious many of the people on the Tijuana side will assimilate into the United States?</p><p>DINGELL:  Then let me ask you this question.  Build a wall, tear down a wall -- are there structures that are working that are in place?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  .</p><p>DINGELL:  So that's -- what I do think we need drones.  We need to fill the 3,000 open patrol --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's common ground, both sides believe in that.</p><p>DINGELL:  Both agree --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Technology and drones -- definitely.</p><p>DINGELL:  We need technology.  We need to make these ports safer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Specifically in a dense area, like Tijuana/San Diego, drones wouldn't work.  I mean maybe you want that in addition to a wall.  When you have such a dense area, where there's three million people on one side of the wall and three m million on the other, don't you need an actual barrier?</p><p>DINGELL:  But they are going to go in this room.  There are people that know what they're doing.  They're people -- they're senior people that have been on homeland security, people from the areas that are impacted --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think they're going to deal?  We won't shut down the government again?</p><p>DINGELL:  I pray to God, we never shut down the government.  Not only do I pray to God that doesn't come out of conference but you're going to see Republicans and Democrats working together.  We'll get --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This whole wall issue, Congresswoman, sort of underscores what's going on I think in both parties.  Now you've got former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz seeing an opening as a result of the radicalness on both sides.</p><p>He's facing backlash on his first stop for his book tour last night.  It was his first public appearance after announcing a possible Independent presidential run.  It did not go smoothly.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire (EXPLETIVE DELETED).  Go back to (INAUDIBLE) on Twitter.  Go back to Davos with the other billionaire elites who think they know how to run the world.  That's not what the country needs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  You know, I give you a lot of credit just being in politics, by the way.</p><p>Schultz is also being criticized by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, billionaire.  He tweeted this, \"In 2020 the great likelihood is that an Independent would just split the anti-Trump vote and end up reelecting the President.  That's a risk.  I refused to run in 2016 and we can't afford it right now.</p><p>Congresswoman -- do you think an Independent run is viable?  Do you think an Independent run from Schultz would hurt the Democrats?</p><p>DINGELL:  I think it's viable.  He has the money to spend it.  But I think he would hurt the Democrats.  I'm fearful that I am -- I'm trying to step back.  I'm not getting any candidate I want to see who is going to emerge, who's got people skills.</p><p>But this is dangerous.  And as you know, told you two years ago, Donald Trump could become president.  Nobody believed me.  You all thought I was crazy.  You may not have but most people did.</p><p>And I still think he could get reelected.  And if we do not run a strong campaign and we don't have somebody like that that pulls votes off --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  One of the issues is the messaging of what the platform is.  So what do you think the Democratic candidate for 2020 should have as their platform?  What's most important?</p><p>DINGELL:  You know what we didn't do and one of the reasons I believe firmly that President Trump became President Trump.  One, people are tired of partisan bickering.  They're tired of seeing things not get done in Washington.</p><p>There are a lot of people that are hurting in this country, just working men and women who want to know that we actually care about them.  They're scared about healthcare.  They're scared about escalating drug costs.  There's -- look at our --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So healthcare should be the platform?</p><p>DINGELL:  it's one piece of it.  Infrastructure, let's create jobs.  What are we going to do about education?  Trade?</p><p>Now, the President -- you want to know why he won Michigan?  Trade.  They're tired of bad trade deals that ship jobs overseas.  We don't have a level playing field.  The President's trade policy is all over the place.</p><p>It's not consistent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you going to vote for the ratification of USMCA?</p><p>DINGELL:  I don't call it USMC.  I call it NAFTA 2.0.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you going to vote for ratification.</p><p>DINGELL:  I haven't decided yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is on your plate now in the next month.</p><p>DINGELL:  Very much on my plate.  And talk to Lighthizer about it all the time.  But I'm not voting for any bill that doesn't have and acting legislation that keeps more manufacturing from going to Mexico.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wasn't that one of the key things of this new law?</p><p>DINGELL:  But Blazer still went to --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Keeping jobs here.</p><p>DINGELL:  Blazers went to Mexico in July.  I'm not seeing any more American cars go to Mexico and get built for $1.50 to $3.50 and then gets shipped back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you want a change before you vote for it?</p><p>DINGELL:  He knows how I feel.  I'm not -- one of the more likely people to vote for it but I'm not voting for it in the form that it's in right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.   We'll leave it there.</p><p>Congresswoman -- it's good to see you.</p><p>DINGELL:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.  Congresswoman Debbie Dingell joining us here.</p><p>Coming up, the longest government shutdown in American history is over.  But another shutdown threat is on the horizon.

The new teaser trailer for \"Toy Story 4\" drops with a big surprise.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Tuesday, January 29th.  Your top stories right now at 7:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Earnings season in full swing this morning for the fourth quarter.  Several Dow components reporting their fourth quarter this morning.  Verizon reported a mixed quarter earlier this hour.  Pfizer and 3M also under pressure this morning as you can see.  3M up three percent, although Pfizer and Verizon down better than one percent.</p><p>Rising tensions with China continuing, the U.S. bringing charges against Chinese telecom company Huawei as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning between the two nations.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will be joining me as my special guest this morning at the top of the hour, 8:00 a.m. Eastern.  Join us for that talk on China and the economy as we break it all down with the Treasury secretary.</p><p>Markets this morning are hovering around the flat line.  Take a look.  Dow Industrials up 20 points right now, 26 higher.  The S&amp;P 500 is down by almost one point and the NASDAQ down about three points.</p><p>All this after the major indices finished lower yesterday across the board at 04:00 on Wall Street.  Dow industrials were down 208 points and then actually was off of the lows of the -- of the day, down almost one percent at the close.  S&amp;P 500 gave up 21 points, that was three-quarters of one percent.  And the NASDAQ was down 79 points, better than one percent lower.</p><p>In Europe this morning, a mixed story, actually mostly higher.  FT-100 at the high of the morning right here, up 1-1/4 percent, 83 points higher, ahead of the British vote on the U.K. leaving the E.U.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is up 42 points, almost one percent higher and the DAX Index in Germany higher by 25, quarter of a percent higher there.</p><p>Asian markets mostly quiet overnight.  Take a look, as you can see, it was pretty much across the board.</p><p>$100,000 penalty, how one misstep cost a professional golfer big time.  The outcry, coming up.</p><p>And Woody and Buzz Lightyear are back, the new teaser trailer for \"Toy Story 4\" is out and it marks the return of one character after 20 years.  We will bring it to you.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning.  But first, our top story this half an hour, shutdown showdown, the government open for business again after the last -- at least for the next three weeks, rather.  But the main issue, funding the wall has not been resolved and the White House is not letting it go.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  What I do know is that if they don't come back with a deal, that means Democrats get virtually nothing.  That will make the president and force him to have to take executive action that does not give Democrats the things that they want.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is the House Minority leader, Congressman Kevin McCarthy.  Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you.</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  Thanks for having me back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So, what do the next three weeks look like?  Take us through these negotiating.  Do you expect any money for the wall?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  I expect us to solve this problem in the end.  What's interesting here is the whole time speaker Pelosi said I couldn't negotiate anything until you open up government.  The president put the public first and said OK, let's go through, I'll give you three weeks.</p><p>Now Wednesday, we'll have the conference committee, the senators and the congressional members' appropriation sit down and we'll see if they're serious about it, if they're willing to do something.  Because I believe Nancy Pelosi is out of step with her own party.  If you look at her number two, Steny Hoyer.  He said of course, that walls are not immoral, and that he believes some fencing involved.  From her Agricultural secretary to her Agricultural chair to our Armed Services chair, they both believe in a wall too.  Her Agriculture chairman said give Trump the money.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and she continues to say that it's immoral which I find incredible given the fact she has a wall in her own state.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  As my state too.  You know what I find --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And your state too, exactly.  California.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  You know what I find immoral?  When you really talk about this, this is about stopping human trafficking.  In 2016, they stopped more than 2,000 individuals involved in that.  I think it's immoral that you would allow that to continue.  I don't believe anybody in America that says they support border security believes that there is no such thing as some barrier.</p><p>And the president said, he does not a -- he does not want a wall from sea to shining sea.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  He just believes in the area you need some form of barrier and he's correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, where do you think are the most important areas that you would need the wall?  I mean, we talked earlier about this wall in your state, Tijuana, San Diego where it's very dense, three million people on one side, three million people on the other.  Can you make the case that that dense area is elsewhere where that's why the president is so stuck on having this wall there?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  And it's not the president saying, it's the experts.  The president sat down with the experts and they said this is what we need to be able to secure our border.</p><p>So in certain areas, like in San Diego, we stopped illegal movement by more than 95 percent.  You look at Yuma, Arizons, El Paso another -- El Paso became one of the safest cities in the nation after being able to put it through.  That's what we need, in certain parts of the country along the border, you need a barrier.  In other parts you could put the drones in this part area.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what are you expecting to give on?  And what -- do you think they're going to offer the $5.7 billion that the president wants for border security?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  But we're arguing over one-tenth of one percent of the budget.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a great point.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  The Democrats have voted for a wall before.  But now that the president brings forward what the experts want, they say no.  That is what's so confusing to me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, what -- why is this so important for the president right now?  Going into 2020, I mean, is she seeing this as a campaign promise and that's why he doesn't -- she won't agree to it.  Because I don't know how she can call it immoral, given the wall in her own state, your own state.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Again, it's such a little price to pay for so much more security when you look at the human trafficking.  Think of the number of lives that we will save from this process if we have a secure border.</p><p>But what's more importantly, it's the president that sat down and tried to be reasonable, find common ground.  He's the one who brought DACA into it.</p><p>And let's not forget, speaker Pelosi just a year ago holds the record for the longest speech on the floor, eight hours, over one issue, DACA, which she shut the government down over.  And now she thinks that's not important?  I think those people are important as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think that this -- a negotiation, an agreement will include a DACA deal?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  It could.  It doesn't have to.  But because the Democrats and speaker Pelosi have been saying no.  The president said he was willing to go there, three more years of DACA for a portion of the border security that the experts are asking for.  I just find her out of step with her own party.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, there seems to be a movement within the party, even some of the newer congress people coming in, fresher faces saying you know what, yes, we do need border security and we do need the money.  So, are they going head to head?  I mean, are they -- do they even have a voice?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  They don't even have a voice.  Because remember, she has so much power.  She will not allow the vote to come up.  I believe inside the conference we could come up with an agreement.  The question is, will speaker Pelosi even allow that to be voted on the floor?  If we had a vote on the floor, I believe it would pass.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think that the president will allow the government to shut down again?  I mean, is the president really prepared to have another government shutdown if he doesn't get the money?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Look, I think the president's going to try to find a way to solve this one way or another.  I don't know that shutting the government down solves it.  I there's other ways to do that the president can.  I know he firmly believes in a legislative process.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Should he call for a national emergency?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  He has the power to do that.  I think the best road forward right now is a legislative agreement.  And what's so interesting to me, I'd listened to these Democrats celebrate Nancy Pelosi.  You celebrated someone that got you status quo.  They're still a DACA problem, they're still a border security problem.</p><p>And government is designed to find common ground and compromise.  The president was the one person looking reasonable in all these discussions.  I know the president's committed to this.  He will get the border secure one way or another.  He's giving the Democrats an opportunity.  He gave them an opportunity all along this discussion.  They said then open up the government, they'll discuss it.  So he did that and gave them a three week time.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean, I think this whole thing, the government shutdown and the constant resist upsets people.  I mean, you have to wonder if in fact -- you know, she keeps resisting everything that the president wants, if the people will turn on her.  Because people want to see you guys get something done.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Yes, she is celebrating status quo.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  That's not where we need to be --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me move on and ask you about 2010, congressman.  Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz thinking about running for office.  He was at a book signing last night in New York and he was heckled over his bid.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump.  You egotistical billionaire (INAUDIBLE).  Go back to getting ratioed on Twitter.  Go back to Davos with the other billionaire elites who think they know how to run the world.  That's not what the country needs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This heckler not the only one weighing in.  Michael Bloomberg former mayor of New York City also told Schultz not to run as an independent.  He said this, given the strong pull of partisanship and the realities of the electoral college system, there's no way an independent can win.  That is truer today than ever before.  Is that where we are, an independent can't win, congressman?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  No, I think it's Bloomberg upset.  Because remember, he went from a Republican to an independent to a Democrat and he just spent $120 million giving to the Democrats so they can win the majority in the House and he doesn't want his money to be wasted, so he doesn't want competition.</p><p>Look, I think there's ample opportunity for an independent to get in this race, only because the Democrats are now become social Democrats.  They're talking about a 70 percent tax rate.  They're talking about these green deals.  They're talking about socialism.  If you listen to what some of these new Democrats say, they think Venezuela's problem is not because they're a socialist country, it's because of sanctions.  They're so out of step.  They are putting letters in to help those who want to go sign up for ISIS, to be easy on them to the judge.  I mean, I have -- this is not the America we live in, and that's the difference.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  This party is so out of step and I think you'll find a lot of moderate Democrats who say I want somebody else who could talk about this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, that's why a number of moderate Democrats can't really get the OK from the party leadership because they're not left enough.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  This new socialist Democrat Party has left the Democratic Party.  They are in to -- remember, Bernie Sanders is not registered as a Democrat.  He's registered as a socialist.  AOC does not call herself a Democrat, she calls herself a Democrat socialist.  This party is moving to a whole different place.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Real quick before you go, when the election happened back in November.  You said one of your priorities going to be to get the majority back.  How are you going to do it?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Well, first of all, you've got to make sure you can recruit.  I think, you put the ideas up there.  Ideas should win at the end of the day.  You look at where we are financially in this country.  A lot of that happens to do with the policies that we're able to create, from the tax policy, the battle we had with you human trafficking and other that we were able to do.

Congressman Kevin McCarthy, joining us there.</p><p>Still ahead, Richard Trumka AFL-CIO president on the impact of the shutdown on American workers, what he'd like to see, back in a moment with that.</p><p>And then, support on the links, a pro golfer given a big fine and a two-shot penalty which many are calling grossly unfair.  What went wrong, right here.</p><p>Plus, you've got a friend and a big surprise, the trailer for \"Toy Story 4\" drops with a character we haven't seen in 20 years.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Prosecutors resting their case against Joaquin El Chapo Guzman.  Cheryl Casone in New York with details and headlines, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It; must something else, Maria.  The federal government has now rested its case.  They called 56 witnesses.  The trial of the notorious Mexican drug kingpin started back in mid-November.  El Chapo told the trial judge yesterday he will not take the stand in his own defense.  One witness is scheduled to appear for the defense today.  Closing arguments expected to take place tomorrow and Thursday.  Big story, a lot of New Yorkers have been following very closely.</p><p>Well, professional golfer Haotong Li is getting a huge outpouring of support from fellow golfers after losing out on nearly $100,000 Saturday for a minor infraction.  It happened at the Omega Dubai Desert Classic.  Li was on the 18th green when judges accuses caddie of standing too close behind him as he got ready to putt.  Well, the ensuing penalty dropped Li's score from 71 to 73.  And he went from third to 12th.  Tour officials say the correct call was made but acknowledge it was grossly unfair.  They're looking at the giving referees more discretion in cases like this going forward.</p><p>And then, get ready for \"Toy Story 4\".  Pixar is putting out this teaser video, shows the revival of Woody's love interest, Bo Peep.  And she is back with a new, more modern look.  She was last seen in \"Toy Story 2\", back in 1999.  It is now 20 years later, \"Toy Story 4\" is going to be released, Maria, this June .  Those are your headlines from New York, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like it.  Bo Peep.  All right, thank you Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, the lingering effects of the shutdown showdown.  AFL-CIO Richard Trumka will join us to talk about the impact on American workers.  He's up next.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We are focused on the American worker this morning.  White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney saying that the 800,000 federal workers who were not paid twice during the partial government shutdown should receive those checks by the end of this week.</p><p>Joining us right now is American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organization's president, AFL-CIO, Richard Trumka.  It's great to see you, Richard.  Thank you so much for being here.</p><p>RICHARD TRUMKA, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR AND CONGRESS OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION:  Maria, thanks for having me on today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Give us your take on what the impact of the shutdown was.</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, I think there's several impacts.  There's impact on the people and you not only have government workers who get back pay but you have the government contractors who won't get back pay unless something is done.  That was a devastating effect on them.  It had a devastating effect on the economy itself.  $11 billion, although we'll pick some of that back up later in the year.</p><p>But you had a devastating effect on the airline industry where you had people, airline controllers, traffic controllers that were in school that actually just up and left.  They said we're not going to do this anymore (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What could -- what could have been done about it then, Rich?  Because you as the leader that you are and representing so many workers across the country have to be unnerved when you see open borders and illegals coming in and taking your jobs.</p><p>TRUMKA:  Look, that's just not how it works anymore.  I mean, you have people that got laid off from the president's place that have been here 20 years.  They're not taking anybody's job.  What we want to do is make sure every worker in this country has the same rights so that they can't be exploited.</p><p>Because what happens right now with undocumented workers is, they're great when no one's around.  When they try to organize and get a voice, then they start squeezing them.  They start ex -- you know, doing, calling in ICE and different things.</p><p>The idea is if everybody has the same rights, then they can't exploit those people and everybody can actually have a fair playing field.  What happens to American workers -- employers right now, is you have an employer that hires people, makes them work in unfair condition, misclassifies them, underpays them, and they're competing against our employer.  That employer needs to pay everybody the same rate, live by the same working conditions, so that we can all compete.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you're OK with illegals coming in and as long as everybody's treated the same?</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, Maria, it's a -- it's a nice cliche, illegals coming in.  But you know yourself that most people that are here undocumented or illegally came in legally.  So the whole system needs to be addressed.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, but there are apprehensions that we could look at, just in the month of December, just in the month of November, where apprehensions were of illegal immigrants coming in and wanting asylum in the United States.</p><p>TRUMKA:  There's no question that the system is broken.  We need to fix the system and have a path towards citizenship so that those workers that have been here for years and are actually making the economy run, even the president's golf courses and things like that, they have a chance to get citizenship and they work their work there.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Just a question on the golf courses.  As you know, that's the H2B program, people who come here as foreign workers, come under a specified amount of time for DOL.  I think the real question is is that, what happens to all the people, not who have been here who came legally and overstayed the visa, but what about all the people who come every day at the southern border and can cross into our country?  That's really the pernicious problem.  And even on wall, built with American workers, you'd be for that.</p><p>TRUMKA:  But listen, the people that come back and forth, you have Americans that go to Mexico and Mexicans that come to America to work.  I think Mexico --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you don't think there's a problem at the border at all?</p><p>TRUMKA:  I didn't say that.  There is -- there is a problem.  We do need border security.  And no, I don't think that a wall's the answer to it.  Every time someone's tried to build a wall it's not been very successful.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, the one in Tijuana is successful.</p><p>TRUMKA:  Ask the Chinese, ask the French.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The wall -- the wall in Tijuana --</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Ask Tijuana (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tijuana and San Diego, what abut that Richard?</p><p>TRUMKA:  I'm sorry?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The wall, between Tijuana -- separating Tijuana from San Diego, is that successful?</p><p>TRUMKA:  There are places -- there are places probably where it works.  Is that the answer to everything?  No.  Should that have been the reason for a shutdown?  Absolutely not.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  I want -- I want to ask a broader political question.  We've seen in the last two elections that increasingly voters, blue collar voters, voters in manufacturing towns all over America, the kind of rank and file people that you represent are voting for Republicans, they're going for Trump.  Does the AFL-CIO need to realign its own approach to politics in this town, given that more and more of its people are going with people like Donald Trump and his trade policies and the Republican Party?</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, that's a -- that's a question we could talk about two or three hours for.  First of all, we have realigned our politics.  We are issuing -- we're issue oriented right now.  We put an issue out and if a politician supports that issue, then we support them.</p><p>In fact, in this last election we elected two union members to the Senate, three to governorship, 18 to the House of Representative, and 925 to state legislatures, because those workers will go and support our issues.  That's what we try to do.  We find it more and more difficult to find Republicans that actually support us.  Now, the American worker believes that neither the political system --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got to jump.</p><p>TRUMKA:  -- or the economic system works for them.  They want somebody to change the rules.  That's why they voted for Trump.  If he changes the rules to their advantage, some of them will vote for him again.  If he doesn't, he stands a chance of losing those workers and right now he's losing those workers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Richard, thank you so much for joining us.  We appreciate it.  Richard Trumka there.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Show: MORNINGS WITH MARIA][Date: January 29, 2019][Time: 08:00:00][Tran: 012903cb.231][Type: SHOW][Head: Apple Disables Group FaceTime Function That Was Allowing Callers To Listen And View Without Your Consent; British Parliament To Vote On Brexit Amendments; Kudlow on the Economy; Craft Brewers Impacts from the Government Shutdown; Kudlow on China Trade][Sect: News; Domestic][Byline: Maria Bartiromo, Gerri Willis, Ashley Webster, Hillary Vaughn, Dagen McDowell][Guest: Steven Mnuchin, Larry Kudlow, Matt Schlapp, Jon Hilsenrath][Spec: FaceTime; Huawei; Apple; Brexit; Federal Reserve; 3M; Harley-Davidson; Verizon; Oath Media; Channel Inventory; World War II; CBO; Trade Talks; Deregulations; Tax Plan; China Trade; Slowdown; Government Shutdown]</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good Tuesday morning.  Welcome back, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  Live from Washington this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is January 29th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  Earnings in focus.  Investors watching results from several Dow components this morning ahead of the opening bell.  One to watch after the bell tonight -- after the close is Apple.</p><p>Meanwhile, Apple under fire FaceTime hit with a new bug that allows people to eavesdrop on you without your knowledge and even if you don't take the call.  Rising tensions with China, the U.S. brings charges against Chinese telecom company, Huawei as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  The very latest on the state of negotiations with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin coming up.</p><p>Markets are searching for direction this morning.  Take a look at the futures ahead of the open this morning.  Dow industrials picking up speed up 55 points right now, a quarter of a percent higher.  S&amp;P 500 is up two and the NASDAQ right now right now showing a gain of 11 points at the open in about an hour and a half.  This after declines across the board yesterday.  Stocks finished off of the lows, but nonetheless the Dow Industrials gave up 209 points yesterday 4:00, almost one percent lower.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 gave up 21 points, three quarters of a percent lower.  And the NASDAQ was down 79 points.  That was better than one percent lower yesterday.  Global markets this morning are mostly higher.  Take a look at European indices with the FT-100-is at the high of the morning, up 86 points, 1-1/4 percent ahead of the vote on Brexit.  CAC quarante in Paris us up 44 points and the DAX index up 21, fractional gain there.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets were little changed.  Take a look, it was pretty much across the board.  Now, our top story this morning, concerns of a global slowdown.  Last week in Davos I spoke with Bridgewater Associates founder, Ray Dalio, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, and Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey.  Here's what they said about the possibility of an economic slowdown on the horizon.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RAY DALIO, FOUNDER, BRIDGEWATER ASSOCIATES:  Europe has a negative growth and the United States is going to have a negative growth environment.  I don't mean absolute negative, I mean slowing of growth in a material way that could be close to between zero and two percent over the next 18 months.</p><p>BRIAN MOYNIHAN, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, BANK OF AMERICA:  We have the top research firm in the world, and they have done a great job.  And they have the U.S. growing at 2-1/2 percent this year.  The world growing 3-1/2 percent GDP growth.  But that's down from last year.  And so the confusion in the environment right now is a slowdown or is it going in to a recession?</p><p>Nothing we see says it's close to a recession.</p><p>JAMES QUINCEY, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, COCA-COLA:  I think we are in danger of talking ourselves into a problem.  It's just a little bit slower growth.  It's not a recession or a decline.  So we see -- we see a little -- a little softer 2019, maybe a little less tail wind than 2018.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now in a Fox Business exclusive is the treasury secretary of the United States, Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  Great to see you, Secretary.</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, UNITED STATES TREASURY SECRETARY:  Great to see you as well, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.  Your reaction to really what seems like now a unanimous feeling that a slowdown is on the horizon.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, Maria, from everything we see, the U.S. economy is still quite strong.  The companies are doing quite well.  And we see still tremendous investment in capital and human investments.  There's no question that as it relates to Europe and China, there is a slowdown.  We're monitoring that carefully.  But we still see a tremendous opportunity and a lot of capital coming into the U.S.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Federal Reserve basically told us they are on pause.  They may even pause the balance sheet unwind which is also telling us that the Fed is also expecting a slowdown, but do you believe a recession is on the horizon in 2020 even though you're seeing strength and stability so far?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  We see no indications whatsoever of a recession on the horizon.  And from everything we see from speaking to a large across the board businesses, the combination of tax reform, regulatory relief and trade is still has a very strong impact on the U.S. economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And some people are saying that the impact of certainly of trade and tariffs is causing some uncertainty.  So how much of this slowdown that we're expecting later on even if it's not right now is due to what you say you're watching China and Europe and how much of it is uncertainty around the President's tariffs program?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, Maria, as you said, there are people who expect a slowdown but I would just comment a year ago with the projections were 2-1/2 percent.  And we were at three.  We feel very comfortable we're going to hit three for last year.  And we think there's still a very good case for three percent this year.  Now, as it relates to trade, we couldn't be more pleased with the USMCA.  We are looking forward to Congress passing that quickly.</p><p>That's a very important trade deal.  We have two days of talks with China starting tomorrow.  The President is going to be involved in those talks at the conclusion.  We've been updating him.  We have another 30 days after this.  So I think we're making significant progress, and I think on the trade front, these are all very positive impacts for the U.S. economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about the trade talks because this story of China, first off, thank you to the President and to the administration for pushing back on China because that's another unanimous feeling out there, that the President did the right thing in terms of stopping China from some of its practices.  What are you expecting out of these talks?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, the President wants fair trade with China.  It's got to be reciprocal.  Right now China has free access into our markets, and we have limited access to there.  So the critical issue that we've talked about is market access, making sure there aren't forced joint ventures, not forced transfer of technology and that we have a mechanism that when we reach an agreement that we can monitor that agreement and that they'll live up to it.</p><p>And that's how I expect we will make significant progress this week on those issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How much of a priority is espionage?  Obviously the administration unveiling a sweeping set of criminal charges against Huawei Technologies.  We have had on a number of CEOs that have said yes, they have stolen trade secrets from us.  Has this come into the conversation with your Chinese leadership?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  No, let me be clear.  Those are separate issues.  And that's a separate dialogue.  So as it relates to the Huawei issues that's being run by the Justice Department.  I have no involvement in that.  I found out about that yesterday when it was announced.  So those are not part of trade discussions.  Forced technology issues are part of trade discussions but any issues as it relates to violation of U.S. law or U.S. sanctions are going through a separate track, which is the Justice Department.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, I guess the broader issue is, is this a cultural thing in China?  I mean this weekend on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" over on Fox News I spoke with the ranking member of the Intel Committee, House Intel Committee Devin Nunes and he went through some of the practices that China does every day.  Listen to this.  I've got to get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  China might have accessed allied intelligence shared with Poland and passed it on to Moscow.</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R), CALIFORNIA:  What the Chinese are doing is that they have these companies that are essentially owned by the party, the Communist Party and essentially this is a dictatorship.  There's very few people that own these companies.  They weaponize the.  So when all over the -- all over the world you have Chinese technology specifically as it relates to infrastructure on -- communications infrastructure, they will go in and they beat every other company around the world.</p><p>And in fact, they've driven a lot of companies out of business because they come in undercut.  They want to have control over all the com systems or communication systems all over the globe.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's pretty incredible.  We will handle your infrastructure of telecom and then they have a way in of spying.  How can you separate that from the conversation on trade and on forced transfer of technology?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Maria, I think you can easily separate these issues.  So there are two different issues.  One is an issue of state subsidies where they do subsidize state enterprises and they compete unfairly.  Those are trade issues, those are violations of the WTO and that's something from an economic standpoint.  We are going to enforce very seriously.  I think you know among the National Security Council, so I'm going to be careful what I say on national security issues.</p><p>But I assure you whether it's China or anywhere else in the world, our security services, DHS and others will make sure that we protect the U.S. infrastructure, we protect from cyberattacks.  That's something we're very well aware of.  But these are separate issues and shouldn't be confused.  We are focused on what are unfair economic practices.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So the best case that you can get from China is what?  Opening up their markets?  Already we are seeing some likelihood of that, UBS I guess was the first bank that was allowed to operate in China and own 51 percent of that bank.  They say they're going to go to 100 percent in three years.  Are you seeing a significant opening in terms of the Chinese willingness to open their markets to foreigners?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I do, but I think that's a good start.  But why should we have to wait three years for a U.S. company to own 100 percent in the financial services?  China can operate and own 100 percent of companies here.  So that's an example where, you know, they're moving in the right direction.  We want to speed that up.  But the issue is really we want to make sure that U.S. companies can compete fairly in China.</p><p>And if we can do that, China has a very large growing middle class.  It's an enormous market.  As I have said before, this is one of the biggest opportunities for U.S. companies in U.S. business if we can get this right.  And President Trump is determined.  This is the first administration that has aggressively said to China, you need to play fair.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is the President willing to drop all tariffs, should he get a good deal that's acceptable?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I think everything is on the table.  So the President is -- will look at, again, the objective is to have a very fair deal.  Hopefully we'll make progress this week.  The President will be involved in these negotiations and discussions.  And we've still got a lot of work to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the President said look, I'm a tariff guy.  I like tariffs.  So does that mean these tariffs are for, you know, no end in sight or would he be willing to drop the tariffs all together?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  The President hasn't made any decisions on that.  There have been no recommendations from the economic team on that yet.  The first step is to make sure we get a good agreement.  And when we get a good agreement, we'll make a recommendation to the President and he will consider that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have seen the Chinese economy get impacted.  You're still talking about 6.4 percent growth, we think, but that is lower than some people think.  What's your worry or how concerning is it that the Chinese slowdown will impact the United States?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, there's no question that China is slowing down.  They still have significant growth rates.  We're beginning to see the impact on that on world growth.  Our objective is not to slow down China.  Our objective is to make sure that U.S. companies can do business in China and can do business fairly.  So we're monitoring these issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary, stay with us.  We want to get into the shutdown and get your impact on how much the shutdown cost the economy and what you're expecting there.  Stay with us.  More of my exclusive interview with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin when we come right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are life live this morning in Washington, D.C.  And I'm sitting right now with -- in a Fox Business exclusive with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  And Treasury Mnuchin, we were talking about the broad economy.  I want to ask your thoughts on the shutdown.  The CBO says that the shutdown caused $11 billion impact to the economy, $3 billion which is completely lost because of the 35-day shutdown.  Your reaction?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Maria, Kevin Hassett, the CEA is working on final numbers for us.  I think his view is that there's no question that there was some cost but those costs will be recovered as money comes back into the system.  I think it's -- he views that it will almost all be recovered.  Now as it relates to the exact numbers, I haven't seen the final numbers yet.  But the good news is we got the government open.</p><p>People are back to work and we have not seen any significant impact on the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Has -- is the President prepared to shut down the government again in three weeks if he doesn't get the money for the border wall?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Maria, I had dinner last night with the President, the Vice President, Senator Lindsey Graham.  We had a very good discussion on this issue.  There's no question in my mind that the President, the Vice President want to do a fair deal.  Lindsey has been terrific in helping to negotiate this.  I hope the Democrats are sincere.  If they are, there's a sincere deal that will include a lot of different issues that need to be resolved.</p><p>But if they're not sincere, the President has all his options on the table.  And he's determined that he's going to make sure we have border security.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's the impact on the IRS?  There's a lot of worry out there that people are not going to get their checks after April 15th as a result of this shutdown.  What can we expect?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, let me just comment on both the treasury, our bureaus, the IRS in particular, I want to thank the enormous number of government employees who came in and worked during the shutdown.  I think as you know, we had the ability to bring in critical employees.  We never would have been able to do the sanctions that we've been doing over the last month without the hardworking people.</p><p>And the IRS had a large number of critical employees to make sure that we were ready to open for business as usual.  So we're ready to open for tax season.  We're taking tax returns.  We'll be ready for tax refunds.  We will have the phones restaffed.  Now, let me just say that there's no question, this time of the year, there's very, very heavy call volume.  That's something we have to manage.  I encourage taxpayers who have questions to try to go to the web first.</p><p>But we are ready for tax season, and I can assure you that tax refunds will be paid as normal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  So, tax refunds will be paid as normal.  That's the bottom line.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  People were worried about that.  Let me move to the sanctions and in particular Venezuela because you've applied sanctions on the Venezuelan oil industry.  Tell us specifically what the impact here is.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, sanctions are a very important tool in our national security portfolio.  And when we look at national security issues, we look at economic tools.  We look at diplomacy.  We look at national security tools, military options.  So there's no question that what we're trying to do is to cut off the money to the regime that should not be in power and make sure that the President Guaido has access to funds and has access to the assets of the country.</p><p>And to make sure we protect these assets for the people of Venezuela.  It's really quite sad.  This is a country that is very, very rich in oil resources that has had extraordinary poverty and extraordinary humanitarian issues over the last issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And have you spoken with the opposition leader party about this?  What has been the response so far?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I haven't personally, but I know the Vice President has been in communication.  I think the response has been very positive.  We've been very careful in balancing this.  We've -- I've spoken to many of the refineries over the last week.  I want to make sure that there was significant capacity.  There's a lot of oil on the water already in transit to the U.S. refineries.  So I think on the one hand, we've been able to cut off Venezuelan oil going forward.</p><p>But we're managing this with the U.S. refineries.  We've issued licenses for the U.S. refineries to continue to operate.  And if Venezuela wants to continue to sell us oil, which we would like to buy that money would go into blocked accounts and will be protected for the people of Venezuela.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what about other industries in Venezuela?  I mean, the sanctions are on the oil industry.  What about other money, other imports that they still get that?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  We will always look at additional sanctions.  We want to make sure that things like medicine and other humanitarian issues continue to go to the people.  We will always look at additional sanctions to make sure we protect the assets of the country for the people of Venezuela.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why was it important for the President to back the opposition leader?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I think he is the rightful leader of the country, the national assembly, the constitution.  I think, you know, democracy is very important to the people of the United States.  And we want to make sure that there are free and fair elections and that there is a proper democracy that's very important to the national security of the United States.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary, it's good to have you on the program.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you very much.  Secretary Steven Mnuchin joining us.  Coming up, earnings in focus.  Major companies reporting this week including Apple after the bell tonight.  What you need to know ahead of those numbers.

The company says they are checking it.  But you should know that Tim Cook on Monday, well, he was saying big things about International Data Privacy Day asking users to insist on reforms.  Oops, I guess they got a problem.  Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Gerri.  Thanks very much.  Gerri Willis on Wall Street.  British lawmakers will debate several amendments to the U.K.'s planned exit from the European Union today and let Prime Minister Theresa May know what parliament is prepared to vote for.  Ashley Webster is live in London right now with that.  Ashley?</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.  Good morning, Maria.  This is if Parliament knows exactly what it will vote for.  There will be at least 15 amendments to choose from -- will be debated.  That will be up to the Common Speaker John Bercow.  He will decide which ones will be debated.  And it could indeed shape the future of what Brexit will look like moving forward.</p><p>Now, among the most popular amendments that we are expecting to be the debated will be what's called the Cooper amendment, that's Yvette Cooper, the Labour M.P.  It basically says if no deal is reached by February the 26th, it would postpone Brexit for nine months essentially to end of the year from march 29th, that's the date that exists now.  Then there's the Brady amendment, the Graham Brady (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>He basically is putting forward an amendment that would replace the Irish backstop with what is called alternative arrangements, such pretty vague, basically anything elsewhere and what we have now and there is no time limit on that backstop.  We have heard that Prime Minister Theresa May has already told European leaders that she wants to reopen Brexit negotiations.  Let's not forget, just last month, in December, the Prime Minister said it wasn't going to be reopened that the E.U had given her their best deal.</p><p>Now she wants to turn around and say look, you need to reopen negotiations.  I'm going to find out from Parliament what they are prepared to vote for and let's go from there.  And it calls today is January 29th.  The Brexit deadline, March 29th.  We have exactly two months left to go, Maria.  And let's be honest, there is no sign yet of a -- of a deal in place that a majority of people in Parliament can get behind.</p><p>Yesterday we had a whole series of warnings about what would happen if there was a no deal scenario.  Just crashing out retail consortiums saying, look, there's going to be empty shelves, prices are going to go up, a break in the supply chain.  It will be very, very detrimental to the British economy.  So that is the background.  Later on today, we'll find out what Parliament can get behind.  Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Ashley.  Thanks so much.  We'll check back with you.  Ashley Webster in London this morning.  Coming up.  The shutdown impact on your wallet.  I will be speaking with National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow on the economic effects of the shutdown.  Plus Federal debt reportedly headed to the highest level since World War II.</p><p>That is next.  One brewery feeling the impact.  The shutdown hitting one San Diego beer company.  We've got that story.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thank so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo coming to you live this morning from Washington, D.C.  It is Tuesday, January 29th.  Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Earnings season in full swing.  We have heard from Harley-Davidson, hit in the pre-markets after disappointing numbers.  Xerox as well headed higher after beating expectations.  Look at Harley-Davidson's shares down almost 10 percent right now.  China, one of the issues, once again.  Meanwhile rising tensions with China on the U.S. level.  The U.S. bringing charges against Chinese telecom company, Huawei, as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  Moments ago, I spoke with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin who talked about what the U.S. is looking for in the coming talks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MNUCHIN:  The President wants fair trade with China.  It's got to be reciprocal.  Right now, China has free access into our markets and we have limited access to there.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Futures this morning are higher.  Take a look, we have the highs of the morning right here with the Dow Jones Industrial average up 73 points, a third of a percent.  The S&amp;P 500 up 4-1/2, and the NASDAQ higher by 18 points, one-quarter of one percent.  European indices this morning are also higher.  Take a look.  FT-100 in London is up almost 100 points, 1-1/2 percent.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is up 55, better than one percent.  And the DAX Index in Germany up 37 points, that's one-third of one percent.  Asian markets mostly flat overnight as you'll see that was pretty much across the board with Japan and Korea squeaking out a fractional gain.</p><p>Our top story this half an hour, the cost of the government shutdown.  The CBO says about $3 billion out of 2019's projected GDP was completely lost due to the shutdown.  Joining me right now in a FOX Business exclusive is National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow.  Larry, it's great to see you this morning.</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for being here.  So obviously 35 days, government shutdown, CBO says $3 billion is lost.  Never coming back.  Your reaction.</p><p>KUDLOW:  With respect, once again, we disagree with the CBO.  I don't think we're going to lose anything.  This is completely temporary.  None of the incentives in the economy have been changed by this.  You know, that's the key point.  President Trump lowered marginal tax rates on individuals and most especially businesses.  And then he had this massive sweeping rollback of costly and burden regulations, which freed up the whole economy, including the energy sector, which has turned out to be a boom.  Why would we lose something just because of a temporary issue regarding the government?  Now, I'm always interested in sort of counting angels on the head of a pin.  We have about a $20 trillion economy, fair?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  There -- what was their number, three billion out of 20 trillion?  Do you know what the --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Three billion.  Yes, no, you're right.  You're right.</p><p>KUDLOW:  - percentage that is?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I totally understand.</p><p>KUDLOW:  I don't understand why we even mess with it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Actually, they're saying the total impact was $8-11 billion.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But that will come back, except for the $3 billion they say that is completely lost.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, again, with all due respect to the professionals at the CBO, I disagree.  Again, because the incentives in the economy -- here's the big difference between I guess the administration and the Congressional Budget Office and a lot of other forecasters.  We believe the economy is growing at three percent plus.  By the way, the Commerce Department for 2018 has scored I believe 3.1 percent.  We'll get the rest of those numbers in a week or two.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KUDLOW:  The CBO does not.  They never have.  They've never given us credit for the incentive effect of lowering taxes and regulations.  Supply side incentives are kicking in.  If you look at the whole panoply all of the economic data, whether it's very strong Christmas retail sales, whether it's industrial production, manufacturing, the best since the '80s, whether it's business equipment, which means the capex boom is happening that we always hoped for.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KUDLOW:  You'll see in my judgment, at least, the three percent trend line will continue.  CBO and many others have us at two.  But this goes back before the President.  This goes back way before.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  They don't believe the economy can grow.  They don't give any credit --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, even somebody like a Steve Schwarzman will say 4.2 percent growth in the second quarter is very hard to sustain on a $20 trillion economy.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, I'll keep working on Steve Schwarzman.  He's a good guy.  But in a $20 trillion economy, which again will grow rapidly, I see no reason why we can't continue three percent plus.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That's the whole point.  The idea that was sold to everybody I guess going back several years, maybe going back 10 or 15 years, that we're in some secular stagnation is just plain wrong.  With the right set of policies, to unleash --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- American animal spirit --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we saw that with the tax plan and the deregulation.  I totally get that.</p><p>KUDLOW:  And you look at the --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But what about tariffs and trade, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  The -- just one --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because the CBO'S report also brings that up.</p><p>KUDLOW:  One last one on this, the face of the new Trump economy -- I just want to put this in here, it's the thought I've had for quite a while.  These are men and women running small businesses.  These are blue-collar workers.  You look at the evidence, the employment for blue-collar workers, the best increase since the mid to late '80s, when I was a Reagan Cub Scout here in Washington, D.C.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  The wage rates of blue-collar manufacturing autos, they're rising faster than white-collar workers.  This is a direct result --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- of the incentives we've put into the economy.  CBO, again, it's not personal to my friends at the CBO, they don't give us any credit for these incentives.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No, I understand that.  But the --</p><p>KUDLOW:  And I want to stay with that story.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- the report on the trade policies estimated that new tariffs on imports and exports will cut an average of one-tenth of a percent from economic growth through 2029.  What's your take on that, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because we know that these tariffs are in place.  They still are impacting business and uncertainties.  So, is the President prepared to do away with all tariffs if he gets that agreement from the other side?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, I don't want to go there.  I mean, that's going to be his decision as you know.  Vice Premier Liu He is coming and we will have high level discussions Wednesday and Thursday and we're all looking forward to that, as is the President.  The President, as I read him, moderately optimistic about this trade story.  So, that's good.  What was it, one-tenth of one percent by 2029?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  So then here we are in 2019, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, no.  One-tenth of a percent from economic growth through 2029.</p><p>KUDLOW:  See, this is too hard, Maria.  It's way too hard --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- to figure that stuff out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you don't think there's going to be any -- there's --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Could it be possible that there's no impact from the shutdown?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Yes, quite possible.  I never -- it's utterly totally temporary.  So, that's -- let me --- look, let me go back -- the growth potential from China trade, people tend to look at this as a negative.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Look, I don't know the outcome of these talks.  Here's what I know, the scope of the discussion will be the broadest and deepest in the history of U.S.-China trade.  Literally everything's on the table.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Point number one.  Point number two, if China opens its markets --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is a big deal.</p><p>KUDLOW:  OK?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it looks like there's (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>KUDLOW:  Which is huge.  You know, I don't want to predict, and as Ambassador Lighthizer said a million times, and I agree, the enforcement mechanisms are going to be crucial.  But if they were to open their markets as we have requested regarding tariffs and non-tariffs, if they would let American companies own the subsidiary in China, so there's no forced transfer of the family jewels of technology, if we have --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But it --</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- some rule of law regarding I.P. theft, here's my point, open markets will allow the United States to export like crazy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But I understand that, Larry.</p><p>KUDLOW:  And that has been hand -- we've been handcuffed.  If we do that, if we do that, not only will the United States grow faster --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- because of that, China will grow faster.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That all sounds great, but can you actually do that, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Competition is the solution.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's the point, because if you're saying, \"OK, China, we are agreeing that you are opening your markets, and as a result, we will meet your demands, but then they say okay, but you have to have a communist, a government leader on the board of any company that has 100 percent.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Which is -- which is extraordinary, you're absolutely right.  It's extraordinary.  And it's --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So I mean -- so you could say it's great --</p><p>KUDLOW:  And unacceptable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- that you're going to open markets.</p><p>KUDLOW:  It's unacceptable.  It's unacceptable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But they -- aren't they saying that a communist has to be on the board of any company that has 100 percent?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I think that's been the past and I think that's going to be a very hot topic in these trade talks because that is completely unacceptable to us.  No question about it.  We will see how this turns out.  China, unfortunately, you know, they're in a slump.  China's economy is slumping very bad.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  I think part of that slump is a function of the President's tough negotiating with tariffs, when necessary, OK, part of that slump is in the last five to ten years.  China has moved in the wrong direction, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  The market-based reforms have been moving in their own direction.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But they're not market-based.  They are communists and they want communists on the board of -- So I'm just wondering, all of this sounds great, if you can actually get it done.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Oh, I know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Larry, stay with us.  We want to talk to you about other things because the tax plan and the deregulations have worked.  But there are some other ideas coming into play ahead of 2020.</p><p>KUDLOW:  China should not use the Venezuelan form of the economic policy.  We need to go back to who is it that said free market capitalism is the best path to prosperity?  It was the (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, that would -- that would be you and Ronald Reagan.  Stay with us.  We will be right back.  More with Larry Kudlow.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Thank you.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We come to you live this morning from Washington, D.C. and I am sitting with National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow, in an exclusive interview this morning.  And we were talking about China and what you can get done.  How important is tomorrow and Thursday in terms of meeting a deadline, that March 1st, in terms of a deal on the table?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I think's very important.  Look, I --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think you'll get a deal by March 1?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I don't want to predict.  It's just too hard to predict.  And, of course, these are decisions that will be made by the President, who is his own best negotiator.  Best I can is, as I said, the scope of this thing's going to as wide and broad as anything we have ever seen.  That does not ensure positive negotiator.  Best I can is, as I said, the scope of this thing is going to be as wide and broad as anything we've ever seen.  That does not ensure positive outcomes --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- right?  I think everybody, including the President, is basically moderately optimistic about this, OK?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Wait, let me ask you, your tax plan --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Ultimately -- one other thought which the President believes that he and President Xi will probably be the ultimate negotiators.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  OK?  And the work being done tomorrow and Thursday is vitally important to lay out options, OK?  But --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So the President will be involved in these talks tomorrow and Thursday?</p><p>KUDLOW:  That is what he has been saying in our meetings.  And I hope so because he's a great negotiator.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me move on to the tax plan.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because we're hearing a lot of ideas in terms of taxes now, now with a lot of 2020 hopefuls.  The Tax and Jobs Act obviously did move the needle on economic growth along with the deregulation out of this administration.  Now you've got Elizabeth Warren talking about two to three percent tax on the very high wealth people.  So if you have $50 million in wealth, you'll get two percent tax.  If you've got a billion dollars in assets, you'll get taxed three percent.  And you've got Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez talking about tax of 70 percent tax --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- on the highest earners.  What is your take on this?  Give us your reaction and what kind of an impact those policies might have.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Right.  These are prosperity killers, these are growth killers, these are job killers, these are incentive killers.  This is a return to some heavy government planning essentially direct to the economy.  You know, I hate to dwell on this because it's a crisis right now, but take a look at Venezuela, just for the heck of it.  What (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There was a time when that was vibrant -- it was a vibrate country.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That is correct.  That is correct.  And investment was flocking to it.  Then they took, down through the years, really exact measures you're describing that are coming from some of these Democratic candidates --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- and the economy was destroyed.  I mean I hear this notion we have to have equality, equality of income, equality of results, which I think runs counter to all human nature.  You know what?  A place like Venezuela has equality.  Everybody's poor.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think they'll be able to reverse the tax cuts then?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Everybody's poor in Venezuela, except for a hand -- Maduro and a handful of this top military people.  Is that what we want in America?  We are growing right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So will the Dems be able to reverse your tax cut plans?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Never.  Never, not until the President's configuration.  I -- look, first of all, if they want to try to raise taxes, it will be defeated in the Senate, Republican.  I personally believe even if it went beyond that --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- the President would veto any efforts to turn back his program.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How important --</p><p>KUDLOW:  We're doing what people said we couldn't do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But how important is debt?</p><p>KUDLOW:  They said we couldn't grow at three, four percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But how important is debt, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  We're growing at three, four percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Let's not mess with it.  If it ain't broke, don't fix it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Congressional Budget --</p><p>KUDLOW:  There's a tremendous surge in prosperity here shared by the middle and lower middle income people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Congressional Budget Office is saying that the deficit is hit -- set to hit $897 billion this year.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That would be the highest level since World War II.  When does debt become a priority?  Do you think the President, let's say he does have another term, will try to attack the entitlements?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, look, I think right now the two issues are maintaining economic growth.  You know, growth is the single biggest factor in these budget calculations.  Growth brings income and revenues.  And in fact I haven't gone through it with a fine-toothed comb yet, but I will.  I think I see that the CBO is acknowledging that our faster growth, which they did not predict, is now paying for over 80 percent of the tax cuts.  OK?  And I think you'll see more about that as we get through.  The reports just came out yesterday.</p><p>Second point I want to make is we will have a tough spending budget coming up in a few weeks, a very tough spending budget with reductions of at least five percent across the board, in non-defense accounts.  So I think that's going to be very important.  Let's minimize government where possible.  Let's grow the economy to its max.  And you will see the debt burden, which I thought debt, as a share of GDP, will be coming down, and by the way, it already is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  OK.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That's what happened during the Reagan years.  That's what happened during the John F. Kennedy years.  So, I wrote about it in my book.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That -- that's the best way to measure that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But, Larry, you know what I don't understand?  I mean you're all about growth, you have been for all your entire career.  Why are so many people worried about the slowdown?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why are we hearing some people say a recession is on the horizon?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, there's just -- it's funny in this town and I guess a little bit in New York, this is a lot of pessimism.  I don't --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you expect a recession this year or 2020?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I do not.  I don't see it right now.  If I look at financial indicators, credit spreads, the actual numbers, you know, it's just -- we -- GDP will come out a week late because the Commerce Department has reopened.  We've seen stuff like falling unemployment claims, rising manufacturing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But what are the markets telling us, Larry?  In the month of December, there was no high-yield debt issuance at all.  Credit markets are still tight.</p><p>KUDLOW:  They've come back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They've come back a bit.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Come back.  I like that.  Profits, the mother's milk of stocks, I don't know who first that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You did.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Profits, the mother's milk of stocks are rising.  The early indications are they won't to 25 percent but they're going to rise 10, to 15 percent.  I like that a lot.  Interest rates, the level of rates, are historically low.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you're not worried about market volatility?</p><p>KUDLOW:  There's a million things to worry about when I get up in the morning, you know, mainly getting here on time so I could do this great interview.  But I just want to say, if you look at the sum total of all the evidence right now, there's no recession out there.  I am the happy warrior.  I am an optimist.  President Trump is an optimist.  I think America, right now, we are the hottest economy in the world and we should remain so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll end it there.  Larry Kudlow.  Good to see you, sir.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow.  Back in a moment.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The government shutdown may be over, but the effects are still being felt.  Hillary Vaughn is live this morning at a craft brewery in Escondido, California where the shutdown effects are actually still lingering.  Hillary.</p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Hi, Maria.  Good morning.  Craft beer is a $76.2 billion industry, and for many craft breweries, like Stone Brewery, where we are today, the effects of the government shutdown are not over.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOMINIC ENGELS, CEO, STONE BREWING:  When the industry craft is built on seasonal beers, it's built on new beers, it's the new sexy thing, and if we can't get the new sexy thing to market, then we're not going to connect with our fans.  They're going to be disappointed.  We're going to make the sales numbers we planned to make in our financial plans, and these things will have repercussions.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUGHN:  As Federal workers at the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau are finally back in the office, a mountain of paperwork is waiting, about 11,000 applications for alcohol labels have been backlogged leaving craft breweries waiting to ship and sell all their new beer across state line, which means they're in limbo until these approvals go through.  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Hillary.  Thanks very much.  We've be watching that.  Hillary Vaughn.  Stay with us.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  President Trump is tweeting this morning.  He's talking about a former staffer.  Here's what he just said.  \"A low level staffer that I hardly knew named Cliff Sims wrote yet another boring book based on made up stories in fiction.  He pretended to be an insider when, in fact, he was nothing more than a gofer.  He signed a non-disclosure agreement.  He is a mess.  Dagen McDowell, great to see you this morning thank you so much.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  John Hilsenrath, Matt Schlapp.  I don't know why the President tweets this.  He's got how many million view, you know, users and followers.  He just let everybody know who this guy is like --</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, THE AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Well, he literally sat in a -- he sat in a cubicle outside my wife's office in the West Wing, and so it is kind of amazing like this insider whole kind of mythology is something the President knows is not true.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  But he's got some extra sales thanks to that tweet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.

Good morning, everyone, I'm Maria Bartiromo, thanks for joining us live this morning from Washington.  It is Tuesday, January 29th, your top stories right now 6:00 a.m. on the east coast.  Earnings in focus this morning, investors are watching results from several Dow components ahead of the open this morning.  The one to watch after the close is Apple.  We've got everything you need to know this morning previewing the report.  Apple under fire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile, FaceTime hit with a new bug that lets people eavesdrop on you without your knowledge.  How you can fix it, coming up -- big story.  Rising tensions with China meanwhile, the U.S. bringing charges against Huawei as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  The very latest on state of negotiations with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin this morning.  That interview at 8:00 a.m. Eastern, join us for that.  PG&amp;E makes it official, California's largest utility filed to bankruptcy protection, following the massive wild fires.  We've got all the details, coming up.</p><p>Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz roasted.  The billionaire hackled at an event last night as he gears up toward a possible independent run for the White House.  We've got a big show this morning coming from D.C., U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is here, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow is here along with House Minority, California Congressman Kevin McCarthy.  Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell will join me, along with AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka.  Don't miss a moment of it.  We've got a big three hours, coming up.</p><p>And we turn now -- right now, we kick it off with Wall Street markets.  We're looking to see a rebound this morning.  Take a look at Futures actually have just turned negative once again.  Futures down just fractionally, about 6 points on the Dow Industrials; 1-1/2 points lower on the S&amp;P; and the NASDAQ down 13 points.  This, after stocks finished lower yesterday on China growth fears along with weak guidance from Nvidia and Caterpillar.  We told you -- the Caterpillar numbers right here.  And of course, it did worsen throughout the day as investors react to a weaker-than-expected earnings and guidance.</p><p>Joining me right now is Federated Investors Chief Equity Market Strategist, Phil Orlando.  And Phil, it's good to see you this morning.</p><p>PHIL ORLANDO, CHIEF EQUITY MARKET STRATEGIST, FEDERATED INVESTORS:  Thanks for having me back, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All indications that we are seeing a slowdown and worries around China, among other issues, how do you see the markets here as more earnings have come into play?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, you had this 20 percent waterfall decline in stock prices in the fourth quarter of last year, we thought the market was attempting to price in the prospect of recession this year.  Multiples contracted from 18 times earnings down to 14 times earnings.  In our view, there's no risk of recession this year.  So, the rally that we've seen over the last month, 14 percent rally, the market is starting to price in the fact that maybe we're not going to have a recession.  But we've had a 14 percent rally in a month.  That's very, very powerful.  We would absolutely expect some consolidation here over the next month or two particularly as we've got these critical sign posts coming up in the month of March, but as we look out over the balance of the year, we do think that multiples will return to that 18 level, and we're going to end up with a pretty good year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  To what do you attribute the slowdown?  We've got earnings in focus and we're looking at a number of companies out that give weaker-than-expected guidance or miss on the top line.  Lockheed Martin, Pfizer, and Verizon are reporting this morning.  Apple is, of course, out after the bell, so when you look at the earnings picture, where in terms of industry are you seeing the most slowdown?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, I think in a word, uncertainty is what's impacting earnings and guidance to some degree.  You've got the Fed flip-flops that we saw in the fourth quarter last year, the uncertainty about whether or not the United States and China are going to be able to consummate this trade deal.  You've got Brexit overhanging on the global market and certainly the government shutdown, which was up there for 35 days, and it was just temporarily resolved last Friday.  You've got a number of issues there, all of which are impacting companies in some way, shape or form.  So, with earnings up 25 percent year-over-year in the first three quarters of last year, this fourth quarter is a little softer, I think we're up about 13 percent.  So far, we're about a quarter of the way through the earnings season.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>ORLANDO:  And I think what companies are pointing to are some combination of those four issues that I just mentioned.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you mentioned the shutdown.  The shutdown apparently costing the economy $11 billion according to new analysis from the Congressional Budget Office, although Larry Kudlow is disputing that number, and he's going to join us this morning live to talk about it.  The report says that it hit $3 billion, that's one-tenth of a percent of economic activity in the fourth quarter alone.  So, are there sectors that were -- that were hit hardest in that regard, or do you want to look at those companies that are largely tied to the China trade as one area of the real weakness?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the council of economic advisers under Trump had advised us that the shutdown was going to take about one-tenth of one percent out of GDP per week.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, remember, the shutdown started right around Christmas, so that makes sense that we lost, you know, a tenth of a percent in the fourth quarter, you know, maybe a half a percent here in the first quarter.  We're at 1.7 percent GDP growth in the first quarter, consensus blue chip is around 22, 23.  So, we think this pretext a little high and there will be, you know, sort of a downward revision as we get later in the quarter.  But in terms of industries, I think it's really across the board.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Across the board.</p><p>ORLANDO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about technology because it's big week for tech, Apple, of course, the big story today, reporting after the close tonight -- the only big tech reporting.  Microsoft, Facebook out tomorrow, Amazon is out on Thursday.  This is the week that we'll focus on technology and that's where really the growth stories have been.  Would you want to put new money to work in any of these names ahead of their earnings?</p><p>ORLANDO:  Short answer is probably no.  Again, you've had this 14 percent rally here in the last month, you've got concerns about slowing economic growth both in the U.S. and China.  We think that those issues will be resolved as we get into the back half of the year, but right now, you know, why run the risk of putting new money to work after you've had a big rally in some of these names ahead of what could be a disappointing earnings number or perhaps conservative guidance.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, the stock has come down because people were worried about it.  So, we'll see what the numbers are.  Would you, at some point, go back in to tech?  What's your favorite group right now, Phil?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, the areas that we like best in the U.S. markets are energy, financial services, industrials, and health care.  In terms of looking overseas, emerging markets look very attractive to us.  So, the areas that have really gotten hit the most are the ones that we've been attracted to.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there.  So, the valuations are better, I guess, is what you're saying.</p><p>ORLANDO:  The valuations are much more attractive.  We think the fundamentals are still very strong.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Phil, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>ORLANDO:  Great to see you.  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Phil Orlando joining us there.  Meanwhile, a bug in Apple's FaceTime app lets users listen in someone's phone without even the person knowing.  Dagen McDowell, what's happening this morning?  Good morning to you, Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well, Apple has some explaining to do, but particularly on this earnings call this afternoon.  So, there's a bug in the Apple iPhone that would allow people to eavesdrop on FaceTime users' calls.  A FaceTime user calling another person could listen in while the recipients phone is still ringing even if the person never accepts the call.  This was -- it involves several steps in the Group FaceTime feature on the iPhone.</p><p>Apple has disabled that Group FaceTime while it tries to come up with a fix for this, but you can eavesdrop in on somebody, essentially listening through the microphone, even if a person never takes that call, you could eavesdrop on rooms with unattended devices and even receive unauthorized video from the phone.  And again, it would take several steps to do this, but this is coming from a company, Maria, that loves to brag about its privacy protections and even throws shade at the likes of Facebook and other technology companies.</p><p>And adding embarrassment to embarrassment, yesterday was International Data Privacy Day and Tim Cook was tweeting about that.  Here's what he said on Twitter yesterday before this bug, this eavesdropping bug was disclosed.  We must keep fighting for the kind of world we want to live in.  On this Data Privacy Day, let us all insist on action and reform for vital privacy protections.  The dangers are real and the consequences are too important.  Big whoops for Apple, and of course, everything that happens in the business world is a political opportunity.  The Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo had to weigh in on this as well, putting out a statement late yesterday, say, \"Urging FaceTime users to temporarily disable the app.  So, Apple beat him to it, they're trying to fix it.  Embarrassment nonetheless.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible because you don't even know -- I mean, the phone could be ringing and you don't even know that they're listening.  I mean, that's the worst part of it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  I can explain later as the show goes on how this work, but you'd have to place a FaceTime call, go to the group, add yourself to the call and then the recipient of the call would have to hit maybe one like the on-button on the phone in order to activate it, but it was possible, and it was all over the internet yesterday how to do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, if -- so, if it's -- if it's not on and you say -- and you do -- and you decline the phone call, they can't listen in?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Unless you -- but you can't touch the phone at all.  Like, it's not even declining the phone.  Like, if you hit the up -- the up volume button on the phone, and so if I was playing this trick on you, it would activate it, and they could essentially hear what was going on in the room.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Unbelievable.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  I want to hear more about that, for sure.  Meanwhile, there's this, as expected, PG&amp;E filed for bankruptcy protection following those devastating wildfires in California.  Cheryl Casone on that in headlines right now.  Cheryl, good morning to you.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  Well, PG&amp;E is facing roughly about 30 billion in potential liabilities, as investigators are looking into whether the company's equipment played a role in starting California's deadliest fire.  More than 100 people died following a series of wildfires that burned hundreds of thousands of acres over a two-year period.  The utility providing energy service to 60 million people, we should add.  Taking a look at shares of PG&amp;E, look at that, in the premarket down nearly nine percent.  And those loses have actually paired back in the last hour or so, folks.</p><p>Well, China's Vice Premier has arrived in Washington for high-level trade talks that are going to start tomorrow.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and trade representative Robert Lighthizer will attend the two-day meeting.  Yesterday, the Trump administration announced a pair of indictments against Chinese telecom giant, Huawei.  The U.S. is accusing the company of trying to steal trade secrets from T-Mobile.  The Justice Department also charging Huawei with conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran.</p><p>And the China story continues, folks, shares of Nvidia are lower this morning.  The chipmaker is warning investors, and expects much weaker sales thanks in part, yes, to China's slowing economy.  It also previously cautioned the sales of its graphics processors that are used in video games PCs would be disappointing.  The China effect continues.  Chips for video gaming account for more than half of their business, they lost half their market value since hitting their peak back on October 1st, Maria.  So, Goldman Sachs had to come out last Friday, Maria, warning that a lot of these chip companies that have massive exposure to China are going to have really rough reports.  Micron Technology, even Wynn Resorts, the casino company, has got big China exposure, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, for sure.  All right, Cheryl, thanks so much.  Coming up next, five police officers are injured this morning, four of them shot while serving a search warrant.  The very latest coming up.  And then a venti-size disaster for Howard Schultz last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire (BLEEP).</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Former Starbucks CEO having a rough time exploring a 2020 Presidential run as he gets heckled.  We break it down right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Live from Washington, we are eyeing 2020, former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz facing backlash last night on his first stop of his book tour.  It was his first public appearance after announcing a possible Independent Presidential run.  It did not begin smoothly.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire (BLEEP).  Go back to getting ratio'd on Twitter.  Go back to Davos with the other billionaire elite who think they know how to run the world.  That's not what democracy needs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, my goodness.  Schultz is also facing backlash from former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.  Here's what he tweeted: \"In 2020, the great likelihood is that an Independent would just split the anti-Trump vote and end up re-electing the President.  That's a risk I refused to run in 2016, and we can't afford to run it now.\"</p><p>Here with me this morning to talk more about all of that is Dagen McDowell back in New York, Wall Street Journal Global Economics Editor Jon Hilsenrath here in D.C. with me, along with the American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp.  Gentlemen, it's good to see you.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Welcome to Washington.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, thank you so much.  And welcome to presidential politics, Howard Schultz.  What do you think about that?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Well, I'm going to get some popcorn.  This could be a real interesting Democratic primary, and whatever this Independent thing is, don't you love Michael Bloomberg who has probably spent a million dollars on polling, trying to figure out every way to become the President.  Publicly chastising Schultz for running as an Independent when that's exactly what Bloomberg would just love to do if he could.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  You know, on the one hand, Dagen, I feel like there is an opening for an Independent because there's such extremes and radical conversation going on certainly on the left.  And on the other hand, I don't know, how much is a cup of coffee at Starbucks?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Again, that $18.00 cup of Joe, I'm joking, I'm exaggerating.  It's helping --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think it's like $6.00.  I mean, seriously.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, we love cart coffee around this place.  But again, that's helping fund this run.  But Michael Bloomberg -- you know what, Michael Bloomberg should run for the Democratic nomination if he thinks he can win, it's just hilarious to have this multibillionaire lecturing Howard Schultz about an Independent run when actually a cup of Starbucks coffee has more charisma than Michael Bloomberg, number one.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Number two, it's going to be really interesting to see the narrative in the spring of 1992 with Ross Perot was -- Ross Perot was going to divide the Democratic vote, that it wouldn't hurt the Republican.  This could very well -- I mean, it depends on who -- what Howard Schultz says on the campaign trail and how far-left the Democrats go when they're running for the nomination.  But I'll say this, what he said so far about pay -- how to pay for Medicare For All and how that's impossible, I would be really interested to hear him talk about how to fix the health care system, because he might come to the table with some really interesting ideas and force the Democrats to answer the hard questions about paying for this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that is the thing, I mean, this party unfortunately, it's very hard for someone who's a centrist to actually have a shot.  You had Tim Ryan from Ohio, he wanted to do it, he's an economic thinker, he doesn't have a shot because of the same thing, you've got the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's 70 percent tax rate, the loudest voice in the room.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I mean, there's no question that these primaries are starting out very much from the left, you know, you have talk about a wealth tax, and 70 percent high-income tax threshold.  You have Elizabeth Warren who is going around beating up on the banks.  This is definitely a left-leaning primary season that we're going to be going into.  What I find so fascinating is the journeys that these different billionaires are traveling.  You know, you had President Trump who supported a lot of Democrats as a businessman in New York City traveling over to Republican Party, now you have Michael Bloomberg who started out as a Republican Mayor --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- traveling over to the Democratic Party, and Howard Schultz doesn't know where to go.  He doesn't know where he fits in.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He doesn't know where -- and what about Senator Kamala Harris?  Let's listen to her, because she held a CNN Townhall meeting in Iowa last night.  Harris is vowing to eliminate private health insurance with Medicare For All if elected president.  What's your take, Matt?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Making insurance companies illegal.  Look, the Democratic Party has become quite radicalized.  Think about this, less choices for the patient is the solution to our problems.  That seems insane.  Also, do we really think the government, when you get your tags to drive your car, or when you pay your taxes at the IRS, do you really think all the solutions to our problems are there?  I don't.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Let me ask you this, who does President Trump want to see come out of this whole --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think he wants Howard Schultz to run.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think -- he was taunting him yesterday.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH:  No, besides Howard Schultz, among the Democrats, who does he -- who does he want to (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>SCHLAPP:  I think most Republicans -- I'm not going to speak for the President -- but I think most Republicans believe that Elizabeth Warren is so far out there on the loony left, basically Marxism, socialism that I think they find that a delicious opportunity.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Can I --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- call the confiscation, Dagen.  He called it (INAUDIBLE) I mean, this two or three percent tax on assets, confiscation.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It is wealth confiscation.  It's totally communist and then to try and find people when they hand in their U.S. citizenship when other countries come calling, wanting you move there because they won't come and take your hard-earned money.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  One thing I want to point out that Jon Hilsenrath said that Howard Schultz doesn't know where to go.  President Trump should be worried about a Howard Schultz, because what if he comes to the table, like I said, with ideas that appeal to voters in this country who feel left out.  Who left out from the Republican Party and certainly left out by the left-leaning Democrats in this environment.  So, be very, very careful.  And one other thing I'll add with Howard Schultz at that -- at that bookstore, that's just the New York City welcome wagon.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's the way they treat all tourists in this city.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, I think you make a good point because there is that path.  That path of centrism.  I mean, that path of the center, because people do feel like it's gone wacky all the way on the left, for sure.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  It's a centrist country, but don't forget Hillary.  She's making noises.  Maybe that's the President's favorite opponent.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH:  We haven't seen any --</p><p>SCHLAPP:  She's making noises.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  We haven't seen anyone travel that centrist path as an Independent to presidency.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  So, it was a smart move on Howard Schultz's part.  We'll see.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Or a risky one for all those billions --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, certainly risky.  Take a quick break.  Extreme weather warning meanwhile on the other side of this break, millions of people across the country are gearing up for an Arctic blast as temperatures are plummeting, that's next.</p><p>Then showing their cards, British Prime Minister Theresa May asking Parliament to put up its plans from Britain's exit from the E.U.  Details on the historic debate.  And the vote happening later today, back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  It is cold out, and the deep freeze is setting in, hitting millions of Americans with subzero and dangerous temperatures.  Fox News Senior Meteorologist Janice Dean in the Fox Weather Center right now with the very latest.  Janice, tell us about it.</p><p>JANICE DEAN, FOX NEWS SENIOR METEOROLOGIST:  Hi, Maria, yes, we could be dealing with historic lows.  These are current windchills, what it feels like when you go outside and you are not protected.  Dangerous, potentially life-threatening windchills of -41 in International Falls, -18 in Chicago, but we still have another blast behind this.  So, these are morning lows, these are not windchill temperatures: Chicago -25 on Thursday, -31 in Minneapolis, -16 in Detroit.  Again, those are not windchill values.  Those are actual air temperatures.  But with the windchill, in some cases, we could get windchill values of -40 to -50.  If you go outside, your skin is going to freeze in minutes.</p><p>So, here's Chicago, Illinois.  Your all-time record low is -28.  So, we're going to flirt with historic lows, Maria.  This is a big deal.  The good news is it won't be long lasting.  By the weekend, we'll start to rebound, but I also want to make mention with this arctic cold front as we have snow across the deep south.  Snow that could cripple travel across portions of Atlanta, Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, and towards the southeast, so that's another dangerous part of the storm is the -- not only extreme cold but the snow as far as south as the gulf coast.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Janice.  Wow, what a story, thank you so much.</p><p>DEAN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will be watching.  Janice Dean.  Coming up next, the State of the Union is back on, it is February 5th.  Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi extending an invitation to the President, he accepted the offer.  Then, we're taking a look at the enormous cost of the shutdown.  What is the real number?  Plus, place your bets, Super Bowl fans getting ready to throw down an enormous amount of cash.  So, bet on the big game Sunday.  We break down all the numbers.  Stay with us.  Live from Washington this morning.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us.  We are coming to you live from Washington this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, January 29th, your top stories right now 6:31 on the east coast right now.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will be my special guest, in about 90 minutes time.  We will break it all down with the Treasury Secretary, coming up.  So, stay with us.</p><p>Meanwhile, Futures relatively flat this morning, take a look at markets, down 20 points on the Dow Industrials, down 4 points on the S&amp;P, down 18 points on the NASDAQ.  We are expecting some pressure at the start of trading this morning, after all the major indices finished lower, yesterday, on Wall Street.</p><p>In fact, at 4:00, the Dow Industrials gave up 208 points, that was almost 1 percent lower, the S&amp;P 500 down 21, that was three quarters of a percent lower, and the NASDAQ with a 79-point decline yesterday, at the close, down better than 1 percent.</p><p>Investors are watching some big news this week, J.P. Morgan, calling this week the most important week of the first quarter, and here is why, you've got earnings, you've got the British vote, you've got U.S.-China trade talks, you've got a Federal Reserve decision, we're not expecting a Fed hike.</p><p>We've got fourth quarter GDP coming out.  And, of course, at the end of the week, the job's report for the month of January, a big week, investors want to watch it and will be covering it all.</p><p>European indices this morning look like this, in terms of trading.  We are looking at gains in Europe.  The FT-100 up one and a quarter percent, 86 points higher, the CAC Quarante in Paris is up a half a percent, 26 points higher, and the DAX Index in Germany, higher by a fraction, as you can see there.</p><p>Asian markets overnight, flat, take a look.  No real moves there, because mover was the KOSPI Index in Korea, up a quarter of a percent.</p><p>Well, there is tragedy in Houston to report, five police officers injured.  Four of them shot, while serving a search warrant.  We have the very latest, coming up.</p><p>And a debate in parliament, British lawmakers set to vote on the latest plan for the U.K. to leave the European Union.

The address was originally supposed to be today.</p><p>Even though the shutdown is over, the U.S. is still feeling effects, new numbers from the Congressional Budget Office to report.  The U.S. GDP will be $3 billion lower during the fourth quarter of 2018, because of this shutdown.  On the immigration front, backlogs of immigration courts grew by at least 10 percent, according to Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about all of that is Americans for Tax Reform President, Grover Norquist, Grover, good to see you.</p><p>GROVER NORQUIST, PRESIDENT, AMERICANS FOR TAX REFORM:  Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So, the CBO is talking about a $3 billion-dollar hit, in fact, as a result of the shutdown, Larry Kudlow is having an issue with this.  He says, frequently disagrees with the CBO anyway.  What's your take in terms of what the shutdown cost the economy?</p><p>NORQUIST:  Look, the key thing is that the economy continues to grow and we're looking at a three percent rate of growth for the year, so $3 billion is a big number, unless you compare it to the GDP of the United States in the fourth quarter.</p><p>So, actually, we're doing fairly well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You don't think it had much of an impact then, Grover?</p><p>NORQUIST:  No, it's a small impact and we have a tremendous growth for the year, which is way beyond what the CBO said was possible, when they scored this.  The CBO needs to spend a little more time going back to explain why they were so wrong on all of their recent predictions, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  Go ahead.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Grover, the Federal Reserve and most of the economist that we surveyed at the Wall Street Journal are saying that the economy is slowing down in 2019.  We had a nice burst in 2018 in part, because of tax cuts and in part, because there's more spending, $300 billion of additional spending.</p><p>But now, they say the economy is slowing along with the global economy, what does that say about the impact of these tax cuts, are the tax cuts really created the long-run growth that Republicans said was going to happen?</p><p>NORQUIST:  The tax cuts do two things.  We were at 35 percent rate, which is the highest in the world.  It made sense for an American company like Burger King to be bought by Canadian company, because even though they're selling the same hamburgers, the same number of employees, it was worth more, because we had a worldwide tax system at 35 percent.</p><p>By taking 35 down to 21, we became competitive with Europe.  I mean, our friends, the Germans were at 25, the Japanese were at 25.  I'm sorry, the Japanese were at 30.  The Chinese were at 25.  And we were at 35.  We weren't even close to being competitive.  It's a huge change in the direction for the country.</p><p>And if the CBO tells you they're pessimistic, they didn't think you could do three percent, they laughed at three percent growth, said you could never do more than --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  The question is, is that three percent growth.  I think a lot of people understand that the corporate tax rate was uncompetitive, even some Democrats wanted to lower their corporate tax rate, but the question is, this new tax code that we've got, is that sufficient to sustain the three percent growth in 2019?</p><p>NORQUIST:  It's a good first start.  We also need to do something about the workforce.  We need more workers and frankly, there's more tax reduction that needs to be done and spending restraint is very important at the end of the day.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  I want to go back to this question about a shutdown, Grover, which is, people are saying, they're almost using the reason why you couldn't cut government, because somehow, that would have a negative impact on our economic growth.  That seems like a very dangerous road to go down.</p><p>Isn't it true that all of this money that they are saying didn't get put into the economy, are you worried that the government actually won't spend all of that by the time that the authority over the money, expires?</p><p>NORQUIST:  For the government to -- I was taught this (INAUDIBLE) economics in college also.  The government takes your money, and then spends it.  It's much better for the economy than if it lets you spend it.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Right.</p><p>NORQUIST:  Because you would waste some of it by investing it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because they can spend money better than you, of course.</p><p>NORQUIST:  And that's the oddest thing because, of course, that's nonsense.  East Germany should have done very well, under this theory, but it doesn't, so --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  What the government is doing is borrowing other people's money and spending it, right?  I mean, we're talking about deficits that are nearing a trillion dollars.</p><p>NORQUIST:  The (INAUDIBLE) cost the government is how much the government spends, whether they borrowed or take it, it's still gone from the -- from the real economy.  The cost of government is total government spending.  We should have taxes low, and then the least destructive way possible, all taxes are somewhat destructive.  And you have less borrowing if you have less spending.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what about all of these new plans?  And by the way, we are getting earnings right now, as we're talking 3M and Xerox, both beat expectations, although 3M is cutting its forecast for the year.  What about all of these ideas about taxing the wealthy?  New York Congressman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez claims for a 70 percent marginal tax rate on the tippy top, as she calls it.</p><p>Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts senator, hopeful, for 2020, two percent tax on Americans whose assets exceed 50 million.  If you're a billionaire, three percent, what's the impact?</p><p>NORQUIST:  OK, magicians like to do this, so you're not looking at, you know -- watch my right hand, don't look at the left hand.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NORQUIST:  The reason they talk about high tax rates on rich people, is that they want to gouge the middle class.  The difference between the United States and Sweden, Finland, Denmark, the countries that Cortez talked about is, they don't have the 70 percent rate, just back up for sec -- there isn't a country in the world with a 70 percent income tax rate.</p><p>Many countries used to, the Beatle song, 19 for me, one for you, 95 percent tax rate, and then the Beatles moved to United States, and everybody who could pay tennis, left Sweden.  And all the countries of the world realize that tax rates that high were stupid and destructive and didn't help equality or growth or anything like that.</p><p>So, they got rid of them.  The whole world got rid of them.  We did it, it was stupid.  We back offed it and had strong economic growth as a result, so 70 percent stupid and destructive.  It's not America saying, the world says that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You probably showed the op-ed today, in the Journal, in California, and taxes as well.  The Journal, this week, by Cypress founder, T.J. Rodgers, which was very good, Another California Tax Grab, he writes.  In it, the politicians have fueled an affordability crisis that drives away businesses and exacerbates homelessness.</p><p>California Governor, Gavin Newsom, called for even higher taxes in his inauguration speech earlier this month.</p><p>NORQUIST:  California is a good example of 70 percent play.  They have a 13 percent rate on people making a million dollars, but they have 8 percent rate on people making $42,000.  So, they want the middle class people in California to think you're OK, because we're really screwing the other guy.</p><p>And point of fact, Florida has a zero percent first income tax, Texas has a zero percent first income tax, 8 percent looks good compared to 13.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NORQUIST:  Looks lousy compared to zero percent.  They want the middle class to think somebody else is paying the freight.  That's why they have those phoney high tax rates that don't raise much money.  It's to fool the middle class.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it is talking point, and it works for the populist.  Let me bring in Dagen McDowell on this, because we hear this every time we go into the tax discussion and we have a Democrat on which takes out another one of those talking points on taxes, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And I want to say that Senator Kamala Harris said that the first thing -- she said it last night, in the town hall, he first thing she do is to cut taxes for the middle class.  Well, roughly half this country pays no net federal income tax, number one, and the Republicans just did that particularly, doubling the standard deduction.</p><p>So, I don't know who she's going to cut taxes for.  But this is the ruse and this is the big liberal lie that all of these big new welfare state initiatives, whether it's green energy, even single payer, it's all going to be paid for by the super rich.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And that it's not going to be -- that the paying won't be spread across every person in this country to fund this welfare state.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And by the way, the numbers don't add up even if you tax all the rich, you're not going to get the amount of money you need for this green deal, Grover.</p><p>NORQUIST:  You don't even balance the budget if you do that, never mind half money for new things.  Look, the big difference between United States and Denmark, United States and Sweden, it's not how much money higher income people pay, it's what happens to middle-income people.</p><p>Denmark, Finland, Sweden, the tax rate on middle income people is 10, 15, 20 points higher than an American middle class person.  And, you add to that the value added tax.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NORQUIST:  The difference between United States and Europe is how heavily taxed middle income people are, and they have those (INAUDIBLE) high rates that very few people pay, to make people in the middle class think that they are getting a deal.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Speaking of middle income tax -- a lot of Democrats want a carbon tax, gasoline tax and even some big American business.  That's the way to address the issue of climate change.  Do you see any path towards a carbon tax that would be acceptable to your point --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I guess, but real quick, Grover.</p><p>NORQUIST:  No.  No, absolutely not.  And the reason is, you can look at Washington State, very deep blue Washington State.  They have twice had it on the ballot and twice defeated a carbon dioxide tax, gasoline taxes lose overwhelmingly.  This is too obvious tax on middle-income people.  It's a loser up.  They are having this fight in -- our dear friends in France or loggerhead down the subject.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We know how that played out.</p><p>NORQUIST:  We had the Ontario government and the Alberta government collapsed as a result of this, and three times, in Australia.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Grover, thank you.  Yes.</p><p>NORQUIST:  Bad politics and lousy economics.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Grover, thank you for the facts, we appreciate it, Grover Norquist, joining us there.</p><p>Five officers injured in a shooting in Texas, meanwhile, Cheryl Casone in New York, with the details, there.  Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  That's right, Maria.  Four officers were shot and another officer suffered a knee injury in Houston.  They were serving a search warrant at a suspected drug house.  Police say two of them were hit in the neck.  Those officers are in critical but stable condition.  Two suspects were killed at the scene.</p><p>Well, a key E.U. negotiator, warning the risk of Britain leaving the European Union without a deal, is very high, as parliament votes on amendments in Theresa May's exit plan today.  Lawmakers set to consider more than 10 different amendments before taking votes.  That's going to be at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>And those votes come after May's plan to leave the European Union was overwhelmingly rejected earlier this month, a lot of those votes against her from her own party.</p><p>Well, Americans will be betting an estimated $6 billion on the Super Bowl, that's according to the survey by the American Gaming Association.  About 22.7 million U.S. adults plan to place a bet on the upcoming Atlanta game, of those bets, 94.47 percent, reportedly illegal, but let the games begin, Maria, and those are your headlines.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Be there to watch it all, front-row seat.</p><p>CASONE:  I'm there for you, Maria.  I've got surprises for you, coming up.  You're going to love them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK, looking forward to it.  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, crisis in Venezuela to take a look at, new sanctions have been placed on the country's oil.  Plus, National Security Advisor, John Bolton, may have inadvertently revealed the administration's next move.  Why his notes are raising eyebrows this morning.</p><p>Then, farming in America, why farmers are being forced to rent water.  That's up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A look at some of the big headlines across America this morning.  The Chicago Tribune reporting on the Pension Agency criticizing Sears Chairman Eddie Lampert's plan to acquire the bankrupt retailer.  The article explaining that the agency sets to takeover Sears.  Pensions objects to the bid, calling it the final fulfillment of a year-long's scheme to deprive Sears and its creditors of assets and its employees of jobs while lining Lampert's on owns pockets.</p><p>The Daily Camera in Colorado, reporting on how Boulder County farmers are increasingly renting water.  The report explains how ownership from agricultural interests has dropped from 85 percent in the late 1950s to just 30 percent.  The water increasingly moving to municipal control.</p><p>And the Mercury News writing that how in one California city you can text 911 for emergency help.  According to the paper, the police department there announced that the service is now available in the city.  It is meant to help people who are hearing or voice impaired.  The police are also recommending that you not send emojis.  Well, yes, I would think not.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  What are we coming to?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  My God, but it is good that you can text 911.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  That's a good step, just don't text person emoji.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, crisis in Venezuela new sanctions placed on the country's oil, plus National Security Advisor John Bolton may have inadvertently revealed the administration's next move, why his notes on his legal pad are raising eyebrows this morning?  We're breaking that down when we come right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A framework for peace.  The U.S. and Taliban negotiators making a preliminary on key issues to end the war in Afghanistan -- the longest war in American history.  The two top points American troop withdrawal and insurgence vowing to end terrorist attacks abroad, that's according to the Wall Street Journal.  Many hurdles remain to ensure the peace is in place.  Joining me right now is Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst, General Jack Keane.  General, it's always a pleasure to see you.</p><p>GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST:  Good to see you, Maria, and welcome to Washington again.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  And what do you think about this?  I mean, are we supposed to be trusting the Taliban?</p><p>KEANE:  No, we can never ever trust the Taliban, that doesn't mean that we can't have a treaty with them.  But here's what I think is going on, a couple of things have changed: one is the Taliban in the last couple of years have gone all out as we have so dramatically reduced our forces, thinking that they will going to be able to overthrow the regime, because the only thing the United States is really doing is training and assisting the ground forces -- no longer doing the fighting, however provide an air power.  That didn't work.  They retook some territory but never took capitals or provinces and they never took -- they never able to secure a province.  So, what has happened?  The war stalemated.  The Taliban cannot take over the government and the government cannot defeat Taliban, even with our assistance.</p><p>Second thing, and this is crucial, Pakistan has gotten involved in this in a way they've never have before.  They forced the Taliban to go to the peace negotiation table, why?  Pakistan knows it's no longer in national interest to keep this thing stalemated.  There's growing al-Qaeda and growing ISIS presence in Afghanistan which gives the Pakistanis some concern.  So, those are the new things that are happening.  That's why the negotiations have some momentum.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's the thing, though.  I mean, so many people were worried when the president said: we were withdrawing the troops.  And where do you stand on that now?  I mean, do you feel better about it given this peace deal?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, let me answer it this way -- I mean, it is an essential question: the Taliban themselves, we are trying to get an agreement with them that, one, they'll stop trying to overthrow the government and number two, they'll power share with them and also, they will assist in taking down the al-Qaeda and the ISIS.  I don't think we can trust them to do that, based on the fact that they provided safe haven for Osama bin Laden for almost 10 years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  So, what do we do?</p><p>KEANE:  So, we leave in place, after we bring out the troops that are providing the training and assistance.  We leave in place a counterterrorism force and an intelligence capability indefinitely.  We're doing that in Yemen, we're doing it in Libya and we're doing it in Africa.  The one in Africa is off the coast.  It's a Maritime Joint Task Force.  That is what we need to do, that is the guaranty against the Taliban because the issue in Afghanistan has always been, we would never intervene in the civil war in Afghanistan between the northern alliance and Taliban for one reason only, we didn't evade, because they attacked the United States.  That's the reason we're there.  We don't want that to happen again and we cannot trust the Taliban to provide that guarantee for us.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, let me move on and ask you about sanctions on the Venezuelan oil industry.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin who will be here shortly this morning along with Security Adviser John Bolton, explain the decision in a briefing yesterday and issued warning for disputed President Nicolas Maduro.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN BOLTON, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR:  The president has made it very clear on this -- on this matter that all options are on the table.</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY:  There's no reason why these resources shouldn't be used for the economic benefit of the people there.  There's no reason for the poverty and the starvation and the humanitarian crisis.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to this announcement yesterday?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, increased pressure on Maduro regime is certainly a welcome thing.  I mean, this really comes down to the loyalty of the military to Maduro.  As long as that loyalty is there, it's unlikely that Maduro is going the leave.  If that loyalty starts to fall apart, I hope we're working a 'plan b', which is engineering right now some kind of exit path for Maduro, where he can go into exile with recriminations in Venezuela.  The Reagan administration did this very successfully on Ferdinand Marcos, back in 1986, overwhelming popular opposition to him, hundreds of thousands of people.  We engineered his exit.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me squeeze in this question before you go general.  This image from the briefing going viral and it shows John Bolton's notepad with the notation: \"5,000 troops to Colombia.\"  Whoa, do you think we should be sending troops to the region?  What do you think about this?  Caught on camera.</p><p>KEANE:  Look, when we deposed Noriega in 1989 operation just cost Panama, 26,000 troops, is what it took.  When we deposed a dictator in Haiti, 28,000.  The ease of troops that would only be in there, move into Venezuela, if there's a problem at the embassy to our diplomat.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How significance is revealing such a secret?</p><p>KEANE:  I think he'd probably wanted to reveal it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  General Jack Keane, good to see you sir.  Thank you so much.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Show: MORNINGS WITH MARIA][Date: January 29, 2019][Time: 07:00:00][Tran: 012902cb.231][Type: SHOW][Head: Interview with Rep.

And joining me to break it all down -- Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell in New York; the \"Wall Street Journal's\" global economics editor Jon Hilsenrath here in D.C. with me; and the American Conservative Union chairman, Matt Schlapp.  Great to see you -- guys.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Great to be here.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen -- good morning to you.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning.  We were talking about the shutdown.  So it's over for the time being.</p><p>The Democrats have actually been hurt by it as well.  Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows that positive feelings about the Democratic Party have fallen to 35 percent this month.  That's down 4 percentage points since December.  And that is essentially in line with the positive feelings that people have about Republicans.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean that's a really good point because the President really did not get hurt certainly on his base, from his base, by the shutdown.  What do you guys think?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Two things.  First is that the President's base was actually energized that he would make a spending fight.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Remember, immigration is a spending fight because if he can stop illegal immigration or reduce it, you don't have all these social services costs.</p><p>But the second thing is, the President's brand is that he will fight, he will fight harder than any politician on the field and he reiterated that brand.  So if he can increase that reputation, I think it appeals to Independents.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They said dig in.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  But isn't his brand also -- it's about fighting and continuing to fight and winning.  And he didn't win the wall in this case.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  I don't agree with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We don't know if he won the wall yet.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  There's three steps to this - -</p><p>HILSENRATH:  In this case, right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  In this case.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  -- there's three really important things.  Number one, the bill he signed has $1.3 billion in barrier funding annualized.</p><p>Number two, he's got to exhaust all legislative efforts if he's going to go the emergency route in order to have a good case in court.</p><p>And number three, the American people when it comes to immigration, he is on the right side of this policy argument.  And Democrats who are against border security, they're going to be sorry for this eventually.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  But you know what.  You better be --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, go ahead -- Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- but you better be careful about what you do and this goes to all politicians because I was flying on Friday and that was an utter nightmare.  If you want to anger everybody in the electorate, you pull another fast one like that where people are grounded and you've got an hour and-a-half plane flight where you're at 8,000 feet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But who are you blaming?</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They were blaming (INAUDIBLE) and blaming the Democrats because --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They were blaming everybody.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- Nancy Pelosi dug in.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They were blaming everybody.  But TSA agents down in Raleigh, Durham were going to food banks because they were spending what little money they had on gas trying to get to and from work.  So again, I don't care who is responsible for it.  They're all responsible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, businesses did start, you know, putting the uncertainty out there, sitting on cash, making decisions later.  We know.  I mean the SEC closed, can't get any IPOs through.  FDA closed, got to worry about obvious food shortages or food issues.</p><p>So we were beginning to see some real impact.  And Dagen saw it firsthand at the airport.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  That's true.  But if you're a federal employee in this town, let's face it, you make a little bit of a bargain.  Yes, every year you might have to go through a shutdown with your salary.</p><p>But you know, the other thing, Maria, that we don't talk about, it's almost impossible to fire a federal employee.  There's some pretty cushy gigs --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good point.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  -- in THIS town where you basically have an insurance policy against ever getting fired unless you do something just awful.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  And you can read all the GAO reports that's backed that up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're talking about all of that this morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But there are people barely making ends meet who are trying to drive to work, and spending all their money on gasoline and going to food banks who were working for the TSA and not getting paid.</p><p>And when the Republicans stop thinking about them and start talking about the workers who aren't needed, the ones who are furloughed you have really missed the boat.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, maybe.  But how about the fact that we've got a border wall in Nancy Pelosi's state?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that immoral, the wall that separates Tijuana from San Diego --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  But --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- is that immoral?  I don't think so.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They need to start asking all of these Democrats who think that the wall is immoral or don't want to fund it, ok, let's take down the walls that are there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's how you put --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will the three million people in Tijuana assimilate with the three million people in San Diego if that wall is torn down?  I think so.  And we're going to talk about that this morning.</p><p>We've got a big show this morning from D.C., live.  Coming up Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is here, live.  National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow has a thing or two to say about the CBO protections about what exactly the impact is on the economy from that shutdown.</p><p>House Minority Leader and California Congressman Kevin McCarthy will walk us through what these next three weeks look like with his colleagues in terms of this negotiating on border wall funding.</p><p>Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell is here.</p><p>Along with AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka.</p><p>Don't miss a moment of it.  A big two hours coming up.</p><p>And we kick it off this hour right now with markets.  Futures are pointing to a flat opening this morning amid all of this uncertainty over China trade, earnings.  It's an enormous week this week.</p><p>This after stocks finished to the downside yesterday on the China growth fears, the weak guidance from Nvidia and Caterpillar as well, and of course these worries about what happens with China and the U.S.  There's conversations happening tomorrow.</p><p>Joining us right now is the founder, CEO and chief investment strategist at Mainstay Capital Management David Kudla.  David -- good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>DAVID KUDLA, FOUNDER/CEO/CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, MAINSTAY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So we've been talking about what a week this is with the fourth quarter earnings coming out.  That's been pretty much driving the story.  We have a jobs report coming out at the end of the week on Friday.  Brexit discussions, the vote today.  U.S./China discussions tomorrow.  A fourth quarter GDP number.  How do you want to invest with all of this?</p><p>KUDLA:  I think investors should be looking at stocks right now that they want to own.  We've been invested through -- the past month has been very good for stock investors.  13 percent rise through Friday from the lows of December 24th.  And that's in both growth stocks and value stocks, so a broad market advance.</p><p>We're going to see some give and take here now after this nice advance of last month but investors should be picking, you know, their points here, have their list out on stocks they want to own.  We look for a good 2019 for stock investors.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is it good news, Jon Hilsenrath, that the Fed gave us a pivot that we know that the Fed is on pause right now and that we know that they're even ready to consider slowing down the unwind of the bond portfolio?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  I don't think it's good news.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I think it shows that the Fed is becoming less confident about how strong and sustainable the economy is.  I mean it is a sign that inflation isn't picking up and that's good news.  But you see some real trepidation coming out of the Fed right now with the global economy slowing, with markets being unstable and volatile.</p><p>I think the Fed is a little worried about the outlook and that shouldn't really give us a lot of encouragement.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about that, David?  I mean the economy's slowing.</p><p>KUDLA:  But Jon this -- yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLA:  But John -- the important thing here is what happened in the fourth quarter is we had mixed messages out of fed chair Jerome Powell.  We had on October 3rd we were far away from neutral.  Then by November we were close to neutral rates.  Then on the 16th in the Fed meeting they were going to do what's right no matter what.</p><p>Then he came in on January 4th and finally said we're going to be considerate of market and economic conditions and now we're seeing a more consistent and accommodative message out of the Fed.  And that's very important for the markets.</p><p>That's music to the market's ears and that's why we've now seen a sustained advance.  So the markets and investors are now looking at a Fed that seems as though they are going to be considerate of or accommodative or take into account what's happening with the markets, with the economy, and not just normalize rates for the sake of normalizing rates.</p><p>They won't have $50 billion rolling off the balance sheet on auto pilot and they won't raise rates just to raise rates to get to a normalized rate structure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that was the worry in the fourth quarter.</p><p>KUDLA:  -- in pause like in 2016 if the market and economy warrants it.  That's important.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That was they worry in the fourth quarter -- that they were on auto pilot-- Jon.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  Yes, I make two points.</p><p>KUDLA:  That drove volatility in the fourth quarter, the Fed.  .</p><p>HILSENRATH:  David makes a really important point, you know.  So this has been Jerome Powell's first year at the Fed.  He's had a bit of a honeymoon with the market.  And then what the market has discovered in the last month or two is that Mr. Powell, you know, he kind of prides himself on being a plain-spoken communicator but his communication has confused a lot of people in the market.  And he's really had to do a lot of corrections over the last few weeks --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- so that raised some questions about him.</p><p>But the other thing about -- you know, the market wants to see the Fed on an easier path.  Ok.  But the underlying message there is that this economy can't sustain very high rates.</p><p>So it doesn't send a really encouraging message about economic growth and the economic outlook when we see that the Fed is starting to recognize it just can't sustain a tighter monetary policy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But look, we're getting the news from the companies themselves with the fourth quarter numbers coming out.  Verizon just reported mixed earnings.  They beat on earnings, but they missed on revenue.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Caterpillar.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Technology reporting late today, Apple.  And we heard from Apple already.  Facebook, Amazon -- all reporting this week, Microsoft.  It's going to be a big week for technology.  And of course you mentioned Caterpillar.  That was the big kahuna yesterday that really set the tone for the markets because Caterpillar is a great indicator of economic activity across the world, in particular China.</p><p>So stay on earnings for a second, David.  Give me your take on technology.  Because you've got Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft coming out this week.</p><p>KUDLA:  Well, you know, tech stocks got beat up very bad in the fourth quarter.  They've come back in this rally and we think that tech stocks have further to go.</p><p>Look, we think that investors should stay with tech stocks.  We have an opportunity here to add value stocks to the portfolio.  Cyclicals came into 2019 at their lowest valuation relative to the S&amp;P 500 ever.</p><p>So investors now can diversify their portfolio in an opportunistic way, holding both growth stocks.  Those tech stocks that we think still have some rebound and some further runway ahead of them, and by adding value stocks that are very opportunistic.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  David -- it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>KUDLA:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Still bullish on this market.  David Kudla joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, the State of the Union is back on, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi extended officially the invitation to President Trump to do the State of the Union in the House Chamber.  He accepted the offer.</p><p>Plus we're taking a look at the enormous cost of the shutdown, what exactly is the number?  A lot of people say it wasn't very much at all.</p><p>Then, Snapchat's unthinkable change, how the photo sharing app is attempting to compete with Instagram by changing a key feature.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>New revelations in the sexual misconduct claims against the former CEO of Wynn Resorts.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with headlines now in New York -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Maria.  The \"Wall Street Journal\" is reporting that executives at Wynn Resort ignored allegations of sexual misconduct by Steve Wynn over more than a decade.  According to a regulator's report Wynn was accused of sexually assaulting or harassing salon workers, cocktail servers and flight attendants who worked for his company.</p><p>Under a proposed settlement, the Nevada Gaming Control Board won't try to revoke Wynn's regulatory licenses but Wynn is going to pay a fine.  Steve Wynn has denied any claims of misconduct.  There's a one year chart of Wynn's in front of you right there.</p><p>Well, Snapchat has named Lara Sweet as its interim CFO.  This is another shift in leadership at Snap as the company has lost several high profile employees over the last year.  Meanwhile Snap is reportedly considering allowing longer lasting or even permanent videos on Snapchat.  It will apply the Snap shared publicly on this story's features.  Snap is down 52 percent from one year ago.  There's that chart for you.</p><p>Well, Porsche is speeding past Tesla in a fast charging race.  The car maker says it new Porsche Taycan is going to be able to add more than 60 miles of charge in just four minutes.  That will be the fastest available today, exceeding Tesla's super charging stations which needs about 30 minutes to charge a vehicle's battery to at least 80 percent.  Charging times are a key selling point obviously for these car makers and now Porsche is giving Taycan owners three years of free charging.</p><p>And obviously we're going to be hearing from Tesla this week, Maria.  Earnings are coming out from Elon Musk and company.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Cheryl -- thank you so much.</p><p>Coming up next, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi challenged over her words describing a border wall as immoral.  We will break it down when we come back.</p><p>Then support on the links, fans rallying around a pro golfer whose two shot penalty was deemed unfair.  More on that.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Keeping America safe, the government is back open but the focus now is whether President Trump can make a deal with Democratic leadership on funding for the border wall.</p><p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has called it immoral, any wall is immoral.  But her home state of California protects the southern border in some places with an actual wall -- the wall separating Tijuana and San Diego.</p><p>Joining me right now is Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell.  And the last time you were on you said you wanted to look at this again.  Congresswoman -- it's good to see you.</p><p>REP. DEBBIE DINGELL (D), MICHIGAN:  It's good to see you.  Welcome to Washington.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.</p><p>What's your take on this?  I mean can Nancy Pelosi really get away with calling a wall immoral when she has a wall in her own state, separating Tijuana from San Diego?</p><p>DINGELL:  Here is what I think is going to happen.  You've got strong countries (ph), both sides of the aisle, both houses.  They're going to go into that room and they want to cut a deal that's going to keep our nation safe.  I don't think anybody wants to see what we just went through for 35 days.</p><p>It hurt the economy.  It hurt -- and I do believe -- this is going to sound corny but I don't -- you know, why do we point -- why do we need to have a Trump win, a Pelosi win.  We need an American win.</p><p>So I'm hoping they're going to go in that room.  I've talked to my colleagues on both sides.  I've talked to Roy Blunt.  I've talked to all my Democratic colleagues in the House.  They want to win.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DINGELL:  They want to go in and put together a package that's going to keep --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So how do you win?  What's the position in terms of wall funding?  Because they may very well -- your colleagues may very well come back and say ok, here's $5 billion towards border security, not a dime toward a wall.</p><p>DINGELL:  I don't know -- if people are really working together, that may not happen.  You know, there may be money, if there are appropriate places for a wall or fence or --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is there a movement within your party, do you think, among your colleagues that they feel that, yes, some money should go for an actual barrier?</p><p>DINGELL:  I think what I hear among my colleagues is let's go into a room and do something that makes sense.  Let's come up with -- we need to -- I've said this to you a million times.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DINGELL:  We need to strengthen our borders at both sides.  Everybody talks about the southern border.  I've got this northern border too which just had a huge human trafficking problem again in the last few --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But there are areas of the southern border that are very dense.  In other words like when you just look at the wall in Nancy's state and that is three million people on one side in Tijuana, three million people on the other side in San Diego.  If you tear that wall down -- I mean isn't it obvious many of the people on the Tijuana side will assimilate into the United States?</p><p>DINGELL:  Then let me ask you this question.  Build a wall, tear down a wall -- are there structures that are working that are in place?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  .</p><p>DINGELL:  So that's -- what I do think we need drones.  We need to fill the 3,000 open patrol --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's common ground, both sides believe in that.</p><p>DINGELL:  Both agree --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Technology and drones -- definitely.</p><p>DINGELL:  We need technology.  We need to make these ports safer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Specifically in a dense area, like Tijuana/San Diego, drones wouldn't work.  I mean maybe you want that in addition to a wall.  When you have such a dense area, where there's three million people on one side of the wall and three m million on the other, don't you need an actual barrier?</p><p>DINGELL:  But they are going to go in this room.  There are people that know what they're doing.  They're people -- they're senior people that have been on homeland security, people from the areas that are impacted --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think they're going to deal?  We won't shut down the government again?</p><p>DINGELL:  I pray to God, we never shut down the government.  Not only do I pray to God that doesn't come out of conference but you're going to see Republicans and Democrats working together.  We'll get --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This whole wall issue, Congresswoman, sort of underscores what's going on I think in both parties.  Now you've got former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz seeing an opening as a result of the radicalness on both sides.</p><p>He's facing backlash on his first stop for his book tour last night.  It was his first public appearance after announcing a possible Independent presidential run.  It did not go smoothly.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire (EXPLETIVE DELETED).  Go back to (INAUDIBLE) on Twitter.  Go back to Davos with the other billionaire elites who think they know how to run the world.  That's not what the country needs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  You know, I give you a lot of credit just being in politics, by the way.</p><p>Schultz is also being criticized by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, billionaire.  He tweeted this, \"In 2020 the great likelihood is that an Independent would just split the anti-Trump vote and end up reelecting the President.  That's a risk.  I refused to run in 2016 and we can't afford it right now.</p><p>Congresswoman -- do you think an Independent run is viable?  Do you think an Independent run from Schultz would hurt the Democrats?</p><p>DINGELL:  I think it's viable.  He has the money to spend it.  But I think he would hurt the Democrats.  I'm fearful that I am -- I'm trying to step back.  I'm not getting any candidate I want to see who is going to emerge, who's got people skills.</p><p>But this is dangerous.  And as you know, told you two years ago, Donald Trump could become president.  Nobody believed me.  You all thought I was crazy.  You may not have but most people did.</p><p>And I still think he could get reelected.  And if we do not run a strong campaign and we don't have somebody like that that pulls votes off --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  One of the issues is the messaging of what the platform is.  So what do you think the Democratic candidate for 2020 should have as their platform?  What's most important?</p><p>DINGELL:  You know what we didn't do and one of the reasons I believe firmly that President Trump became President Trump.  One, people are tired of partisan bickering.  They're tired of seeing things not get done in Washington.</p><p>There are a lot of people that are hurting in this country, just working men and women who want to know that we actually care about them.  They're scared about healthcare.  They're scared about escalating drug costs.  There's -- look at our --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So healthcare should be the platform?</p><p>DINGELL:  it's one piece of it.  Infrastructure, let's create jobs.  What are we going to do about education?  Trade?</p><p>Now, the President -- you want to know why he won Michigan?  Trade.  They're tired of bad trade deals that ship jobs overseas.  We don't have a level playing field.  The President's trade policy is all over the place.</p><p>It's not consistent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you going to vote for the ratification of USMCA?</p><p>DINGELL:  I don't call it USMC.  I call it NAFTA 2.0.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you going to vote for ratification.</p><p>DINGELL:  I haven't decided yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is on your plate now in the next month.</p><p>DINGELL:  Very much on my plate.  And talk to Lighthizer about it all the time.  But I'm not voting for any bill that doesn't have and acting legislation that keeps more manufacturing from going to Mexico.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wasn't that one of the key things of this new law?</p><p>DINGELL:  But Blazer still went to --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Keeping jobs here.</p><p>DINGELL:  Blazers went to Mexico in July.  I'm not seeing any more American cars go to Mexico and get built for $1.50 to $3.50 and then gets shipped back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you want a change before you vote for it?</p><p>DINGELL:  He knows how I feel.  I'm not -- one of the more likely people to vote for it but I'm not voting for it in the form that it's in right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.   We'll leave it there.</p><p>Congresswoman -- it's good to see you.</p><p>DINGELL:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.  Congresswoman Debbie Dingell joining us here.</p><p>Coming up, the longest government shutdown in American history is over.  But another shutdown threat is on the horizon.  We will talk about the next three weeks, what it looks like with House Minority Leader, Kevin McCarthy.  He's up next.</p><p>Then you've got a friend again.  The new teaser trailer for \"Toy Story 4\" drops with a big surprise.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Tuesday, January 29th.  Your top stories right now at 7:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Earnings season in full swing this morning for the fourth quarter.  Several Dow components reporting their fourth quarter this morning.  Verizon reported a mixed quarter earlier this hour.  Pfizer and 3M also under pressure this morning as you can see.  3M up three percent, although Pfizer and Verizon down better than one percent.</p><p>Rising tensions with China continuing, the U.S. bringing charges against Chinese telecom company Huawei as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning between the two nations.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will be joining me as my special guest this morning at the top of the hour, 8:00 a.m. Eastern.  Join us for that talk on China and the economy as we break it all down with the Treasury secretary.</p><p>Markets this morning are hovering around the flat line.  Take a look.  Dow Industrials up 20 points right now, 26 higher.  The S&amp;P 500 is down by almost one point and the NASDAQ down about three points.</p><p>All this after the major indices finished lower yesterday across the board at 04:00 on Wall Street.  Dow industrials were down 208 points and then actually was off of the lows of the -- of the day, down almost one percent at the close.  S&amp;P 500 gave up 21 points, that was three-quarters of one percent.  And the NASDAQ was down 79 points, better than one percent lower.</p><p>In Europe this morning, a mixed story, actually mostly higher.  FT-100 at the high of the morning right here, up 1-1/4 percent, 83 points higher, ahead of the British vote on the U.K. leaving the E.U.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is up 42 points, almost one percent higher and the DAX Index in Germany higher by 25, quarter of a percent higher there.</p><p>Asian markets mostly quiet overnight.  Take a look, as you can see, it was pretty much across the board.</p><p>$100,000 penalty, how one misstep cost a professional golfer big time.  The outcry, coming up.</p><p>And Woody and Buzz Lightyear are back, the new teaser trailer for \"Toy Story 4\" is out and it marks the return of one character after 20 years.  We will bring it to you.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning.  But first, our top story this half an hour, shutdown showdown, the government open for business again after the last -- at least for the next three weeks, rather.  But the main issue, funding the wall has not been resolved and the White House is not letting it go.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  What I do know is that if they don't come back with a deal, that means Democrats get virtually nothing.  That will make the president and force him to have to take executive action that does not give Democrats the things that they want.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is the House Minority leader, Congressman Kevin McCarthy.  Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you.</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  Thanks for having me back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So, what do the next three weeks look like?  Take us through these negotiating.  Do you expect any money for the wall?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  I expect us to solve this problem in the end.  What's interesting here is the whole time speaker Pelosi said I couldn't negotiate anything until you open up government.  The president put the public first and said OK, let's go through, I'll give you three weeks.</p><p>Now Wednesday, we'll have the conference committee, the senators and the congressional members' appropriation sit down and we'll see if they're serious about it, if they're willing to do something.  Because I believe Nancy Pelosi is out of step with her own party.  If you look at her number two, Steny Hoyer.  He said of course, that walls are not immoral, and that he believes some fencing involved.  From her Agricultural secretary to her Agricultural chair to our Armed Services chair, they both believe in a wall too.  Her Agriculture chairman said give Trump the money.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and she continues to say that it's immoral which I find incredible given the fact she has a wall in her own state.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  As my state too.  You know what I find --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And your state too, exactly.  California.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  You know what I find immoral?  When you really talk about this, this is about stopping human trafficking.  In 2016, they stopped more than 2,000 individuals involved in that.  I think it's immoral that you would allow that to continue.  I don't believe anybody in America that says they support border security believes that there is no such thing as some barrier.</p><p>And the president said, he does not a -- he does not want a wall from sea to shining sea.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  He just believes in the area you need some form of barrier and he's correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, where do you think are the most important areas that you would need the wall?  I mean, we talked earlier about this wall in your state, Tijuana, San Diego where it's very dense, three million people on one side, three million people on the other.  Can you make the case that that dense area is elsewhere where that's why the president is so stuck on having this wall there?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  And it's not the president saying, it's the experts.  The president sat down with the experts and they said this is what we need to be able to secure our border.</p><p>So in certain areas, like in San Diego, we stopped illegal movement by more than 95 percent.  You look at Yuma, Arizons, El Paso another -- El Paso became one of the safest cities in the nation after being able to put it through.  That's what we need, in certain parts of the country along the border, you need a barrier.  In other parts you could put the drones in this part area.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what are you expecting to give on?  And what -- do you think they're going to offer the $5.7 billion that the president wants for border security?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  But we're arguing over one-tenth of one percent of the budget.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a great point.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  The Democrats have voted for a wall before.  But now that the president brings forward what the experts want, they say no.  That is what's so confusing to me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, what -- why is this so important for the president right now?  Going into 2020, I mean, is she seeing this as a campaign promise and that's why he doesn't -- she won't agree to it.  Because I don't know how she can call it immoral, given the wall in her own state, your own state.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Again, it's such a little price to pay for so much more security when you look at the human trafficking.  Think of the number of lives that we will save from this process if we have a secure border.</p><p>But what's more importantly, it's the president that sat down and tried to be reasonable, find common ground.  He's the one who brought DACA into it.</p><p>And let's not forget, speaker Pelosi just a year ago holds the record for the longest speech on the floor, eight hours, over one issue, DACA, which she shut the government down over.  And now she thinks that's not important?  I think those people are important as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think that this -- a negotiation, an agreement will include a DACA deal?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  It could.  It doesn't have to.  But because the Democrats and speaker Pelosi have been saying no.  The president said he was willing to go there, three more years of DACA for a portion of the border security that the experts are asking for.  I just find her out of step with her own party.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, there seems to be a movement within the party, even some of the newer congress people coming in, fresher faces saying you know what, yes, we do need border security and we do need the money.  So, are they going head to head?  I mean, are they -- do they even have a voice?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  They don't even have a voice.  Because remember, she has so much power.  She will not allow the vote to come up.  I believe inside the conference we could come up with an agreement.  The question is, will speaker Pelosi even allow that to be voted on the floor?  If we had a vote on the floor, I believe it would pass.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think that the president will allow the government to shut down again?  I mean, is the president really prepared to have another government shutdown if he doesn't get the money?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Look, I think the president's going to try to find a way to solve this one way or another.  I don't know that shutting the government down solves it.  I there's other ways to do that the president can.  I know he firmly believes in a legislative process.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Should he call for a national emergency?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  He has the power to do that.  I think the best road forward right now is a legislative agreement.  And what's so interesting to me, I'd listened to these Democrats celebrate Nancy Pelosi.  You celebrated someone that got you status quo.  They're still a DACA problem, they're still a border security problem.</p><p>And government is designed to find common ground and compromise.  The president was the one person looking reasonable in all these discussions.  I know the president's committed to this.  He will get the border secure one way or another.  He's giving the Democrats an opportunity.  He gave them an opportunity all along this discussion.  They said then open up the government, they'll discuss it.  So he did that and gave them a three week time.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean, I think this whole thing, the government shutdown and the constant resist upsets people.  I mean, you have to wonder if in fact -- you know, she keeps resisting everything that the president wants, if the people will turn on her.  Because people want to see you guys get something done.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Yes, she is celebrating status quo.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  That's not where we need to be --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me move on and ask you about 2010, congressman.  Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz thinking about running for office.  He was at a book signing last night in New York and he was heckled over his bid.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump.  You egotistical billionaire (INAUDIBLE).  Go back to getting ratioed on Twitter.  Go back to Davos with the other billionaire elites who think they know how to run the world.  That's not what the country needs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This heckler not the only one weighing in.  Michael Bloomberg former mayor of New York City also told Schultz not to run as an independent.  He said this, given the strong pull of partisanship and the realities of the electoral college system, there's no way an independent can win.  That is truer today than ever before.  Is that where we are, an independent can't win, congressman?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  No, I think it's Bloomberg upset.  Because remember, he went from a Republican to an independent to a Democrat and he just spent $120 million giving to the Democrats so they can win the majority in the House and he doesn't want his money to be wasted, so he doesn't want competition.</p><p>Look, I think there's ample opportunity for an independent to get in this race, only because the Democrats are now become social Democrats.  They're talking about a 70 percent tax rate.  They're talking about these green deals.  They're talking about socialism.  If you listen to what some of these new Democrats say, they think Venezuela's problem is not because they're a socialist country, it's because of sanctions.  They're so out of step.  They are putting letters in to help those who want to go sign up for ISIS, to be easy on them to the judge.  I mean, I have -- this is not the America we live in, and that's the difference.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  This party is so out of step and I think you'll find a lot of moderate Democrats who say I want somebody else who could talk about this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, that's why a number of moderate Democrats can't really get the OK from the party leadership because they're not left enough.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  This new socialist Democrat Party has left the Democratic Party.  They are in to -- remember, Bernie Sanders is not registered as a Democrat.  He's registered as a socialist.  AOC does not call herself a Democrat, she calls herself a Democrat socialist.  This party is moving to a whole different place.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Real quick before you go, when the election happened back in November.  You said one of your priorities going to be to get the majority back.  How are you going to do it?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Well, first of all, you've got to make sure you can recruit.  I think, you put the ideas up there.  Ideas should win at the end of the day.  You look at where we are financially in this country.  A lot of that happens to do with the policies that we're able to create, from the tax policy, the battle we had with you human trafficking and other that we were able to do.  I think you're going to find as going directly to, we've got to find a suburban areas to be able to win again in and I think we're going to be very successful.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, it's good to see you.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Congressman Kevin McCarthy, joining us there.</p><p>Still ahead, Richard Trumka AFL-CIO president on the impact of the shutdown on American workers, what he'd like to see, back in a moment with that.</p><p>And then, support on the links, a pro golfer given a big fine and a two-shot penalty which many are calling grossly unfair.  What went wrong, right here.</p><p>Plus, you've got a friend and a big surprise, the trailer for \"Toy Story 4\" drops with a character we haven't seen in 20 years.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Prosecutors resting their case against Joaquin El Chapo Guzman.  Cheryl Casone in New York with details and headlines, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It; must something else, Maria.  The federal government has now rested its case.  They called 56 witnesses.  The trial of the notorious Mexican drug kingpin started back in mid-November.  El Chapo told the trial judge yesterday he will not take the stand in his own defense.  One witness is scheduled to appear for the defense today.  Closing arguments expected to take place tomorrow and Thursday.  Big story, a lot of New Yorkers have been following very closely.</p><p>Well, professional golfer Haotong Li is getting a huge outpouring of support from fellow golfers after losing out on nearly $100,000 Saturday for a minor infraction.  It happened at the Omega Dubai Desert Classic.  Li was on the 18th green when judges accuses caddie of standing too close behind him as he got ready to putt.  Well, the ensuing penalty dropped Li's score from 71 to 73.  And he went from third to 12th.  Tour officials say the correct call was made but acknowledge it was grossly unfair.  They're looking at the giving referees more discretion in cases like this going forward.</p><p>And then, get ready for \"Toy Story 4\".  Pixar is putting out this teaser video, shows the revival of Woody's love interest, Bo Peep.  And she is back with a new, more modern look.  She was last seen in \"Toy Story 2\", back in 1999.  It is now 20 years later, \"Toy Story 4\" is going to be released, Maria, this June .  Those are your headlines from New York, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like it.  Bo Peep.  All right, thank you Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, the lingering effects of the shutdown showdown.  AFL-CIO Richard Trumka will join us to talk about the impact on American workers.  He's up next.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We are focused on the American worker this morning.  White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney saying that the 800,000 federal workers who were not paid twice during the partial government shutdown should receive those checks by the end of this week.</p><p>Joining us right now is American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organization's president, AFL-CIO, Richard Trumka.  It's great to see you, Richard.  Thank you so much for being here.</p><p>RICHARD TRUMKA, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR AND CONGRESS OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION:  Maria, thanks for having me on today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Give us your take on what the impact of the shutdown was.</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, I think there's several impacts.  There's impact on the people and you not only have government workers who get back pay but you have the government contractors who won't get back pay unless something is done.  That was a devastating effect on them.  It had a devastating effect on the economy itself.  $11 billion, although we'll pick some of that back up later in the year.</p><p>But you had a devastating effect on the airline industry where you had people, airline controllers, traffic controllers that were in school that actually just up and left.  They said we're not going to do this anymore (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What could -- what could have been done about it then, Rich?  Because you as the leader that you are and representing so many workers across the country have to be unnerved when you see open borders and illegals coming in and taking your jobs.</p><p>TRUMKA:  Look, that's just not how it works anymore.  I mean, you have people that got laid off from the president's place that have been here 20 years.  They're not taking anybody's job.  What we want to do is make sure every worker in this country has the same rights so that they can't be exploited.</p><p>Because what happens right now with undocumented workers is, they're great when no one's around.  When they try to organize and get a voice, then they start squeezing them.  They start ex -- you know, doing, calling in ICE and different things.</p><p>The idea is if everybody has the same rights, then they can't exploit those people and everybody can actually have a fair playing field.  What happens to American workers -- employers right now, is you have an employer that hires people, makes them work in unfair condition, misclassifies them, underpays them, and they're competing against our employer.  That employer needs to pay everybody the same rate, live by the same working conditions, so that we can all compete.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you're OK with illegals coming in and as long as everybody's treated the same?</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, Maria, it's a -- it's a nice cliche, illegals coming in.  But you know yourself that most people that are here undocumented or illegally came in legally.  So the whole system needs to be addressed.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, but there are apprehensions that we could look at, just in the month of December, just in the month of November, where apprehensions were of illegal immigrants coming in and wanting asylum in the United States.</p><p>TRUMKA:  There's no question that the system is broken.  We need to fix the system and have a path towards citizenship so that those workers that have been here for years and are actually making the economy run, even the president's golf courses and things like that, they have a chance to get citizenship and they work their work there.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Just a question on the golf courses.  As you know, that's the H2B program, people who come here as foreign workers, come under a specified amount of time for DOL.  I think the real question is is that, what happens to all the people, not who have been here who came legally and overstayed the visa, but what about all the people who come every day at the southern border and can cross into our country?  That's really the pernicious problem.  And even on wall, built with American workers, you'd be for that.</p><p>TRUMKA:  But listen, the people that come back and forth, you have Americans that go to Mexico and Mexicans that come to America to work.  I think Mexico --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you don't think there's a problem at the border at all?</p><p>TRUMKA:  I didn't say that.  There is -- there is a problem.  We do need border security.  And no, I don't think that a wall's the answer to it.  Every time someone's tried to build a wall it's not been very successful.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, the one in Tijuana is successful.</p><p>TRUMKA:  Ask the Chinese, ask the French.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The wall -- the wall in Tijuana --</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Ask Tijuana (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tijuana and San Diego, what abut that Richard?</p><p>TRUMKA:  I'm sorry?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The wall, between Tijuana -- separating Tijuana from San Diego, is that successful?</p><p>TRUMKA:  There are places -- there are places probably where it works.  Is that the answer to everything?  No.  Should that have been the reason for a shutdown?  Absolutely not.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  I want -- I want to ask a broader political question.  We've seen in the last two elections that increasingly voters, blue collar voters, voters in manufacturing towns all over America, the kind of rank and file people that you represent are voting for Republicans, they're going for Trump.  Does the AFL-CIO need to realign its own approach to politics in this town, given that more and more of its people are going with people like Donald Trump and his trade policies and the Republican Party?</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, that's a -- that's a question we could talk about two or three hours for.  First of all, we have realigned our politics.  We are issuing -- we're issue oriented right now.  We put an issue out and if a politician supports that issue, then we support them.</p><p>In fact, in this last election we elected two union members to the Senate, three to governorship, 18 to the House of Representative, and 925 to state legislatures, because those workers will go and support our issues.  That's what we try to do.  We find it more and more difficult to find Republicans that actually support us.  Now, the American worker believes that neither the political system --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got to jump.</p><p>TRUMKA:  -- or the economic system works for them.  They want somebody to change the rules.  That's why they voted for Trump.  If he changes the rules to their advantage, some of them will vote for him again.  If he doesn't, he stands a chance of losing those workers and right now he's losing those workers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Richard, thank you so much for joining us.  We appreciate it.  Richard Trumka there.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Show: MORNINGS WITH MARIA][Date: January 29, 2019][Time: 08:00:00][Tran: 012903cb.231][Type: SHOW][Head: Apple Disables Group FaceTime Function That Was Allowing Callers To Listen And View Without Your Consent; British Parliament To Vote On Brexit Amendments; Kudlow on the Economy; Craft Brewers Impacts from the Government Shutdown; Kudlow on China Trade][Sect: News; Domestic][Byline: Maria Bartiromo, Gerri Willis, Ashley Webster, Hillary Vaughn, Dagen McDowell][Guest: Steven Mnuchin, Larry Kudlow, Matt Schlapp, Jon Hilsenrath][Spec: FaceTime; Huawei; Apple; Brexit; Federal Reserve; 3M; Harley-Davidson; Verizon; Oath Media; Channel Inventory; World War II; CBO; Trade Talks; Deregulations; Tax Plan; China Trade; Slowdown; Government Shutdown]</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good Tuesday morning.  Welcome back, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  Live from Washington this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is January 29th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  Earnings in focus.  Investors watching results from several Dow components this morning ahead of the opening bell.  One to watch after the bell tonight -- after the close is Apple.</p><p>Meanwhile, Apple under fire FaceTime hit with a new bug that allows people to eavesdrop on you without your knowledge and even if you don't take the call.  Rising tensions with China, the U.S. brings charges against Chinese telecom company, Huawei as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  The very latest on the state of negotiations with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin coming up.</p><p>Markets are searching for direction this morning.  Take a look at the futures ahead of the open this morning.  Dow industrials picking up speed up 55 points right now, a quarter of a percent higher.  S&amp;P 500 is up two and the NASDAQ right now right now showing a gain of 11 points at the open in about an hour and a half.  This after declines across the board yesterday.  Stocks finished off of the lows, but nonetheless the Dow Industrials gave up 209 points yesterday 4:00, almost one percent lower.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 gave up 21 points, three quarters of a percent lower.  And the NASDAQ was down 79 points.  That was better than one percent lower yesterday.  Global markets this morning are mostly higher.  Take a look at European indices with the FT-100-is at the high of the morning, up 86 points, 1-1/4 percent ahead of the vote on Brexit.  CAC quarante in Paris us up 44 points and the DAX index up 21, fractional gain there.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets were little changed.  Take a look, it was pretty much across the board.  Now, our top story this morning, concerns of a global slowdown.  Last week in Davos I spoke with Bridgewater Associates founder, Ray Dalio, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, and Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey.  Here's what they said about the possibility of an economic slowdown on the horizon.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RAY DALIO, FOUNDER, BRIDGEWATER ASSOCIATES:  Europe has a negative growth and the United States is going to have a negative growth environment.  I don't mean absolute negative, I mean slowing of growth in a material way that could be close to between zero and two percent over the next 18 months.</p><p>BRIAN MOYNIHAN, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, BANK OF AMERICA:  We have the top research firm in the world, and they have done a great job.  And they have the U.S. growing at 2-1/2 percent this year.  The world growing 3-1/2 percent GDP growth.  But that's down from last year.  And so the confusion in the environment right now is a slowdown or is it going in to a recession?</p><p>Nothing we see says it's close to a recession.</p><p>JAMES QUINCEY, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, COCA-COLA:  I think we are in danger of talking ourselves into a problem.  It's just a little bit slower growth.  It's not a recession or a decline.  So we see -- we see a little -- a little softer 2019, maybe a little less tail wind than 2018.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now in a Fox Business exclusive is the treasury secretary of the United States, Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  Great to see you, Secretary.</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, UNITED STATES TREASURY SECRETARY:  Great to see you as well, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.  Your reaction to really what seems like now a unanimous feeling that a slowdown is on the horizon.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, Maria, from everything we see, the U.S. economy is still quite strong.  The companies are doing quite well.  And we see still tremendous investment in capital and human investments.  There's no question that as it relates to Europe and China, there is a slowdown.  We're monitoring that carefully.  But we still see a tremendous opportunity and a lot of capital coming into the U.S.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Federal Reserve basically told us they are on pause.  They may even pause the balance sheet unwind which is also telling us that the Fed is also expecting a slowdown, but do you believe a recession is on the horizon in 2020 even though you're seeing strength and stability so far?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  We see no indications whatsoever of a recession on the horizon.  And from everything we see from speaking to a large across the board businesses, the combination of tax reform, regulatory relief and trade is still has a very strong impact on the U.S. economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And some people are saying that the impact of certainly of trade and tariffs is causing some uncertainty.  So how much of this slowdown that we're expecting later on even if it's not right now is due to what you say you're watching China and Europe and how much of it is uncertainty around the President's tariffs program?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, Maria, as you said, there are people who expect a slowdown but I would just comment a year ago with the projections were 2-1/2 percent.  And we were at three.  We feel very comfortable we're going to hit three for last year.  And we think there's still a very good case for three percent this year.  Now, as it relates to trade, we couldn't be more pleased with the USMCA.  We are looking forward to Congress passing that quickly.</p><p>That's a very important trade deal.  We have two days of talks with China starting tomorrow.  The President is going to be involved in those talks at the conclusion.  We've been updating him.  We have another 30 days after this.  So I think we're making significant progress, and I think on the trade front, these are all very positive impacts for the U.S. economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about the trade talks because this story of China, first off, thank you to the President and to the administration for pushing back on China because that's another unanimous feeling out there, that the President did the right thing in terms of stopping China from some of its practices.  What are you expecting out of these talks?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, the President wants fair trade with China.  It's got to be reciprocal.  Right now China has free access into our markets, and we have limited access to there.  So the critical issue that we've talked about is market access, making sure there aren't forced joint ventures, not forced transfer of technology and that we have a mechanism that when we reach an agreement that we can monitor that agreement and that they'll live up to it.</p><p>And that's how I expect we will make significant progress this week on those issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How much of a priority is espionage?  Obviously the administration unveiling a sweeping set of criminal charges against Huawei Technologies.  We have had on a number of CEOs that have said yes, they have stolen trade secrets from us.  Has this come into the conversation with your Chinese leadership?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  No, let me be clear.  Those are separate issues.  And that's a separate dialogue.  So as it relates to the Huawei issues that's being run by the Justice Department.  I have no involvement in that.  I found out about that yesterday when it was announced.  So those are not part of trade discussions.  Forced technology issues are part of trade discussions but any issues as it relates to violation of U.S. law or U.S. sanctions are going through a separate track, which is the Justice Department.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, I guess the broader issue is, is this a cultural thing in China?  I mean this weekend on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" over on Fox News I spoke with the ranking member of the Intel Committee, House Intel Committee Devin Nunes and he went through some of the practices that China does every day.  Listen to this.  I've got to get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  China might have accessed allied intelligence shared with Poland and passed it on to Moscow.</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R), CALIFORNIA:  What the Chinese are doing is that they have these companies that are essentially owned by the party, the Communist Party and essentially this is a dictatorship.  There's very few people that own these companies.  They weaponize the.  So when all over the -- all over the world you have Chinese technology specifically as it relates to infrastructure on -- communications infrastructure, they will go in and they beat every other company around the world.</p><p>And in fact, they've driven a lot of companies out of business because they come in undercut.  They want to have control over all the com systems or communication systems all over the globe.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's pretty incredible.  We will handle your infrastructure of telecom and then they have a way in of spying.  How can you separate that from the conversation on trade and on forced transfer of technology?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Maria, I think you can easily separate these issues.  So there are two different issues.  One is an issue of state subsidies where they do subsidize state enterprises and they compete unfairly.  Those are trade issues, those are violations of the WTO and that's something from an economic standpoint.  We are going to enforce very seriously.  I think you know among the National Security Council, so I'm going to be careful what I say on national security issues.</p><p>But I assure you whether it's China or anywhere else in the world, our security services, DHS and others will make sure that we protect the U.S. infrastructure, we protect from cyberattacks.  That's something we're very well aware of.  But these are separate issues and shouldn't be confused.  We are focused on what are unfair economic practices.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So the best case that you can get from China is what?  Opening up their markets?  Already we are seeing some likelihood of that, UBS I guess was the first bank that was allowed to operate in China and own 51 percent of that bank.  They say they're going to go to 100 percent in three years.  Are you seeing a significant opening in terms of the Chinese willingness to open their markets to foreigners?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I do, but I think that's a good start.  But why should we have to wait three years for a U.S. company to own 100 percent in the financial services?  China can operate and own 100 percent of companies here.  So that's an example where, you know, they're moving in the right direction.  We want to speed that up.  But the issue is really we want to make sure that U.S. companies can compete fairly in China.</p><p>And if we can do that, China has a very large growing middle class.  It's an enormous market.  As I have said before, this is one of the biggest opportunities for U.S. companies in U.S. business if we can get this right.  And President Trump is determined.  This is the first administration that has aggressively said to China, you need to play fair.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is the President willing to drop all tariffs, should he get a good deal that's acceptable?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I think everything is on the table.  So the President is -- will look at, again, the objective is to have a very fair deal.  Hopefully we'll make progress this week.  The President will be involved in these negotiations and discussions.  And we've still got a lot of work to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the President said look, I'm a tariff guy.  I like tariffs.  So does that mean these tariffs are for, you know, no end in sight or would he be willing to drop the tariffs all together?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  The President hasn't made any decisions on that.  There have been no recommendations from the economic team on that yet.  The first step is to make sure we get a good agreement.  And when we get a good agreement, we'll make a recommendation to the President and he will consider that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have seen the Chinese economy get impacted.  You're still talking about 6.4 percent growth, we think, but that is lower than some people think.  What's your worry or how concerning is it that the Chinese slowdown will impact the United States?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, there's no question that China is slowing down.  They still have significant growth rates.  We're beginning to see the impact on that on world growth.  Our objective is not to slow down China.  Our objective is to make sure that U.S. companies can do business in China and can do business fairly.  So we're monitoring these issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary, stay with us.  We want to get into the shutdown and get your impact on how much the shutdown cost the economy and what you're expecting there.  Stay with us.  More of my exclusive interview with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin when we come right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are life live this morning in Washington, D.C.  And I'm sitting right now with -- in a Fox Business exclusive with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  And Treasury Mnuchin, we were talking about the broad economy.  I want to ask your thoughts on the shutdown.  The CBO says that the shutdown caused $11 billion impact to the economy, $3 billion which is completely lost because of the 35-day shutdown.  Your reaction?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Maria, Kevin Hassett, the CEA is working on final numbers for us.  I think his view is that there's no question that there was some cost but those costs will be recovered as money comes back into the system.  I think it's -- he views that it will almost all be recovered.  Now as it relates to the exact numbers, I haven't seen the final numbers yet.  But the good news is we got the government open.</p><p>People are back to work and we have not seen any significant impact on the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Has -- is the President prepared to shut down the government again in three weeks if he doesn't get the money for the border wall?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Maria, I had dinner last night with the President, the Vice President, Senator Lindsey Graham.  We had a very good discussion on this issue.  There's no question in my mind that the President, the Vice President want to do a fair deal.  Lindsey has been terrific in helping to negotiate this.  I hope the Democrats are sincere.  If they are, there's a sincere deal that will include a lot of different issues that need to be resolved.</p><p>But if they're not sincere, the President has all his options on the table.  And he's determined that he's going to make sure we have border security.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's the impact on the IRS?  There's a lot of worry out there that people are not going to get their checks after April 15th as a result of this shutdown.  What can we expect?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, let me just comment on both the treasury, our bureaus, the IRS in particular, I want to thank the enormous number of government employees who came in and worked during the shutdown.  I think as you know, we had the ability to bring in critical employees.  We never would have been able to do the sanctions that we've been doing over the last month without the hardworking people.</p><p>And the IRS had a large number of critical employees to make sure that we were ready to open for business as usual.  So we're ready to open for tax season.  We're taking tax returns.  We'll be ready for tax refunds.  We will have the phones restaffed.  Now, let me just say that there's no question, this time of the year, there's very, very heavy call volume.  That's something we have to manage.  I encourage taxpayers who have questions to try to go to the web first.</p><p>But we are ready for tax season, and I can assure you that tax refunds will be paid as normal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  So, tax refunds will be paid as normal.  That's the bottom line.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  People were worried about that.  Let me move to the sanctions and in particular Venezuela because you've applied sanctions on the Venezuelan oil industry.  Tell us specifically what the impact here is.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, sanctions are a very important tool in our national security portfolio.  And when we look at national security issues, we look at economic tools.  We look at diplomacy.  We look at national security tools, military options.  So there's no question that what we're trying to do is to cut off the money to the regime that should not be in power and make sure that the President Guaido has access to funds and has access to the assets of the country.</p><p>And to make sure we protect these assets for the people of Venezuela.  It's really quite sad.  This is a country that is very, very rich in oil resources that has had extraordinary poverty and extraordinary humanitarian issues over the last issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And have you spoken with the opposition leader party about this?  What has been the response so far?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I haven't personally, but I know the Vice President has been in communication.  I think the response has been very positive.  We've been very careful in balancing this.  We've -- I've spoken to many of the refineries over the last week.  I want to make sure that there was significant capacity.  There's a lot of oil on the water already in transit to the U.S. refineries.  So I think on the one hand, we've been able to cut off Venezuelan oil going forward.</p><p>But we're managing this with the U.S. refineries.  We've issued licenses for the U.S. refineries to continue to operate.  And if Venezuela wants to continue to sell us oil, which we would like to buy that money would go into blocked accounts and will be protected for the people of Venezuela.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what about other industries in Venezuela?  I mean, the sanctions are on the oil industry.  What about other money, other imports that they still get that?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  We will always look at additional sanctions.  We want to make sure that things like medicine and other humanitarian issues continue to go to the people.  We will always look at additional sanctions to make sure we protect the assets of the country for the people of Venezuela.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why was it important for the President to back the opposition leader?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I think he is the rightful leader of the country, the national assembly, the constitution.  I think, you know, democracy is very important to the people of the United States.  And we want to make sure that there are free and fair elections and that there is a proper democracy that's very important to the national security of the United States.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary, it's good to have you on the program.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you very much.  Secretary Steven Mnuchin joining us.  Coming up, earnings in focus.  Major companies reporting this week including Apple after the bell tonight.  What you need to know ahead of those numbers.  Then the U.K. facing a crucial test.  British lawmakers voting later today on measures surrounding the U.K.'s potential exit from the European Union.  Back in a moment with that.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Earnings driving markets this morning.  3M, Harley-Davidson, Verizon out with mixed reports this morning.  Gerri Willis is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange watching markets.  Gerri?</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  That's right.  3M, Dow component, a split decision here missing on estimates beating on revenue.  The EPS line $2.27 a share.  Revenue 7.95 billion.  They lowered their 2019 guidance.  But they say they're positioned for success in 2019 despite the global slowdown.  Stock trading higher.  Harley-Davidson, let's get to that, a big miss on both the top and the bottom line.</p><p>EPS of 17 cents a share.  Revenue of 955 million.  The stock is down and down hard this morning nearly 10 percent.  They're citing restructuring charges, incremental tariffs and recall costs.  Big troubles for the hog.  Verizon beating on EPs but missing on revenue.  We're seeing yet another split decision here.  EPS of a $1.12 a share.  Revenue of 34.3 billion.  The stock trading down nearly four percent here.</p><p>Profit hurt by the restructuring of Oath Media business as we have discussed.  Apple coming after the bell, this is critical earnings release for the markets here.  EPS estimate of $4.17 a share.  Revenue of 84 billion.  We will be focused like a laser on iPhone.  iPhone sales in China, is there an iPhone recession going on in China right now?  Watch Channel Inventory for some of the details about that.</p><p>Meanwhile, Apple having trouble with FaceTime.  A bug where callers can eavesdrop on FaceTime calls has cropped up.  The company says they are checking it.  But you should know that Tim Cook on Monday, well, he was saying big things about International Data Privacy Day asking users to insist on reforms.  Oops, I guess they got a problem.  Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Gerri.  Thanks very much.  Gerri Willis on Wall Street.  British lawmakers will debate several amendments to the U.K.'s planned exit from the European Union today and let Prime Minister Theresa May know what parliament is prepared to vote for.  Ashley Webster is live in London right now with that.  Ashley?</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.  Good morning, Maria.  This is if Parliament knows exactly what it will vote for.  There will be at least 15 amendments to choose from -- will be debated.  That will be up to the Common Speaker John Bercow.  He will decide which ones will be debated.  And it could indeed shape the future of what Brexit will look like moving forward.</p><p>Now, among the most popular amendments that we are expecting to be the debated will be what's called the Cooper amendment, that's Yvette Cooper, the Labour M.P.  It basically says if no deal is reached by February the 26th, it would postpone Brexit for nine months essentially to end of the year from march 29th, that's the date that exists now.  Then there's the Brady amendment, the Graham Brady (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>He basically is putting forward an amendment that would replace the Irish backstop with what is called alternative arrangements, such pretty vague, basically anything elsewhere and what we have now and there is no time limit on that backstop.  We have heard that Prime Minister Theresa May has already told European leaders that she wants to reopen Brexit negotiations.  Let's not forget, just last month, in December, the Prime Minister said it wasn't going to be reopened that the E.U had given her their best deal.</p><p>Now she wants to turn around and say look, you need to reopen negotiations.  I'm going to find out from Parliament what they are prepared to vote for and let's go from there.  And it calls today is January 29th.  The Brexit deadline, March 29th.  We have exactly two months left to go, Maria.  And let's be honest, there is no sign yet of a -- of a deal in place that a majority of people in Parliament can get behind.</p><p>Yesterday we had a whole series of warnings about what would happen if there was a no deal scenario.  Just crashing out retail consortiums saying, look, there's going to be empty shelves, prices are going to go up, a break in the supply chain.  It will be very, very detrimental to the British economy.  So that is the background.  Later on today, we'll find out what Parliament can get behind.  Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Ashley.  Thanks so much.  We'll check back with you.  Ashley Webster in London this morning.  Coming up.  The shutdown impact on your wallet.  I will be speaking with National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow on the economic effects of the shutdown.  Plus Federal debt reportedly headed to the highest level since World War II.</p><p>That is next.  One brewery feeling the impact.  The shutdown hitting one San Diego beer company.  We've got that story.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thank so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo coming to you live this morning from Washington, D.C.  It is Tuesday, January 29th.  Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Earnings season in full swing.  We have heard from Harley-Davidson, hit in the pre-markets after disappointing numbers.  Xerox as well headed higher after beating expectations.  Look at Harley-Davidson's shares down almost 10 percent right now.  China, one of the issues, once again.  Meanwhile rising tensions with China on the U.S. level.  The U.S. bringing charges against Chinese telecom company, Huawei, as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  Moments ago, I spoke with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin who talked about what the U.S. is looking for in the coming talks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MNUCHIN:  The President wants fair trade with China.  It's got to be reciprocal.  Right now, China has free access into our markets and we have limited access to there.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Futures this morning are higher.  Take a look, we have the highs of the morning right here with the Dow Jones Industrial average up 73 points, a third of a percent.  The S&amp;P 500 up 4-1/2, and the NASDAQ higher by 18 points, one-quarter of one percent.  European indices this morning are also higher.  Take a look.  FT-100 in London is up almost 100 points, 1-1/2 percent.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is up 55, better than one percent.  And the DAX Index in Germany up 37 points, that's one-third of one percent.  Asian markets mostly flat overnight as you'll see that was pretty much across the board with Japan and Korea squeaking out a fractional gain.</p><p>Our top story this half an hour, the cost of the government shutdown.  The CBO says about $3 billion out of 2019's projected GDP was completely lost due to the shutdown.  Joining me right now in a FOX Business exclusive is National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow.  Larry, it's great to see you this morning.</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for being here.  So obviously 35 days, government shutdown, CBO says $3 billion is lost.  Never coming back.  Your reaction.</p><p>KUDLOW:  With respect, once again, we disagree with the CBO.  I don't think we're going to lose anything.  This is completely temporary.  None of the incentives in the economy have been changed by this.  You know, that's the key point.  President Trump lowered marginal tax rates on individuals and most especially businesses.  And then he had this massive sweeping rollback of costly and burden regulations, which freed up the whole economy, including the energy sector, which has turned out to be a boom.  Why would we lose something just because of a temporary issue regarding the government?  Now, I'm always interested in sort of counting angels on the head of a pin.  We have about a $20 trillion economy, fair?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  There -- what was their number, three billion out of 20 trillion?  Do you know what the --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Three billion.  Yes, no, you're right.  You're right.</p><p>KUDLOW:  - percentage that is?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I totally understand.</p><p>KUDLOW:  I don't understand why we even mess with it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Actually, they're saying the total impact was $8-11 billion.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But that will come back, except for the $3 billion they say that is completely lost.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, again, with all due respect to the professionals at the CBO, I disagree.  Again, because the incentives in the economy -- here's the big difference between I guess the administration and the Congressional Budget Office and a lot of other forecasters.  We believe the economy is growing at three percent plus.  By the way, the Commerce Department for 2018 has scored I believe 3.1 percent.  We'll get the rest of those numbers in a week or two.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KUDLOW:  The CBO does not.  They never have.  They've never given us credit for the incentive effect of lowering taxes and regulations.  Supply side incentives are kicking in.  If you look at the whole panoply all of the economic data, whether it's very strong Christmas retail sales, whether it's industrial production, manufacturing, the best since the '80s, whether it's business equipment, which means the capex boom is happening that we always hoped for.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KUDLOW:  You'll see in my judgment, at least, the three percent trend line will continue.  CBO and many others have us at two.  But this goes back before the President.  This goes back way before.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  They don't believe the economy can grow.  They don't give any credit --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, even somebody like a Steve Schwarzman will say 4.2 percent growth in the second quarter is very hard to sustain on a $20 trillion economy.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, I'll keep working on Steve Schwarzman.  He's a good guy.  But in a $20 trillion economy, which again will grow rapidly, I see no reason why we can't continue three percent plus.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That's the whole point.  The idea that was sold to everybody I guess going back several years, maybe going back 10 or 15 years, that we're in some secular stagnation is just plain wrong.  With the right set of policies, to unleash --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- American animal spirit --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we saw that with the tax plan and the deregulation.  I totally get that.</p><p>KUDLOW:  And you look at the --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But what about tariffs and trade, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  The -- just one --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because the CBO'S report also brings that up.</p><p>KUDLOW:  One last one on this, the face of the new Trump economy -- I just want to put this in here, it's the thought I've had for quite a while.  These are men and women running small businesses.  These are blue-collar workers.  You look at the evidence, the employment for blue-collar workers, the best increase since the mid to late '80s, when I was a Reagan Cub Scout here in Washington, D.C.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  The wage rates of blue-collar manufacturing autos, they're rising faster than white-collar workers.  This is a direct result --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- of the incentives we've put into the economy.  CBO, again, it's not personal to my friends at the CBO, they don't give us any credit for these incentives.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No, I understand that.  But the --</p><p>KUDLOW:  And I want to stay with that story.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- the report on the trade policies estimated that new tariffs on imports and exports will cut an average of one-tenth of a percent from economic growth through 2029.  What's your take on that, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because we know that these tariffs are in place.  They still are impacting business and uncertainties.  So, is the President prepared to do away with all tariffs if he gets that agreement from the other side?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, I don't want to go there.  I mean, that's going to be his decision as you know.  Vice Premier Liu He is coming and we will have high level discussions Wednesday and Thursday and we're all looking forward to that, as is the President.  The President, as I read him, moderately optimistic about this trade story.  So, that's good.  What was it, one-tenth of one percent by 2029?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  So then here we are in 2019, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, no.  One-tenth of a percent from economic growth through 2029.</p><p>KUDLOW:  See, this is too hard, Maria.  It's way too hard --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- to figure that stuff out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you don't think there's going to be any -- there's --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Could it be possible that there's no impact from the shutdown?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Yes, quite possible.  I never -- it's utterly totally temporary.  So, that's -- let me --- look, let me go back -- the growth potential from China trade, people tend to look at this as a negative.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Look, I don't know the outcome of these talks.  Here's what I know, the scope of the discussion will be the broadest and deepest in the history of U.S.-China trade.  Literally everything's on the table.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Point number one.  Point number two, if China opens its markets --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is a big deal.</p><p>KUDLOW:  OK?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it looks like there's (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>KUDLOW:  Which is huge.  You know, I don't want to predict, and as Ambassador Lighthizer said a million times, and I agree, the enforcement mechanisms are going to be crucial.  But if they were to open their markets as we have requested regarding tariffs and non-tariffs, if they would let American companies own the subsidiary in China, so there's no forced transfer of the family jewels of technology, if we have --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But it --</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- some rule of law regarding I.P. theft, here's my point, open markets will allow the United States to export like crazy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But I understand that, Larry.</p><p>KUDLOW:  And that has been hand -- we've been handcuffed.  If we do that, if we do that, not only will the United States grow faster --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- because of that, China will grow faster.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That all sounds great, but can you actually do that, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Competition is the solution.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's the point, because if you're saying, \"OK, China, we are agreeing that you are opening your markets, and as a result, we will meet your demands, but then they say okay, but you have to have a communist, a government leader on the board of any company that has 100 percent.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Which is -- which is extraordinary, you're absolutely right.  It's extraordinary.  And it's --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So I mean -- so you could say it's great --</p><p>KUDLOW:  And unacceptable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- that you're going to open markets.</p><p>KUDLOW:  It's unacceptable.  It's unacceptable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But they -- aren't they saying that a communist has to be on the board of any company that has 100 percent?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I think that's been the past and I think that's going to be a very hot topic in these trade talks because that is completely unacceptable to us.  No question about it.  We will see how this turns out.  China, unfortunately, you know, they're in a slump.  China's economy is slumping very bad.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  I think part of that slump is a function of the President's tough negotiating with tariffs, when necessary, OK, part of that slump is in the last five to ten years.  China has moved in the wrong direction, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  The market-based reforms have been moving in their own direction.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But they're not market-based.  They are communists and they want communists on the board of -- So I'm just wondering, all of this sounds great, if you can actually get it done.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Oh, I know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Larry, stay with us.  We want to talk to you about other things because the tax plan and the deregulations have worked.  But there are some other ideas coming into play ahead of 2020.</p><p>KUDLOW:  China should not use the Venezuelan form of the economic policy.  We need to go back to who is it that said free market capitalism is the best path to prosperity?  It was the (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, that would -- that would be you and Ronald Reagan.  Stay with us.  We will be right back.  More with Larry Kudlow.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Thank you.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We come to you live this morning from Washington, D.C. and I am sitting with National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow, in an exclusive interview this morning.  And we were talking about China and what you can get done.  How important is tomorrow and Thursday in terms of meeting a deadline, that March 1st, in terms of a deal on the table?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I think's very important.  Look, I --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think you'll get a deal by March 1?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I don't want to predict.  It's just too hard to predict.  And, of course, these are decisions that will be made by the President, who is his own best negotiator.  Best I can is, as I said, the scope of this thing's going to as wide and broad as anything we have ever seen.  That does not ensure positive negotiator.  Best I can is, as I said, the scope of this thing is going to be as wide and broad as anything we've ever seen.  That does not ensure positive outcomes --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- right?  I think everybody, including the President, is basically moderately optimistic about this, OK?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Wait, let me ask you, your tax plan --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Ultimately -- one other thought which the President believes that he and President Xi will probably be the ultimate negotiators.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  OK?  And the work being done tomorrow and Thursday is vitally important to lay out options, OK?  But --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So the President will be involved in these talks tomorrow and Thursday?</p><p>KUDLOW:  That is what he has been saying in our meetings.  And I hope so because he's a great negotiator.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me move on to the tax plan.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because we're hearing a lot of ideas in terms of taxes now, now with a lot of 2020 hopefuls.  The Tax and Jobs Act obviously did move the needle on economic growth along with the deregulation out of this administration.  Now you've got Elizabeth Warren talking about two to three percent tax on the very high wealth people.  So if you have $50 million in wealth, you'll get two percent tax.  If you've got a billion dollars in assets, you'll get taxed three percent.  And you've got Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez talking about tax of 70 percent tax --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- on the highest earners.  What is your take on this?  Give us your reaction and what kind of an impact those policies might have.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Right.  These are prosperity killers, these are growth killers, these are job killers, these are incentive killers.  This is a return to some heavy government planning essentially direct to the economy.  You know, I hate to dwell on this because it's a crisis right now, but take a look at Venezuela, just for the heck of it.  What (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There was a time when that was vibrant -- it was a vibrate country.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That is correct.  That is correct.  And investment was flocking to it.  Then they took, down through the years, really exact measures you're describing that are coming from some of these Democratic candidates --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- and the economy was destroyed.  I mean I hear this notion we have to have equality, equality of income, equality of results, which I think runs counter to all human nature.  You know what?  A place like Venezuela has equality.  Everybody's poor.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think they'll be able to reverse the tax cuts then?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Everybody's poor in Venezuela, except for a hand -- Maduro and a handful of this top military people.  Is that what we want in America?  We are growing right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So will the Dems be able to reverse your tax cut plans?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Never.  Never, not until the President's configuration.  I -- look, first of all, if they want to try to raise taxes, it will be defeated in the Senate, Republican.  I personally believe even if it went beyond that --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- the President would veto any efforts to turn back his program.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How important --</p><p>KUDLOW:  We're doing what people said we couldn't do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But how important is debt?</p><p>KUDLOW:  They said we couldn't grow at three, four percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But how important is debt, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  We're growing at three, four percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Let's not mess with it.  If it ain't broke, don't fix it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Congressional Budget --</p><p>KUDLOW:  There's a tremendous surge in prosperity here shared by the middle and lower middle income people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Congressional Budget Office is saying that the deficit is hit -- set to hit $897 billion this year.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That would be the highest level since World War II.  When does debt become a priority?  Do you think the President, let's say he does have another term, will try to attack the entitlements?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, look, I think right now the two issues are maintaining economic growth.  You know, growth is the single biggest factor in these budget calculations.  Growth brings income and revenues.  And in fact I haven't gone through it with a fine-toothed comb yet, but I will.  I think I see that the CBO is acknowledging that our faster growth, which they did not predict, is now paying for over 80 percent of the tax cuts.  OK?  And I think you'll see more about that as we get through.  The reports just came out yesterday.</p><p>Second point I want to make is we will have a tough spending budget coming up in a few weeks, a very tough spending budget with reductions of at least five percent across the board, in non-defense accounts.  So I think that's going to be very important.  Let's minimize government where possible.  Let's grow the economy to its max.  And you will see the debt burden, which I thought debt, as a share of GDP, will be coming down, and by the way, it already is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  OK.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That's what happened during the Reagan years.  That's what happened during the John F. Kennedy years.  So, I wrote about it in my book.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That -- that's the best way to measure that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But, Larry, you know what I don't understand?  I mean you're all about growth, you have been for all your entire career.  Why are so many people worried about the slowdown?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why are we hearing some people say a recession is on the horizon?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, there's just -- it's funny in this town and I guess a little bit in New York, this is a lot of pessimism.  I don't --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you expect a recession this year or 2020?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I do not.  I don't see it right now.  If I look at financial indicators, credit spreads, the actual numbers, you know, it's just -- we -- GDP will come out a week late because the Commerce Department has reopened.  We've seen stuff like falling unemployment claims, rising manufacturing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But what are the markets telling us, Larry?  In the month of December, there was no high-yield debt issuance at all.  Credit markets are still tight.</p><p>KUDLOW:  They've come back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They've come back a bit.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Come back.  I like that.  Profits, the mother's milk of stocks, I don't know who first that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You did.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Profits, the mother's milk of stocks are rising.  The early indications are they won't to 25 percent but they're going to rise 10, to 15 percent.  I like that a lot.  Interest rates, the level of rates, are historically low.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you're not worried about market volatility?</p><p>KUDLOW:  There's a million things to worry about when I get up in the morning, you know, mainly getting here on time so I could do this great interview.  But I just want to say, if you look at the sum total of all the evidence right now, there's no recession out there.  I am the happy warrior.  I am an optimist.  President Trump is an optimist.  I think America, right now, we are the hottest economy in the world and we should remain so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll end it there.  Larry Kudlow.  Good to see you, sir.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow.  Back in a moment.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The government shutdown may be over, but the effects are still being felt.  Hillary Vaughn is live this morning at a craft brewery in Escondido, California where the shutdown effects are actually still lingering.  Hillary.</p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Hi, Maria.  Good morning.  Craft beer is a $76.2 billion industry, and for many craft breweries, like Stone Brewery, where we are today, the effects of the government shutdown are not over.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOMINIC ENGELS, CEO, STONE BREWING:  When the industry craft is built on seasonal beers, it's built on new beers, it's the new sexy thing, and if we can't get the new sexy thing to market, then we're not going to connect with our fans.  They're going to be disappointed.  We're going to make the sales numbers we planned to make in our financial plans, and these things will have repercussions.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUGHN:  As Federal workers at the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau are finally back in the office, a mountain of paperwork is waiting, about 11,000 applications for alcohol labels have been backlogged leaving craft breweries waiting to ship and sell all their new beer across state line, which means they're in limbo until these approvals go through.

Dagen McDowell, great to see you this morning thank you so much.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  John Hilsenrath, Matt Schlapp.  I don't know why the President tweets this.  He's got how many million view, you know, users and followers.  He just let everybody know who this guy is like --</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, THE AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Well, he literally sat in a -- he sat in a cubicle outside my wife's office in the West Wing, and so it is kind of amazing like this insider whole kind of mythology is something the President knows is not true.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  But he's got some extra sales thanks to that tweet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  That's what I'm saying.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think, Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  Again, everybody's got a book to write.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jim Comey, this guy.

Good morning, everyone, I'm Maria Bartiromo, thanks for joining us live this morning from Washington.  It is Tuesday, January 29th, your top stories right now 6:00 a.m. on the east coast.  Earnings in focus this morning, investors are watching results from several Dow components ahead of the open this morning.  The one to watch after the close is Apple.  We've got everything you need to know this morning previewing the report.  Apple under fire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile, FaceTime hit with a new bug that lets people eavesdrop on you without your knowledge.  How you can fix it, coming up -- big story.  Rising tensions with China meanwhile, the U.S. bringing charges against Huawei as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  The very latest on state of negotiations with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin this morning.  That interview at 8:00 a.m. Eastern, join us for that.  PG&amp;E makes it official, California's largest utility filed to bankruptcy protection, following the massive wild fires.  We've got all the details, coming up.</p><p>Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz roasted.  The billionaire hackled at an event last night as he gears up toward a possible independent run for the White House.  We've got a big show this morning coming from D.C., U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is here, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow is here along with House Minority, California Congressman Kevin McCarthy.  Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell will join me, along with AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka.  Don't miss a moment of it.  We've got a big three hours, coming up.</p><p>And we turn now -- right now, we kick it off with Wall Street markets.  We're looking to see a rebound this morning.  Take a look at Futures actually have just turned negative once again.  Futures down just fractionally, about 6 points on the Dow Industrials; 1-1/2 points lower on the S&amp;P; and the NASDAQ down 13 points.  This, after stocks finished lower yesterday on China growth fears along with weak guidance from Nvidia and Caterpillar.  We told you -- the Caterpillar numbers right here.  And of course, it did worsen throughout the day as investors react to a weaker-than-expected earnings and guidance.</p><p>Joining me right now is Federated Investors Chief Equity Market Strategist, Phil Orlando.  And Phil, it's good to see you this morning.</p><p>PHIL ORLANDO, CHIEF EQUITY MARKET STRATEGIST, FEDERATED INVESTORS:  Thanks for having me back, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All indications that we are seeing a slowdown and worries around China, among other issues, how do you see the markets here as more earnings have come into play?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, you had this 20 percent waterfall decline in stock prices in the fourth quarter of last year, we thought the market was attempting to price in the prospect of recession this year.  Multiples contracted from 18 times earnings down to 14 times earnings.  In our view, there's no risk of recession this year.  So, the rally that we've seen over the last month, 14 percent rally, the market is starting to price in the fact that maybe we're not going to have a recession.  But we've had a 14 percent rally in a month.  That's very, very powerful.  We would absolutely expect some consolidation here over the next month or two particularly as we've got these critical sign posts coming up in the month of March, but as we look out over the balance of the year, we do think that multiples will return to that 18 level, and we're going to end up with a pretty good year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  To what do you attribute the slowdown?  We've got earnings in focus and we're looking at a number of companies out that give weaker-than-expected guidance or miss on the top line.  Lockheed Martin, Pfizer, and Verizon are reporting this morning.  Apple is, of course, out after the bell, so when you look at the earnings picture, where in terms of industry are you seeing the most slowdown?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, I think in a word, uncertainty is what's impacting earnings and guidance to some degree.  You've got the Fed flip-flops that we saw in the fourth quarter last year, the uncertainty about whether or not the United States and China are going to be able to consummate this trade deal.  You've got Brexit overhanging on the global market and certainly the government shutdown, which was up there for 35 days, and it was just temporarily resolved last Friday.  You've got a number of issues there, all of which are impacting companies in some way, shape or form.  So, with earnings up 25 percent year-over-year in the first three quarters of last year, this fourth quarter is a little softer, I think we're up about 13 percent.  So far, we're about a quarter of the way through the earnings season.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>ORLANDO:  And I think what companies are pointing to are some combination of those four issues that I just mentioned.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you mentioned the shutdown.  The shutdown apparently costing the economy $11 billion according to new analysis from the Congressional Budget Office, although Larry Kudlow is disputing that number, and he's going to join us this morning live to talk about it.  The report says that it hit $3 billion, that's one-tenth of a percent of economic activity in the fourth quarter alone.  So, are there sectors that were -- that were hit hardest in that regard, or do you want to look at those companies that are largely tied to the China trade as one area of the real weakness?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the council of economic advisers under Trump had advised us that the shutdown was going to take about one-tenth of one percent out of GDP per week.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, remember, the shutdown started right around Christmas, so that makes sense that we lost, you know, a tenth of a percent in the fourth quarter, you know, maybe a half a percent here in the first quarter.  We're at 1.7 percent GDP growth in the first quarter, consensus blue chip is around 22, 23.  So, we think this pretext a little high and there will be, you know, sort of a downward revision as we get later in the quarter.  But in terms of industries, I think it's really across the board.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Across the board.</p><p>ORLANDO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about technology because it's big week for tech, Apple, of course, the big story today, reporting after the close tonight -- the only big tech reporting.  Microsoft, Facebook out tomorrow, Amazon is out on Thursday.  This is the week that we'll focus on technology and that's where really the growth stories have been.  Would you want to put new money to work in any of these names ahead of their earnings?</p><p>ORLANDO:  Short answer is probably no.  Again, you've had this 14 percent rally here in the last month, you've got concerns about slowing economic growth both in the U.S. and China.  We think that those issues will be resolved as we get into the back half of the year, but right now, you know, why run the risk of putting new money to work after you've had a big rally in some of these names ahead of what could be a disappointing earnings number or perhaps conservative guidance.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, the stock has come down because people were worried about it.  So, we'll see what the numbers are.  Would you, at some point, go back in to tech?  What's your favorite group right now, Phil?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, the areas that we like best in the U.S. markets are energy, financial services, industrials, and health care.  In terms of looking overseas, emerging markets look very attractive to us.  So, the areas that have really gotten hit the most are the ones that we've been attracted to.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there.  So, the valuations are better, I guess, is what you're saying.</p><p>ORLANDO:  The valuations are much more attractive.  We think the fundamentals are still very strong.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Phil, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>ORLANDO:  Great to see you.  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Phil Orlando joining us there.  Meanwhile, a bug in Apple's FaceTime app lets users listen in someone's phone without even the person knowing.  Dagen McDowell, what's happening this morning?  Good morning to you, Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well, Apple has some explaining to do, but particularly on this earnings call this afternoon.  So, there's a bug in the Apple iPhone that would allow people to eavesdrop on FaceTime users' calls.  A FaceTime user calling another person could listen in while the recipients phone is still ringing even if the person never accepts the call.  This was -- it involves several steps in the Group FaceTime feature on the iPhone.</p><p>Apple has disabled that Group FaceTime while it tries to come up with a fix for this, but you can eavesdrop in on somebody, essentially listening through the microphone, even if a person never takes that call, you could eavesdrop on rooms with unattended devices and even receive unauthorized video from the phone.  And again, it would take several steps to do this, but this is coming from a company, Maria, that loves to brag about its privacy protections and even throws shade at the likes of Facebook and other technology companies.</p><p>And adding embarrassment to embarrassment, yesterday was International Data Privacy Day and Tim Cook was tweeting about that.  Here's what he said on Twitter yesterday before this bug, this eavesdropping bug was disclosed.  We must keep fighting for the kind of world we want to live in.  On this Data Privacy Day, let us all insist on action and reform for vital privacy protections.  The dangers are real and the consequences are too important.  Big whoops for Apple, and of course, everything that happens in the business world is a political opportunity.  The Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo had to weigh in on this as well, putting out a statement late yesterday, say, \"Urging FaceTime users to temporarily disable the app.  So, Apple beat him to it, they're trying to fix it.  Embarrassment nonetheless.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible because you don't even know -- I mean, the phone could be ringing and you don't even know that they're listening.  I mean, that's the worst part of it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  I can explain later as the show goes on how this work, but you'd have to place a FaceTime call, go to the group, add yourself to the call and then the recipient of the call would have to hit maybe one like the on-button on the phone in order to activate it, but it was possible, and it was all over the internet yesterday how to do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, if -- so, if it's -- if it's not on and you say -- and you do -- and you decline the phone call, they can't listen in?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Unless you -- but you can't touch the phone at all.  Like, it's not even declining the phone.  Like, if you hit the up -- the up volume button on the phone, and so if I was playing this trick on you, it would activate it, and they could essentially hear what was going on in the room.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Unbelievable.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  I want to hear more about that, for sure.  Meanwhile, there's this, as expected, PG&amp;E filed for bankruptcy protection following those devastating wildfires in California.  Cheryl Casone on that in headlines right now.  Cheryl, good morning to you.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  Well, PG&amp;E is facing roughly about 30 billion in potential liabilities, as investigators are looking into whether the company's equipment played a role in starting California's deadliest fire.  More than 100 people died following a series of wildfires that burned hundreds of thousands of acres over a two-year period.  The utility providing energy service to 60 million people, we should add.  Taking a look at shares of PG&amp;E, look at that, in the premarket down nearly nine percent.  And those loses have actually paired back in the last hour or so, folks.</p><p>Well, China's Vice Premier has arrived in Washington for high-level trade talks that are going to start tomorrow.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and trade representative Robert Lighthizer will attend the two-day meeting.  Yesterday, the Trump administration announced a pair of indictments against Chinese telecom giant, Huawei.  The U.S. is accusing the company of trying to steal trade secrets from T-Mobile.  The Justice Department also charging Huawei with conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran.</p><p>And the China story continues, folks, shares of Nvidia are lower this morning.  The chipmaker is warning investors, and expects much weaker sales thanks in part, yes, to China's slowing economy.  It also previously cautioned the sales of its graphics processors that are used in video games PCs would be disappointing.  The China effect continues.  Chips for video gaming account for more than half of their business, they lost half their market value since hitting their peak back on October 1st, Maria.  So, Goldman Sachs had to come out last Friday, Maria, warning that a lot of these chip companies that have massive exposure to China are going to have really rough reports.  Micron Technology, even Wynn Resorts, the casino company, has got big China exposure, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, for sure.  All right, Cheryl, thanks so much.  Coming up next, five police officers are injured this morning, four of them shot while serving a search warrant.  The very latest coming up.  And then a venti-size disaster for Howard Schultz last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire (BLEEP).</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Former Starbucks CEO having a rough time exploring a 2020 Presidential run as he gets heckled.  We break it down right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Live from Washington, we are eyeing 2020, former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz facing backlash last night on his first stop of his book tour.  It was his first public appearance after announcing a possible Independent Presidential run.  It did not begin smoothly.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire (BLEEP).  Go back to getting ratio'd on Twitter.  Go back to Davos with the other billionaire elite who think they know how to run the world.  That's not what democracy needs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, my goodness.  Schultz is also facing backlash from former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.  Here's what he tweeted: \"In 2020, the great likelihood is that an Independent would just split the anti-Trump vote and end up re-electing the President.  That's a risk I refused to run in 2016, and we can't afford to run it now.\"</p><p>Here with me this morning to talk more about all of that is Dagen McDowell back in New York, Wall Street Journal Global Economics Editor Jon Hilsenrath here in D.C. with me, along with the American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp.  Gentlemen, it's good to see you.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Welcome to Washington.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, thank you so much.  And welcome to presidential politics, Howard Schultz.  What do you think about that?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Well, I'm going to get some popcorn.  This could be a real interesting Democratic primary, and whatever this Independent thing is, don't you love Michael Bloomberg who has probably spent a million dollars on polling, trying to figure out every way to become the President.  Publicly chastising Schultz for running as an Independent when that's exactly what Bloomberg would just love to do if he could.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  You know, on the one hand, Dagen, I feel like there is an opening for an Independent because there's such extremes and radical conversation going on certainly on the left.  And on the other hand, I don't know, how much is a cup of coffee at Starbucks?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Again, that $18.00 cup of Joe, I'm joking, I'm exaggerating.  It's helping --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think it's like $6.00.  I mean, seriously.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, we love cart coffee around this place.  But again, that's helping fund this run.  But Michael Bloomberg -- you know what, Michael Bloomberg should run for the Democratic nomination if he thinks he can win, it's just hilarious to have this multibillionaire lecturing Howard Schultz about an Independent run when actually a cup of Starbucks coffee has more charisma than Michael Bloomberg, number one.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Number two, it's going to be really interesting to see the narrative in the spring of 1992 with Ross Perot was -- Ross Perot was going to divide the Democratic vote, that it wouldn't hurt the Republican.  This could very well -- I mean, it depends on who -- what Howard Schultz says on the campaign trail and how far-left the Democrats go when they're running for the nomination.  But I'll say this, what he said so far about pay -- how to pay for Medicare For All and how that's impossible, I would be really interested to hear him talk about how to fix the health care system, because he might come to the table with some really interesting ideas and force the Democrats to answer the hard questions about paying for this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that is the thing, I mean, this party unfortunately, it's very hard for someone who's a centrist to actually have a shot.  You had Tim Ryan from Ohio, he wanted to do it, he's an economic thinker, he doesn't have a shot because of the same thing, you've got the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's 70 percent tax rate, the loudest voice in the room.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I mean, there's no question that these primaries are starting out very much from the left, you know, you have talk about a wealth tax, and 70 percent high-income tax threshold.  You have Elizabeth Warren who is going around beating up on the banks.  This is definitely a left-leaning primary season that we're going to be going into.  What I find so fascinating is the journeys that these different billionaires are traveling.  You know, you had President Trump who supported a lot of Democrats as a businessman in New York City traveling over to Republican Party, now you have Michael Bloomberg who started out as a Republican Mayor --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- traveling over to the Democratic Party, and Howard Schultz doesn't know where to go.  He doesn't know where he fits in.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He doesn't know where -- and what about Senator Kamala Harris?  Let's listen to her, because she held a CNN Townhall meeting in Iowa last night.  Harris is vowing to eliminate private health insurance with Medicare For All if elected president.  What's your take, Matt?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Making insurance companies illegal.  Look, the Democratic Party has become quite radicalized.  Think about this, less choices for the patient is the solution to our problems.  That seems insane.  Also, do we really think the government, when you get your tags to drive your car, or when you pay your taxes at the IRS, do you really think all the solutions to our problems are there?  I don't.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Let me ask you this, who does President Trump want to see come out of this whole --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think he wants Howard Schultz to run.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think -- he was taunting him yesterday.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH:  No, besides Howard Schultz, among the Democrats, who does he -- who does he want to (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>SCHLAPP:  I think most Republicans -- I'm not going to speak for the President -- but I think most Republicans believe that Elizabeth Warren is so far out there on the loony left, basically Marxism, socialism that I think they find that a delicious opportunity.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Can I --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- call the confiscation, Dagen.  He called it (INAUDIBLE) I mean, this two or three percent tax on assets, confiscation.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It is wealth confiscation.  It's totally communist and then to try and find people when they hand in their U.S. citizenship when other countries come calling, wanting you move there because they won't come and take your hard-earned money.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  One thing I want to point out that Jon Hilsenrath said that Howard Schultz doesn't know where to go.  President Trump should be worried about a Howard Schultz, because what if he comes to the table, like I said, with ideas that appeal to voters in this country who feel left out.  Who left out from the Republican Party and certainly left out by the left-leaning Democrats in this environment.  So, be very, very careful.  And one other thing I'll add with Howard Schultz at that -- at that bookstore, that's just the New York City welcome wagon.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's the way they treat all tourists in this city.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, I think you make a good point because there is that path.  That path of centrism.  I mean, that path of the center, because people do feel like it's gone wacky all the way on the left, for sure.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  It's a centrist country, but don't forget Hillary.  She's making noises.  Maybe that's the President's favorite opponent.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH:  We haven't seen any --</p><p>SCHLAPP:  She's making noises.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  We haven't seen anyone travel that centrist path as an Independent to presidency.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  So, it was a smart move on Howard Schultz's part.  We'll see.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Or a risky one for all those billions --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, certainly risky.  Take a quick break.  Extreme weather warning meanwhile on the other side of this break, millions of people across the country are gearing up for an Arctic blast as temperatures are plummeting, that's next.</p><p>Then showing their cards, British Prime Minister Theresa May asking Parliament to put up its plans from Britain's exit from the E.U.  Details on the historic debate.  And the vote happening later today, back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  It is cold out, and the deep freeze is setting in, hitting millions of Americans with subzero and dangerous temperatures.  Fox News Senior Meteorologist Janice Dean in the Fox Weather Center right now with the very latest.  Janice, tell us about it.</p><p>JANICE DEAN, FOX NEWS SENIOR METEOROLOGIST:  Hi, Maria, yes, we could be dealing with historic lows.  These are current windchills, what it feels like when you go outside and you are not protected.  Dangerous, potentially life-threatening windchills of -41 in International Falls, -18 in Chicago, but we still have another blast behind this.  So, these are morning lows, these are not windchill temperatures: Chicago -25 on Thursday, -31 in Minneapolis, -16 in Detroit.  Again, those are not windchill values.  Those are actual air temperatures.  But with the windchill, in some cases, we could get windchill values of -40 to -50.  If you go outside, your skin is going to freeze in minutes.</p><p>So, here's Chicago, Illinois.  Your all-time record low is -28.  So, we're going to flirt with historic lows, Maria.  This is a big deal.  The good news is it won't be long lasting.  By the weekend, we'll start to rebound, but I also want to make mention with this arctic cold front as we have snow across the deep south.  Snow that could cripple travel across portions of Atlanta, Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, and towards the southeast, so that's another dangerous part of the storm is the -- not only extreme cold but the snow as far as south as the gulf coast.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Janice.  Wow, what a story, thank you so much.</p><p>DEAN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will be watching.  Janice Dean.  Coming up next, the State of the Union is back on, it is February 5th.  Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi extending an invitation to the President, he accepted the offer.  Then, we're taking a look at the enormous cost of the shutdown.  What is the real number?  Plus, place your bets, Super Bowl fans getting ready to throw down an enormous amount of cash.  So, bet on the big game Sunday.  We break down all the numbers.  Stay with us.  Live from Washington this morning.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us.  We are coming to you live from Washington this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, January 29th, your top stories right now 6:31 on the east coast right now.  Earnings season is in full swing, a lot of big names reporting their fourth quarter today.  Xerox and Pfizer set to report in just a few moments, we'll bring you the numbers as soon as they hit the tape, and tell you how they are impacting markets.  Rising tensions with China, the U.S. is bringing charges against Huawei, as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will be my special guest, in about 90 minutes time.  We will break it all down with the Treasury Secretary, coming up.  So, stay with us.</p><p>Meanwhile, Futures relatively flat this morning, take a look at markets, down 20 points on the Dow Industrials, down 4 points on the S&amp;P, down 18 points on the NASDAQ.  We are expecting some pressure at the start of trading this morning, after all the major indices finished lower, yesterday, on Wall Street.</p><p>In fact, at 4:00, the Dow Industrials gave up 208 points, that was almost 1 percent lower, the S&amp;P 500 down 21, that was three quarters of a percent lower, and the NASDAQ with a 79-point decline yesterday, at the close, down better than 1 percent.</p><p>Investors are watching some big news this week, J.P. Morgan, calling this week the most important week of the first quarter, and here is why, you've got earnings, you've got the British vote, you've got U.S.-China trade talks, you've got a Federal Reserve decision, we're not expecting a Fed hike.</p><p>We've got fourth quarter GDP coming out.  And, of course, at the end of the week, the job's report for the month of January, a big week, investors want to watch it and will be covering it all.</p><p>European indices this morning look like this, in terms of trading.  We are looking at gains in Europe.  The FT-100 up one and a quarter percent, 86 points higher, the CAC Quarante in Paris is up a half a percent, 26 points higher, and the DAX Index in Germany, higher by a fraction, as you can see there.</p><p>Asian markets overnight, flat, take a look.  No real moves there, because mover was the KOSPI Index in Korea, up a quarter of a percent.</p><p>Well, there is tragedy in Houston to report, five police officers injured.  Four of them shot, while serving a search warrant.  We have the very latest, coming up.</p><p>And a debate in parliament, British lawmakers set to vote on the latest plan for the U.K. to leave the European Union.  We are previewing that and we will take a look at the impact across the world.</p><p>We've got a big program this morning from D.C., U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is coming up this morning, along National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow, they will take a look at all of these expectations that the economy is slowing.</p><p>Plus, House Minority Leader and California Congressman, Kevin McCarthy, is with us, along with Michigan Congresswoman, Debbie Dingell.  Plus, AFL CIO, President Richard Trumpa, here as well, big show, don't miss a moment of it, big three hours, coming up. And we are kicking off this half an hour right now, with this top story, feeling the effects of the shutdown, Washington, D.C. back in business for now, President Trump will give his State of the Union of Address on February 5th, Tuesday.  The address was originally supposed to be today.</p><p>Even though the shutdown is over, the U.S. is still feeling effects, new numbers from the Congressional Budget Office to report.  The U.S. GDP will be $3 billion lower during the fourth quarter of 2018, because of this shutdown.  On the immigration front, backlogs of immigration courts grew by at least 10 percent, according to Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about all of that is Americans for Tax Reform President, Grover Norquist, Grover, good to see you.</p><p>GROVER NORQUIST, PRESIDENT, AMERICANS FOR TAX REFORM:  Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So, the CBO is talking about a $3 billion-dollar hit, in fact, as a result of the shutdown, Larry Kudlow is having an issue with this.  He says, frequently disagrees with the CBO anyway.  What's your take in terms of what the shutdown cost the economy?</p><p>NORQUIST:  Look, the key thing is that the economy continues to grow and we're looking at a three percent rate of growth for the year, so $3 billion is a big number, unless you compare it to the GDP of the United States in the fourth quarter.</p><p>So, actually, we're doing fairly well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You don't think it had much of an impact then, Grover?</p><p>NORQUIST:  No, it's a small impact and we have a tremendous growth for the year, which is way beyond what the CBO said was possible, when they scored this.  The CBO needs to spend a little more time going back to explain why they were so wrong on all of their recent predictions, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  Go ahead.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Grover, the Federal Reserve and most of the economist that we surveyed at the Wall Street Journal are saying that the economy is slowing down in 2019.  We had a nice burst in 2018 in part, because of tax cuts and in part, because there's more spending, $300 billion of additional spending.</p><p>But now, they say the economy is slowing along with the global economy, what does that say about the impact of these tax cuts, are the tax cuts really created the long-run growth that Republicans said was going to happen?</p><p>NORQUIST:  The tax cuts do two things.  We were at 35 percent rate, which is the highest in the world.  It made sense for an American company like Burger King to be bought by Canadian company, because even though they're selling the same hamburgers, the same number of employees, it was worth more, because we had a worldwide tax system at 35 percent.</p><p>By taking 35 down to 21, we became competitive with Europe.  I mean, our friends, the Germans were at 25, the Japanese were at 25.  I'm sorry, the Japanese were at 30.  The Chinese were at 25.  And we were at 35.  We weren't even close to being competitive.  It's a huge change in the direction for the country.</p><p>And if the CBO tells you they're pessimistic, they didn't think you could do three percent, they laughed at three percent growth, said you could never do more than --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  The question is, is that three percent growth.  I think a lot of people understand that the corporate tax rate was uncompetitive, even some Democrats wanted to lower their corporate tax rate, but the question is, this new tax code that we've got, is that sufficient to sustain the three percent growth in 2019?</p><p>NORQUIST:  It's a good first start.  We also need to do something about the workforce.  We need more workers and frankly, there's more tax reduction that needs to be done and spending restraint is very important at the end of the day.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  I want to go back to this question about a shutdown, Grover, which is, people are saying, they're almost using the reason why you couldn't cut government, because somehow, that would have a negative impact on our economic growth.  That seems like a very dangerous road to go down.</p><p>Isn't it true that all of this money that they are saying didn't get put into the economy, are you worried that the government actually won't spend all of that by the time that the authority over the money, expires?</p><p>NORQUIST:  For the government to -- I was taught this (INAUDIBLE) economics in college also.  The government takes your money, and then spends it.  It's much better for the economy than if it lets you spend it.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Right.</p><p>NORQUIST:  Because you would waste some of it by investing it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because they can spend money better than you, of course.</p><p>NORQUIST:  And that's the oddest thing because, of course, that's nonsense.  East Germany should have done very well, under this theory, but it doesn't, so --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  What the government is doing is borrowing other people's money and spending it, right?  I mean, we're talking about deficits that are nearing a trillion dollars.</p><p>NORQUIST:  The (INAUDIBLE) cost the government is how much the government spends, whether they borrowed or take it, it's still gone from the -- from the real economy.  The cost of government is total government spending.  We should have taxes low, and then the least destructive way possible, all taxes are somewhat destructive.  And you have less borrowing if you have less spending.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what about all of these new plans?  And by the way, we are getting earnings right now, as we're talking 3M and Xerox, both beat expectations, although 3M is cutting its forecast for the year.  What about all of these ideas about taxing the wealthy?  New York Congressman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez claims for a 70 percent marginal tax rate on the tippy top, as she calls it.</p><p>Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts senator, hopeful, for 2020, two percent tax on Americans whose assets exceed 50 million.  If you're a billionaire, three percent, what's the impact?</p><p>NORQUIST:  OK, magicians like to do this, so you're not looking at, you know -- watch my right hand, don't look at the left hand.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NORQUIST:  The reason they talk about high tax rates on rich people, is that they want to gouge the middle class.  The difference between the United States and Sweden, Finland, Denmark, the countries that Cortez talked about is, they don't have the 70 percent rate, just back up for sec -- there isn't a country in the world with a 70 percent income tax rate.</p><p>Many countries used to, the Beatle song, 19 for me, one for you, 95 percent tax rate, and then the Beatles moved to United States, and everybody who could pay tennis, left Sweden.  And all the countries of the world realize that tax rates that high were stupid and destructive and didn't help equality or growth or anything like that.</p><p>So, they got rid of them.  The whole world got rid of them.  We did it, it was stupid.  We back offed it and had strong economic growth as a result, so 70 percent stupid and destructive.  It's not America saying, the world says that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You probably showed the op-ed today, in the Journal, in California, and taxes as well.  The Journal, this week, by Cypress founder, T.J. Rodgers, which was very good, Another California Tax Grab, he writes.  In it, the politicians have fueled an affordability crisis that drives away businesses and exacerbates homelessness.</p><p>California Governor, Gavin Newsom, called for even higher taxes in his inauguration speech earlier this month.</p><p>NORQUIST:  California is a good example of 70 percent play.  They have a 13 percent rate on people making a million dollars, but they have 8 percent rate on people making $42,000.  So, they want the middle class people in California to think you're OK, because we're really screwing the other guy.</p><p>And point of fact, Florida has a zero percent first income tax, Texas has a zero percent first income tax, 8 percent looks good compared to 13.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NORQUIST:  Looks lousy compared to zero percent.  They want the middle class to think somebody else is paying the freight.  That's why they have those phoney high tax rates that don't raise much money.  It's to fool the middle class.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it is talking point, and it works for the populist.  Let me bring in Dagen McDowell on this, because we hear this every time we go into the tax discussion and we have a Democrat on which takes out another one of those talking points on taxes, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And I want to say that Senator Kamala Harris said that the first thing -- she said it last night, in the town hall, he first thing she do is to cut taxes for the middle class.  Well, roughly half this country pays no net federal income tax, number one, and the Republicans just did that particularly, doubling the standard deduction.</p><p>So, I don't know who she's going to cut taxes for.  But this is the ruse and this is the big liberal lie that all of these big new welfare state initiatives, whether it's green energy, even single payer, it's all going to be paid for by the super rich.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And that it's not going to be -- that the paying won't be spread across every person in this country to fund this welfare state.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And by the way, the numbers don't add up even if you tax all the rich, you're not going to get the amount of money you need for this green deal, Grover.</p><p>NORQUIST:  You don't even balance the budget if you do that, never mind half money for new things.  Look, the big difference between United States and Denmark, United States and Sweden, it's not how much money higher income people pay, it's what happens to middle-income people.</p><p>Denmark, Finland, Sweden, the tax rate on middle income people is 10, 15, 20 points higher than an American middle class person.  And, you add to that the value added tax.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NORQUIST:  The difference between United States and Europe is how heavily taxed middle income people are, and they have those (INAUDIBLE) high rates that very few people pay, to make people in the middle class think that they are getting a deal.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Speaking of middle income tax -- a lot of Democrats want a carbon tax, gasoline tax and even some big American business.  That's the way to address the issue of climate change.  Do you see any path towards a carbon tax that would be acceptable to your point --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I guess, but real quick, Grover.</p><p>NORQUIST:  No.  No, absolutely not.  And the reason is, you can look at Washington State, very deep blue Washington State.  They have twice had it on the ballot and twice defeated a carbon dioxide tax, gasoline taxes lose overwhelmingly.  This is too obvious tax on middle-income people.  It's a loser up.  They are having this fight in -- our dear friends in France or loggerhead down the subject.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We know how that played out.</p><p>NORQUIST:  We had the Ontario government and the Alberta government collapsed as a result of this, and three times, in Australia.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Grover, thank you.  Yes.</p><p>NORQUIST:  Bad politics and lousy economics.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Grover, thank you for the facts, we appreciate it, Grover Norquist, joining us there.</p><p>Five officers injured in a shooting in Texas, meanwhile, Cheryl Casone in New York, with the details, there.  Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  That's right, Maria.  Four officers were shot and another officer suffered a knee injury in Houston.  They were serving a search warrant at a suspected drug house.  Police say two of them were hit in the neck.  Those officers are in critical but stable condition.  Two suspects were killed at the scene.</p><p>Well, a key E.U. negotiator, warning the risk of Britain leaving the European Union without a deal, is very high, as parliament votes on amendments in Theresa May's exit plan today.  Lawmakers set to consider more than 10 different amendments before taking votes.  That's going to be at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>And those votes come after May's plan to leave the European Union was overwhelmingly rejected earlier this month, a lot of those votes against her from her own party.</p><p>Well, Americans will be betting an estimated $6 billion on the Super Bowl, that's according to the survey by the American Gaming Association.  About 22.7 million U.S. adults plan to place a bet on the upcoming Atlanta game, of those bets, 94.47 percent, reportedly illegal, but let the games begin, Maria, and those are your headlines.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Be there to watch it all, front-row seat.</p><p>CASONE:  I'm there for you, Maria.  I've got surprises for you, coming up.  You're going to love them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK, looking forward to it.  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, crisis in Venezuela to take a look at, new sanctions have been placed on the country's oil.  Plus, National Security Advisor, John Bolton, may have inadvertently revealed the administration's next move.  Why his notes are raising eyebrows this morning.</p><p>Then, farming in America, why farmers are being forced to rent water.  That's up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A look at some of the big headlines across America this morning.  The Chicago Tribune reporting on the Pension Agency criticizing Sears Chairman Eddie Lampert's plan to acquire the bankrupt retailer.  The article explaining that the agency sets to takeover Sears.  Pensions objects to the bid, calling it the final fulfillment of a year-long's scheme to deprive Sears and its creditors of assets and its employees of jobs while lining Lampert's on owns pockets.</p><p>The Daily Camera in Colorado, reporting on how Boulder County farmers are increasingly renting water.  The report explains how ownership from agricultural interests has dropped from 85 percent in the late 1950s to just 30 percent.  The water increasingly moving to municipal control.</p><p>And the Mercury News writing that how in one California city you can text 911 for emergency help.  According to the paper, the police department there announced that the service is now available in the city.  It is meant to help people who are hearing or voice impaired.  The police are also recommending that you not send emojis.  Well, yes, I would think not.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  What are we coming to?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  My God, but it is good that you can text 911.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  That's a good step, just don't text person emoji.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, crisis in Venezuela new sanctions placed on the country's oil, plus National Security Advisor John Bolton may have inadvertently revealed the administration's next move, why his notes on his legal pad are raising eyebrows this morning?  We're breaking that down when we come right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A framework for peace.  The U.S. and Taliban negotiators making a preliminary on key issues to end the war in Afghanistan -- the longest war in American history.  The two top points American troop withdrawal and insurgence vowing to end terrorist attacks abroad, that's according to the Wall Street Journal.  Many hurdles remain to ensure the peace is in place.  Joining me right now is Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst, General Jack Keane.  General, it's always a pleasure to see you.</p><p>GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST:  Good to see you, Maria, and welcome to Washington again.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  And what do you think about this?  I mean, are we supposed to be trusting the Taliban?</p><p>KEANE:  No, we can never ever trust the Taliban, that doesn't mean that we can't have a treaty with them.  But here's what I think is going on, a couple of things have changed: one is the Taliban in the last couple of years have gone all out as we have so dramatically reduced our forces, thinking that they will going to be able to overthrow the regime, because the only thing the United States is really doing is training and assisting the ground forces -- no longer doing the fighting, however provide an air power.  That didn't work.  They retook some territory but never took capitals or provinces and they never took -- they never able to secure a province.  So, what has happened?  The war stalemated.  The Taliban cannot take over the government and the government cannot defeat Taliban, even with our assistance.</p><p>Second thing, and this is crucial, Pakistan has gotten involved in this in a way they've never have before.  They forced the Taliban to go to the peace negotiation table, why?  Pakistan knows it's no longer in national interest to keep this thing stalemated.  There's growing al-Qaeda and growing ISIS presence in Afghanistan which gives the Pakistanis some concern.  So, those are the new things that are happening.  That's why the negotiations have some momentum.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's the thing, though.  I mean, so many people were worried when the president said: we were withdrawing the troops.  And where do you stand on that now?  I mean, do you feel better about it given this peace deal?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, let me answer it this way -- I mean, it is an essential question: the Taliban themselves, we are trying to get an agreement with them that, one, they'll stop trying to overthrow the government and number two, they'll power share with them and also, they will assist in taking down the al-Qaeda and the ISIS.  I don't think we can trust them to do that, based on the fact that they provided safe haven for Osama bin Laden for almost 10 years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  So, what do we do?</p><p>KEANE:  So, we leave in place, after we bring out the troops that are providing the training and assistance.  We leave in place a counterterrorism force and an intelligence capability indefinitely.  We're doing that in Yemen, we're doing it in Libya and we're doing it in Africa.  The one in Africa is off the coast.  It's a Maritime Joint Task Force.  That is what we need to do, that is the guaranty against the Taliban because the issue in Afghanistan has always been, we would never intervene in the civil war in Afghanistan between the northern alliance and Taliban for one reason only, we didn't evade, because they attacked the United States.  That's the reason we're there.  We don't want that to happen again and we cannot trust the Taliban to provide that guarantee for us.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, let me move on and ask you about sanctions on the Venezuelan oil industry.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin who will be here shortly this morning along with Security Adviser John Bolton, explain the decision in a briefing yesterday and issued warning for disputed President Nicolas Maduro.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN BOLTON, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR:  The president has made it very clear on this -- on this matter that all options are on the table.</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY:  There's no reason why these resources shouldn't be used for the economic benefit of the people there.  There's no reason for the poverty and the starvation and the humanitarian crisis.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to this announcement yesterday?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, increased pressure on Maduro regime is certainly a welcome thing.  I mean, this really comes down to the loyalty of the military to Maduro.  As long as that loyalty is there, it's unlikely that Maduro is going the leave.  If that loyalty starts to fall apart, I hope we're working a 'plan b', which is engineering right now some kind of exit path for Maduro, where he can go into exile with recriminations in Venezuela.  The Reagan administration did this very successfully on Ferdinand Marcos, back in 1986, overwhelming popular opposition to him, hundreds of thousands of people.  We engineered his exit.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me squeeze in this question before you go general.  This image from the briefing going viral and it shows John Bolton's notepad with the notation: \"5,000 troops to Colombia.\"  Whoa, do you think we should be sending troops to the region?  What do you think about this?  Caught on camera.</p><p>KEANE:  Look, when we deposed Noriega in 1989 operation just cost Panama, 26,000 troops, is what it took.  When we deposed a dictator in Haiti, 28,000.  The ease of troops that would only be in there, move into Venezuela, if there's a problem at the embassy to our diplomat.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How significance is revealing such a secret?</p><p>KEANE:  I think he'd probably wanted to reveal it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  General Jack Keane, good to see you sir.  Thank you so much.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Show: MORNINGS WITH MARIA][Date: January 29, 2019][Time: 07:00:00][Tran: 012902cb.231][Type: SHOW][Head: Interview with Rep.

And joining me to break it all down -- Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell in New York; the \"Wall Street Journal's\" global economics editor Jon Hilsenrath here in D.C. with me; and the American Conservative Union chairman, Matt Schlapp.  Great to see you -- guys.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Great to be here.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen -- good morning to you.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning.  We were talking about the shutdown.  So it's over for the time being.</p><p>The Democrats have actually been hurt by it as well.  Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows that positive feelings about the Democratic Party have fallen to 35 percent this month.  That's down 4 percentage points since December.  And that is essentially in line with the positive feelings that people have about Republicans.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean that's a really good point because the President really did not get hurt certainly on his base, from his base, by the shutdown.  What do you guys think?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Two things.  First is that the President's base was actually energized that he would make a spending fight.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Remember, immigration is a spending fight because if he can stop illegal immigration or reduce it, you don't have all these social services costs.</p><p>But the second thing is, the President's brand is that he will fight, he will fight harder than any politician on the field and he reiterated that brand.  So if he can increase that reputation, I think it appeals to Independents.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They said dig in.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  But isn't his brand also -- it's about fighting and continuing to fight and winning.  And he didn't win the wall in this case.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  I don't agree with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We don't know if he won the wall yet.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  There's three steps to this - -</p><p>HILSENRATH:  In this case, right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  In this case.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  -- there's three really important things.  Number one, the bill he signed has $1.3 billion in barrier funding annualized.</p><p>Number two, he's got to exhaust all legislative efforts if he's going to go the emergency route in order to have a good case in court.</p><p>And number three, the American people when it comes to immigration, he is on the right side of this policy argument.  And Democrats who are against border security, they're going to be sorry for this eventually.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  But you know what.  You better be --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, go ahead -- Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- but you better be careful about what you do and this goes to all politicians because I was flying on Friday and that was an utter nightmare.  If you want to anger everybody in the electorate, you pull another fast one like that where people are grounded and you've got an hour and-a-half plane flight where you're at 8,000 feet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But who are you blaming?</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They were blaming (INAUDIBLE) and blaming the Democrats because --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They were blaming everybody.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- Nancy Pelosi dug in.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They were blaming everybody.  But TSA agents down in Raleigh, Durham were going to food banks because they were spending what little money they had on gas trying to get to and from work.  So again, I don't care who is responsible for it.  They're all responsible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, businesses did start, you know, putting the uncertainty out there, sitting on cash, making decisions later.  We know.  I mean the SEC closed, can't get any IPOs through.  FDA closed, got to worry about obvious food shortages or food issues.</p><p>So we were beginning to see some real impact.  And Dagen saw it firsthand at the airport.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  That's true.  But if you're a federal employee in this town, let's face it, you make a little bit of a bargain.  Yes, every year you might have to go through a shutdown with your salary.</p><p>But you know, the other thing, Maria, that we don't talk about, it's almost impossible to fire a federal employee.  There's some pretty cushy gigs --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good point.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  -- in THIS town where you basically have an insurance policy against ever getting fired unless you do something just awful.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  And you can read all the GAO reports that's backed that up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're talking about all of that this morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But there are people barely making ends meet who are trying to drive to work, and spending all their money on gasoline and going to food banks who were working for the TSA and not getting paid.</p><p>And when the Republicans stop thinking about them and start talking about the workers who aren't needed, the ones who are furloughed you have really missed the boat.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, maybe.  But how about the fact that we've got a border wall in Nancy Pelosi's state?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that immoral, the wall that separates Tijuana from San Diego --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  But --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- is that immoral?  I don't think so.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They need to start asking all of these Democrats who think that the wall is immoral or don't want to fund it, ok, let's take down the walls that are there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's how you put --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will the three million people in Tijuana assimilate with the three million people in San Diego if that wall is torn down?  I think so.  And we're going to talk about that this morning.</p><p>We've got a big show this morning from D.C., live.  Coming up Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is here, live.  National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow has a thing or two to say about the CBO protections about what exactly the impact is on the economy from that shutdown.</p><p>House Minority Leader and California Congressman Kevin McCarthy will walk us through what these next three weeks look like with his colleagues in terms of this negotiating on border wall funding.</p><p>Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell is here.</p><p>Along with AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka.</p><p>Don't miss a moment of it.  A big two hours coming up.</p><p>And we kick it off this hour right now with markets.  Futures are pointing to a flat opening this morning amid all of this uncertainty over China trade, earnings.  It's an enormous week this week.</p><p>This after stocks finished to the downside yesterday on the China growth fears, the weak guidance from Nvidia and Caterpillar as well, and of course these worries about what happens with China and the U.S.  There's conversations happening tomorrow.</p><p>Joining us right now is the founder, CEO and chief investment strategist at Mainstay Capital Management David Kudla.  David -- good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>DAVID KUDLA, FOUNDER/CEO/CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, MAINSTAY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So we've been talking about what a week this is with the fourth quarter earnings coming out.  That's been pretty much driving the story.  We have a jobs report coming out at the end of the week on Friday.  Brexit discussions, the vote today.  U.S./China discussions tomorrow.  A fourth quarter GDP number.  How do you want to invest with all of this?</p><p>KUDLA:  I think investors should be looking at stocks right now that they want to own.  We've been invested through -- the past month has been very good for stock investors.  13 percent rise through Friday from the lows of December 24th.  And that's in both growth stocks and value stocks, so a broad market advance.</p><p>We're going to see some give and take here now after this nice advance of last month but investors should be picking, you know, their points here, have their list out on stocks they want to own.  We look for a good 2019 for stock investors.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is it good news, Jon Hilsenrath, that the Fed gave us a pivot that we know that the Fed is on pause right now and that we know that they're even ready to consider slowing down the unwind of the bond portfolio?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  I don't think it's good news.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I think it shows that the Fed is becoming less confident about how strong and sustainable the economy is.  I mean it is a sign that inflation isn't picking up and that's good news.  But you see some real trepidation coming out of the Fed right now with the global economy slowing, with markets being unstable and volatile.</p><p>I think the Fed is a little worried about the outlook and that shouldn't really give us a lot of encouragement.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about that, David?  I mean the economy's slowing.</p><p>KUDLA:  But Jon this -- yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLA:  But John -- the important thing here is what happened in the fourth quarter is we had mixed messages out of fed chair Jerome Powell.  We had on October 3rd we were far away from neutral.  Then by November we were close to neutral rates.  Then on the 16th in the Fed meeting they were going to do what's right no matter what.</p><p>Then he came in on January 4th and finally said we're going to be considerate of market and economic conditions and now we're seeing a more consistent and accommodative message out of the Fed.  And that's very important for the markets.</p><p>That's music to the market's ears and that's why we've now seen a sustained advance.  So the markets and investors are now looking at a Fed that seems as though they are going to be considerate of or accommodative or take into account what's happening with the markets, with the economy, and not just normalize rates for the sake of normalizing rates.</p><p>They won't have $50 billion rolling off the balance sheet on auto pilot and they won't raise rates just to raise rates to get to a normalized rate structure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that was the worry in the fourth quarter.</p><p>KUDLA:  -- in pause like in 2016 if the market and economy warrants it.  That's important.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That was they worry in the fourth quarter -- that they were on auto pilot-- Jon.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  Yes, I make two points.</p><p>KUDLA:  That drove volatility in the fourth quarter, the Fed.  .</p><p>HILSENRATH:  David makes a really important point, you know.  So this has been Jerome Powell's first year at the Fed.  He's had a bit of a honeymoon with the market.  And then what the market has discovered in the last month or two is that Mr. Powell, you know, he kind of prides himself on being a plain-spoken communicator but his communication has confused a lot of people in the market.  And he's really had to do a lot of corrections over the last few weeks --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- so that raised some questions about him.</p><p>But the other thing about -- you know, the market wants to see the Fed on an easier path.  Ok.  But the underlying message there is that this economy can't sustain very high rates.</p><p>So it doesn't send a really encouraging message about economic growth and the economic outlook when we see that the Fed is starting to recognize it just can't sustain a tighter monetary policy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But look, we're getting the news from the companies themselves with the fourth quarter numbers coming out.  Verizon just reported mixed earnings.  They beat on earnings, but they missed on revenue.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Caterpillar.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Technology reporting late today, Apple.  And we heard from Apple already.  Facebook, Amazon -- all reporting this week, Microsoft.  It's going to be a big week for technology.  And of course you mentioned Caterpillar.  That was the big kahuna yesterday that really set the tone for the markets because Caterpillar is a great indicator of economic activity across the world, in particular China.</p><p>So stay on earnings for a second, David.  Give me your take on technology.  Because you've got Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft coming out this week.</p><p>KUDLA:  Well, you know, tech stocks got beat up very bad in the fourth quarter.  They've come back in this rally and we think that tech stocks have further to go.</p><p>Look, we think that investors should stay with tech stocks.  We have an opportunity here to add value stocks to the portfolio.  Cyclicals came into 2019 at their lowest valuation relative to the S&amp;P 500 ever.</p><p>So investors now can diversify their portfolio in an opportunistic way, holding both growth stocks.  Those tech stocks that we think still have some rebound and some further runway ahead of them, and by adding value stocks that are very opportunistic.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  David -- it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>KUDLA:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Still bullish on this market.  David Kudla joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, the State of the Union is back on, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi extended officially the invitation to President Trump to do the State of the Union in the House Chamber.  He accepted the offer.</p><p>Plus we're taking a look at the enormous cost of the shutdown, what exactly is the number?  A lot of people say it wasn't very much at all.</p><p>Then, Snapchat's unthinkable change, how the photo sharing app is attempting to compete with Instagram by changing a key feature.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>New revelations in the sexual misconduct claims against the former CEO of Wynn Resorts.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with headlines now in New York -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Maria.  The \"Wall Street Journal\" is reporting that executives at Wynn Resort ignored allegations of sexual misconduct by Steve Wynn over more than a decade.  According to a regulator's report Wynn was accused of sexually assaulting or harassing salon workers, cocktail servers and flight attendants who worked for his company.</p><p>Under a proposed settlement, the Nevada Gaming Control Board won't try to revoke Wynn's regulatory licenses but Wynn is going to pay a fine.  Steve Wynn has denied any claims of misconduct.  There's a one year chart of Wynn's in front of you right there.</p><p>Well, Snapchat has named Lara Sweet as its interim CFO.  This is another shift in leadership at Snap as the company has lost several high profile employees over the last year.  Meanwhile Snap is reportedly considering allowing longer lasting or even permanent videos on Snapchat.  It will apply the Snap shared publicly on this story's features.  Snap is down 52 percent from one year ago.  There's that chart for you.</p><p>Well, Porsche is speeding past Tesla in a fast charging race.  The car maker says it new Porsche Taycan is going to be able to add more than 60 miles of charge in just four minutes.  That will be the fastest available today, exceeding Tesla's super charging stations which needs about 30 minutes to charge a vehicle's battery to at least 80 percent.  Charging times are a key selling point obviously for these car makers and now Porsche is giving Taycan owners three years of free charging.</p><p>And obviously we're going to be hearing from Tesla this week, Maria.  Earnings are coming out from Elon Musk and company.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Cheryl -- thank you so much.</p><p>Coming up next, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi challenged over her words describing a border wall as immoral.  We will break it down when we come back.</p><p>Then support on the links, fans rallying around a pro golfer whose two shot penalty was deemed unfair.  More on that.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Keeping America safe, the government is back open but the focus now is whether President Trump can make a deal with Democratic leadership on funding for the border wall.</p><p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has called it immoral, any wall is immoral.  But her home state of California protects the southern border in some places with an actual wall -- the wall separating Tijuana and San Diego.</p><p>Joining me right now is Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell.  And the last time you were on you said you wanted to look at this again.  Congresswoman -- it's good to see you.</p><p>REP. DEBBIE DINGELL (D), MICHIGAN:  It's good to see you.  Welcome to Washington.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.</p><p>What's your take on this?  I mean can Nancy Pelosi really get away with calling a wall immoral when she has a wall in her own state, separating Tijuana from San Diego?</p><p>DINGELL:  Here is what I think is going to happen.  You've got strong countries (ph), both sides of the aisle, both houses.  They're going to go into that room and they want to cut a deal that's going to keep our nation safe.  I don't think anybody wants to see what we just went through for 35 days.</p><p>It hurt the economy.  It hurt -- and I do believe -- this is going to sound corny but I don't -- you know, why do we point -- why do we need to have a Trump win, a Pelosi win.  We need an American win.</p><p>So I'm hoping they're going to go in that room.  I've talked to my colleagues on both sides.  I've talked to Roy Blunt.  I've talked to all my Democratic colleagues in the House.  They want to win.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DINGELL:  They want to go in and put together a package that's going to keep --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So how do you win?  What's the position in terms of wall funding?  Because they may very well -- your colleagues may very well come back and say ok, here's $5 billion towards border security, not a dime toward a wall.</p><p>DINGELL:  I don't know -- if people are really working together, that may not happen.  You know, there may be money, if there are appropriate places for a wall or fence or --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is there a movement within your party, do you think, among your colleagues that they feel that, yes, some money should go for an actual barrier?</p><p>DINGELL:  I think what I hear among my colleagues is let's go into a room and do something that makes sense.  Let's come up with -- we need to -- I've said this to you a million times.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DINGELL:  We need to strengthen our borders at both sides.  Everybody talks about the southern border.  I've got this northern border too which just had a huge human trafficking problem again in the last few --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But there are areas of the southern border that are very dense.  In other words like when you just look at the wall in Nancy's state and that is three million people on one side in Tijuana, three million people on the other side in San Diego.  If you tear that wall down -- I mean isn't it obvious many of the people on the Tijuana side will assimilate into the United States?</p><p>DINGELL:  Then let me ask you this question.  Build a wall, tear down a wall -- are there structures that are working that are in place?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  .</p><p>DINGELL:  So that's -- what I do think we need drones.  We need to fill the 3,000 open patrol --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's common ground, both sides believe in that.</p><p>DINGELL:  Both agree --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Technology and drones -- definitely.</p><p>DINGELL:  We need technology.  We need to make these ports safer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Specifically in a dense area, like Tijuana/San Diego, drones wouldn't work.  I mean maybe you want that in addition to a wall.  When you have such a dense area, where there's three million people on one side of the wall and three m million on the other, don't you need an actual barrier?</p><p>DINGELL:  But they are going to go in this room.  There are people that know what they're doing.  They're people -- they're senior people that have been on homeland security, people from the areas that are impacted --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think they're going to deal?  We won't shut down the government again?</p><p>DINGELL:  I pray to God, we never shut down the government.  Not only do I pray to God that doesn't come out of conference but you're going to see Republicans and Democrats working together.  We'll get --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This whole wall issue, Congresswoman, sort of underscores what's going on I think in both parties.  Now you've got former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz seeing an opening as a result of the radicalness on both sides.</p><p>He's facing backlash on his first stop for his book tour last night.  It was his first public appearance after announcing a possible Independent presidential run.  It did not go smoothly.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire (EXPLETIVE DELETED).  Go back to (INAUDIBLE) on Twitter.  Go back to Davos with the other billionaire elites who think they know how to run the world.  That's not what the country needs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  You know, I give you a lot of credit just being in politics, by the way.</p><p>Schultz is also being criticized by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, billionaire.  He tweeted this, \"In 2020 the great likelihood is that an Independent would just split the anti-Trump vote and end up reelecting the President.  That's a risk.  I refused to run in 2016 and we can't afford it right now.</p><p>Congresswoman -- do you think an Independent run is viable?  Do you think an Independent run from Schultz would hurt the Democrats?</p><p>DINGELL:  I think it's viable.  He has the money to spend it.  But I think he would hurt the Democrats.  I'm fearful that I am -- I'm trying to step back.  I'm not getting any candidate I want to see who is going to emerge, who's got people skills.</p><p>But this is dangerous.  And as you know, told you two years ago, Donald Trump could become president.  Nobody believed me.  You all thought I was crazy.  You may not have but most people did.</p><p>And I still think he could get reelected.  And if we do not run a strong campaign and we don't have somebody like that that pulls votes off --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  One of the issues is the messaging of what the platform is.  So what do you think the Democratic candidate for 2020 should have as their platform?  What's most important?</p><p>DINGELL:  You know what we didn't do and one of the reasons I believe firmly that President Trump became President Trump.  One, people are tired of partisan bickering.  They're tired of seeing things not get done in Washington.</p><p>There are a lot of people that are hurting in this country, just working men and women who want to know that we actually care about them.  They're scared about healthcare.  They're scared about escalating drug costs.  There's -- look at our --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So healthcare should be the platform?</p><p>DINGELL:  it's one piece of it.  Infrastructure, let's create jobs.  What are we going to do about education?  Trade?</p><p>Now, the President -- you want to know why he won Michigan?  Trade.  They're tired of bad trade deals that ship jobs overseas.  We don't have a level playing field.  The President's trade policy is all over the place.</p><p>It's not consistent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you going to vote for the ratification of USMCA?</p><p>DINGELL:  I don't call it USMC.  I call it NAFTA 2.0.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you going to vote for ratification.</p><p>DINGELL:  I haven't decided yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is on your plate now in the next month.</p><p>DINGELL:  Very much on my plate.  And talk to Lighthizer about it all the time.  But I'm not voting for any bill that doesn't have and acting legislation that keeps more manufacturing from going to Mexico.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wasn't that one of the key things of this new law?</p><p>DINGELL:  But Blazer still went to --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Keeping jobs here.</p><p>DINGELL:  Blazers went to Mexico in July.  I'm not seeing any more American cars go to Mexico and get built for $1.50 to $3.50 and then gets shipped back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you want a change before you vote for it?</p><p>DINGELL:  He knows how I feel.  I'm not -- one of the more likely people to vote for it but I'm not voting for it in the form that it's in right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.   We'll leave it there.</p><p>Congresswoman -- it's good to see you.</p><p>DINGELL:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.  Congresswoman Debbie Dingell joining us here.</p><p>Coming up, the longest government shutdown in American history is over.  But another shutdown threat is on the horizon.

The new teaser trailer for \"Toy Story 4\" drops with a big surprise.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Tuesday, January 29th.  Your top stories right now at 7:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Earnings season in full swing this morning for the fourth quarter.  Several Dow components reporting their fourth quarter this morning.  Verizon reported a mixed quarter earlier this hour.  Pfizer and 3M also under pressure this morning as you can see.  3M up three percent, although Pfizer and Verizon down better than one percent.</p><p>Rising tensions with China continuing, the U.S. bringing charges against Chinese telecom company Huawei as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning between the two nations.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will be joining me as my special guest this morning at the top of the hour, 8:00 a.m. Eastern.  Join us for that talk on China and the economy as we break it all down with the Treasury secretary.</p><p>Markets this morning are hovering around the flat line.  Take a look.  Dow Industrials up 20 points right now, 26 higher.  The S&amp;P 500 is down by almost one point and the NASDAQ down about three points.</p><p>All this after the major indices finished lower yesterday across the board at 04:00 on Wall Street.  Dow industrials were down 208 points and then actually was off of the lows of the -- of the day, down almost one percent at the close.  S&amp;P 500 gave up 21 points, that was three-quarters of one percent.  And the NASDAQ was down 79 points, better than one percent lower.</p><p>In Europe this morning, a mixed story, actually mostly higher.  FT-100 at the high of the morning right here, up 1-1/4 percent, 83 points higher, ahead of the British vote on the U.K. leaving the E.U.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is up 42 points, almost one percent higher and the DAX Index in Germany higher by 25, quarter of a percent higher there.</p><p>Asian markets mostly quiet overnight.  Take a look, as you can see, it was pretty much across the board.</p><p>$100,000 penalty, how one misstep cost a professional golfer big time.  The outcry, coming up.</p><p>And Woody and Buzz Lightyear are back, the new teaser trailer for \"Toy Story 4\" is out and it marks the return of one character after 20 years.  We will bring it to you.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning.  But first, our top story this half an hour, shutdown showdown, the government open for business again after the last -- at least for the next three weeks, rather.  But the main issue, funding the wall has not been resolved and the White House is not letting it go.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  What I do know is that if they don't come back with a deal, that means Democrats get virtually nothing.  That will make the president and force him to have to take executive action that does not give Democrats the things that they want.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is the House Minority leader, Congressman Kevin McCarthy.  Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you.</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  Thanks for having me back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So, what do the next three weeks look like?  Take us through these negotiating.  Do you expect any money for the wall?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  I expect us to solve this problem in the end.  What's interesting here is the whole time speaker Pelosi said I couldn't negotiate anything until you open up government.  The president put the public first and said OK, let's go through, I'll give you three weeks.</p><p>Now Wednesday, we'll have the conference committee, the senators and the congressional members' appropriation sit down and we'll see if they're serious about it, if they're willing to do something.  Because I believe Nancy Pelosi is out of step with her own party.  If you look at her number two, Steny Hoyer.  He said of course, that walls are not immoral, and that he believes some fencing involved.  From her Agricultural secretary to her Agricultural chair to our Armed Services chair, they both believe in a wall too.  Her Agriculture chairman said give Trump the money.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and she continues to say that it's immoral which I find incredible given the fact she has a wall in her own state.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  As my state too.  You know what I find --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And your state too, exactly.  California.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  You know what I find immoral?  When you really talk about this, this is about stopping human trafficking.  In 2016, they stopped more than 2,000 individuals involved in that.  I think it's immoral that you would allow that to continue.  I don't believe anybody in America that says they support border security believes that there is no such thing as some barrier.</p><p>And the president said, he does not a -- he does not want a wall from sea to shining sea.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  He just believes in the area you need some form of barrier and he's correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, where do you think are the most important areas that you would need the wall?  I mean, we talked earlier about this wall in your state, Tijuana, San Diego where it's very dense, three million people on one side, three million people on the other.  Can you make the case that that dense area is elsewhere where that's why the president is so stuck on having this wall there?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  And it's not the president saying, it's the experts.  The president sat down with the experts and they said this is what we need to be able to secure our border.</p><p>So in certain areas, like in San Diego, we stopped illegal movement by more than 95 percent.  You look at Yuma, Arizons, El Paso another -- El Paso became one of the safest cities in the nation after being able to put it through.  That's what we need, in certain parts of the country along the border, you need a barrier.  In other parts you could put the drones in this part area.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what are you expecting to give on?  And what -- do you think they're going to offer the $5.7 billion that the president wants for border security?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  But we're arguing over one-tenth of one percent of the budget.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a great point.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  The Democrats have voted for a wall before.  But now that the president brings forward what the experts want, they say no.  That is what's so confusing to me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, what -- why is this so important for the president right now?  Going into 2020, I mean, is she seeing this as a campaign promise and that's why he doesn't -- she won't agree to it.  Because I don't know how she can call it immoral, given the wall in her own state, your own state.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Again, it's such a little price to pay for so much more security when you look at the human trafficking.  Think of the number of lives that we will save from this process if we have a secure border.</p><p>But what's more importantly, it's the president that sat down and tried to be reasonable, find common ground.  He's the one who brought DACA into it.</p><p>And let's not forget, speaker Pelosi just a year ago holds the record for the longest speech on the floor, eight hours, over one issue, DACA, which she shut the government down over.  And now she thinks that's not important?  I think those people are important as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think that this -- a negotiation, an agreement will include a DACA deal?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  It could.  It doesn't have to.  But because the Democrats and speaker Pelosi have been saying no.  The president said he was willing to go there, three more years of DACA for a portion of the border security that the experts are asking for.  I just find her out of step with her own party.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, there seems to be a movement within the party, even some of the newer congress people coming in, fresher faces saying you know what, yes, we do need border security and we do need the money.  So, are they going head to head?  I mean, are they -- do they even have a voice?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  They don't even have a voice.  Because remember, she has so much power.  She will not allow the vote to come up.  I believe inside the conference we could come up with an agreement.  The question is, will speaker Pelosi even allow that to be voted on the floor?  If we had a vote on the floor, I believe it would pass.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think that the president will allow the government to shut down again?  I mean, is the president really prepared to have another government shutdown if he doesn't get the money?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Look, I think the president's going to try to find a way to solve this one way or another.  I don't know that shutting the government down solves it.  I there's other ways to do that the president can.  I know he firmly believes in a legislative process.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Should he call for a national emergency?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  He has the power to do that.  I think the best road forward right now is a legislative agreement.  And what's so interesting to me, I'd listened to these Democrats celebrate Nancy Pelosi.  You celebrated someone that got you status quo.  They're still a DACA problem, they're still a border security problem.</p><p>And government is designed to find common ground and compromise.  The president was the one person looking reasonable in all these discussions.  I know the president's committed to this.  He will get the border secure one way or another.  He's giving the Democrats an opportunity.  He gave them an opportunity all along this discussion.  They said then open up the government, they'll discuss it.  So he did that and gave them a three week time.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean, I think this whole thing, the government shutdown and the constant resist upsets people.  I mean, you have to wonder if in fact -- you know, she keeps resisting everything that the president wants, if the people will turn on her.  Because people want to see you guys get something done.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Yes, she is celebrating status quo.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  That's not where we need to be --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me move on and ask you about 2010, congressman.  Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz thinking about running for office.  He was at a book signing last night in New York and he was heckled over his bid.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump.  You egotistical billionaire (INAUDIBLE).  Go back to getting ratioed on Twitter.  Go back to Davos with the other billionaire elites who think they know how to run the world.  That's not what the country needs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This heckler not the only one weighing in.  Michael Bloomberg former mayor of New York City also told Schultz not to run as an independent.  He said this, given the strong pull of partisanship and the realities of the electoral college system, there's no way an independent can win.  That is truer today than ever before.  Is that where we are, an independent can't win, congressman?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  No, I think it's Bloomberg upset.  Because remember, he went from a Republican to an independent to a Democrat and he just spent $120 million giving to the Democrats so they can win the majority in the House and he doesn't want his money to be wasted, so he doesn't want competition.</p><p>Look, I think there's ample opportunity for an independent to get in this race, only because the Democrats are now become social Democrats.  They're talking about a 70 percent tax rate.  They're talking about these green deals.  They're talking about socialism.  If you listen to what some of these new Democrats say, they think Venezuela's problem is not because they're a socialist country, it's because of sanctions.  They're so out of step.  They are putting letters in to help those who want to go sign up for ISIS, to be easy on them to the judge.  I mean, I have -- this is not the America we live in, and that's the difference.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  This party is so out of step and I think you'll find a lot of moderate Democrats who say I want somebody else who could talk about this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, that's why a number of moderate Democrats can't really get the OK from the party leadership because they're not left enough.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  This new socialist Democrat Party has left the Democratic Party.  They are in to -- remember, Bernie Sanders is not registered as a Democrat.  He's registered as a socialist.  AOC does not call herself a Democrat, she calls herself a Democrat socialist.  This party is moving to a whole different place.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Real quick before you go, when the election happened back in November.  You said one of your priorities going to be to get the majority back.  How are you going to do it?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Well, first of all, you've got to make sure you can recruit.  I think, you put the ideas up there.  Ideas should win at the end of the day.  You look at where we are financially in this country.  A lot of that happens to do with the policies that we're able to create, from the tax policy, the battle we had with you human trafficking and other that we were able to do.  I think you're going to find as going directly to, we've got to find a suburban areas to be able to win again in and I think we're going to be very successful.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, it's good to see you.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Congressman Kevin McCarthy, joining us there.</p><p>Still ahead, Richard Trumka AFL-CIO president on the impact of the shutdown on American workers, what he'd like to see, back in a moment with that.</p><p>And then, support on the links, a pro golfer given a big fine and a two-shot penalty which many are calling grossly unfair.  What went wrong, right here.</p><p>Plus, you've got a friend and a big surprise, the trailer for \"Toy Story 4\" drops with a character we haven't seen in 20 years.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Prosecutors resting their case against Joaquin El Chapo Guzman.  Cheryl Casone in New York with details and headlines, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It; must something else, Maria.  The federal government has now rested its case.  They called 56 witnesses.  The trial of the notorious Mexican drug kingpin started back in mid-November.  El Chapo told the trial judge yesterday he will not take the stand in his own defense.  One witness is scheduled to appear for the defense today.  Closing arguments expected to take place tomorrow and Thursday.  Big story, a lot of New Yorkers have been following very closely.</p><p>Well, professional golfer Haotong Li is getting a huge outpouring of support from fellow golfers after losing out on nearly $100,000 Saturday for a minor infraction.  It happened at the Omega Dubai Desert Classic.  Li was on the 18th green when judges accuses caddie of standing too close behind him as he got ready to putt.  Well, the ensuing penalty dropped Li's score from 71 to 73.  And he went from third to 12th.  Tour officials say the correct call was made but acknowledge it was grossly unfair.  They're looking at the giving referees more discretion in cases like this going forward.</p><p>And then, get ready for \"Toy Story 4\".  Pixar is putting out this teaser video, shows the revival of Woody's love interest, Bo Peep.  And she is back with a new, more modern look.  She was last seen in \"Toy Story 2\", back in 1999.  It is now 20 years later, \"Toy Story 4\" is going to be released, Maria, this June .  Those are your headlines from New York, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like it.  Bo Peep.  All right, thank you Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, the lingering effects of the shutdown showdown.  AFL-CIO Richard Trumka will join us to talk about the impact on American workers.  He's up next.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We are focused on the American worker this morning.  White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney saying that the 800,000 federal workers who were not paid twice during the partial government shutdown should receive those checks by the end of this week.</p><p>Joining us right now is American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organization's president, AFL-CIO, Richard Trumka.  It's great to see you, Richard.  Thank you so much for being here.</p><p>RICHARD TRUMKA, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR AND CONGRESS OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION:  Maria, thanks for having me on today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Give us your take on what the impact of the shutdown was.</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, I think there's several impacts.  There's impact on the people and you not only have government workers who get back pay but you have the government contractors who won't get back pay unless something is done.  That was a devastating effect on them.  It had a devastating effect on the economy itself.  $11 billion, although we'll pick some of that back up later in the year.</p><p>But you had a devastating effect on the airline industry where you had people, airline controllers, traffic controllers that were in school that actually just up and left.  They said we're not going to do this anymore (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What could -- what could have been done about it then, Rich?  Because you as the leader that you are and representing so many workers across the country have to be unnerved when you see open borders and illegals coming in and taking your jobs.</p><p>TRUMKA:  Look, that's just not how it works anymore.  I mean, you have people that got laid off from the president's place that have been here 20 years.  They're not taking anybody's job.  What we want to do is make sure every worker in this country has the same rights so that they can't be exploited.</p><p>Because what happens right now with undocumented workers is, they're great when no one's around.  When they try to organize and get a voice, then they start squeezing them.  They start ex -- you know, doing, calling in ICE and different things.</p><p>The idea is if everybody has the same rights, then they can't exploit those people and everybody can actually have a fair playing field.  What happens to American workers -- employers right now, is you have an employer that hires people, makes them work in unfair condition, misclassifies them, underpays them, and they're competing against our employer.  That employer needs to pay everybody the same rate, live by the same working conditions, so that we can all compete.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you're OK with illegals coming in and as long as everybody's treated the same?</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, Maria, it's a -- it's a nice cliche, illegals coming in.  But you know yourself that most people that are here undocumented or illegally came in legally.  So the whole system needs to be addressed.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, but there are apprehensions that we could look at, just in the month of December, just in the month of November, where apprehensions were of illegal immigrants coming in and wanting asylum in the United States.</p><p>TRUMKA:  There's no question that the system is broken.  We need to fix the system and have a path towards citizenship so that those workers that have been here for years and are actually making the economy run, even the president's golf courses and things like that, they have a chance to get citizenship and they work their work there.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Just a question on the golf courses.  As you know, that's the H2B program, people who come here as foreign workers, come under a specified amount of time for DOL.  I think the real question is is that, what happens to all the people, not who have been here who came legally and overstayed the visa, but what about all the people who come every day at the southern border and can cross into our country?  That's really the pernicious problem.  And even on wall, built with American workers, you'd be for that.</p><p>TRUMKA:  But listen, the people that come back and forth, you have Americans that go to Mexico and Mexicans that come to America to work.  I think Mexico --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you don't think there's a problem at the border at all?</p><p>TRUMKA:  I didn't say that.  There is -- there is a problem.  We do need border security.  And no, I don't think that a wall's the answer to it.  Every time someone's tried to build a wall it's not been very successful.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, the one in Tijuana is successful.</p><p>TRUMKA:  Ask the Chinese, ask the French.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The wall -- the wall in Tijuana --</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Ask Tijuana (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tijuana and San Diego, what abut that Richard?</p><p>TRUMKA:  I'm sorry?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The wall, between Tijuana -- separating Tijuana from San Diego, is that successful?</p><p>TRUMKA:  There are places -- there are places probably where it works.  Is that the answer to everything?  No.  Should that have been the reason for a shutdown?  Absolutely not.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  I want -- I want to ask a broader political question.  We've seen in the last two elections that increasingly voters, blue collar voters, voters in manufacturing towns all over America, the kind of rank and file people that you represent are voting for Republicans, they're going for Trump.  Does the AFL-CIO need to realign its own approach to politics in this town, given that more and more of its people are going with people like Donald Trump and his trade policies and the Republican Party?</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, that's a -- that's a question we could talk about two or three hours for.  First of all, we have realigned our politics.  We are issuing -- we're issue oriented right now.  We put an issue out and if a politician supports that issue, then we support them.</p><p>In fact, in this last election we elected two union members to the Senate, three to governorship, 18 to the House of Representative, and 925 to state legislatures, because those workers will go and support our issues.  That's what we try to do.  We find it more and more difficult to find Republicans that actually support us.  Now, the American worker believes that neither the political system --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got to jump.</p><p>TRUMKA:  -- or the economic system works for them.  They want somebody to change the rules.  That's why they voted for Trump.  If he changes the rules to their advantage, some of them will vote for him again.  If he doesn't, he stands a chance of losing those workers and right now he's losing those workers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Richard, thank you so much for joining us.  We appreciate it.  Richard Trumka there.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Show: MORNINGS WITH MARIA][Date: January 29, 2019][Time: 08:00:00][Tran: 012903cb.231][Type: SHOW][Head: Apple Disables Group FaceTime Function That Was Allowing Callers To Listen And View Without Your Consent; British Parliament To Vote On Brexit Amendments; Kudlow on the Economy; Craft Brewers Impacts from the Government Shutdown; Kudlow on China Trade][Sect: News; Domestic][Byline: Maria Bartiromo, Gerri Willis, Ashley Webster, Hillary Vaughn, Dagen McDowell][Guest: Steven Mnuchin, Larry Kudlow, Matt Schlapp, Jon Hilsenrath][Spec: FaceTime; Huawei; Apple; Brexit; Federal Reserve; 3M; Harley-Davidson; Verizon; Oath Media; Channel Inventory; World War II; CBO; Trade Talks; Deregulations; Tax Plan; China Trade; Slowdown; Government Shutdown]</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good Tuesday morning.  Welcome back, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  Live from Washington this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is January 29th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  Earnings in focus.  Investors watching results from several Dow components this morning ahead of the opening bell.  One to watch after the bell tonight -- after the close is Apple.</p><p>Meanwhile, Apple under fire FaceTime hit with a new bug that allows people to eavesdrop on you without your knowledge and even if you don't take the call.  Rising tensions with China, the U.S. brings charges against Chinese telecom company, Huawei as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  The very latest on the state of negotiations with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin coming up.</p><p>Markets are searching for direction this morning.  Take a look at the futures ahead of the open this morning.  Dow industrials picking up speed up 55 points right now, a quarter of a percent higher.  S&amp;P 500 is up two and the NASDAQ right now right now showing a gain of 11 points at the open in about an hour and a half.  This after declines across the board yesterday.  Stocks finished off of the lows, but nonetheless the Dow Industrials gave up 209 points yesterday 4:00, almost one percent lower.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 gave up 21 points, three quarters of a percent lower.  And the NASDAQ was down 79 points.  That was better than one percent lower yesterday.  Global markets this morning are mostly higher.  Take a look at European indices with the FT-100-is at the high of the morning, up 86 points, 1-1/4 percent ahead of the vote on Brexit.  CAC quarante in Paris us up 44 points and the DAX index up 21, fractional gain there.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets were little changed.  Take a look, it was pretty much across the board.  Now, our top story this morning, concerns of a global slowdown.  Last week in Davos I spoke with Bridgewater Associates founder, Ray Dalio, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, and Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey.  Here's what they said about the possibility of an economic slowdown on the horizon.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RAY DALIO, FOUNDER, BRIDGEWATER ASSOCIATES:  Europe has a negative growth and the United States is going to have a negative growth environment.  I don't mean absolute negative, I mean slowing of growth in a material way that could be close to between zero and two percent over the next 18 months.</p><p>BRIAN MOYNIHAN, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, BANK OF AMERICA:  We have the top research firm in the world, and they have done a great job.  And they have the U.S. growing at 2-1/2 percent this year.  The world growing 3-1/2 percent GDP growth.  But that's down from last year.  And so the confusion in the environment right now is a slowdown or is it going in to a recession?</p><p>Nothing we see says it's close to a recession.</p><p>JAMES QUINCEY, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, COCA-COLA:  I think we are in danger of talking ourselves into a problem.  It's just a little bit slower growth.  It's not a recession or a decline.  So we see -- we see a little -- a little softer 2019, maybe a little less tail wind than 2018.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now in a Fox Business exclusive is the treasury secretary of the United States, Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  Great to see you, Secretary.</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, UNITED STATES TREASURY SECRETARY:  Great to see you as well, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.  Your reaction to really what seems like now a unanimous feeling that a slowdown is on the horizon.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, Maria, from everything we see, the U.S. economy is still quite strong.  The companies are doing quite well.  And we see still tremendous investment in capital and human investments.  There's no question that as it relates to Europe and China, there is a slowdown.  We're monitoring that carefully.  But we still see a tremendous opportunity and a lot of capital coming into the U.S.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Federal Reserve basically told us they are on pause.  They may even pause the balance sheet unwind which is also telling us that the Fed is also expecting a slowdown, but do you believe a recession is on the horizon in 2020 even though you're seeing strength and stability so far?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  We see no indications whatsoever of a recession on the horizon.  And from everything we see from speaking to a large across the board businesses, the combination of tax reform, regulatory relief and trade is still has a very strong impact on the U.S. economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And some people are saying that the impact of certainly of trade and tariffs is causing some uncertainty.  So how much of this slowdown that we're expecting later on even if it's not right now is due to what you say you're watching China and Europe and how much of it is uncertainty around the President's tariffs program?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, Maria, as you said, there are people who expect a slowdown but I would just comment a year ago with the projections were 2-1/2 percent.  And we were at three.  We feel very comfortable we're going to hit three for last year.  And we think there's still a very good case for three percent this year.  Now, as it relates to trade, we couldn't be more pleased with the USMCA.  We are looking forward to Congress passing that quickly.</p><p>That's a very important trade deal.  We have two days of talks with China starting tomorrow.  The President is going to be involved in those talks at the conclusion.  We've been updating him.  We have another 30 days after this.  So I think we're making significant progress, and I think on the trade front, these are all very positive impacts for the U.S. economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about the trade talks because this story of China, first off, thank you to the President and to the administration for pushing back on China because that's another unanimous feeling out there, that the President did the right thing in terms of stopping China from some of its practices.  What are you expecting out of these talks?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, the President wants fair trade with China.  It's got to be reciprocal.  Right now China has free access into our markets, and we have limited access to there.  So the critical issue that we've talked about is market access, making sure there aren't forced joint ventures, not forced transfer of technology and that we have a mechanism that when we reach an agreement that we can monitor that agreement and that they'll live up to it.</p><p>And that's how I expect we will make significant progress this week on those issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How much of a priority is espionage?  Obviously the administration unveiling a sweeping set of criminal charges against Huawei Technologies.  We have had on a number of CEOs that have said yes, they have stolen trade secrets from us.  Has this come into the conversation with your Chinese leadership?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  No, let me be clear.  Those are separate issues.  And that's a separate dialogue.  So as it relates to the Huawei issues that's being run by the Justice Department.  I have no involvement in that.  I found out about that yesterday when it was announced.  So those are not part of trade discussions.  Forced technology issues are part of trade discussions but any issues as it relates to violation of U.S. law or U.S. sanctions are going through a separate track, which is the Justice Department.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, I guess the broader issue is, is this a cultural thing in China?  I mean this weekend on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" over on Fox News I spoke with the ranking member of the Intel Committee, House Intel Committee Devin Nunes and he went through some of the practices that China does every day.  Listen to this.  I've got to get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  China might have accessed allied intelligence shared with Poland and passed it on to Moscow.</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R), CALIFORNIA:  What the Chinese are doing is that they have these companies that are essentially owned by the party, the Communist Party and essentially this is a dictatorship.  There's very few people that own these companies.  They weaponize the.  So when all over the -- all over the world you have Chinese technology specifically as it relates to infrastructure on -- communications infrastructure, they will go in and they beat every other company around the world.</p><p>And in fact, they've driven a lot of companies out of business because they come in undercut.  They want to have control over all the com systems or communication systems all over the globe.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's pretty incredible.  We will handle your infrastructure of telecom and then they have a way in of spying.  How can you separate that from the conversation on trade and on forced transfer of technology?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Maria, I think you can easily separate these issues.  So there are two different issues.  One is an issue of state subsidies where they do subsidize state enterprises and they compete unfairly.  Those are trade issues, those are violations of the WTO and that's something from an economic standpoint.  We are going to enforce very seriously.  I think you know among the National Security Council, so I'm going to be careful what I say on national security issues.</p><p>But I assure you whether it's China or anywhere else in the world, our security services, DHS and others will make sure that we protect the U.S. infrastructure, we protect from cyberattacks.  That's something we're very well aware of.  But these are separate issues and shouldn't be confused.  We are focused on what are unfair economic practices.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So the best case that you can get from China is what?  Opening up their markets?  Already we are seeing some likelihood of that, UBS I guess was the first bank that was allowed to operate in China and own 51 percent of that bank.  They say they're going to go to 100 percent in three years.  Are you seeing a significant opening in terms of the Chinese willingness to open their markets to foreigners?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I do, but I think that's a good start.  But why should we have to wait three years for a U.S. company to own 100 percent in the financial services?  China can operate and own 100 percent of companies here.  So that's an example where, you know, they're moving in the right direction.  We want to speed that up.  But the issue is really we want to make sure that U.S. companies can compete fairly in China.</p><p>And if we can do that, China has a very large growing middle class.  It's an enormous market.  As I have said before, this is one of the biggest opportunities for U.S. companies in U.S. business if we can get this right.  And President Trump is determined.  This is the first administration that has aggressively said to China, you need to play fair.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is the President willing to drop all tariffs, should he get a good deal that's acceptable?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I think everything is on the table.  So the President is -- will look at, again, the objective is to have a very fair deal.  Hopefully we'll make progress this week.  The President will be involved in these negotiations and discussions.  And we've still got a lot of work to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the President said look, I'm a tariff guy.  I like tariffs.  So does that mean these tariffs are for, you know, no end in sight or would he be willing to drop the tariffs all together?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  The President hasn't made any decisions on that.  There have been no recommendations from the economic team on that yet.  The first step is to make sure we get a good agreement.  And when we get a good agreement, we'll make a recommendation to the President and he will consider that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have seen the Chinese economy get impacted.  You're still talking about 6.4 percent growth, we think, but that is lower than some people think.  What's your worry or how concerning is it that the Chinese slowdown will impact the United States?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, there's no question that China is slowing down.  They still have significant growth rates.  We're beginning to see the impact on that on world growth.  Our objective is not to slow down China.  Our objective is to make sure that U.S. companies can do business in China and can do business fairly.  So we're monitoring these issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary, stay with us.  We want to get into the shutdown and get your impact on how much the shutdown cost the economy and what you're expecting there.  Stay with us.  More of my exclusive interview with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin when we come right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are life live this morning in Washington, D.C.  And I'm sitting right now with -- in a Fox Business exclusive with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  And Treasury Mnuchin, we were talking about the broad economy.  I want to ask your thoughts on the shutdown.  The CBO says that the shutdown caused $11 billion impact to the economy, $3 billion which is completely lost because of the 35-day shutdown.  Your reaction?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Maria, Kevin Hassett, the CEA is working on final numbers for us.  I think his view is that there's no question that there was some cost but those costs will be recovered as money comes back into the system.  I think it's -- he views that it will almost all be recovered.  Now as it relates to the exact numbers, I haven't seen the final numbers yet.  But the good news is we got the government open.</p><p>People are back to work and we have not seen any significant impact on the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Has -- is the President prepared to shut down the government again in three weeks if he doesn't get the money for the border wall?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Maria, I had dinner last night with the President, the Vice President, Senator Lindsey Graham.  We had a very good discussion on this issue.  There's no question in my mind that the President, the Vice President want to do a fair deal.  Lindsey has been terrific in helping to negotiate this.  I hope the Democrats are sincere.  If they are, there's a sincere deal that will include a lot of different issues that need to be resolved.</p><p>But if they're not sincere, the President has all his options on the table.  And he's determined that he's going to make sure we have border security.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's the impact on the IRS?  There's a lot of worry out there that people are not going to get their checks after April 15th as a result of this shutdown.  What can we expect?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, let me just comment on both the treasury, our bureaus, the IRS in particular, I want to thank the enormous number of government employees who came in and worked during the shutdown.  I think as you know, we had the ability to bring in critical employees.  We never would have been able to do the sanctions that we've been doing over the last month without the hardworking people.</p><p>And the IRS had a large number of critical employees to make sure that we were ready to open for business as usual.  So we're ready to open for tax season.  We're taking tax returns.  We'll be ready for tax refunds.  We will have the phones restaffed.  Now, let me just say that there's no question, this time of the year, there's very, very heavy call volume.  That's something we have to manage.  I encourage taxpayers who have questions to try to go to the web first.</p><p>But we are ready for tax season, and I can assure you that tax refunds will be paid as normal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  So, tax refunds will be paid as normal.  That's the bottom line.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  People were worried about that.  Let me move to the sanctions and in particular Venezuela because you've applied sanctions on the Venezuelan oil industry.  Tell us specifically what the impact here is.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, sanctions are a very important tool in our national security portfolio.  And when we look at national security issues, we look at economic tools.  We look at diplomacy.  We look at national security tools, military options.  So there's no question that what we're trying to do is to cut off the money to the regime that should not be in power and make sure that the President Guaido has access to funds and has access to the assets of the country.</p><p>And to make sure we protect these assets for the people of Venezuela.  It's really quite sad.  This is a country that is very, very rich in oil resources that has had extraordinary poverty and extraordinary humanitarian issues over the last issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And have you spoken with the opposition leader party about this?  What has been the response so far?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I haven't personally, but I know the Vice President has been in communication.  I think the response has been very positive.  We've been very careful in balancing this.  We've -- I've spoken to many of the refineries over the last week.  I want to make sure that there was significant capacity.  There's a lot of oil on the water already in transit to the U.S. refineries.  So I think on the one hand, we've been able to cut off Venezuelan oil going forward.</p><p>But we're managing this with the U.S. refineries.  We've issued licenses for the U.S. refineries to continue to operate.  And if Venezuela wants to continue to sell us oil, which we would like to buy that money would go into blocked accounts and will be protected for the people of Venezuela.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what about other industries in Venezuela?  I mean, the sanctions are on the oil industry.  What about other money, other imports that they still get that?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  We will always look at additional sanctions.  We want to make sure that things like medicine and other humanitarian issues continue to go to the people.  We will always look at additional sanctions to make sure we protect the assets of the country for the people of Venezuela.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why was it important for the President to back the opposition leader?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I think he is the rightful leader of the country, the national assembly, the constitution.  I think, you know, democracy is very important to the people of the United States.  And we want to make sure that there are free and fair elections and that there is a proper democracy that's very important to the national security of the United States.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary, it's good to have you on the program.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you very much.  Secretary Steven Mnuchin joining us.  Coming up, earnings in focus.  Major companies reporting this week including Apple after the bell tonight.  What you need to know ahead of those numbers.  Then the U.K. facing a crucial test.  British lawmakers voting later today on measures surrounding the U.K.'s potential exit from the European Union.  Back in a moment with that.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Earnings driving markets this morning.  3M, Harley-Davidson, Verizon out with mixed reports this morning.  Gerri Willis is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange watching markets.  Gerri?</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  That's right.  3M, Dow component, a split decision here missing on estimates beating on revenue.  The EPS line $2.27 a share.  Revenue 7.95 billion.  They lowered their 2019 guidance.  But they say they're positioned for success in 2019 despite the global slowdown.  Stock trading higher.  Harley-Davidson, let's get to that, a big miss on both the top and the bottom line.</p><p>EPS of 17 cents a share.  Revenue of 955 million.  The stock is down and down hard this morning nearly 10 percent.  They're citing restructuring charges, incremental tariffs and recall costs.  Big troubles for the hog.  Verizon beating on EPs but missing on revenue.  We're seeing yet another split decision here.  EPS of a $1.12 a share.  Revenue of 34.3 billion.  The stock trading down nearly four percent here.</p><p>Profit hurt by the restructuring of Oath Media business as we have discussed.  Apple coming after the bell, this is critical earnings release for the markets here.  EPS estimate of $4.17 a share.  Revenue of 84 billion.  We will be focused like a laser on iPhone.  iPhone sales in China, is there an iPhone recession going on in China right now?  Watch Channel Inventory for some of the details about that.</p><p>Meanwhile, Apple having trouble with FaceTime.  A bug where callers can eavesdrop on FaceTime calls has cropped up.  The company says they are checking it.  But you should know that Tim Cook on Monday, well, he was saying big things about International Data Privacy Day asking users to insist on reforms.  Oops, I guess they got a problem.  Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Gerri.  Thanks very much.  Gerri Willis on Wall Street.  British lawmakers will debate several amendments to the U.K.'s planned exit from the European Union today and let Prime Minister Theresa May know what parliament is prepared to vote for.  Ashley Webster is live in London right now with that.  Ashley?</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.  Good morning, Maria.  This is if Parliament knows exactly what it will vote for.  There will be at least 15 amendments to choose from -- will be debated.  That will be up to the Common Speaker John Bercow.  He will decide which ones will be debated.  And it could indeed shape the future of what Brexit will look like moving forward.</p><p>Now, among the most popular amendments that we are expecting to be the debated will be what's called the Cooper amendment, that's Yvette Cooper, the Labour M.P.  It basically says if no deal is reached by February the 26th, it would postpone Brexit for nine months essentially to end of the year from march 29th, that's the date that exists now.  Then there's the Brady amendment, the Graham Brady (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>He basically is putting forward an amendment that would replace the Irish backstop with what is called alternative arrangements, such pretty vague, basically anything elsewhere and what we have now and there is no time limit on that backstop.  We have heard that Prime Minister Theresa May has already told European leaders that she wants to reopen Brexit negotiations.  Let's not forget, just last month, in December, the Prime Minister said it wasn't going to be reopened that the E.U had given her their best deal.</p><p>Now she wants to turn around and say look, you need to reopen negotiations.  I'm going to find out from Parliament what they are prepared to vote for and let's go from there.  And it calls today is January 29th.  The Brexit deadline, March 29th.  We have exactly two months left to go, Maria.  And let's be honest, there is no sign yet of a -- of a deal in place that a majority of people in Parliament can get behind.</p><p>Yesterday we had a whole series of warnings about what would happen if there was a no deal scenario.  Just crashing out retail consortiums saying, look, there's going to be empty shelves, prices are going to go up, a break in the supply chain.  It will be very, very detrimental to the British economy.  So that is the background.  Later on today, we'll find out what Parliament can get behind.  Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Ashley.  Thanks so much.  We'll check back with you.  Ashley Webster in London this morning.  Coming up.  The shutdown impact on your wallet.  I will be speaking with National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow on the economic effects of the shutdown.  Plus Federal debt reportedly headed to the highest level since World War II.</p><p>That is next.  One brewery feeling the impact.  The shutdown hitting one San Diego beer company.  We've got that story.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thank so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo coming to you live this morning from Washington, D.C.  It is Tuesday, January 29th.  Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Earnings season in full swing.  We have heard from Harley-Davidson, hit in the pre-markets after disappointing numbers.  Xerox as well headed higher after beating expectations.  Look at Harley-Davidson's shares down almost 10 percent right now.  China, one of the issues, once again.  Meanwhile rising tensions with China on the U.S. level.  The U.S. bringing charges against Chinese telecom company, Huawei, as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  Moments ago, I spoke with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin who talked about what the U.S. is looking for in the coming talks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MNUCHIN:  The President wants fair trade with China.  It's got to be reciprocal.  Right now, China has free access into our markets and we have limited access to there.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Futures this morning are higher.  Take a look, we have the highs of the morning right here with the Dow Jones Industrial average up 73 points, a third of a percent.  The S&amp;P 500 up 4-1/2, and the NASDAQ higher by 18 points, one-quarter of one percent.  European indices this morning are also higher.  Take a look.  FT-100 in London is up almost 100 points, 1-1/2 percent.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is up 55, better than one percent.  And the DAX Index in Germany up 37 points, that's one-third of one percent.  Asian markets mostly flat overnight as you'll see that was pretty much across the board with Japan and Korea squeaking out a fractional gain.</p><p>Our top story this half an hour, the cost of the government shutdown.  The CBO says about $3 billion out of 2019's projected GDP was completely lost due to the shutdown.  Joining me right now in a FOX Business exclusive is National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow.  Larry, it's great to see you this morning.</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for being here.  So obviously 35 days, government shutdown, CBO says $3 billion is lost.  Never coming back.  Your reaction.</p><p>KUDLOW:  With respect, once again, we disagree with the CBO.  I don't think we're going to lose anything.  This is completely temporary.  None of the incentives in the economy have been changed by this.  You know, that's the key point.  President Trump lowered marginal tax rates on individuals and most especially businesses.  And then he had this massive sweeping rollback of costly and burden regulations, which freed up the whole economy, including the energy sector, which has turned out to be a boom.  Why would we lose something just because of a temporary issue regarding the government?  Now, I'm always interested in sort of counting angels on the head of a pin.  We have about a $20 trillion economy, fair?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  There -- what was their number, three billion out of 20 trillion?  Do you know what the --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Three billion.  Yes, no, you're right.  You're right.</p><p>KUDLOW:  - percentage that is?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I totally understand.</p><p>KUDLOW:  I don't understand why we even mess with it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Actually, they're saying the total impact was $8-11 billion.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But that will come back, except for the $3 billion they say that is completely lost.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, again, with all due respect to the professionals at the CBO, I disagree.  Again, because the incentives in the economy -- here's the big difference between I guess the administration and the Congressional Budget Office and a lot of other forecasters.  We believe the economy is growing at three percent plus.  By the way, the Commerce Department for 2018 has scored I believe 3.1 percent.  We'll get the rest of those numbers in a week or two.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KUDLOW:  The CBO does not.  They never have.  They've never given us credit for the incentive effect of lowering taxes and regulations.  Supply side incentives are kicking in.  If you look at the whole panoply all of the economic data, whether it's very strong Christmas retail sales, whether it's industrial production, manufacturing, the best since the '80s, whether it's business equipment, which means the capex boom is happening that we always hoped for.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KUDLOW:  You'll see in my judgment, at least, the three percent trend line will continue.  CBO and many others have us at two.  But this goes back before the President.  This goes back way before.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  They don't believe the economy can grow.  They don't give any credit --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, even somebody like a Steve Schwarzman will say 4.2 percent growth in the second quarter is very hard to sustain on a $20 trillion economy.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, I'll keep working on Steve Schwarzman.  He's a good guy.  But in a $20 trillion economy, which again will grow rapidly, I see no reason why we can't continue three percent plus.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That's the whole point.  The idea that was sold to everybody I guess going back several years, maybe going back 10 or 15 years, that we're in some secular stagnation is just plain wrong.  With the right set of policies, to unleash --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- American animal spirit --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we saw that with the tax plan and the deregulation.  I totally get that.</p><p>KUDLOW:  And you look at the --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But what about tariffs and trade, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  The -- just one --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because the CBO'S report also brings that up.</p><p>KUDLOW:  One last one on this, the face of the new Trump economy -- I just want to put this in here, it's the thought I've had for quite a while.  These are men and women running small businesses.  These are blue-collar workers.  You look at the evidence, the employment for blue-collar workers, the best increase since the mid to late '80s, when I was a Reagan Cub Scout here in Washington, D.C.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  The wage rates of blue-collar manufacturing autos, they're rising faster than white-collar workers.  This is a direct result --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- of the incentives we've put into the economy.  CBO, again, it's not personal to my friends at the CBO, they don't give us any credit for these incentives.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No, I understand that.  But the --</p><p>KUDLOW:  And I want to stay with that story.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- the report on the trade policies estimated that new tariffs on imports and exports will cut an average of one-tenth of a percent from economic growth through 2029.  What's your take on that, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because we know that these tariffs are in place.  They still are impacting business and uncertainties.  So, is the President prepared to do away with all tariffs if he gets that agreement from the other side?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, I don't want to go there.  I mean, that's going to be his decision as you know.  Vice Premier Liu He is coming and we will have high level discussions Wednesday and Thursday and we're all looking forward to that, as is the President.  The President, as I read him, moderately optimistic about this trade story.  So, that's good.  What was it, one-tenth of one percent by 2029?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  So then here we are in 2019, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, no.  One-tenth of a percent from economic growth through 2029.</p><p>KUDLOW:  See, this is too hard, Maria.  It's way too hard --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- to figure that stuff out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you don't think there's going to be any -- there's --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Could it be possible that there's no impact from the shutdown?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Yes, quite possible.  I never -- it's utterly totally temporary.  So, that's -- let me --- look, let me go back -- the growth potential from China trade, people tend to look at this as a negative.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Look, I don't know the outcome of these talks.  Here's what I know, the scope of the discussion will be the broadest and deepest in the history of U.S.-China trade.  Literally everything's on the table.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Point number one.  Point number two, if China opens its markets --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is a big deal.</p><p>KUDLOW:  OK?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it looks like there's (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>KUDLOW:  Which is huge.  You know, I don't want to predict, and as Ambassador Lighthizer said a million times, and I agree, the enforcement mechanisms are going to be crucial.  But if they were to open their markets as we have requested regarding tariffs and non-tariffs, if they would let American companies own the subsidiary in China, so there's no forced transfer of the family jewels of technology, if we have --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But it --</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- some rule of law regarding I.P. theft, here's my point, open markets will allow the United States to export like crazy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But I understand that, Larry.</p><p>KUDLOW:  And that has been hand -- we've been handcuffed.  If we do that, if we do that, not only will the United States grow faster --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- because of that, China will grow faster.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That all sounds great, but can you actually do that, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Competition is the solution.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's the point, because if you're saying, \"OK, China, we are agreeing that you are opening your markets, and as a result, we will meet your demands, but then they say okay, but you have to have a communist, a government leader on the board of any company that has 100 percent.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Which is -- which is extraordinary, you're absolutely right.  It's extraordinary.  And it's --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So I mean -- so you could say it's great --</p><p>KUDLOW:  And unacceptable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- that you're going to open markets.</p><p>KUDLOW:  It's unacceptable.  It's unacceptable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But they -- aren't they saying that a communist has to be on the board of any company that has 100 percent?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I think that's been the past and I think that's going to be a very hot topic in these trade talks because that is completely unacceptable to us.  No question about it.  We will see how this turns out.  China, unfortunately, you know, they're in a slump.  China's economy is slumping very bad.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  I think part of that slump is a function of the President's tough negotiating with tariffs, when necessary, OK, part of that slump is in the last five to ten years.  China has moved in the wrong direction, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  The market-based reforms have been moving in their own direction.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But they're not market-based.  They are communists and they want communists on the board of -- So I'm just wondering, all of this sounds great, if you can actually get it done.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Oh, I know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Larry, stay with us.  We want to talk to you about other things because the tax plan and the deregulations have worked.  But there are some other ideas coming into play ahead of 2020.</p><p>KUDLOW:  China should not use the Venezuelan form of the economic policy.  We need to go back to who is it that said free market capitalism is the best path to prosperity?  It was the (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, that would -- that would be you and Ronald Reagan.  Stay with us.  We will be right back.  More with Larry Kudlow.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Thank you.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We come to you live this morning from Washington, D.C. and I am sitting with National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow, in an exclusive interview this morning.  And we were talking about China and what you can get done.  How important is tomorrow and Thursday in terms of meeting a deadline, that March 1st, in terms of a deal on the table?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I think's very important.  Look, I --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think you'll get a deal by March 1?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I don't want to predict.  It's just too hard to predict.  And, of course, these are decisions that will be made by the President, who is his own best negotiator.  Best I can is, as I said, the scope of this thing's going to as wide and broad as anything we have ever seen.  That does not ensure positive negotiator.  Best I can is, as I said, the scope of this thing is going to be as wide and broad as anything we've ever seen.  That does not ensure positive outcomes --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- right?  I think everybody, including the President, is basically moderately optimistic about this, OK?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Wait, let me ask you, your tax plan --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Ultimately -- one other thought which the President believes that he and President Xi will probably be the ultimate negotiators.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  OK?  And the work being done tomorrow and Thursday is vitally important to lay out options, OK?  But --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So the President will be involved in these talks tomorrow and Thursday?</p><p>KUDLOW:  That is what he has been saying in our meetings.  And I hope so because he's a great negotiator.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me move on to the tax plan.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because we're hearing a lot of ideas in terms of taxes now, now with a lot of 2020 hopefuls.  The Tax and Jobs Act obviously did move the needle on economic growth along with the deregulation out of this administration.  Now you've got Elizabeth Warren talking about two to three percent tax on the very high wealth people.  So if you have $50 million in wealth, you'll get two percent tax.  If you've got a billion dollars in assets, you'll get taxed three percent.  And you've got Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez talking about tax of 70 percent tax --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- on the highest earners.  What is your take on this?  Give us your reaction and what kind of an impact those policies might have.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Right.  These are prosperity killers, these are growth killers, these are job killers, these are incentive killers.  This is a return to some heavy government planning essentially direct to the economy.  You know, I hate to dwell on this because it's a crisis right now, but take a look at Venezuela, just for the heck of it.  What (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There was a time when that was vibrant -- it was a vibrate country.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That is correct.  That is correct.  And investment was flocking to it.  Then they took, down through the years, really exact measures you're describing that are coming from some of these Democratic candidates --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- and the economy was destroyed.  I mean I hear this notion we have to have equality, equality of income, equality of results, which I think runs counter to all human nature.  You know what?  A place like Venezuela has equality.  Everybody's poor.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think they'll be able to reverse the tax cuts then?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Everybody's poor in Venezuela, except for a hand -- Maduro and a handful of this top military people.  Is that what we want in America?  We are growing right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So will the Dems be able to reverse your tax cut plans?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Never.  Never, not until the President's configuration.  I -- look, first of all, if they want to try to raise taxes, it will be defeated in the Senate, Republican.  I personally believe even if it went beyond that --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- the President would veto any efforts to turn back his program.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How important --</p><p>KUDLOW:  We're doing what people said we couldn't do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But how important is debt?</p><p>KUDLOW:  They said we couldn't grow at three, four percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But how important is debt, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  We're growing at three, four percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Let's not mess with it.  If it ain't broke, don't fix it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Congressional Budget --</p><p>KUDLOW:  There's a tremendous surge in prosperity here shared by the middle and lower middle income people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Congressional Budget Office is saying that the deficit is hit -- set to hit $897 billion this year.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That would be the highest level since World War II.  When does debt become a priority?  Do you think the President, let's say he does have another term, will try to attack the entitlements?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, look, I think right now the two issues are maintaining economic growth.  You know, growth is the single biggest factor in these budget calculations.  Growth brings income and revenues.  And in fact I haven't gone through it with a fine-toothed comb yet, but I will.  I think I see that the CBO is acknowledging that our faster growth, which they did not predict, is now paying for over 80 percent of the tax cuts.  OK?  And I think you'll see more about that as we get through.  The reports just came out yesterday.</p><p>Second point I want to make is we will have a tough spending budget coming up in a few weeks, a very tough spending budget with reductions of at least five percent across the board, in non-defense accounts.  So I think that's going to be very important.  Let's minimize government where possible.  Let's grow the economy to its max.  And you will see the debt burden, which I thought debt, as a share of GDP, will be coming down, and by the way, it already is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  OK.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That's what happened during the Reagan years.  That's what happened during the John F. Kennedy years.  So, I wrote about it in my book.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That -- that's the best way to measure that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But, Larry, you know what I don't understand?  I mean you're all about growth, you have been for all your entire career.  Why are so many people worried about the slowdown?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why are we hearing some people say a recession is on the horizon?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, there's just -- it's funny in this town and I guess a little bit in New York, this is a lot of pessimism.  I don't --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you expect a recession this year or 2020?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I do not.  I don't see it right now.  If I look at financial indicators, credit spreads, the actual numbers, you know, it's just -- we -- GDP will come out a week late because the Commerce Department has reopened.  We've seen stuff like falling unemployment claims, rising manufacturing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But what are the markets telling us, Larry?  In the month of December, there was no high-yield debt issuance at all.  Credit markets are still tight.</p><p>KUDLOW:  They've come back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They've come back a bit.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Come back.  I like that.  Profits, the mother's milk of stocks, I don't know who first that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You did.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Profits, the mother's milk of stocks are rising.  The early indications are they won't to 25 percent but they're going to rise 10, to 15 percent.  I like that a lot.  Interest rates, the level of rates, are historically low.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you're not worried about market volatility?</p><p>KUDLOW:  There's a million things to worry about when I get up in the morning, you know, mainly getting here on time so I could do this great interview.  But I just want to say, if you look at the sum total of all the evidence right now, there's no recession out there.  I am the happy warrior.  I am an optimist.  President Trump is an optimist.  I think America, right now, we are the hottest economy in the world and we should remain so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll end it there.  Larry Kudlow.  Good to see you, sir.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow.  Back in a moment.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The government shutdown may be over, but the effects are still being felt.  Hillary Vaughn is live this morning at a craft brewery in Escondido, California where the shutdown effects are actually still lingering.  Hillary.</p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Hi, Maria.  Good morning.  Craft beer is a $76.2 billion industry, and for many craft breweries, like Stone Brewery, where we are today, the effects of the government shutdown are not over.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOMINIC ENGELS, CEO, STONE BREWING:  When the industry craft is built on seasonal beers, it's built on new beers, it's the new sexy thing, and if we can't get the new sexy thing to market, then we're not going to connect with our fans.  They're going to be disappointed.  We're going to make the sales numbers we planned to make in our financial plans, and these things will have repercussions.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUGHN:  As Federal workers at the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau are finally back in the office, a mountain of paperwork is waiting, about 11,000 applications for alcohol labels have been backlogged leaving craft breweries waiting to ship and sell all their new beer across state line, which means they're in limbo until these approvals go through.  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Hillary.  Thanks very much.  We've be watching that.  Hillary Vaughn.  Stay with us.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  President Trump is tweeting this morning.  He's talking about a former staffer.  Here's what he just said.  \"A low level staffer that I hardly knew named Cliff Sims wrote yet another boring book based on made up stories in fiction.  He pretended to be an insider when, in fact, he was nothing more than a gofer.  He signed a non-disclosure agreement.  He is a mess.  Dagen McDowell, great to see you this morning thank you so much.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  John Hilsenrath, Matt Schlapp.  I don't know why the President tweets this.  He's got how many million view, you know, users and followers.  He just let everybody know who this guy is like --</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, THE AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Well, he literally sat in a -- he sat in a cubicle outside my wife's office in the West Wing, and so it is kind of amazing like this insider whole kind of mythology is something the President knows is not true.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  But he's got some extra sales thanks to that tweet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  That's what I'm saying.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think, Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  Again, everybody's got a book to write.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jim Comey, this guy.  Hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Oh, that was a good answer.  Hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, Jim Comey's book, yes, well, there's -- I think that will be a story that we're going to continue following, Jim Comey and the FBI.  You know what.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Everybody wants to be Norma Desmond, Maria.  I'm ready for my close up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  Thanks, everybody.  Great panel today.  Great to see you Dagen McDowell, Matt Schlapp, Jon Hilsenrath.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FINWRE-2172770077</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FINWRE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WRR-09R1-JBHT-D0GG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">316089</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"24032\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good morning, everyone, I'm Maria Bartiromo, thanks for joining us live this morning from Washington.  It is Tuesday, January 29th, your top stories right now 6:00 a.m. on the east coast.  Earnings in focus this morning, investors are watching results from several Dow components ahead of the open this morning.  The one to watch after the close is Apple.  We've got everything you need to know this morning previewing the report.  Apple under fire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile, FaceTime hit with a new bug that lets people eavesdrop on you without your knowledge.  How you can fix it, coming up -- big story.  Rising tensions with China meanwhile, the U.S. bringing charges against Huawei as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  The very latest on state of negotiations with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin this morning.  That interview at 8:00 a.m. Eastern, join us for that.  PG&amp;E makes it official, California's largest utility filed to bankruptcy protection, following the massive wild fires.  We've got all the details, coming up.</p><p>Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz roasted.  The billionaire hackled at an event last night as he gears up toward a possible independent run for the White House.  We've got a big show this morning coming from D.C., U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is here, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow is here along with House Minority, California Congressman Kevin McCarthy.  Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell will join me, along with AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka.  Don't miss a moment of it.  We've got a big three hours, coming up.</p><p>And we turn now -- right now, we kick it off with Wall Street markets.  We're looking to see a rebound this morning.  Take a look at Futures actually have just turned negative once again.  Futures down just fractionally, about 6 points on the Dow Industrials; 1-1/2 points lower on the S&amp;P; and the NASDAQ down 13 points.  This, after stocks finished lower yesterday on China growth fears along with weak guidance from Nvidia and Caterpillar.  We told you -- the Caterpillar numbers right here.  And of course, it did worsen throughout the day as investors react to a weaker-than-expected earnings and guidance.</p><p>Joining me right now is Federated Investors Chief Equity Market Strategist, Phil Orlando.  And Phil, it's good to see you this morning.</p><p>PHIL ORLANDO, CHIEF EQUITY MARKET STRATEGIST, FEDERATED INVESTORS:  Thanks for having me back, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All indications that we are seeing a slowdown and worries around China, among other issues, how do you see the markets here as more earnings have come into play?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, you had this 20 percent waterfall decline in stock prices in the fourth quarter of last year, we thought the market was attempting to price in the prospect of recession this year.  Multiples contracted from 18 times earnings down to 14 times earnings.  In our view, there's no risk of recession this year.  So, the rally that we've seen over the last month, 14 percent rally, the market is starting to price in the fact that maybe we're not going to have a recession.  But we've had a 14 percent rally in a month.  That's very, very powerful.  We would absolutely expect some consolidation here over the next month or two particularly as we've got these critical sign posts coming up in the month of March, but as we look out over the balance of the year, we do think that multiples will return to that 18 level, and we're going to end up with a pretty good year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  To what do you attribute the slowdown?  We've got earnings in focus and we're looking at a number of companies out that give weaker-than-expected guidance or miss on the top line.  Lockheed Martin, Pfizer, and Verizon are reporting this morning.  Apple is, of course, out after the bell, so when you look at the earnings picture, where in terms of industry are you seeing the most slowdown?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, I think in a word, uncertainty is what's impacting earnings and guidance to some degree.  You've got the Fed flip-flops that we saw in the fourth quarter last year, the uncertainty about whether or not the United States and China are going to be able to consummate this trade deal.  You've got Brexit overhanging on the global market and certainly the government shutdown, which was up there for 35 days, and it was just temporarily resolved last Friday.  You've got a number of issues there, all of which are impacting companies in some way, shape or form.  So, with earnings up 25 percent year-over-year in the first three quarters of last year, this fourth quarter is a little softer, I think we're up about 13 percent.  So far, we're about a quarter of the way through the earnings season.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>ORLANDO:  And I think what companies are pointing to are some combination of those four issues that I just mentioned.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you mentioned the shutdown.  The shutdown apparently costing the economy $11 billion according to new analysis from the Congressional Budget Office, although Larry Kudlow is disputing that number, and he's going to join us this morning live to talk about it.  The report says that it hit $3 billion, that's one-tenth of a percent of economic activity in the fourth quarter alone.  So, are there sectors that were -- that were hit hardest in that regard, or do you want to look at those companies that are largely tied to the China trade as one area of the real weakness?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the council of economic advisers under Trump had advised us that the shutdown was going to take about one-tenth of one percent out of GDP per week.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, remember, the shutdown started right around Christmas, so that makes sense that we lost, you know, a tenth of a percent in the fourth quarter, you know, maybe a half a percent here in the first quarter.  We're at 1.7 percent GDP growth in the first quarter, consensus blue chip is around 22, 23.  So, we think this pretext a little high and there will be, you know, sort of a downward revision as we get later in the quarter.  But in terms of industries, I think it's really across the board.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Across the board.</p><p>ORLANDO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about technology because it's big week for tech, Apple, of course, the big story today, reporting after the close tonight -- the only big tech reporting.  Microsoft, Facebook out tomorrow, Amazon is out on Thursday.  This is the week that we'll focus on technology and that's where really the growth stories have been.  Would you want to put new money to work in any of these names ahead of their earnings?</p><p>ORLANDO:  Short answer is probably no.  Again, you've had this 14 percent rally here in the last month, you've got concerns about slowing economic growth both in the U.S. and China.  We think that those issues will be resolved as we get into the back half of the year, but right now, you know, why run the risk of putting new money to work after you've had a big rally in some of these names ahead of what could be a disappointing earnings number or perhaps conservative guidance.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, the stock has come down because people were worried about it.  So, we'll see what the numbers are.  Would you, at some point, go back in to tech?  What's your favorite group right now, Phil?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, the areas that we like best in the U.S. markets are energy, financial services, industrials, and health care.  In terms of looking overseas, emerging markets look very attractive to us.  So, the areas that have really gotten hit the most are the ones that we've been attracted to.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there.  So, the valuations are better, I guess, is what you're saying.</p><p>ORLANDO:  The valuations are much more attractive.  We think the fundamentals are still very strong.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Phil, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>ORLANDO:  Great to see you.  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Phil Orlando joining us there.  Meanwhile, a bug in Apple's FaceTime app lets users listen in someone's phone without even the person knowing.  Dagen McDowell, what's happening this morning?  Good morning to you, Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well, Apple has some explaining to do, but particularly on this earnings call this afternoon.  So, there's a bug in the Apple iPhone that would allow people to eavesdrop on FaceTime users' calls.  A FaceTime user calling another person could listen in while the recipients phone is still ringing even if the person never accepts the call.  This was -- it involves several steps in the Group FaceTime feature on the iPhone.</p><p>Apple has disabled that Group FaceTime while it tries to come up with a fix for this, but you can eavesdrop in on somebody, essentially listening through the microphone, even if a person never takes that call, you could eavesdrop on rooms with unattended devices and even receive unauthorized video from the phone.  And again, it would take several steps to do this, but this is coming from a company, Maria, that loves to brag about its privacy protections and even throws shade at the likes of Facebook and other technology companies.</p><p>And adding embarrassment to embarrassment, yesterday was International Data Privacy Day and Tim Cook was tweeting about that.  Here's what he said on Twitter yesterday before this bug, this eavesdropping bug was disclosed.  We must keep fighting for the kind of world we want to live in.  On this Data Privacy Day, let us all insist on action and reform for vital privacy protections.  The dangers are real and the consequences are too important.  Big whoops for Apple, and of course, everything that happens in the business world is a political opportunity.  The Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo had to weigh in on this as well, putting out a statement late yesterday, say, \"Urging FaceTime users to temporarily disable the app.  So, Apple beat him to it, they're trying to fix it.  Embarrassment nonetheless.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible because you don't even know -- I mean, the phone could be ringing and you don't even know that they're listening.  I mean, that's the worst part of it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  I can explain later as the show goes on how this work, but you'd have to place a FaceTime call, go to the group, add yourself to the call and then the recipient of the call would have to hit maybe one like the on-button on the phone in order to activate it, but it was possible, and it was all over the internet yesterday how to do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, if -- so, if it's -- if it's not on and you say -- and you do -- and you decline the phone call, they can't listen in?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Unless you -- but you can't touch the phone at all.  Like, it's not even declining the phone.  Like, if you hit the up -- the up volume button on the phone, and so if I was playing this trick on you, it would activate it, and they could essentially hear what was going on in the room.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Unbelievable.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  I want to hear more about that, for sure.  Meanwhile, there's this, as expected, PG&amp;E filed for bankruptcy protection following those devastating wildfires in California.  Cheryl Casone on that in headlines right now.  Cheryl, good morning to you.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  Well, PG&amp;E is facing roughly about 30 billion in potential liabilities, as investigators are looking into whether the company's equipment played a role in starting California's deadliest fire.  More than 100 people died following a series of wildfires that burned hundreds of thousands of acres over a two-year period.  The utility providing energy service to 60 million people, we should add.  Taking a look at shares of PG&amp;E, look at that, in the premarket down nearly nine percent.  And those loses have actually paired back in the last hour or so, folks.</p><p>Well, China's Vice Premier has arrived in Washington for high-level trade talks that are going to start tomorrow.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and trade representative Robert Lighthizer will attend the two-day meeting.  Yesterday, the Trump administration announced a pair of indictments against Chinese telecom giant, Huawei.  The U.S. is accusing the company of trying to steal trade secrets from T-Mobile.  The Justice Department also charging Huawei with conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran.</p><p>And the China story continues, folks, shares of Nvidia are lower this morning.  The chipmaker is warning investors, and expects much weaker sales thanks in part, yes, to China's slowing economy.  It also previously cautioned the sales of its graphics processors that are used in video games PCs would be disappointing.  The China effect continues.  Chips for video gaming account for more than half of their business, they lost half their market value since hitting their peak back on October 1st, Maria.  So, Goldman Sachs had to come out last Friday, Maria, warning that a lot of these chip companies that have massive exposure to China are going to have really rough reports.  Micron Technology, even Wynn Resorts, the casino company, has got big China exposure, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, for sure.  All right, Cheryl, thanks so much.  Coming up next, five police officers are injured this morning, four of them shot while serving a search warrant.  The very latest coming up.  And then a venti-size disaster for Howard Schultz last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire (BLEEP).</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Former Starbucks CEO having a rough time exploring a 2020 Presidential run as he gets heckled.  We break it down right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Live from Washington, we are eyeing 2020, former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz facing backlash last night on his first stop of his book tour.  It was his first public appearance after announcing a possible Independent Presidential run.  It did not begin smoothly.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire (BLEEP).  Go back to getting ratio'd on Twitter.  Go back to Davos with the other billionaire elite who think they know how to run the world.  That's not what democracy needs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, my goodness.  Schultz is also facing backlash from former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.  Here's what he tweeted: \"In 2020, the great likelihood is that an Independent would just split the anti-Trump vote and end up re-electing the President.  That's a risk I refused to run in 2016, and we can't afford to run it now.\"</p><p>Here with me this morning to talk more about all of that is Dagen McDowell back in New York, Wall Street Journal Global Economics Editor Jon Hilsenrath here in D.C. with me, along with the American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp.  Gentlemen, it's good to see you.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Welcome to Washington.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, thank you so much.  And welcome to presidential politics, Howard Schultz.  What do you think about that?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Well, I'm going to get some popcorn.  This could be a real interesting Democratic primary, and whatever this Independent thing is, don't you love Michael Bloomberg who has probably spent a million dollars on polling, trying to figure out every way to become the President.  Publicly chastising Schultz for running as an Independent when that's exactly what Bloomberg would just love to do if he could.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  You know, on the one hand, Dagen, I feel like there is an opening for an Independent because there's such extremes and radical conversation going on certainly on the left.  And on the other hand, I don't know, how much is a cup of coffee at Starbucks?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Again, that $18.00 cup of Joe, I'm joking, I'm exaggerating.  It's helping --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think it's like $6.00.  I mean, seriously.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, we love cart coffee around this place.  But again, that's helping fund this run.  But Michael Bloomberg -- you know what, Michael Bloomberg should run for the Democratic nomination if he thinks he can win, it's just hilarious to have this multibillionaire lecturing Howard Schultz about an Independent run when actually a cup of Starbucks coffee has more charisma than Michael Bloomberg, number one.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Number two, it's going to be really interesting to see the narrative in the spring of 1992 with Ross Perot was -- Ross Perot was going to divide the Democratic vote, that it wouldn't hurt the Republican.  This could very well -- I mean, it depends on who -- what Howard Schultz says on the campaign trail and how far-left the Democrats go when they're running for the nomination.  But I'll say this, what he said so far about pay -- how to pay for Medicare For All and how that's impossible, I would be really interested to hear him talk about how to fix the health care system, because he might come to the table with some really interesting ideas and force the Democrats to answer the hard questions about paying for this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that is the thing, I mean, this party unfortunately, it's very hard for someone who's a centrist to actually have a shot.  You had Tim Ryan from Ohio, he wanted to do it, he's an economic thinker, he doesn't have a shot because of the same thing, you've got the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's 70 percent tax rate, the loudest voice in the room.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I mean, there's no question that these primaries are starting out very much from the left, you know, you have talk about a wealth tax, and 70 percent high-income tax threshold.  You have Elizabeth Warren who is going around beating up on the banks.  This is definitely a left-leaning primary season that we're going to be going into.  What I find so fascinating is the journeys that these different billionaires are traveling.  You know, you had President Trump who supported a lot of Democrats as a businessman in New York City traveling over to Republican Party, now you have Michael Bloomberg who started out as a Republican Mayor --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- traveling over to the Democratic Party, and Howard Schultz doesn't know where to go.  He doesn't know where he fits in.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He doesn't know where -- and what about Senator Kamala Harris?  Let's listen to her, because she held a CNN Townhall meeting in Iowa last night.  Harris is vowing to eliminate private health insurance with Medicare For All if elected president.  What's your take, Matt?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Making insurance companies illegal.  Look, the Democratic Party has become quite radicalized.  Think about this, less choices for the patient is the solution to our problems.  That seems insane.  Also, do we really think the government, when you get your tags to drive your car, or when you pay your taxes at the IRS, do you really think all the solutions to our problems are there?  I don't.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Let me ask you this, who does President Trump want to see come out of this whole --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think he wants Howard Schultz to run.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think -- he was taunting him yesterday.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH:  No, besides Howard Schultz, among the Democrats, who does he -- who does he want to (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>SCHLAPP:  I think most Republicans -- I'm not going to speak for the President -- but I think most Republicans believe that Elizabeth Warren is so far out there on the loony left, basically Marxism, socialism that I think they find that a delicious opportunity.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Can I --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- call the confiscation, Dagen.  He called it (INAUDIBLE) I mean, this two or three percent tax on assets, confiscation.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It is wealth confiscation.  It's totally communist and then to try and find people when they hand in their U.S. citizenship when other countries come calling, wanting you move there because they won't come and take your hard-earned money.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  One thing I want to point out that Jon Hilsenrath said that Howard Schultz doesn't know where to go.  President Trump should be worried about a Howard Schultz, because what if he comes to the table, like I said, with ideas that appeal to voters in this country who feel left out.  Who left out from the Republican Party and certainly left out by the left-leaning Democrats in this environment.  So, be very, very careful.  And one other thing I'll add with Howard Schultz at that -- at that bookstore, that's just the New York City welcome wagon.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's the way they treat all tourists in this city.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, I think you make a good point because there is that path.  That path of centrism.  I mean, that path of the center, because people do feel like it's gone wacky all the way on the left, for sure.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  It's a centrist country, but don't forget Hillary.  She's making noises.  Maybe that's the President's favorite opponent.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH:  We haven't seen any --</p><p>SCHLAPP:  She's making noises.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  We haven't seen anyone travel that centrist path as an Independent to presidency.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  So, it was a smart move on Howard Schultz's part.  We'll see.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Or a risky one for all those billions --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, certainly risky.  Take a quick break.  Extreme weather warning meanwhile on the other side of this break, millions of people across the country are gearing up for an Arctic blast as temperatures are plummeting, that's next.</p><p>Then showing their cards, British Prime Minister Theresa May asking Parliament to put up its plans from Britain's exit from the E.U.  Details on the historic debate.  And the vote happening later today, back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  It is cold out, and the deep freeze is setting in, hitting millions of Americans with subzero and dangerous temperatures.  Fox News Senior Meteorologist Janice Dean in the Fox Weather Center right now with the very latest.  Janice, tell us about it.</p><p>JANICE DEAN, FOX NEWS SENIOR METEOROLOGIST:  Hi, Maria, yes, we could be dealing with historic lows.  These are current windchills, what it feels like when you go outside and you are not protected.  Dangerous, potentially life-threatening windchills of -41 in International Falls, -18 in Chicago, but we still have another blast behind this.  So, these are morning lows, these are not windchill temperatures: Chicago -25 on Thursday, -31 in Minneapolis, -16 in Detroit.  Again, those are not windchill values.  Those are actual air temperatures.  But with the windchill, in some cases, we could get windchill values of -40 to -50.  If you go outside, your skin is going to freeze in minutes.</p><p>So, here's Chicago, Illinois.  Your all-time record low is -28.  So, we're going to flirt with historic lows, Maria.  This is a big deal.  The good news is it won't be long lasting.  By the weekend, we'll start to rebound, but I also want to make mention with this arctic cold front as we have snow across the deep south.  Snow that could cripple travel across portions of Atlanta, Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, and towards the southeast, so that's another dangerous part of the storm is the -- not only extreme cold but the snow as far as south as the gulf coast.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Janice.  Wow, what a story, thank you so much.</p><p>DEAN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will be watching.  Janice Dean.  Coming up next, the State of the Union is back on, it is February 5th.  Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi extending an invitation to the President, he accepted the offer.  Then, we're taking a look at the enormous cost of the shutdown.  What is the real number?  Plus, place your bets, Super Bowl fans getting ready to throw down an enormous amount of cash.  So, bet on the big game Sunday.  We break down all the numbers.  Stay with us.  Live from Washington this morning.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us.  We are coming to you live from Washington this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, January 29th, your top stories right now 6:31 on the east coast right now.  Earnings season is in full swing, a lot of big names reporting their fourth quarter today.  Xerox and Pfizer set to report in just a few moments, we'll bring you the numbers as soon as they hit the tape, and tell you how they are impacting markets.  Rising tensions with China, the U.S. is bringing charges against Huawei, as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will be my special guest, in about 90 minutes time.  We will break it all down with the Treasury Secretary, coming up.  So, stay with us.</p><p>Meanwhile, Futures relatively flat this morning, take a look at markets, down 20 points on the Dow Industrials, down 4 points on the S&amp;P, down 18 points on the NASDAQ.  We are expecting some pressure at the start of trading this morning, after all the major indices finished lower, yesterday, on Wall Street.</p><p>In fact, at 4:00, the Dow Industrials gave up 208 points, that was almost 1 percent lower, the S&amp;P 500 down 21, that was three quarters of a percent lower, and the NASDAQ with a 79-point decline yesterday, at the close, down better than 1 percent.</p><p>Investors are watching some big news this week, J.P. Morgan, calling this week the most important week of the first quarter, and here is why, you've got earnings, you've got the British vote, you've got U.S.-China trade talks, you've got a Federal Reserve decision, we're not expecting a Fed hike.</p><p>We've got fourth quarter GDP coming out.  And, of course, at the end of the week, the job's report for the month of January, a big week, investors want to watch it and will be covering it all.</p><p>European indices this morning look like this, in terms of trading.  We are looking at gains in Europe.  The FT-100 up one and a quarter percent, 86 points higher, the CAC Quarante in Paris is up a half a percent, 26 points higher, and the DAX Index in Germany, higher by a fraction, as you can see there.</p><p>Asian markets overnight, flat, take a look.  No real moves there, because mover was the KOSPI Index in Korea, up a quarter of a percent.</p><p>Well, there is tragedy in Houston to report, five police officers injured.  Four of them shot, while serving a search warrant.  We have the very latest, coming up.</p><p>And a debate in parliament, British lawmakers set to vote on the latest plan for the U.K. to leave the European Union.  We are previewing that and we will take a look at the impact across the world.</p><p>We've got a big program this morning from D.C., U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is coming up this morning, along National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow, they will take a look at all of these expectations that the economy is slowing.</p><p>Plus, House Minority Leader and California Congressman, Kevin McCarthy, is with us, along with Michigan Congresswoman, Debbie Dingell.  Plus, AFL CIO, President Richard Trumpa, here as well, big show, don't miss a moment of it, big three hours, coming up. And we are kicking off this half an hour right now, with this top story, feeling the effects of the shutdown, Washington, D.C. back in business for now, President Trump will give his State of the Union of Address on February 5th, Tuesday.  The address was originally supposed to be today.</p><p>Even though the shutdown is over, the U.S. is still feeling effects, new numbers from the Congressional Budget Office to report.  The U.S. GDP will be $3 billion lower during the fourth quarter of 2018, because of this shutdown.  On the immigration front, backlogs of immigration courts grew by at least 10 percent, according to Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about all of that is Americans for Tax Reform President, Grover Norquist, Grover, good to see you.</p><p>GROVER NORQUIST, PRESIDENT, AMERICANS FOR TAX REFORM:  Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So, the CBO is talking about a $3 billion-dollar hit, in fact, as a result of the shutdown, Larry Kudlow is having an issue with this.  He says, frequently disagrees with the CBO anyway.  What's your take in terms of what the shutdown cost the economy?</p><p>NORQUIST:  Look, the key thing is that the economy continues to grow and we're looking at a three percent rate of growth for the year, so $3 billion is a big number, unless you compare it to the GDP of the United States in the fourth quarter.</p><p>So, actually, we're doing fairly well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You don't think it had much of an impact then, Grover?</p><p>NORQUIST:  No, it's a small impact and we have a tremendous growth for the year, which is way beyond what the CBO said was possible, when they scored this.  The CBO needs to spend a little more time going back to explain why they were so wrong on all of their recent predictions, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  Go ahead.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Grover, the Federal Reserve and most of the economist that we surveyed at the Wall Street Journal are saying that the economy is slowing down in 2019.  We had a nice burst in 2018 in part, because of tax cuts and in part, because there's more spending, $300 billion of additional spending.</p><p>But now, they say the economy is slowing along with the global economy, what does that say about the impact of these tax cuts, are the tax cuts really created the long-run growth that Republicans said was going to happen?</p><p>NORQUIST:  The tax cuts do two things.  We were at 35 percent rate, which is the highest in the world.  It made sense for an American company like Burger King to be bought by Canadian company, because even though they're selling the same hamburgers, the same number of employees, it was worth more, because we had a worldwide tax system at 35 percent.</p><p>By taking 35 down to 21, we became competitive with Europe.  I mean, our friends, the Germans were at 25, the Japanese were at 25.  I'm sorry, the Japanese were at 30.  The Chinese were at 25.  And we were at 35.  We weren't even close to being competitive.  It's a huge change in the direction for the country.</p><p>And if the CBO tells you they're pessimistic, they didn't think you could do three percent, they laughed at three percent growth, said you could never do more than --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  The question is, is that three percent growth.  I think a lot of people understand that the corporate tax rate was uncompetitive, even some Democrats wanted to lower their corporate tax rate, but the question is, this new tax code that we've got, is that sufficient to sustain the three percent growth in 2019?</p><p>NORQUIST:  It's a good first start.  We also need to do something about the workforce.  We need more workers and frankly, there's more tax reduction that needs to be done and spending restraint is very important at the end of the day.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  I want to go back to this question about a shutdown, Grover, which is, people are saying, they're almost using the reason why you couldn't cut government, because somehow, that would have a negative impact on our economic growth.  That seems like a very dangerous road to go down.</p><p>Isn't it true that all of this money that they are saying didn't get put into the economy, are you worried that the government actually won't spend all of that by the time that the authority over the money, expires?</p><p>NORQUIST:  For the government to -- I was taught this (INAUDIBLE) economics in college also.  The government takes your money, and then spends it.  It's much better for the economy than if it lets you spend it.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Right.</p><p>NORQUIST:  Because you would waste some of it by investing it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because they can spend money better than you, of course.</p><p>NORQUIST:  And that's the oddest thing because, of course, that's nonsense.  East Germany should have done very well, under this theory, but it doesn't, so --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  What the government is doing is borrowing other people's money and spending it, right?  I mean, we're talking about deficits that are nearing a trillion dollars.</p><p>NORQUIST:  The (INAUDIBLE) cost the government is how much the government spends, whether they borrowed or take it, it's still gone from the -- from the real economy.  The cost of government is total government spending.  We should have taxes low, and then the least destructive way possible, all taxes are somewhat destructive.  And you have less borrowing if you have less spending.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what about all of these new plans?  And by the way, we are getting earnings right now, as we're talking 3M and Xerox, both beat expectations, although 3M is cutting its forecast for the year.  What about all of these ideas about taxing the wealthy?  New York Congressman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez claims for a 70 percent marginal tax rate on the tippy top, as she calls it.</p><p>Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts senator, hopeful, for 2020, two percent tax on Americans whose assets exceed 50 million.  If you're a billionaire, three percent, what's the impact?</p><p>NORQUIST:  OK, magicians like to do this, so you're not looking at, you know -- watch my right hand, don't look at the left hand.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NORQUIST:  The reason they talk about high tax rates on rich people, is that they want to gouge the middle class.  The difference between the United States and Sweden, Finland, Denmark, the countries that Cortez talked about is, they don't have the 70 percent rate, just back up for sec -- there isn't a country in the world with a 70 percent income tax rate.</p><p>Many countries used to, the Beatle song, 19 for me, one for you, 95 percent tax rate, and then the Beatles moved to United States, and everybody who could pay tennis, left Sweden.  And all the countries of the world realize that tax rates that high were stupid and destructive and didn't help equality or growth or anything like that.</p><p>So, they got rid of them.  The whole world got rid of them.  We did it, it was stupid.  We back offed it and had strong economic growth as a result, so 70 percent stupid and destructive.  It's not America saying, the world says that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You probably showed the op-ed today, in the Journal, in California, and taxes as well.  The Journal, this week, by Cypress founder, T.J. Rodgers, which was very good, Another California Tax Grab, he writes.  In it, the politicians have fueled an affordability crisis that drives away businesses and exacerbates homelessness.</p><p>California Governor, Gavin Newsom, called for even higher taxes in his inauguration speech earlier this month.</p><p>NORQUIST:  California is a good example of 70 percent play.  They have a 13 percent rate on people making a million dollars, but they have 8 percent rate on people making $42,000.  So, they want the middle class people in California to think you're OK, because we're really screwing the other guy.</p><p>And point of fact, Florida has a zero percent first income tax, Texas has a zero percent first income tax, 8 percent looks good compared to 13.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NORQUIST:  Looks lousy compared to zero percent.  They want the middle class to think somebody else is paying the freight.  That's why they have those phoney high tax rates that don't raise much money.  It's to fool the middle class.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it is talking point, and it works for the populist.  Let me bring in Dagen McDowell on this, because we hear this every time we go into the tax discussion and we have a Democrat on which takes out another one of those talking points on taxes, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And I want to say that Senator Kamala Harris said that the first thing -- she said it last night, in the town hall, he first thing she do is to cut taxes for the middle class.  Well, roughly half this country pays no net federal income tax, number one, and the Republicans just did that particularly, doubling the standard deduction.</p><p>So, I don't know who she's going to cut taxes for.  But this is the ruse and this is the big liberal lie that all of these big new welfare state initiatives, whether it's green energy, even single payer, it's all going to be paid for by the super rich.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And that it's not going to be -- that the paying won't be spread across every person in this country to fund this welfare state.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And by the way, the numbers don't add up even if you tax all the rich, you're not going to get the amount of money you need for this green deal, Grover.</p><p>NORQUIST:  You don't even balance the budget if you do that, never mind half money for new things.  Look, the big difference between United States and Denmark, United States and Sweden, it's not how much money higher income people pay, it's what happens to middle-income people.</p><p>Denmark, Finland, Sweden, the tax rate on middle income people is 10, 15, 20 points higher than an American middle class person.  And, you add to that the value added tax.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NORQUIST:  The difference between United States and Europe is how heavily taxed middle income people are, and they have those (INAUDIBLE) high rates that very few people pay, to make people in the middle class think that they are getting a deal.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Speaking of middle income tax -- a lot of Democrats want a carbon tax, gasoline tax and even some big American business.  That's the way to address the issue of climate change.  Do you see any path towards a carbon tax that would be acceptable to your point --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I guess, but real quick, Grover.</p><p>NORQUIST:  No.  No, absolutely not.  And the reason is, you can look at Washington State, very deep blue Washington State.  They have twice had it on the ballot and twice defeated a carbon dioxide tax, gasoline taxes lose overwhelmingly.  This is too obvious tax on middle-income people.  It's a loser up.  They are having this fight in -- our dear friends in France or loggerhead down the subject.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We know how that played out.</p><p>NORQUIST:  We had the Ontario government and the Alberta government collapsed as a result of this, and three times, in Australia.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Grover, thank you.  Yes.</p><p>NORQUIST:  Bad politics and lousy economics.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Grover, thank you for the facts, we appreciate it, Grover Norquist, joining us there.</p><p>Five officers injured in a shooting in Texas, meanwhile, Cheryl Casone in New York, with the details, there.  Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  That's right, Maria.  Four officers were shot and another officer suffered a knee injury in Houston.  They were serving a search warrant at a suspected drug house.  Police say two of them were hit in the neck.  Those officers are in critical but stable condition.  Two suspects were killed at the scene.</p><p>Well, a key E.U. negotiator, warning the risk of Britain leaving the European Union without a deal, is very high, as parliament votes on amendments in Theresa May's exit plan today.  Lawmakers set to consider more than 10 different amendments before taking votes.  That's going to be at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>And those votes come after May's plan to leave the European Union was overwhelmingly rejected earlier this month, a lot of those votes against her from her own party.</p><p>Well, Americans will be betting an estimated $6 billion on the Super Bowl, that's according to the survey by the American Gaming Association.  About 22.7 million U.S. adults plan to place a bet on the upcoming Atlanta game, of those bets, 94.47 percent, reportedly illegal, but let the games begin, Maria, and those are your headlines.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Be there to watch it all, front-row seat.</p><p>CASONE:  I'm there for you, Maria.  I've got surprises for you, coming up.  You're going to love them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK, looking forward to it.  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, crisis in Venezuela to take a look at, new sanctions have been placed on the country's oil.  Plus, National Security Advisor, John Bolton, may have inadvertently revealed the administration's next move.  Why his notes are raising eyebrows this morning.</p><p>Then, farming in America, why farmers are being forced to rent water.  That's up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A look at some of the big headlines across America this morning.  The Chicago Tribune reporting on the Pension Agency criticizing Sears Chairman Eddie Lampert's plan to acquire the bankrupt retailer.  The article explaining that the agency sets to takeover Sears.  Pensions objects to the bid, calling it the final fulfillment of a year-long's scheme to deprive Sears and its creditors of assets and its employees of jobs while lining Lampert's on owns pockets.</p><p>The Daily Camera in Colorado, reporting on how Boulder County farmers are increasingly renting water.  The report explains how ownership from agricultural interests has dropped from 85 percent in the late 1950s to just 30 percent.  The water increasingly moving to municipal control.</p><p>And the Mercury News writing that how in one California city you can text 911 for emergency help.  According to the paper, the police department there announced that the service is now available in the city.  It is meant to help people who are hearing or voice impaired.  The police are also recommending that you not send emojis.  Well, yes, I would think not.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  What are we coming to?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  My God, but it is good that you can text 911.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  That's a good step, just don't text person emoji.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, crisis in Venezuela new sanctions placed on the country's oil, plus National Security Advisor John Bolton may have inadvertently revealed the administration's next move, why his notes on his legal pad are raising eyebrows this morning?  We're breaking that down when we come right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A framework for peace.  The U.S. and Taliban negotiators making a preliminary on key issues to end the war in Afghanistan -- the longest war in American history.  The two top points American troop withdrawal and insurgence vowing to end terrorist attacks abroad, that's according to the Wall Street Journal.  Many hurdles remain to ensure the peace is in place.  Joining me right now is Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst, General Jack Keane.  General, it's always a pleasure to see you.</p><p>GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST:  Good to see you, Maria, and welcome to Washington again.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  And what do you think about this?  I mean, are we supposed to be trusting the Taliban?</p><p>KEANE:  No, we can never ever trust the Taliban, that doesn't mean that we can't have a treaty with them.  But here's what I think is going on, a couple of things have changed: one is the Taliban in the last couple of years have gone all out as we have so dramatically reduced our forces, thinking that they will going to be able to overthrow the regime, because the only thing the United States is really doing is training and assisting the ground forces -- no longer doing the fighting, however provide an air power.  That didn't work.  They retook some territory but never took capitals or provinces and they never took -- they never able to secure a province.  So, what has happened?  The war stalemated.  The Taliban cannot take over the government and the government cannot defeat Taliban, even with our assistance.</p><p>Second thing, and this is crucial, Pakistan has gotten involved in this in a way they've never have before.  They forced the Taliban to go to the peace negotiation table, why?  Pakistan knows it's no longer in national interest to keep this thing stalemated.  There's growing al-Qaeda and growing ISIS presence in Afghanistan which gives the Pakistanis some concern.  So, those are the new things that are happening.  That's why the negotiations have some momentum.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's the thing, though.  I mean, so many people were worried when the president said: we were withdrawing the troops.  And where do you stand on that now?  I mean, do you feel better about it given this peace deal?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, let me answer it this way -- I mean, it is an essential question: the Taliban themselves, we are trying to get an agreement with them that, one, they'll stop trying to overthrow the government and number two, they'll power share with them and also, they will assist in taking down the al-Qaeda and the ISIS.  I don't think we can trust them to do that, based on the fact that they provided safe haven for Osama bin Laden for almost 10 years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  So, what do we do?</p><p>KEANE:  So, we leave in place, after we bring out the troops that are providing the training and assistance.  We leave in place a counterterrorism force and an intelligence capability indefinitely.  We're doing that in Yemen, we're doing it in Libya and we're doing it in Africa.  The one in Africa is off the coast.  It's a Maritime Joint Task Force.  That is what we need to do, that is the guaranty against the Taliban because the issue in Afghanistan has always been, we would never intervene in the civil war in Afghanistan between the northern alliance and Taliban for one reason only, we didn't evade, because they attacked the United States.  That's the reason we're there.  We don't want that to happen again and we cannot trust the Taliban to provide that guarantee for us.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, let me move on and ask you about sanctions on the Venezuelan oil industry.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin who will be here shortly this morning along with Security Adviser John Bolton, explain the decision in a briefing yesterday and issued warning for disputed President Nicolas Maduro.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN BOLTON, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR:  The president has made it very clear on this -- on this matter that all options are on the table.</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY:  There's no reason why these resources shouldn't be used for the economic benefit of the people there.  There's no reason for the poverty and the starvation and the humanitarian crisis.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to this announcement yesterday?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, increased pressure on Maduro regime is certainly a welcome thing.  I mean, this really comes down to the loyalty of the military to Maduro.  As long as that loyalty is there, it's unlikely that Maduro is going the leave.  If that loyalty starts to fall apart, I hope we're working a 'plan b', which is engineering right now some kind of exit path for Maduro, where he can go into exile with recriminations in Venezuela.  The Reagan administration did this very successfully on Ferdinand Marcos, back in 1986, overwhelming popular opposition to him, hundreds of thousands of people.  We engineered his exit.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me squeeze in this question before you go general.  This image from the briefing going viral and it shows John Bolton's notepad with the notation: \"5,000 troops to Colombia.\"  Whoa, do you think we should be sending troops to the region?  What do you think about this?  Caught on camera.</p><p>KEANE:  Look, when we deposed Noriega in 1989 operation just cost Panama, 26,000 troops, is what it took.  When we deposed a dictator in Haiti, 28,000.  The ease of troops that would only be in there, move into Venezuela, if there's a problem at the embassy to our diplomat.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How significance is revealing such a secret?</p><p>KEANE:  I think he'd probably wanted to reveal it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  General Jack Keane, good to see you sir.  Thank you so much.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Show: MORNINGS WITH MARIA][Date: January 29, 2019][Time: 07:00:00][Tran: 012902cb.231][Type: SHOW][Head: Interview with Rep.

And joining me to break it all down -- Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell in New York; the \"Wall Street Journal's\" global economics editor Jon Hilsenrath here in D.C. with me; and the American Conservative Union chairman, Matt Schlapp.  Great to see you -- guys.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Great to be here.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen -- good morning to you.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning.  We were talking about the shutdown.  So it's over for the time being.</p><p>The Democrats have actually been hurt by it as well.  Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows that positive feelings about the Democratic Party have fallen to 35 percent this month.  That's down 4 percentage points since December.  And that is essentially in line with the positive feelings that people have about Republicans.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean that's a really good point because the President really did not get hurt certainly on his base, from his base, by the shutdown.  What do you guys think?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Two things.  First is that the President's base was actually energized that he would make a spending fight.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Remember, immigration is a spending fight because if he can stop illegal immigration or reduce it, you don't have all these social services costs.</p><p>But the second thing is, the President's brand is that he will fight, he will fight harder than any politician on the field and he reiterated that brand.  So if he can increase that reputation, I think it appeals to Independents.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They said dig in.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  But isn't his brand also -- it's about fighting and continuing to fight and winning.  And he didn't win the wall in this case.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  I don't agree with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We don't know if he won the wall yet.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  There's three steps to this - -</p><p>HILSENRATH:  In this case, right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  In this case.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  -- there's three really important things.  Number one, the bill he signed has $1.3 billion in barrier funding annualized.</p><p>Number two, he's got to exhaust all legislative efforts if he's going to go the emergency route in order to have a good case in court.</p><p>And number three, the American people when it comes to immigration, he is on the right side of this policy argument.  And Democrats who are against border security, they're going to be sorry for this eventually.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  But you know what.  You better be --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, go ahead -- Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- but you better be careful about what you do and this goes to all politicians because I was flying on Friday and that was an utter nightmare.  If you want to anger everybody in the electorate, you pull another fast one like that where people are grounded and you've got an hour and-a-half plane flight where you're at 8,000 feet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But who are you blaming?</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They were blaming (INAUDIBLE) and blaming the Democrats because --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They were blaming everybody.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- Nancy Pelosi dug in.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They were blaming everybody.  But TSA agents down in Raleigh, Durham were going to food banks because they were spending what little money they had on gas trying to get to and from work.  So again, I don't care who is responsible for it.  They're all responsible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, businesses did start, you know, putting the uncertainty out there, sitting on cash, making decisions later.  We know.  I mean the SEC closed, can't get any IPOs through.  FDA closed, got to worry about obvious food shortages or food issues.</p><p>So we were beginning to see some real impact.  And Dagen saw it firsthand at the airport.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  That's true.  But if you're a federal employee in this town, let's face it, you make a little bit of a bargain.  Yes, every year you might have to go through a shutdown with your salary.</p><p>But you know, the other thing, Maria, that we don't talk about, it's almost impossible to fire a federal employee.  There's some pretty cushy gigs --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good point.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  -- in THIS town where you basically have an insurance policy against ever getting fired unless you do something just awful.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  And you can read all the GAO reports that's backed that up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're talking about all of that this morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But there are people barely making ends meet who are trying to drive to work, and spending all their money on gasoline and going to food banks who were working for the TSA and not getting paid.</p><p>And when the Republicans stop thinking about them and start talking about the workers who aren't needed, the ones who are furloughed you have really missed the boat.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, maybe.  But how about the fact that we've got a border wall in Nancy Pelosi's state?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that immoral, the wall that separates Tijuana from San Diego --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  But --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- is that immoral?  I don't think so.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They need to start asking all of these Democrats who think that the wall is immoral or don't want to fund it, ok, let's take down the walls that are there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's how you put --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will the three million people in Tijuana assimilate with the three million people in San Diego if that wall is torn down?  I think so.  And we're going to talk about that this morning.</p><p>We've got a big show this morning from D.C., live.  Coming up Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is here, live.  National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow has a thing or two to say about the CBO protections about what exactly the impact is on the economy from that shutdown.</p><p>House Minority Leader and California Congressman Kevin McCarthy will walk us through what these next three weeks look like with his colleagues in terms of this negotiating on border wall funding.</p><p>Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell is here.</p><p>Along with AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka.</p><p>Don't miss a moment of it.  A big two hours coming up.</p><p>And we kick it off this hour right now with markets.  Futures are pointing to a flat opening this morning amid all of this uncertainty over China trade, earnings.  It's an enormous week this week.</p><p>This after stocks finished to the downside yesterday on the China growth fears, the weak guidance from Nvidia and Caterpillar as well, and of course these worries about what happens with China and the U.S.  There's conversations happening tomorrow.</p><p>Joining us right now is the founder, CEO and chief investment strategist at Mainstay Capital Management David Kudla.  David -- good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>DAVID KUDLA, FOUNDER/CEO/CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, MAINSTAY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So we've been talking about what a week this is with the fourth quarter earnings coming out.  That's been pretty much driving the story.  We have a jobs report coming out at the end of the week on Friday.  Brexit discussions, the vote today.  U.S./China discussions tomorrow.  A fourth quarter GDP number.  How do you want to invest with all of this?</p><p>KUDLA:  I think investors should be looking at stocks right now that they want to own.  We've been invested through -- the past month has been very good for stock investors.  13 percent rise through Friday from the lows of December 24th.  And that's in both growth stocks and value stocks, so a broad market advance.</p><p>We're going to see some give and take here now after this nice advance of last month but investors should be picking, you know, their points here, have their list out on stocks they want to own.  We look for a good 2019 for stock investors.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is it good news, Jon Hilsenrath, that the Fed gave us a pivot that we know that the Fed is on pause right now and that we know that they're even ready to consider slowing down the unwind of the bond portfolio?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  I don't think it's good news.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I think it shows that the Fed is becoming less confident about how strong and sustainable the economy is.  I mean it is a sign that inflation isn't picking up and that's good news.  But you see some real trepidation coming out of the Fed right now with the global economy slowing, with markets being unstable and volatile.</p><p>I think the Fed is a little worried about the outlook and that shouldn't really give us a lot of encouragement.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about that, David?  I mean the economy's slowing.</p><p>KUDLA:  But Jon this -- yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLA:  But John -- the important thing here is what happened in the fourth quarter is we had mixed messages out of fed chair Jerome Powell.  We had on October 3rd we were far away from neutral.  Then by November we were close to neutral rates.  Then on the 16th in the Fed meeting they were going to do what's right no matter what.</p><p>Then he came in on January 4th and finally said we're going to be considerate of market and economic conditions and now we're seeing a more consistent and accommodative message out of the Fed.  And that's very important for the markets.</p><p>That's music to the market's ears and that's why we've now seen a sustained advance.  So the markets and investors are now looking at a Fed that seems as though they are going to be considerate of or accommodative or take into account what's happening with the markets, with the economy, and not just normalize rates for the sake of normalizing rates.</p><p>They won't have $50 billion rolling off the balance sheet on auto pilot and they won't raise rates just to raise rates to get to a normalized rate structure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that was the worry in the fourth quarter.</p><p>KUDLA:  -- in pause like in 2016 if the market and economy warrants it.  That's important.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That was they worry in the fourth quarter -- that they were on auto pilot-- Jon.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  Yes, I make two points.</p><p>KUDLA:  That drove volatility in the fourth quarter, the Fed.  .</p><p>HILSENRATH:  David makes a really important point, you know.  So this has been Jerome Powell's first year at the Fed.  He's had a bit of a honeymoon with the market.  And then what the market has discovered in the last month or two is that Mr. Powell, you know, he kind of prides himself on being a plain-spoken communicator but his communication has confused a lot of people in the market.  And he's really had to do a lot of corrections over the last few weeks --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- so that raised some questions about him.</p><p>But the other thing about -- you know, the market wants to see the Fed on an easier path.  Ok.  But the underlying message there is that this economy can't sustain very high rates.</p><p>So it doesn't send a really encouraging message about economic growth and the economic outlook when we see that the Fed is starting to recognize it just can't sustain a tighter monetary policy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But look, we're getting the news from the companies themselves with the fourth quarter numbers coming out.  Verizon just reported mixed earnings.  They beat on earnings, but they missed on revenue.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Caterpillar.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Technology reporting late today, Apple.  And we heard from Apple already.  Facebook, Amazon -- all reporting this week, Microsoft.  It's going to be a big week for technology.  And of course you mentioned Caterpillar.  That was the big kahuna yesterday that really set the tone for the markets because Caterpillar is a great indicator of economic activity across the world, in particular China.</p><p>So stay on earnings for a second, David.  Give me your take on technology.  Because you've got Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft coming out this week.</p><p>KUDLA:  Well, you know, tech stocks got beat up very bad in the fourth quarter.  They've come back in this rally and we think that tech stocks have further to go.</p><p>Look, we think that investors should stay with tech stocks.  We have an opportunity here to add value stocks to the portfolio.  Cyclicals came into 2019 at their lowest valuation relative to the S&amp;P 500 ever.</p><p>So investors now can diversify their portfolio in an opportunistic way, holding both growth stocks.  Those tech stocks that we think still have some rebound and some further runway ahead of them, and by adding value stocks that are very opportunistic.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  David -- it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>KUDLA:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Still bullish on this market.  David Kudla joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, the State of the Union is back on, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi extended officially the invitation to President Trump to do the State of the Union in the House Chamber.  He accepted the offer.</p><p>Plus we're taking a look at the enormous cost of the shutdown, what exactly is the number?  A lot of people say it wasn't very much at all.</p><p>Then, Snapchat's unthinkable change, how the photo sharing app is attempting to compete with Instagram by changing a key feature.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>New revelations in the sexual misconduct claims against the former CEO of Wynn Resorts.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with headlines now in New York -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Maria.  The \"Wall Street Journal\" is reporting that executives at Wynn Resort ignored allegations of sexual misconduct by Steve Wynn over more than a decade.  According to a regulator's report Wynn was accused of sexually assaulting or harassing salon workers, cocktail servers and flight attendants who worked for his company.</p><p>Under a proposed settlement, the Nevada Gaming Control Board won't try to revoke Wynn's regulatory licenses but Wynn is going to pay a fine.  Steve Wynn has denied any claims of misconduct.  There's a one year chart of Wynn's in front of you right there.</p><p>Well, Snapchat has named Lara Sweet as its interim CFO.  This is another shift in leadership at Snap as the company has lost several high profile employees over the last year.  Meanwhile Snap is reportedly considering allowing longer lasting or even permanent videos on Snapchat.  It will apply the Snap shared publicly on this story's features.  Snap is down 52 percent from one year ago.  There's that chart for you.</p><p>Well, Porsche is speeding past Tesla in a fast charging race.  The car maker says it new Porsche Taycan is going to be able to add more than 60 miles of charge in just four minutes.  That will be the fastest available today, exceeding Tesla's super charging stations which needs about 30 minutes to charge a vehicle's battery to at least 80 percent.  Charging times are a key selling point obviously for these car makers and now Porsche is giving Taycan owners three years of free charging.</p><p>And obviously we're going to be hearing from Tesla this week, Maria.  Earnings are coming out from Elon Musk and company.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Cheryl -- thank you so much.</p><p>Coming up next, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi challenged over her words describing a border wall as immoral.  We will break it down when we come back.</p><p>Then support on the links, fans rallying around a pro golfer whose two shot penalty was deemed unfair.  More on that.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Keeping America safe, the government is back open but the focus now is whether President Trump can make a deal with Democratic leadership on funding for the border wall.</p><p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has called it immoral, any wall is immoral.  But her home state of California protects the southern border in some places with an actual wall -- the wall separating Tijuana and San Diego.</p><p>Joining me right now is Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell.  And the last time you were on you said you wanted to look at this again.  Congresswoman -- it's good to see you.</p><p>REP. DEBBIE DINGELL (D), MICHIGAN:  It's good to see you.  Welcome to Washington.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.</p><p>What's your take on this?  I mean can Nancy Pelosi really get away with calling a wall immoral when she has a wall in her own state, separating Tijuana from San Diego?</p><p>DINGELL:  Here is what I think is going to happen.  You've got strong countries (ph), both sides of the aisle, both houses.  They're going to go into that room and they want to cut a deal that's going to keep our nation safe.  I don't think anybody wants to see what we just went through for 35 days.</p><p>It hurt the economy.  It hurt -- and I do believe -- this is going to sound corny but I don't -- you know, why do we point -- why do we need to have a Trump win, a Pelosi win.  We need an American win.</p><p>So I'm hoping they're going to go in that room.  I've talked to my colleagues on both sides.  I've talked to Roy Blunt.  I've talked to all my Democratic colleagues in the House.  They want to win.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DINGELL:  They want to go in and put together a package that's going to keep --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So how do you win?  What's the position in terms of wall funding?  Because they may very well -- your colleagues may very well come back and say ok, here's $5 billion towards border security, not a dime toward a wall.</p><p>DINGELL:  I don't know -- if people are really working together, that may not happen.  You know, there may be money, if there are appropriate places for a wall or fence or --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is there a movement within your party, do you think, among your colleagues that they feel that, yes, some money should go for an actual barrier?</p><p>DINGELL:  I think what I hear among my colleagues is let's go into a room and do something that makes sense.  Let's come up with -- we need to -- I've said this to you a million times.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DINGELL:  We need to strengthen our borders at both sides.  Everybody talks about the southern border.  I've got this northern border too which just had a huge human trafficking problem again in the last few --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But there are areas of the southern border that are very dense.  In other words like when you just look at the wall in Nancy's state and that is three million people on one side in Tijuana, three million people on the other side in San Diego.  If you tear that wall down -- I mean isn't it obvious many of the people on the Tijuana side will assimilate into the United States?</p><p>DINGELL:  Then let me ask you this question.  Build a wall, tear down a wall -- are there structures that are working that are in place?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  .</p><p>DINGELL:  So that's -- what I do think we need drones.  We need to fill the 3,000 open patrol --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's common ground, both sides believe in that.</p><p>DINGELL:  Both agree --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Technology and drones -- definitely.</p><p>DINGELL:  We need technology.  We need to make these ports safer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Specifically in a dense area, like Tijuana/San Diego, drones wouldn't work.  I mean maybe you want that in addition to a wall.  When you have such a dense area, where there's three million people on one side of the wall and three m million on the other, don't you need an actual barrier?</p><p>DINGELL:  But they are going to go in this room.  There are people that know what they're doing.  They're people -- they're senior people that have been on homeland security, people from the areas that are impacted --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think they're going to deal?  We won't shut down the government again?</p><p>DINGELL:  I pray to God, we never shut down the government.  Not only do I pray to God that doesn't come out of conference but you're going to see Republicans and Democrats working together.  We'll get --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This whole wall issue, Congresswoman, sort of underscores what's going on I think in both parties.  Now you've got former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz seeing an opening as a result of the radicalness on both sides.</p><p>He's facing backlash on his first stop for his book tour last night.  It was his first public appearance after announcing a possible Independent presidential run.  It did not go smoothly.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire (EXPLETIVE DELETED).  Go back to (INAUDIBLE) on Twitter.  Go back to Davos with the other billionaire elites who think they know how to run the world.  That's not what the country needs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  You know, I give you a lot of credit just being in politics, by the way.</p><p>Schultz is also being criticized by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, billionaire.  He tweeted this, \"In 2020 the great likelihood is that an Independent would just split the anti-Trump vote and end up reelecting the President.  That's a risk.  I refused to run in 2016 and we can't afford it right now.</p><p>Congresswoman -- do you think an Independent run is viable?  Do you think an Independent run from Schultz would hurt the Democrats?</p><p>DINGELL:  I think it's viable.  He has the money to spend it.  But I think he would hurt the Democrats.  I'm fearful that I am -- I'm trying to step back.  I'm not getting any candidate I want to see who is going to emerge, who's got people skills.</p><p>But this is dangerous.  And as you know, told you two years ago, Donald Trump could become president.  Nobody believed me.  You all thought I was crazy.  You may not have but most people did.</p><p>And I still think he could get reelected.  And if we do not run a strong campaign and we don't have somebody like that that pulls votes off --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  One of the issues is the messaging of what the platform is.  So what do you think the Democratic candidate for 2020 should have as their platform?  What's most important?</p><p>DINGELL:  You know what we didn't do and one of the reasons I believe firmly that President Trump became President Trump.  One, people are tired of partisan bickering.  They're tired of seeing things not get done in Washington.</p><p>There are a lot of people that are hurting in this country, just working men and women who want to know that we actually care about them.  They're scared about healthcare.  They're scared about escalating drug costs.  There's -- look at our --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So healthcare should be the platform?</p><p>DINGELL:  it's one piece of it.  Infrastructure, let's create jobs.  What are we going to do about education?  Trade?</p><p>Now, the President -- you want to know why he won Michigan?  Trade.  They're tired of bad trade deals that ship jobs overseas.  We don't have a level playing field.  The President's trade policy is all over the place.</p><p>It's not consistent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you going to vote for the ratification of USMCA?</p><p>DINGELL:  I don't call it USMC.  I call it NAFTA 2.0.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you going to vote for ratification.</p><p>DINGELL:  I haven't decided yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is on your plate now in the next month.</p><p>DINGELL:  Very much on my plate.  And talk to Lighthizer about it all the time.  But I'm not voting for any bill that doesn't have and acting legislation that keeps more manufacturing from going to Mexico.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wasn't that one of the key things of this new law?</p><p>DINGELL:  But Blazer still went to --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Keeping jobs here.</p><p>DINGELL:  Blazers went to Mexico in July.  I'm not seeing any more American cars go to Mexico and get built for $1.50 to $3.50 and then gets shipped back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you want a change before you vote for it?</p><p>DINGELL:  He knows how I feel.  I'm not -- one of the more likely people to vote for it but I'm not voting for it in the form that it's in right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.   We'll leave it there.</p><p>Congresswoman -- it's good to see you.</p><p>DINGELL:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.  Congresswoman Debbie Dingell joining us here.</p><p>Coming up, the longest government shutdown in American history is over.  But another shutdown threat is on the horizon.

The new teaser trailer for \"Toy Story 4\" drops with a big surprise.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Tuesday, January 29th.  Your top stories right now at 7:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Earnings season in full swing this morning for the fourth quarter.  Several Dow components reporting their fourth quarter this morning.  Verizon reported a mixed quarter earlier this hour.  Pfizer and 3M also under pressure this morning as you can see.  3M up three percent, although Pfizer and Verizon down better than one percent.</p><p>Rising tensions with China continuing, the U.S. bringing charges against Chinese telecom company Huawei as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning between the two nations.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will be joining me as my special guest this morning at the top of the hour, 8:00 a.m. Eastern.  Join us for that talk on China and the economy as we break it all down with the Treasury secretary.</p><p>Markets this morning are hovering around the flat line.  Take a look.  Dow Industrials up 20 points right now, 26 higher.  The S&amp;P 500 is down by almost one point and the NASDAQ down about three points.</p><p>All this after the major indices finished lower yesterday across the board at 04:00 on Wall Street.  Dow industrials were down 208 points and then actually was off of the lows of the -- of the day, down almost one percent at the close.  S&amp;P 500 gave up 21 points, that was three-quarters of one percent.  And the NASDAQ was down 79 points, better than one percent lower.</p><p>In Europe this morning, a mixed story, actually mostly higher.  FT-100 at the high of the morning right here, up 1-1/4 percent, 83 points higher, ahead of the British vote on the U.K. leaving the E.U.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is up 42 points, almost one percent higher and the DAX Index in Germany higher by 25, quarter of a percent higher there.</p><p>Asian markets mostly quiet overnight.  Take a look, as you can see, it was pretty much across the board.</p><p>$100,000 penalty, how one misstep cost a professional golfer big time.  The outcry, coming up.</p><p>And Woody and Buzz Lightyear are back, the new teaser trailer for \"Toy Story 4\" is out and it marks the return of one character after 20 years.  We will bring it to you.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning.  But first, our top story this half an hour, shutdown showdown, the government open for business again after the last -- at least for the next three weeks, rather.  But the main issue, funding the wall has not been resolved and the White House is not letting it go.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  What I do know is that if they don't come back with a deal, that means Democrats get virtually nothing.  That will make the president and force him to have to take executive action that does not give Democrats the things that they want.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is the House Minority leader, Congressman Kevin McCarthy.  Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you.</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  Thanks for having me back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So, what do the next three weeks look like?  Take us through these negotiating.  Do you expect any money for the wall?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  I expect us to solve this problem in the end.  What's interesting here is the whole time speaker Pelosi said I couldn't negotiate anything until you open up government.  The president put the public first and said OK, let's go through, I'll give you three weeks.</p><p>Now Wednesday, we'll have the conference committee, the senators and the congressional members' appropriation sit down and we'll see if they're serious about it, if they're willing to do something.  Because I believe Nancy Pelosi is out of step with her own party.  If you look at her number two, Steny Hoyer.  He said of course, that walls are not immoral, and that he believes some fencing involved.  From her Agricultural secretary to her Agricultural chair to our Armed Services chair, they both believe in a wall too.  Her Agriculture chairman said give Trump the money.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and she continues to say that it's immoral which I find incredible given the fact she has a wall in her own state.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  As my state too.  You know what I find --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And your state too, exactly.  California.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  You know what I find immoral?  When you really talk about this, this is about stopping human trafficking.  In 2016, they stopped more than 2,000 individuals involved in that.  I think it's immoral that you would allow that to continue.  I don't believe anybody in America that says they support border security believes that there is no such thing as some barrier.</p><p>And the president said, he does not a -- he does not want a wall from sea to shining sea.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  He just believes in the area you need some form of barrier and he's correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, where do you think are the most important areas that you would need the wall?  I mean, we talked earlier about this wall in your state, Tijuana, San Diego where it's very dense, three million people on one side, three million people on the other.  Can you make the case that that dense area is elsewhere where that's why the president is so stuck on having this wall there?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  And it's not the president saying, it's the experts.  The president sat down with the experts and they said this is what we need to be able to secure our border.</p><p>So in certain areas, like in San Diego, we stopped illegal movement by more than 95 percent.  You look at Yuma, Arizons, El Paso another -- El Paso became one of the safest cities in the nation after being able to put it through.  That's what we need, in certain parts of the country along the border, you need a barrier.  In other parts you could put the drones in this part area.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what are you expecting to give on?  And what -- do you think they're going to offer the $5.7 billion that the president wants for border security?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  But we're arguing over one-tenth of one percent of the budget.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a great point.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  The Democrats have voted for a wall before.  But now that the president brings forward what the experts want, they say no.  That is what's so confusing to me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, what -- why is this so important for the president right now?  Going into 2020, I mean, is she seeing this as a campaign promise and that's why he doesn't -- she won't agree to it.  Because I don't know how she can call it immoral, given the wall in her own state, your own state.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Again, it's such a little price to pay for so much more security when you look at the human trafficking.  Think of the number of lives that we will save from this process if we have a secure border.</p><p>But what's more importantly, it's the president that sat down and tried to be reasonable, find common ground.  He's the one who brought DACA into it.</p><p>And let's not forget, speaker Pelosi just a year ago holds the record for the longest speech on the floor, eight hours, over one issue, DACA, which she shut the government down over.  And now she thinks that's not important?  I think those people are important as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think that this -- a negotiation, an agreement will include a DACA deal?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  It could.  It doesn't have to.  But because the Democrats and speaker Pelosi have been saying no.  The president said he was willing to go there, three more years of DACA for a portion of the border security that the experts are asking for.  I just find her out of step with her own party.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, there seems to be a movement within the party, even some of the newer congress people coming in, fresher faces saying you know what, yes, we do need border security and we do need the money.  So, are they going head to head?  I mean, are they -- do they even have a voice?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  They don't even have a voice.  Because remember, she has so much power.  She will not allow the vote to come up.  I believe inside the conference we could come up with an agreement.  The question is, will speaker Pelosi even allow that to be voted on the floor?  If we had a vote on the floor, I believe it would pass.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think that the president will allow the government to shut down again?  I mean, is the president really prepared to have another government shutdown if he doesn't get the money?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Look, I think the president's going to try to find a way to solve this one way or another.  I don't know that shutting the government down solves it.  I there's other ways to do that the president can.  I know he firmly believes in a legislative process.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Should he call for a national emergency?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  He has the power to do that.  I think the best road forward right now is a legislative agreement.  And what's so interesting to me, I'd listened to these Democrats celebrate Nancy Pelosi.  You celebrated someone that got you status quo.  They're still a DACA problem, they're still a border security problem.</p><p>And government is designed to find common ground and compromise.  The president was the one person looking reasonable in all these discussions.  I know the president's committed to this.  He will get the border secure one way or another.  He's giving the Democrats an opportunity.  He gave them an opportunity all along this discussion.  They said then open up the government, they'll discuss it.  So he did that and gave them a three week time.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean, I think this whole thing, the government shutdown and the constant resist upsets people.  I mean, you have to wonder if in fact -- you know, she keeps resisting everything that the president wants, if the people will turn on her.  Because people want to see you guys get something done.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Yes, she is celebrating status quo.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  That's not where we need to be --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me move on and ask you about 2010, congressman.  Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz thinking about running for office.  He was at a book signing last night in New York and he was heckled over his bid.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump.  You egotistical billionaire (INAUDIBLE).  Go back to getting ratioed on Twitter.  Go back to Davos with the other billionaire elites who think they know how to run the world.  That's not what the country needs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This heckler not the only one weighing in.  Michael Bloomberg former mayor of New York City also told Schultz not to run as an independent.  He said this, given the strong pull of partisanship and the realities of the electoral college system, there's no way an independent can win.  That is truer today than ever before.  Is that where we are, an independent can't win, congressman?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  No, I think it's Bloomberg upset.  Because remember, he went from a Republican to an independent to a Democrat and he just spent $120 million giving to the Democrats so they can win the majority in the House and he doesn't want his money to be wasted, so he doesn't want competition.</p><p>Look, I think there's ample opportunity for an independent to get in this race, only because the Democrats are now become social Democrats.  They're talking about a 70 percent tax rate.  They're talking about these green deals.  They're talking about socialism.  If you listen to what some of these new Democrats say, they think Venezuela's problem is not because they're a socialist country, it's because of sanctions.  They're so out of step.  They are putting letters in to help those who want to go sign up for ISIS, to be easy on them to the judge.  I mean, I have -- this is not the America we live in, and that's the difference.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  This party is so out of step and I think you'll find a lot of moderate Democrats who say I want somebody else who could talk about this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, that's why a number of moderate Democrats can't really get the OK from the party leadership because they're not left enough.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  This new socialist Democrat Party has left the Democratic Party.  They are in to -- remember, Bernie Sanders is not registered as a Democrat.  He's registered as a socialist.  AOC does not call herself a Democrat, she calls herself a Democrat socialist.  This party is moving to a whole different place.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Real quick before you go, when the election happened back in November.  You said one of your priorities going to be to get the majority back.  How are you going to do it?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Well, first of all, you've got to make sure you can recruit.  I think, you put the ideas up there.  Ideas should win at the end of the day.  You look at where we are financially in this country.  A lot of that happens to do with the policies that we're able to create, from the tax policy, the battle we had with you human trafficking and other that we were able to do.  I think you're going to find as going directly to, we've got to find a suburban areas to be able to win again in and I think we're going to be very successful.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, it's good to see you.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Congressman Kevin McCarthy, joining us there.</p><p>Still ahead, Richard Trumka AFL-CIO president on the impact of the shutdown on American workers, what he'd like to see, back in a moment with that.</p><p>And then, support on the links, a pro golfer given a big fine and a two-shot penalty which many are calling grossly unfair.  What went wrong, right here.</p><p>Plus, you've got a friend and a big surprise, the trailer for \"Toy Story 4\" drops with a character we haven't seen in 20 years.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Prosecutors resting their case against Joaquin El Chapo Guzman.  Cheryl Casone in New York with details and headlines, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It; must something else, Maria.  The federal government has now rested its case.  They called 56 witnesses.  The trial of the notorious Mexican drug kingpin started back in mid-November.  El Chapo told the trial judge yesterday he will not take the stand in his own defense.  One witness is scheduled to appear for the defense today.  Closing arguments expected to take place tomorrow and Thursday.  Big story, a lot of New Yorkers have been following very closely.</p><p>Well, professional golfer Haotong Li is getting a huge outpouring of support from fellow golfers after losing out on nearly $100,000 Saturday for a minor infraction.  It happened at the Omega Dubai Desert Classic.  Li was on the 18th green when judges accuses caddie of standing too close behind him as he got ready to putt.  Well, the ensuing penalty dropped Li's score from 71 to 73.  And he went from third to 12th.  Tour officials say the correct call was made but acknowledge it was grossly unfair.  They're looking at the giving referees more discretion in cases like this going forward.</p><p>And then, get ready for \"Toy Story 4\".  Pixar is putting out this teaser video, shows the revival of Woody's love interest, Bo Peep.  And she is back with a new, more modern look.  She was last seen in \"Toy Story 2\", back in 1999.  It is now 20 years later, \"Toy Story 4\" is going to be released, Maria, this June .  Those are your headlines from New York, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like it.  Bo Peep.  All right, thank you Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, the lingering effects of the shutdown showdown.  AFL-CIO Richard Trumka will join us to talk about the impact on American workers.  He's up next.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We are focused on the American worker this morning.  White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney saying that the 800,000 federal workers who were not paid twice during the partial government shutdown should receive those checks by the end of this week.</p><p>Joining us right now is American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organization's president, AFL-CIO, Richard Trumka.  It's great to see you, Richard.  Thank you so much for being here.</p><p>RICHARD TRUMKA, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR AND CONGRESS OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION:  Maria, thanks for having me on today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Give us your take on what the impact of the shutdown was.</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, I think there's several impacts.  There's impact on the people and you not only have government workers who get back pay but you have the government contractors who won't get back pay unless something is done.  That was a devastating effect on them.  It had a devastating effect on the economy itself.  $11 billion, although we'll pick some of that back up later in the year.</p><p>But you had a devastating effect on the airline industry where you had people, airline controllers, traffic controllers that were in school that actually just up and left.  They said we're not going to do this anymore (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What could -- what could have been done about it then, Rich?  Because you as the leader that you are and representing so many workers across the country have to be unnerved when you see open borders and illegals coming in and taking your jobs.</p><p>TRUMKA:  Look, that's just not how it works anymore.  I mean, you have people that got laid off from the president's place that have been here 20 years.  They're not taking anybody's job.  What we want to do is make sure every worker in this country has the same rights so that they can't be exploited.</p><p>Because what happens right now with undocumented workers is, they're great when no one's around.  When they try to organize and get a voice, then they start squeezing them.  They start ex -- you know, doing, calling in ICE and different things.</p><p>The idea is if everybody has the same rights, then they can't exploit those people and everybody can actually have a fair playing field.  What happens to American workers -- employers right now, is you have an employer that hires people, makes them work in unfair condition, misclassifies them, underpays them, and they're competing against our employer.  That employer needs to pay everybody the same rate, live by the same working conditions, so that we can all compete.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you're OK with illegals coming in and as long as everybody's treated the same?</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, Maria, it's a -- it's a nice cliche, illegals coming in.  But you know yourself that most people that are here undocumented or illegally came in legally.  So the whole system needs to be addressed.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, but there are apprehensions that we could look at, just in the month of December, just in the month of November, where apprehensions were of illegal immigrants coming in and wanting asylum in the United States.</p><p>TRUMKA:  There's no question that the system is broken.  We need to fix the system and have a path towards citizenship so that those workers that have been here for years and are actually making the economy run, even the president's golf courses and things like that, they have a chance to get citizenship and they work their work there.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Just a question on the golf courses.  As you know, that's the H2B program, people who come here as foreign workers, come under a specified amount of time for DOL.  I think the real question is is that, what happens to all the people, not who have been here who came legally and overstayed the visa, but what about all the people who come every day at the southern border and can cross into our country?  That's really the pernicious problem.  And even on wall, built with American workers, you'd be for that.</p><p>TRUMKA:  But listen, the people that come back and forth, you have Americans that go to Mexico and Mexicans that come to America to work.  I think Mexico --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you don't think there's a problem at the border at all?</p><p>TRUMKA:  I didn't say that.  There is -- there is a problem.  We do need border security.  And no, I don't think that a wall's the answer to it.  Every time someone's tried to build a wall it's not been very successful.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, the one in Tijuana is successful.</p><p>TRUMKA:  Ask the Chinese, ask the French.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The wall -- the wall in Tijuana --</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Ask Tijuana (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tijuana and San Diego, what abut that Richard?</p><p>TRUMKA:  I'm sorry?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The wall, between Tijuana -- separating Tijuana from San Diego, is that successful?</p><p>TRUMKA:  There are places -- there are places probably where it works.  Is that the answer to everything?  No.  Should that have been the reason for a shutdown?  Absolutely not.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  I want -- I want to ask a broader political question.  We've seen in the last two elections that increasingly voters, blue collar voters, voters in manufacturing towns all over America, the kind of rank and file people that you represent are voting for Republicans, they're going for Trump.  Does the AFL-CIO need to realign its own approach to politics in this town, given that more and more of its people are going with people like Donald Trump and his trade policies and the Republican Party?</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, that's a -- that's a question we could talk about two or three hours for.  First of all, we have realigned our politics.  We are issuing -- we're issue oriented right now.  We put an issue out and if a politician supports that issue, then we support them.</p><p>In fact, in this last election we elected two union members to the Senate, three to governorship, 18 to the House of Representative, and 925 to state legislatures, because those workers will go and support our issues.  That's what we try to do.  We find it more and more difficult to find Republicans that actually support us.  Now, the American worker believes that neither the political system --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got to jump.</p><p>TRUMKA:  -- or the economic system works for them.  They want somebody to change the rules.  That's why they voted for Trump.  If he changes the rules to their advantage, some of them will vote for him again.  If he doesn't, he stands a chance of losing those workers and right now he's losing those workers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Richard, thank you so much for joining us.  We appreciate it.  Richard Trumka there.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Show: MORNINGS WITH MARIA][Date: January 29, 2019][Time: 08:00:00][Tran: 012903cb.231][Type: SHOW][Head: Apple Disables Group FaceTime Function That Was Allowing Callers To Listen And View Without Your Consent; British Parliament To Vote On Brexit Amendments; Kudlow on the Economy; Craft Brewers Impacts from the Government Shutdown; Kudlow on China Trade][Sect: News; Domestic][Byline: Maria Bartiromo, Gerri Willis, Ashley Webster, Hillary Vaughn, Dagen McDowell][Guest: Steven Mnuchin, Larry Kudlow, Matt Schlapp, Jon Hilsenrath][Spec: FaceTime; Huawei; Apple; Brexit; Federal Reserve; 3M; Harley-Davidson; Verizon; Oath Media; Channel Inventory; World War II; CBO; Trade Talks; Deregulations; Tax Plan; China Trade; Slowdown; Government Shutdown]</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good Tuesday morning.  Welcome back, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  Live from Washington this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is January 29th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  Earnings in focus.  Investors watching results from several Dow components this morning ahead of the opening bell.  One to watch after the bell tonight -- after the close is Apple.</p><p>Meanwhile, Apple under fire FaceTime hit with a new bug that allows people to eavesdrop on you without your knowledge and even if you don't take the call.  Rising tensions with China, the U.S. brings charges against Chinese telecom company, Huawei as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  The very latest on the state of negotiations with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin coming up.</p><p>Markets are searching for direction this morning.  Take a look at the futures ahead of the open this morning.  Dow industrials picking up speed up 55 points right now, a quarter of a percent higher.  S&amp;P 500 is up two and the NASDAQ right now right now showing a gain of 11 points at the open in about an hour and a half.  This after declines across the board yesterday.  Stocks finished off of the lows, but nonetheless the Dow Industrials gave up 209 points yesterday 4:00, almost one percent lower.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 gave up 21 points, three quarters of a percent lower.  And the NASDAQ was down 79 points.  That was better than one percent lower yesterday.  Global markets this morning are mostly higher.  Take a look at European indices with the FT-100-is at the high of the morning, up 86 points, 1-1/4 percent ahead of the vote on Brexit.  CAC quarante in Paris us up 44 points and the DAX index up 21, fractional gain there.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets were little changed.  Take a look, it was pretty much across the board.  Now, our top story this morning, concerns of a global slowdown.  Last week in Davos I spoke with Bridgewater Associates founder, Ray Dalio, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, and Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey.  Here's what they said about the possibility of an economic slowdown on the horizon.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RAY DALIO, FOUNDER, BRIDGEWATER ASSOCIATES:  Europe has a negative growth and the United States is going to have a negative growth environment.  I don't mean absolute negative, I mean slowing of growth in a material way that could be close to between zero and two percent over the next 18 months.</p><p>BRIAN MOYNIHAN, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, BANK OF AMERICA:  We have the top research firm in the world, and they have done a great job.  And they have the U.S. growing at 2-1/2 percent this year.  The world growing 3-1/2 percent GDP growth.  But that's down from last year.  And so the confusion in the environment right now is a slowdown or is it going in to a recession?</p><p>Nothing we see says it's close to a recession.</p><p>JAMES QUINCEY, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, COCA-COLA:  I think we are in danger of talking ourselves into a problem.  It's just a little bit slower growth.  It's not a recession or a decline.  So we see -- we see a little -- a little softer 2019, maybe a little less tail wind than 2018.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now in a Fox Business exclusive is the treasury secretary of the United States, Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  Great to see you, Secretary.</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, UNITED STATES TREASURY SECRETARY:  Great to see you as well, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.  Your reaction to really what seems like now a unanimous feeling that a slowdown is on the horizon.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, Maria, from everything we see, the U.S. economy is still quite strong.  The companies are doing quite well.  And we see still tremendous investment in capital and human investments.  There's no question that as it relates to Europe and China, there is a slowdown.  We're monitoring that carefully.  But we still see a tremendous opportunity and a lot of capital coming into the U.S.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Federal Reserve basically told us they are on pause.  They may even pause the balance sheet unwind which is also telling us that the Fed is also expecting a slowdown, but do you believe a recession is on the horizon in 2020 even though you're seeing strength and stability so far?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  We see no indications whatsoever of a recession on the horizon.  And from everything we see from speaking to a large across the board businesses, the combination of tax reform, regulatory relief and trade is still has a very strong impact on the U.S. economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And some people are saying that the impact of certainly of trade and tariffs is causing some uncertainty.  So how much of this slowdown that we're expecting later on even if it's not right now is due to what you say you're watching China and Europe and how much of it is uncertainty around the President's tariffs program?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, Maria, as you said, there are people who expect a slowdown but I would just comment a year ago with the projections were 2-1/2 percent.  And we were at three.  We feel very comfortable we're going to hit three for last year.  And we think there's still a very good case for three percent this year.  Now, as it relates to trade, we couldn't be more pleased with the USMCA.  We are looking forward to Congress passing that quickly.</p><p>That's a very important trade deal.  We have two days of talks with China starting tomorrow.  The President is going to be involved in those talks at the conclusion.  We've been updating him.  We have another 30 days after this.  So I think we're making significant progress, and I think on the trade front, these are all very positive impacts for the U.S. economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about the trade talks because this story of China, first off, thank you to the President and to the administration for pushing back on China because that's another unanimous feeling out there, that the President did the right thing in terms of stopping China from some of its practices.  What are you expecting out of these talks?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, the President wants fair trade with China.  It's got to be reciprocal.  Right now China has free access into our markets, and we have limited access to there.  So the critical issue that we've talked about is market access, making sure there aren't forced joint ventures, not forced transfer of technology and that we have a mechanism that when we reach an agreement that we can monitor that agreement and that they'll live up to it.</p><p>And that's how I expect we will make significant progress this week on those issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How much of a priority is espionage?  Obviously the administration unveiling a sweeping set of criminal charges against Huawei Technologies.  We have had on a number of CEOs that have said yes, they have stolen trade secrets from us.  Has this come into the conversation with your Chinese leadership?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  No, let me be clear.  Those are separate issues.  And that's a separate dialogue.  So as it relates to the Huawei issues that's being run by the Justice Department.  I have no involvement in that.  I found out about that yesterday when it was announced.  So those are not part of trade discussions.  Forced technology issues are part of trade discussions but any issues as it relates to violation of U.S. law or U.S. sanctions are going through a separate track, which is the Justice Department.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, I guess the broader issue is, is this a cultural thing in China?  I mean this weekend on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" over on Fox News I spoke with the ranking member of the Intel Committee, House Intel Committee Devin Nunes and he went through some of the practices that China does every day.  Listen to this.  I've got to get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  China might have accessed allied intelligence shared with Poland and passed it on to Moscow.</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R), CALIFORNIA:  What the Chinese are doing is that they have these companies that are essentially owned by the party, the Communist Party and essentially this is a dictatorship.  There's very few people that own these companies.  They weaponize the.  So when all over the -- all over the world you have Chinese technology specifically as it relates to infrastructure on -- communications infrastructure, they will go in and they beat every other company around the world.</p><p>And in fact, they've driven a lot of companies out of business because they come in undercut.  They want to have control over all the com systems or communication systems all over the globe.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's pretty incredible.  We will handle your infrastructure of telecom and then they have a way in of spying.  How can you separate that from the conversation on trade and on forced transfer of technology?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Maria, I think you can easily separate these issues.  So there are two different issues.  One is an issue of state subsidies where they do subsidize state enterprises and they compete unfairly.  Those are trade issues, those are violations of the WTO and that's something from an economic standpoint.  We are going to enforce very seriously.  I think you know among the National Security Council, so I'm going to be careful what I say on national security issues.</p><p>But I assure you whether it's China or anywhere else in the world, our security services, DHS and others will make sure that we protect the U.S. infrastructure, we protect from cyberattacks.  That's something we're very well aware of.  But these are separate issues and shouldn't be confused.  We are focused on what are unfair economic practices.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So the best case that you can get from China is what?  Opening up their markets?  Already we are seeing some likelihood of that, UBS I guess was the first bank that was allowed to operate in China and own 51 percent of that bank.  They say they're going to go to 100 percent in three years.  Are you seeing a significant opening in terms of the Chinese willingness to open their markets to foreigners?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I do, but I think that's a good start.  But why should we have to wait three years for a U.S. company to own 100 percent in the financial services?  China can operate and own 100 percent of companies here.  So that's an example where, you know, they're moving in the right direction.  We want to speed that up.  But the issue is really we want to make sure that U.S. companies can compete fairly in China.</p><p>And if we can do that, China has a very large growing middle class.  It's an enormous market.  As I have said before, this is one of the biggest opportunities for U.S. companies in U.S. business if we can get this right.  And President Trump is determined.  This is the first administration that has aggressively said to China, you need to play fair.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is the President willing to drop all tariffs, should he get a good deal that's acceptable?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I think everything is on the table.  So the President is -- will look at, again, the objective is to have a very fair deal.  Hopefully we'll make progress this week.  The President will be involved in these negotiations and discussions.  And we've still got a lot of work to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the President said look, I'm a tariff guy.  I like tariffs.  So does that mean these tariffs are for, you know, no end in sight or would he be willing to drop the tariffs all together?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  The President hasn't made any decisions on that.  There have been no recommendations from the economic team on that yet.  The first step is to make sure we get a good agreement.  And when we get a good agreement, we'll make a recommendation to the President and he will consider that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have seen the Chinese economy get impacted.  You're still talking about 6.4 percent growth, we think, but that is lower than some people think.  What's your worry or how concerning is it that the Chinese slowdown will impact the United States?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, there's no question that China is slowing down.  They still have significant growth rates.  We're beginning to see the impact on that on world growth.  Our objective is not to slow down China.  Our objective is to make sure that U.S. companies can do business in China and can do business fairly.  So we're monitoring these issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary, stay with us.  We want to get into the shutdown and get your impact on how much the shutdown cost the economy and what you're expecting there.  Stay with us.  More of my exclusive interview with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin when we come right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are life live this morning in Washington, D.C.  And I'm sitting right now with -- in a Fox Business exclusive with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  And Treasury Mnuchin, we were talking about the broad economy.  I want to ask your thoughts on the shutdown.  The CBO says that the shutdown caused $11 billion impact to the economy, $3 billion which is completely lost because of the 35-day shutdown.  Your reaction?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Maria, Kevin Hassett, the CEA is working on final numbers for us.  I think his view is that there's no question that there was some cost but those costs will be recovered as money comes back into the system.  I think it's -- he views that it will almost all be recovered.  Now as it relates to the exact numbers, I haven't seen the final numbers yet.  But the good news is we got the government open.</p><p>People are back to work and we have not seen any significant impact on the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Has -- is the President prepared to shut down the government again in three weeks if he doesn't get the money for the border wall?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Maria, I had dinner last night with the President, the Vice President, Senator Lindsey Graham.  We had a very good discussion on this issue.  There's no question in my mind that the President, the Vice President want to do a fair deal.  Lindsey has been terrific in helping to negotiate this.  I hope the Democrats are sincere.  If they are, there's a sincere deal that will include a lot of different issues that need to be resolved.</p><p>But if they're not sincere, the President has all his options on the table.  And he's determined that he's going to make sure we have border security.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's the impact on the IRS?  There's a lot of worry out there that people are not going to get their checks after April 15th as a result of this shutdown.  What can we expect?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, let me just comment on both the treasury, our bureaus, the IRS in particular, I want to thank the enormous number of government employees who came in and worked during the shutdown.  I think as you know, we had the ability to bring in critical employees.  We never would have been able to do the sanctions that we've been doing over the last month without the hardworking people.</p><p>And the IRS had a large number of critical employees to make sure that we were ready to open for business as usual.  So we're ready to open for tax season.  We're taking tax returns.  We'll be ready for tax refunds.  We will have the phones restaffed.  Now, let me just say that there's no question, this time of the year, there's very, very heavy call volume.  That's something we have to manage.  I encourage taxpayers who have questions to try to go to the web first.</p><p>But we are ready for tax season, and I can assure you that tax refunds will be paid as normal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  So, tax refunds will be paid as normal.  That's the bottom line.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  People were worried about that.  Let me move to the sanctions and in particular Venezuela because you've applied sanctions on the Venezuelan oil industry.  Tell us specifically what the impact here is.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, sanctions are a very important tool in our national security portfolio.  And when we look at national security issues, we look at economic tools.  We look at diplomacy.  We look at national security tools, military options.  So there's no question that what we're trying to do is to cut off the money to the regime that should not be in power and make sure that the President Guaido has access to funds and has access to the assets of the country.</p><p>And to make sure we protect these assets for the people of Venezuela.  It's really quite sad.  This is a country that is very, very rich in oil resources that has had extraordinary poverty and extraordinary humanitarian issues over the last issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And have you spoken with the opposition leader party about this?  What has been the response so far?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I haven't personally, but I know the Vice President has been in communication.  I think the response has been very positive.  We've been very careful in balancing this.  We've -- I've spoken to many of the refineries over the last week.  I want to make sure that there was significant capacity.  There's a lot of oil on the water already in transit to the U.S. refineries.  So I think on the one hand, we've been able to cut off Venezuelan oil going forward.</p><p>But we're managing this with the U.S. refineries.  We've issued licenses for the U.S. refineries to continue to operate.  And if Venezuela wants to continue to sell us oil, which we would like to buy that money would go into blocked accounts and will be protected for the people of Venezuela.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what about other industries in Venezuela?  I mean, the sanctions are on the oil industry.  What about other money, other imports that they still get that?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  We will always look at additional sanctions.  We want to make sure that things like medicine and other humanitarian issues continue to go to the people.  We will always look at additional sanctions to make sure we protect the assets of the country for the people of Venezuela.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why was it important for the President to back the opposition leader?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I think he is the rightful leader of the country, the national assembly, the constitution.  I think, you know, democracy is very important to the people of the United States.  And we want to make sure that there are free and fair elections and that there is a proper democracy that's very important to the national security of the United States.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary, it's good to have you on the program.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you very much.  Secretary Steven Mnuchin joining us.  Coming up, earnings in focus.  Major companies reporting this week including Apple after the bell tonight.  What you need to know ahead of those numbers.  Then the U.K. facing a crucial test.  British lawmakers voting later today on measures surrounding the U.K.'s potential exit from the European Union.  Back in a moment with that.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Earnings driving markets this morning.  3M, Harley-Davidson, Verizon out with mixed reports this morning.  Gerri Willis is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange watching markets.  Gerri?</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  That's right.  3M, Dow component, a split decision here missing on estimates beating on revenue.  The EPS line $2.27 a share.  Revenue 7.95 billion.  They lowered their 2019 guidance.  But they say they're positioned for success in 2019 despite the global slowdown.  Stock trading higher.  Harley-Davidson, let's get to that, a big miss on both the top and the bottom line.</p><p>EPS of 17 cents a share.  Revenue of 955 million.  The stock is down and down hard this morning nearly 10 percent.  They're citing restructuring charges, incremental tariffs and recall costs.  Big troubles for the hog.  Verizon beating on EPs but missing on revenue.  We're seeing yet another split decision here.  EPS of a $1.12 a share.  Revenue of 34.3 billion.  The stock trading down nearly four percent here.</p><p>Profit hurt by the restructuring of Oath Media business as we have discussed.  Apple coming after the bell, this is critical earnings release for the markets here.  EPS estimate of $4.17 a share.  Revenue of 84 billion.  We will be focused like a laser on iPhone.  iPhone sales in China, is there an iPhone recession going on in China right now?  Watch Channel Inventory for some of the details about that.</p><p>Meanwhile, Apple having trouble with FaceTime.  A bug where callers can eavesdrop on FaceTime calls has cropped up.  The company says they are checking it.  But you should know that Tim Cook on Monday, well, he was saying big things about International Data Privacy Day asking users to insist on reforms.  Oops, I guess they got a problem.  Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Gerri.  Thanks very much.  Gerri Willis on Wall Street.  British lawmakers will debate several amendments to the U.K.'s planned exit from the European Union today and let Prime Minister Theresa May know what parliament is prepared to vote for.  Ashley Webster is live in London right now with that.  Ashley?</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.  Good morning, Maria.  This is if Parliament knows exactly what it will vote for.  There will be at least 15 amendments to choose from -- will be debated.  That will be up to the Common Speaker John Bercow.  He will decide which ones will be debated.  And it could indeed shape the future of what Brexit will look like moving forward.</p><p>Now, among the most popular amendments that we are expecting to be the debated will be what's called the Cooper amendment, that's Yvette Cooper, the Labour M.P.  It basically says if no deal is reached by February the 26th, it would postpone Brexit for nine months essentially to end of the year from march 29th, that's the date that exists now.  Then there's the Brady amendment, the Graham Brady (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>He basically is putting forward an amendment that would replace the Irish backstop with what is called alternative arrangements, such pretty vague, basically anything elsewhere and what we have now and there is no time limit on that backstop.  We have heard that Prime Minister Theresa May has already told European leaders that she wants to reopen Brexit negotiations.  Let's not forget, just last month, in December, the Prime Minister said it wasn't going to be reopened that the E.U had given her their best deal.</p><p>Now she wants to turn around and say look, you need to reopen negotiations.  I'm going to find out from Parliament what they are prepared to vote for and let's go from there.  And it calls today is January 29th.  The Brexit deadline, March 29th.  We have exactly two months left to go, Maria.  And let's be honest, there is no sign yet of a -- of a deal in place that a majority of people in Parliament can get behind.</p><p>Yesterday we had a whole series of warnings about what would happen if there was a no deal scenario.  Just crashing out retail consortiums saying, look, there's going to be empty shelves, prices are going to go up, a break in the supply chain.  It will be very, very detrimental to the British economy.  So that is the background.  Later on today, we'll find out what Parliament can get behind.  Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Ashley.  Thanks so much.  We'll check back with you.  Ashley Webster in London this morning.  Coming up.  The shutdown impact on your wallet.  I will be speaking with National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow on the economic effects of the shutdown.  Plus Federal debt reportedly headed to the highest level since World War II.</p><p>That is next.  One brewery feeling the impact.  The shutdown hitting one San Diego beer company.  We've got that story.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thank so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo coming to you live this morning from Washington, D.C.  It is Tuesday, January 29th.  Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Earnings season in full swing.  We have heard from Harley-Davidson, hit in the pre-markets after disappointing numbers.  Xerox as well headed higher after beating expectations.  Look at Harley-Davidson's shares down almost 10 percent right now.  China, one of the issues, once again.  Meanwhile rising tensions with China on the U.S. level.  The U.S. bringing charges against Chinese telecom company, Huawei, as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  Moments ago, I spoke with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin who talked about what the U.S. is looking for in the coming talks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MNUCHIN:  The President wants fair trade with China.  It's got to be reciprocal.  Right now, China has free access into our markets and we have limited access to there.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Futures this morning are higher.  Take a look, we have the highs of the morning right here with the Dow Jones Industrial average up 73 points, a third of a percent.  The S&amp;P 500 up 4-1/2, and the NASDAQ higher by 18 points, one-quarter of one percent.  European indices this morning are also higher.  Take a look.  FT-100 in London is up almost 100 points, 1-1/2 percent.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is up 55, better than one percent.  And the DAX Index in Germany up 37 points, that's one-third of one percent.  Asian markets mostly flat overnight as you'll see that was pretty much across the board with Japan and Korea squeaking out a fractional gain.</p><p>Our top story this half an hour, the cost of the government shutdown.  The CBO says about $3 billion out of 2019's projected GDP was completely lost due to the shutdown.  Joining me right now in a FOX Business exclusive is National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow.  Larry, it's great to see you this morning.</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for being here.  So obviously 35 days, government shutdown, CBO says $3 billion is lost.  Never coming back.  Your reaction.</p><p>KUDLOW:  With respect, once again, we disagree with the CBO.  I don't think we're going to lose anything.  This is completely temporary.  None of the incentives in the economy have been changed by this.  You know, that's the key point.  President Trump lowered marginal tax rates on individuals and most especially businesses.  And then he had this massive sweeping rollback of costly and burden regulations, which freed up the whole economy, including the energy sector, which has turned out to be a boom.  Why would we lose something just because of a temporary issue regarding the government?  Now, I'm always interested in sort of counting angels on the head of a pin.  We have about a $20 trillion economy, fair?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  There -- what was their number, three billion out of 20 trillion?  Do you know what the --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Three billion.  Yes, no, you're right.  You're right.</p><p>KUDLOW:  - percentage that is?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I totally understand.</p><p>KUDLOW:  I don't understand why we even mess with it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Actually, they're saying the total impact was $8-11 billion.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But that will come back, except for the $3 billion they say that is completely lost.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, again, with all due respect to the professionals at the CBO, I disagree.  Again, because the incentives in the economy -- here's the big difference between I guess the administration and the Congressional Budget Office and a lot of other forecasters.  We believe the economy is growing at three percent plus.  By the way, the Commerce Department for 2018 has scored I believe 3.1 percent.  We'll get the rest of those numbers in a week or two.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KUDLOW:  The CBO does not.  They never have.  They've never given us credit for the incentive effect of lowering taxes and regulations.  Supply side incentives are kicking in.  If you look at the whole panoply all of the economic data, whether it's very strong Christmas retail sales, whether it's industrial production, manufacturing, the best since the '80s, whether it's business equipment, which means the capex boom is happening that we always hoped for.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KUDLOW:  You'll see in my judgment, at least, the three percent trend line will continue.  CBO and many others have us at two.  But this goes back before the President.  This goes back way before.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  They don't believe the economy can grow.  They don't give any credit --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, even somebody like a Steve Schwarzman will say 4.2 percent growth in the second quarter is very hard to sustain on a $20 trillion economy.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, I'll keep working on Steve Schwarzman.  He's a good guy.  But in a $20 trillion economy, which again will grow rapidly, I see no reason why we can't continue three percent plus.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That's the whole point.  The idea that was sold to everybody I guess going back several years, maybe going back 10 or 15 years, that we're in some secular stagnation is just plain wrong.  With the right set of policies, to unleash --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- American animal spirit --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we saw that with the tax plan and the deregulation.  I totally get that.</p><p>KUDLOW:  And you look at the --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But what about tariffs and trade, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  The -- just one --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because the CBO'S report also brings that up.</p><p>KUDLOW:  One last one on this, the face of the new Trump economy -- I just want to put this in here, it's the thought I've had for quite a while.  These are men and women running small businesses.  These are blue-collar workers.  You look at the evidence, the employment for blue-collar workers, the best increase since the mid to late '80s, when I was a Reagan Cub Scout here in Washington, D.C.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  The wage rates of blue-collar manufacturing autos, they're rising faster than white-collar workers.  This is a direct result --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- of the incentives we've put into the economy.  CBO, again, it's not personal to my friends at the CBO, they don't give us any credit for these incentives.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No, I understand that.  But the --</p><p>KUDLOW:  And I want to stay with that story.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- the report on the trade policies estimated that new tariffs on imports and exports will cut an average of one-tenth of a percent from economic growth through 2029.  What's your take on that, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because we know that these tariffs are in place.  They still are impacting business and uncertainties.  So, is the President prepared to do away with all tariffs if he gets that agreement from the other side?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, I don't want to go there.  I mean, that's going to be his decision as you know.  Vice Premier Liu He is coming and we will have high level discussions Wednesday and Thursday and we're all looking forward to that, as is the President.  The President, as I read him, moderately optimistic about this trade story.  So, that's good.  What was it, one-tenth of one percent by 2029?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  So then here we are in 2019, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, no.  One-tenth of a percent from economic growth through 2029.</p><p>KUDLOW:  See, this is too hard, Maria.  It's way too hard --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- to figure that stuff out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you don't think there's going to be any -- there's --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Could it be possible that there's no impact from the shutdown?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Yes, quite possible.  I never -- it's utterly totally temporary.  So, that's -- let me --- look, let me go back -- the growth potential from China trade, people tend to look at this as a negative.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Look, I don't know the outcome of these talks.  Here's what I know, the scope of the discussion will be the broadest and deepest in the history of U.S.-China trade.  Literally everything's on the table.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Point number one.  Point number two, if China opens its markets --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is a big deal.</p><p>KUDLOW:  OK?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it looks like there's (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>KUDLOW:  Which is huge.  You know, I don't want to predict, and as Ambassador Lighthizer said a million times, and I agree, the enforcement mechanisms are going to be crucial.  But if they were to open their markets as we have requested regarding tariffs and non-tariffs, if they would let American companies own the subsidiary in China, so there's no forced transfer of the family jewels of technology, if we have --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But it --</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- some rule of law regarding I.P. theft, here's my point, open markets will allow the United States to export like crazy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But I understand that, Larry.</p><p>KUDLOW:  And that has been hand -- we've been handcuffed.  If we do that, if we do that, not only will the United States grow faster --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- because of that, China will grow faster.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That all sounds great, but can you actually do that, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Competition is the solution.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's the point, because if you're saying, \"OK, China, we are agreeing that you are opening your markets, and as a result, we will meet your demands, but then they say okay, but you have to have a communist, a government leader on the board of any company that has 100 percent.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Which is -- which is extraordinary, you're absolutely right.  It's extraordinary.  And it's --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So I mean -- so you could say it's great --</p><p>KUDLOW:  And unacceptable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- that you're going to open markets.</p><p>KUDLOW:  It's unacceptable.  It's unacceptable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But they -- aren't they saying that a communist has to be on the board of any company that has 100 percent?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I think that's been the past and I think that's going to be a very hot topic in these trade talks because that is completely unacceptable to us.  No question about it.  We will see how this turns out.  China, unfortunately, you know, they're in a slump.  China's economy is slumping very bad.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  I think part of that slump is a function of the President's tough negotiating with tariffs, when necessary, OK, part of that slump is in the last five to ten years.  China has moved in the wrong direction, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  The market-based reforms have been moving in their own direction.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But they're not market-based.  They are communists and they want communists on the board of -- So I'm just wondering, all of this sounds great, if you can actually get it done.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Oh, I know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Larry, stay with us.  We want to talk to you about other things because the tax plan and the deregulations have worked.  But there are some other ideas coming into play ahead of 2020.</p><p>KUDLOW:  China should not use the Venezuelan form of the economic policy.  We need to go back to who is it that said free market capitalism is the best path to prosperity?  It was the (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, that would -- that would be you and Ronald Reagan.  Stay with us.  We will be right back.  More with Larry Kudlow.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Thank you.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We come to you live this morning from Washington, D.C. and I am sitting with National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow, in an exclusive interview this morning.  And we were talking about China and what you can get done.  How important is tomorrow and Thursday in terms of meeting a deadline, that March 1st, in terms of a deal on the table?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I think's very important.  Look, I --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think you'll get a deal by March 1?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I don't want to predict.  It's just too hard to predict.  And, of course, these are decisions that will be made by the President, who is his own best negotiator.  Best I can is, as I said, the scope of this thing's going to as wide and broad as anything we have ever seen.  That does not ensure positive negotiator.  Best I can is, as I said, the scope of this thing is going to be as wide and broad as anything we've ever seen.  That does not ensure positive outcomes --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- right?  I think everybody, including the President, is basically moderately optimistic about this, OK?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Wait, let me ask you, your tax plan --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Ultimately -- one other thought which the President believes that he and President Xi will probably be the ultimate negotiators.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  OK?  And the work being done tomorrow and Thursday is vitally important to lay out options, OK?  But --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So the President will be involved in these talks tomorrow and Thursday?</p><p>KUDLOW:  That is what he has been saying in our meetings.  And I hope so because he's a great negotiator.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me move on to the tax plan.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because we're hearing a lot of ideas in terms of taxes now, now with a lot of 2020 hopefuls.  The Tax and Jobs Act obviously did move the needle on economic growth along with the deregulation out of this administration.  Now you've got Elizabeth Warren talking about two to three percent tax on the very high wealth people.  So if you have $50 million in wealth, you'll get two percent tax.  If you've got a billion dollars in assets, you'll get taxed three percent.  And you've got Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez talking about tax of 70 percent tax --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- on the highest earners.  What is your take on this?  Give us your reaction and what kind of an impact those policies might have.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Right.  These are prosperity killers, these are growth killers, these are job killers, these are incentive killers.  This is a return to some heavy government planning essentially direct to the economy.  You know, I hate to dwell on this because it's a crisis right now, but take a look at Venezuela, just for the heck of it.  What (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There was a time when that was vibrant -- it was a vibrate country.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That is correct.  That is correct.  And investment was flocking to it.  Then they took, down through the years, really exact measures you're describing that are coming from some of these Democratic candidates --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- and the economy was destroyed.  I mean I hear this notion we have to have equality, equality of income, equality of results, which I think runs counter to all human nature.  You know what?  A place like Venezuela has equality.  Everybody's poor.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think they'll be able to reverse the tax cuts then?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Everybody's poor in Venezuela, except for a hand -- Maduro and a handful of this top military people.  Is that what we want in America?  We are growing right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So will the Dems be able to reverse your tax cut plans?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Never.  Never, not until the President's configuration.  I -- look, first of all, if they want to try to raise taxes, it will be defeated in the Senate, Republican.  I personally believe even if it went beyond that --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- the President would veto any efforts to turn back his program.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How important --</p><p>KUDLOW:  We're doing what people said we couldn't do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But how important is debt?</p><p>KUDLOW:  They said we couldn't grow at three, four percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But how important is debt, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  We're growing at three, four percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Let's not mess with it.  If it ain't broke, don't fix it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Congressional Budget --</p><p>KUDLOW:  There's a tremendous surge in prosperity here shared by the middle and lower middle income people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Congressional Budget Office is saying that the deficit is hit -- set to hit $897 billion this year.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That would be the highest level since World War II.  When does debt become a priority?  Do you think the President, let's say he does have another term, will try to attack the entitlements?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, look, I think right now the two issues are maintaining economic growth.  You know, growth is the single biggest factor in these budget calculations.  Growth brings income and revenues.  And in fact I haven't gone through it with a fine-toothed comb yet, but I will.  I think I see that the CBO is acknowledging that our faster growth, which they did not predict, is now paying for over 80 percent of the tax cuts.  OK?  And I think you'll see more about that as we get through.  The reports just came out yesterday.</p><p>Second point I want to make is we will have a tough spending budget coming up in a few weeks, a very tough spending budget with reductions of at least five percent across the board, in non-defense accounts.  So I think that's going to be very important.  Let's minimize government where possible.  Let's grow the economy to its max.  And you will see the debt burden, which I thought debt, as a share of GDP, will be coming down, and by the way, it already is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  OK.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That's what happened during the Reagan years.  That's what happened during the John F. Kennedy years.  So, I wrote about it in my book.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That -- that's the best way to measure that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But, Larry, you know what I don't understand?  I mean you're all about growth, you have been for all your entire career.  Why are so many people worried about the slowdown?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why are we hearing some people say a recession is on the horizon?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, there's just -- it's funny in this town and I guess a little bit in New York, this is a lot of pessimism.  I don't --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you expect a recession this year or 2020?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I do not.  I don't see it right now.  If I look at financial indicators, credit spreads, the actual numbers, you know, it's just -- we -- GDP will come out a week late because the Commerce Department has reopened.  We've seen stuff like falling unemployment claims, rising manufacturing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But what are the markets telling us, Larry?  In the month of December, there was no high-yield debt issuance at all.  Credit markets are still tight.</p><p>KUDLOW:  They've come back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They've come back a bit.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Come back.  I like that.  Profits, the mother's milk of stocks, I don't know who first that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You did.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Profits, the mother's milk of stocks are rising.  The early indications are they won't to 25 percent but they're going to rise 10, to 15 percent.  I like that a lot.  Interest rates, the level of rates, are historically low.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you're not worried about market volatility?</p><p>KUDLOW:  There's a million things to worry about when I get up in the morning, you know, mainly getting here on time so I could do this great interview.  But I just want to say, if you look at the sum total of all the evidence right now, there's no recession out there.  I am the happy warrior.  I am an optimist.  President Trump is an optimist.  I think America, right now, we are the hottest economy in the world and we should remain so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll end it there.  Larry Kudlow.  Good to see you, sir.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow.  Back in a moment.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The government shutdown may be over, but the effects are still being felt.  Hillary Vaughn is live this morning at a craft brewery in Escondido, California where the shutdown effects are actually still lingering.  Hillary.</p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Hi, Maria.  Good morning.  Craft beer is a $76.2 billion industry, and for many craft breweries, like Stone Brewery, where we are today, the effects of the government shutdown are not over.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOMINIC ENGELS, CEO, STONE BREWING:  When the industry craft is built on seasonal beers, it's built on new beers, it's the new sexy thing, and if we can't get the new sexy thing to market, then we're not going to connect with our fans.  They're going to be disappointed.  We're going to make the sales numbers we planned to make in our financial plans, and these things will have repercussions.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUGHN:  As Federal workers at the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau are finally back in the office, a mountain of paperwork is waiting, about 11,000 applications for alcohol labels have been backlogged leaving craft breweries waiting to ship and sell all their new beer across state line, which means they're in limbo until these approvals go through.  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Hillary.  Thanks very much.  We've be watching that.  Hillary Vaughn.  Stay with us.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  President Trump is tweeting this morning.  He's talking about a former staffer.  Here's what he just said.  \"A low level staffer that I hardly knew named Cliff Sims wrote yet another boring book based on made up stories in fiction.  He pretended to be an insider when, in fact, he was nothing more than a gofer.  He signed a non-disclosure agreement.  He is a mess.  Dagen McDowell, great to see you this morning thank you so much.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  John Hilsenrath, Matt Schlapp.  I don't know why the President tweets this.  He's got how many million view, you know, users and followers.  He just let everybody know who this guy is like --</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, THE AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Well, he literally sat in a -- he sat in a cubicle outside my wife's office in the West Wing, and so it is kind of amazing like this insider whole kind of mythology is something the President knows is not true.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  But he's got some extra sales thanks to that tweet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  That's what I'm saying.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think, Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  Again, everybody's got a book to write.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jim Comey, this guy.  Hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Oh, that was a good answer.  Hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, Jim Comey's book, yes, well, there's -- I think that will be a story that we're going to continue following, Jim Comey and the FBI.  You know what.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Everybody wants to be Norma Desmond, Maria.  I'm ready for my close up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  Thanks, everybody.  Great panel today.  Great to see you Dagen McDowell, Matt Schlapp, Jon Hilsenrath.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TECHWR-2172770028</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TECHWR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WB8-DDG1-DY0W-4442-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">352430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"24032\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good morning, everyone, I'm Maria Bartiromo, thanks for joining us live this morning from Washington.  It is Tuesday, January 29th, your top stories right now 6:00 a.m. on the east coast.  Earnings in focus this morning, investors are watching results from several Dow components ahead of the open this morning.  The one to watch after the close is Apple.  We've got everything you need to know this morning previewing the report.  Apple under fire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile, FaceTime hit with a new bug that lets people eavesdrop on you without your knowledge.  How you can fix it, coming up -- big story.  Rising tensions with China meanwhile, the U.S. bringing charges against Huawei as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  The very latest on state of negotiations with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin this morning.  That interview at 8:00 a.m. Eastern, join us for that.  PG&amp;E makes it official, California's largest utility filed to bankruptcy protection, following the massive wild fires.  We've got all the details, coming up.</p><p>Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz roasted.  The billionaire hackled at an event last night as he gears up toward a possible independent run for the White House.  We've got a big show this morning coming from D.C., U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is here, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow is here along with House Minority, California Congressman Kevin McCarthy.  Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell will join me, along with AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka.  Don't miss a moment of it.  We've got a big three hours, coming up.</p><p>And we turn now -- right now, we kick it off with Wall Street markets.  We're looking to see a rebound this morning.  Take a look at Futures actually have just turned negative once again.  Futures down just fractionally, about 6 points on the Dow Industrials; 1-1/2 points lower on the S&amp;P; and the NASDAQ down 13 points.  This, after stocks finished lower yesterday on China growth fears along with weak guidance from Nvidia and Caterpillar.  We told you -- the Caterpillar numbers right here.  And of course, it did worsen throughout the day as investors react to a weaker-than-expected earnings and guidance.</p><p>Joining me right now is Federated Investors Chief Equity Market Strategist, Phil Orlando.  And Phil, it's good to see you this morning.</p><p>PHIL ORLANDO, CHIEF EQUITY MARKET STRATEGIST, FEDERATED INVESTORS:  Thanks for having me back, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All indications that we are seeing a slowdown and worries around China, among other issues, how do you see the markets here as more earnings have come into play?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, you had this 20 percent waterfall decline in stock prices in the fourth quarter of last year, we thought the market was attempting to price in the prospect of recession this year.  Multiples contracted from 18 times earnings down to 14 times earnings.  In our view, there's no risk of recession this year.  So, the rally that we've seen over the last month, 14 percent rally, the market is starting to price in the fact that maybe we're not going to have a recession.  But we've had a 14 percent rally in a month.  That's very, very powerful.  We would absolutely expect some consolidation here over the next month or two particularly as we've got these critical sign posts coming up in the month of March, but as we look out over the balance of the year, we do think that multiples will return to that 18 level, and we're going to end up with a pretty good year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  To what do you attribute the slowdown?  We've got earnings in focus and we're looking at a number of companies out that give weaker-than-expected guidance or miss on the top line.  Lockheed Martin, Pfizer, and Verizon are reporting this morning.  Apple is, of course, out after the bell, so when you look at the earnings picture, where in terms of industry are you seeing the most slowdown?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, I think in a word, uncertainty is what's impacting earnings and guidance to some degree.  You've got the Fed flip-flops that we saw in the fourth quarter last year, the uncertainty about whether or not the United States and China are going to be able to consummate this trade deal.  You've got Brexit overhanging on the global market and certainly the government shutdown, which was up there for 35 days, and it was just temporarily resolved last Friday.  You've got a number of issues there, all of which are impacting companies in some way, shape or form.  So, with earnings up 25 percent year-over-year in the first three quarters of last year, this fourth quarter is a little softer, I think we're up about 13 percent.  So far, we're about a quarter of the way through the earnings season.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>ORLANDO:  And I think what companies are pointing to are some combination of those four issues that I just mentioned.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you mentioned the shutdown.  The shutdown apparently costing the economy $11 billion according to new analysis from the Congressional Budget Office, although Larry Kudlow is disputing that number, and he's going to join us this morning live to talk about it.  The report says that it hit $3 billion, that's one-tenth of a percent of economic activity in the fourth quarter alone.  So, are there sectors that were -- that were hit hardest in that regard, or do you want to look at those companies that are largely tied to the China trade as one area of the real weakness?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the council of economic advisers under Trump had advised us that the shutdown was going to take about one-tenth of one percent out of GDP per week.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, remember, the shutdown started right around Christmas, so that makes sense that we lost, you know, a tenth of a percent in the fourth quarter, you know, maybe a half a percent here in the first quarter.  We're at 1.7 percent GDP growth in the first quarter, consensus blue chip is around 22, 23.  So, we think this pretext a little high and there will be, you know, sort of a downward revision as we get later in the quarter.  But in terms of industries, I think it's really across the board.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Across the board.</p><p>ORLANDO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about technology because it's big week for tech, Apple, of course, the big story today, reporting after the close tonight -- the only big tech reporting.  Microsoft, Facebook out tomorrow, Amazon is out on Thursday.  This is the week that we'll focus on technology and that's where really the growth stories have been.  Would you want to put new money to work in any of these names ahead of their earnings?</p><p>ORLANDO:  Short answer is probably no.  Again, you've had this 14 percent rally here in the last month, you've got concerns about slowing economic growth both in the U.S. and China.  We think that those issues will be resolved as we get into the back half of the year, but right now, you know, why run the risk of putting new money to work after you've had a big rally in some of these names ahead of what could be a disappointing earnings number or perhaps conservative guidance.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, the stock has come down because people were worried about it.  So, we'll see what the numbers are.  Would you, at some point, go back in to tech?  What's your favorite group right now, Phil?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, the areas that we like best in the U.S. markets are energy, financial services, industrials, and health care.  In terms of looking overseas, emerging markets look very attractive to us.  So, the areas that have really gotten hit the most are the ones that we've been attracted to.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there.  So, the valuations are better, I guess, is what you're saying.</p><p>ORLANDO:  The valuations are much more attractive.  We think the fundamentals are still very strong.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Phil, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>ORLANDO:  Great to see you.  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Phil Orlando joining us there.  Meanwhile, a bug in Apple's FaceTime app lets users listen in someone's phone without even the person knowing.  Dagen McDowell, what's happening this morning?  Good morning to you, Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well, Apple has some explaining to do, but particularly on this earnings call this afternoon.  So, there's a bug in the Apple iPhone that would allow people to eavesdrop on FaceTime users' calls.  A FaceTime user calling another person could listen in while the recipients phone is still ringing even if the person never accepts the call.  This was -- it involves several steps in the Group FaceTime feature on the iPhone.</p><p>Apple has disabled that Group FaceTime while it tries to come up with a fix for this, but you can eavesdrop in on somebody, essentially listening through the microphone, even if a person never takes that call, you could eavesdrop on rooms with unattended devices and even receive unauthorized video from the phone.  And again, it would take several steps to do this, but this is coming from a company, Maria, that loves to brag about its privacy protections and even throws shade at the likes of Facebook and other technology companies.</p><p>And adding embarrassment to embarrassment, yesterday was International Data Privacy Day and Tim Cook was tweeting about that.  Here's what he said on Twitter yesterday before this bug, this eavesdropping bug was disclosed.  We must keep fighting for the kind of world we want to live in.  On this Data Privacy Day, let us all insist on action and reform for vital privacy protections.  The dangers are real and the consequences are too important.  Big whoops for Apple, and of course, everything that happens in the business world is a political opportunity.  The Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo had to weigh in on this as well, putting out a statement late yesterday, say, \"Urging FaceTime users to temporarily disable the app.  So, Apple beat him to it, they're trying to fix it.  Embarrassment nonetheless.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible because you don't even know -- I mean, the phone could be ringing and you don't even know that they're listening.  I mean, that's the worst part of it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  I can explain later as the show goes on how this work, but you'd have to place a FaceTime call, go to the group, add yourself to the call and then the recipient of the call would have to hit maybe one like the on-button on the phone in order to activate it, but it was possible, and it was all over the internet yesterday how to do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, if -- so, if it's -- if it's not on and you say -- and you do -- and you decline the phone call, they can't listen in?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Unless you -- but you can't touch the phone at all.  Like, it's not even declining the phone.  Like, if you hit the up -- the up volume button on the phone, and so if I was playing this trick on you, it would activate it, and they could essentially hear what was going on in the room.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Unbelievable.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  I want to hear more about that, for sure.  Meanwhile, there's this, as expected, PG&amp;E filed for bankruptcy protection following those devastating wildfires in California.  Cheryl Casone on that in headlines right now.  Cheryl, good morning to you.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  Well, PG&amp;E is facing roughly about 30 billion in potential liabilities, as investigators are looking into whether the company's equipment played a role in starting California's deadliest fire.  More than 100 people died following a series of wildfires that burned hundreds of thousands of acres over a two-year period.  The utility providing energy service to 60 million people, we should add.  Taking a look at shares of PG&amp;E, look at that, in the premarket down nearly nine percent.  And those loses have actually paired back in the last hour or so, folks.</p><p>Well, China's Vice Premier has arrived in Washington for high-level trade talks that are going to start tomorrow.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and trade representative Robert Lighthizer will attend the two-day meeting.  Yesterday, the Trump administration announced a pair of indictments against Chinese telecom giant, Huawei.  The U.S. is accusing the company of trying to steal trade secrets from T-Mobile.  The Justice Department also charging Huawei with conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran.</p><p>And the China story continues, folks, shares of Nvidia are lower this morning.  The chipmaker is warning investors, and expects much weaker sales thanks in part, yes, to China's slowing economy.  It also previously cautioned the sales of its graphics processors that are used in video games PCs would be disappointing.  The China effect continues.  Chips for video gaming account for more than half of their business, they lost half their market value since hitting their peak back on October 1st, Maria.  So, Goldman Sachs had to come out last Friday, Maria, warning that a lot of these chip companies that have massive exposure to China are going to have really rough reports.  Micron Technology, even Wynn Resorts, the casino company, has got big China exposure, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, for sure.  All right, Cheryl, thanks so much.  Coming up next, five police officers are injured this morning, four of them shot while serving a search warrant.  The very latest coming up.  And then a venti-size disaster for Howard Schultz last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire (BLEEP).</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Former Starbucks CEO having a rough time exploring a 2020 Presidential run as he gets heckled.  We break it down right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Live from Washington, we are eyeing 2020, former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz facing backlash last night on his first stop of his book tour.  It was his first public appearance after announcing a possible Independent Presidential run.  It did not begin smoothly.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire (BLEEP).  Go back to getting ratio'd on Twitter.  Go back to Davos with the other billionaire elite who think they know how to run the world.  That's not what democracy needs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, my goodness.  Schultz is also facing backlash from former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.  Here's what he tweeted: \"In 2020, the great likelihood is that an Independent would just split the anti-Trump vote and end up re-electing the President.  That's a risk I refused to run in 2016, and we can't afford to run it now.\"</p><p>Here with me this morning to talk more about all of that is Dagen McDowell back in New York, Wall Street Journal Global Economics Editor Jon Hilsenrath here in D.C. with me, along with the American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp.  Gentlemen, it's good to see you.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Welcome to Washington.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, thank you so much.  And welcome to presidential politics, Howard Schultz.  What do you think about that?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Well, I'm going to get some popcorn.  This could be a real interesting Democratic primary, and whatever this Independent thing is, don't you love Michael Bloomberg who has probably spent a million dollars on polling, trying to figure out every way to become the President.  Publicly chastising Schultz for running as an Independent when that's exactly what Bloomberg would just love to do if he could.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  You know, on the one hand, Dagen, I feel like there is an opening for an Independent because there's such extremes and radical conversation going on certainly on the left.  And on the other hand, I don't know, how much is a cup of coffee at Starbucks?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Again, that $18.00 cup of Joe, I'm joking, I'm exaggerating.  It's helping --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think it's like $6.00.  I mean, seriously.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, we love cart coffee around this place.  But again, that's helping fund this run.  But Michael Bloomberg -- you know what, Michael Bloomberg should run for the Democratic nomination if he thinks he can win, it's just hilarious to have this multibillionaire lecturing Howard Schultz about an Independent run when actually a cup of Starbucks coffee has more charisma than Michael Bloomberg, number one.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Number two, it's going to be really interesting to see the narrative in the spring of 1992 with Ross Perot was -- Ross Perot was going to divide the Democratic vote, that it wouldn't hurt the Republican.  This could very well -- I mean, it depends on who -- what Howard Schultz says on the campaign trail and how far-left the Democrats go when they're running for the nomination.  But I'll say this, what he said so far about pay -- how to pay for Medicare For All and how that's impossible, I would be really interested to hear him talk about how to fix the health care system, because he might come to the table with some really interesting ideas and force the Democrats to answer the hard questions about paying for this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that is the thing, I mean, this party unfortunately, it's very hard for someone who's a centrist to actually have a shot.  You had Tim Ryan from Ohio, he wanted to do it, he's an economic thinker, he doesn't have a shot because of the same thing, you've got the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's 70 percent tax rate, the loudest voice in the room.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I mean, there's no question that these primaries are starting out very much from the left, you know, you have talk about a wealth tax, and 70 percent high-income tax threshold.  You have Elizabeth Warren who is going around beating up on the banks.  This is definitely a left-leaning primary season that we're going to be going into.  What I find so fascinating is the journeys that these different billionaires are traveling.  You know, you had President Trump who supported a lot of Democrats as a businessman in New York City traveling over to Republican Party, now you have Michael Bloomberg who started out as a Republican Mayor --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- traveling over to the Democratic Party, and Howard Schultz doesn't know where to go.  He doesn't know where he fits in.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He doesn't know where -- and what about Senator Kamala Harris?  Let's listen to her, because she held a CNN Townhall meeting in Iowa last night.  Harris is vowing to eliminate private health insurance with Medicare For All if elected president.  What's your take, Matt?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Making insurance companies illegal.  Look, the Democratic Party has become quite radicalized.  Think about this, less choices for the patient is the solution to our problems.  That seems insane.  Also, do we really think the government, when you get your tags to drive your car, or when you pay your taxes at the IRS, do you really think all the solutions to our problems are there?  I don't.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Let me ask you this, who does President Trump want to see come out of this whole --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think he wants Howard Schultz to run.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think -- he was taunting him yesterday.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH:  No, besides Howard Schultz, among the Democrats, who does he -- who does he want to (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>SCHLAPP:  I think most Republicans -- I'm not going to speak for the President -- but I think most Republicans believe that Elizabeth Warren is so far out there on the loony left, basically Marxism, socialism that I think they find that a delicious opportunity.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Can I --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- call the confiscation, Dagen.  He called it (INAUDIBLE) I mean, this two or three percent tax on assets, confiscation.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It is wealth confiscation.  It's totally communist and then to try and find people when they hand in their U.S. citizenship when other countries come calling, wanting you move there because they won't come and take your hard-earned money.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  One thing I want to point out that Jon Hilsenrath said that Howard Schultz doesn't know where to go.  President Trump should be worried about a Howard Schultz, because what if he comes to the table, like I said, with ideas that appeal to voters in this country who feel left out.  Who left out from the Republican Party and certainly left out by the left-leaning Democrats in this environment.  So, be very, very careful.  And one other thing I'll add with Howard Schultz at that -- at that bookstore, that's just the New York City welcome wagon.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's the way they treat all tourists in this city.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, I think you make a good point because there is that path.  That path of centrism.  I mean, that path of the center, because people do feel like it's gone wacky all the way on the left, for sure.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  It's a centrist country, but don't forget Hillary.  She's making noises.  Maybe that's the President's favorite opponent.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH:  We haven't seen any --</p><p>SCHLAPP:  She's making noises.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  We haven't seen anyone travel that centrist path as an Independent to presidency.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  So, it was a smart move on Howard Schultz's part.  We'll see.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Or a risky one for all those billions --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, certainly risky.  Take a quick break.  Extreme weather warning meanwhile on the other side of this break, millions of people across the country are gearing up for an Arctic blast as temperatures are plummeting, that's next.</p><p>Then showing their cards, British Prime Minister Theresa May asking Parliament to put up its plans from Britain's exit from the E.U.  Details on the historic debate.  And the vote happening later today, back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  It is cold out, and the deep freeze is setting in, hitting millions of Americans with subzero and dangerous temperatures.  Fox News Senior Meteorologist Janice Dean in the Fox Weather Center right now with the very latest.  Janice, tell us about it.</p><p>JANICE DEAN, FOX NEWS SENIOR METEOROLOGIST:  Hi, Maria, yes, we could be dealing with historic lows.  These are current windchills, what it feels like when you go outside and you are not protected.  Dangerous, potentially life-threatening windchills of -41 in International Falls, -18 in Chicago, but we still have another blast behind this.  So, these are morning lows, these are not windchill temperatures: Chicago -25 on Thursday, -31 in Minneapolis, -16 in Detroit.  Again, those are not windchill values.  Those are actual air temperatures.  But with the windchill, in some cases, we could get windchill values of -40 to -50.  If you go outside, your skin is going to freeze in minutes.</p><p>So, here's Chicago, Illinois.  Your all-time record low is -28.  So, we're going to flirt with historic lows, Maria.  This is a big deal.  The good news is it won't be long lasting.  By the weekend, we'll start to rebound, but I also want to make mention with this arctic cold front as we have snow across the deep south.  Snow that could cripple travel across portions of Atlanta, Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, and towards the southeast, so that's another dangerous part of the storm is the -- not only extreme cold but the snow as far as south as the gulf coast.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Janice.  Wow, what a story, thank you so much.</p><p>DEAN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will be watching.  Janice Dean.  Coming up next, the State of the Union is back on, it is February 5th.  Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi extending an invitation to the President, he accepted the offer.  Then, we're taking a look at the enormous cost of the shutdown.  What is the real number?  Plus, place your bets, Super Bowl fans getting ready to throw down an enormous amount of cash.  So, bet on the big game Sunday.  We break down all the numbers.  Stay with us.  Live from Washington this morning.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us.  We are coming to you live from Washington this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, January 29th, your top stories right now 6:31 on the east coast right now.  Earnings season is in full swing, a lot of big names reporting their fourth quarter today.  Xerox and Pfizer set to report in just a few moments, we'll bring you the numbers as soon as they hit the tape, and tell you how they are impacting markets.  Rising tensions with China, the U.S. is bringing charges against Huawei, as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will be my special guest, in about 90 minutes time.  We will break it all down with the Treasury Secretary, coming up.  So, stay with us.</p><p>Meanwhile, Futures relatively flat this morning, take a look at markets, down 20 points on the Dow Industrials, down 4 points on the S&amp;P, down 18 points on the NASDAQ.  We are expecting some pressure at the start of trading this morning, after all the major indices finished lower, yesterday, on Wall Street.</p><p>In fact, at 4:00, the Dow Industrials gave up 208 points, that was almost 1 percent lower, the S&amp;P 500 down 21, that was three quarters of a percent lower, and the NASDAQ with a 79-point decline yesterday, at the close, down better than 1 percent.</p><p>Investors are watching some big news this week, J.P. Morgan, calling this week the most important week of the first quarter, and here is why, you've got earnings, you've got the British vote, you've got U.S.-China trade talks, you've got a Federal Reserve decision, we're not expecting a Fed hike.</p><p>We've got fourth quarter GDP coming out.  And, of course, at the end of the week, the job's report for the month of January, a big week, investors want to watch it and will be covering it all.</p><p>European indices this morning look like this, in terms of trading.  We are looking at gains in Europe.  The FT-100 up one and a quarter percent, 86 points higher, the CAC Quarante in Paris is up a half a percent, 26 points higher, and the DAX Index in Germany, higher by a fraction, as you can see there.</p><p>Asian markets overnight, flat, take a look.  No real moves there, because mover was the KOSPI Index in Korea, up a quarter of a percent.</p><p>Well, there is tragedy in Houston to report, five police officers injured.  Four of them shot, while serving a search warrant.  We have the very latest, coming up.</p><p>And a debate in parliament, British lawmakers set to vote on the latest plan for the U.K. to leave the European Union.  We are previewing that and we will take a look at the impact across the world.</p><p>We've got a big program this morning from D.C., U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is coming up this morning, along National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow, they will take a look at all of these expectations that the economy is slowing.</p><p>Plus, House Minority Leader and California Congressman, Kevin McCarthy, is with us, along with Michigan Congresswoman, Debbie Dingell.  Plus, AFL CIO, President Richard Trumpa, here as well, big show, don't miss a moment of it, big three hours, coming up. And we are kicking off this half an hour right now, with this top story, feeling the effects of the shutdown, Washington, D.C. back in business for now, President Trump will give his State of the Union of Address on February 5th, Tuesday.  The address was originally supposed to be today.</p><p>Even though the shutdown is over, the U.S. is still feeling effects, new numbers from the Congressional Budget Office to report.  The U.S. GDP will be $3 billion lower during the fourth quarter of 2018, because of this shutdown.  On the immigration front, backlogs of immigration courts grew by at least 10 percent, according to Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about all of that is Americans for Tax Reform President, Grover Norquist, Grover, good to see you.</p><p>GROVER NORQUIST, PRESIDENT, AMERICANS FOR TAX REFORM:  Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So, the CBO is talking about a $3 billion-dollar hit, in fact, as a result of the shutdown, Larry Kudlow is having an issue with this.  He says, frequently disagrees with the CBO anyway.  What's your take in terms of what the shutdown cost the economy?</p><p>NORQUIST:  Look, the key thing is that the economy continues to grow and we're looking at a three percent rate of growth for the year, so $3 billion is a big number, unless you compare it to the GDP of the United States in the fourth quarter.</p><p>So, actually, we're doing fairly well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You don't think it had much of an impact then, Grover?</p><p>NORQUIST:  No, it's a small impact and we have a tremendous growth for the year, which is way beyond what the CBO said was possible, when they scored this.  The CBO needs to spend a little more time going back to explain why they were so wrong on all of their recent predictions, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  Go ahead.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Grover, the Federal Reserve and most of the economist that we surveyed at the Wall Street Journal are saying that the economy is slowing down in 2019.  We had a nice burst in 2018 in part, because of tax cuts and in part, because there's more spending, $300 billion of additional spending.</p><p>But now, they say the economy is slowing along with the global economy, what does that say about the impact of these tax cuts, are the tax cuts really created the long-run growth that Republicans said was going to happen?</p><p>NORQUIST:  The tax cuts do two things.  We were at 35 percent rate, which is the highest in the world.  It made sense for an American company like Burger King to be bought by Canadian company, because even though they're selling the same hamburgers, the same number of employees, it was worth more, because we had a worldwide tax system at 35 percent.</p><p>By taking 35 down to 21, we became competitive with Europe.  I mean, our friends, the Germans were at 25, the Japanese were at 25.  I'm sorry, the Japanese were at 30.  The Chinese were at 25.  And we were at 35.  We weren't even close to being competitive.  It's a huge change in the direction for the country.</p><p>And if the CBO tells you they're pessimistic, they didn't think you could do three percent, they laughed at three percent growth, said you could never do more than --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  The question is, is that three percent growth.  I think a lot of people understand that the corporate tax rate was uncompetitive, even some Democrats wanted to lower their corporate tax rate, but the question is, this new tax code that we've got, is that sufficient to sustain the three percent growth in 2019?</p><p>NORQUIST:  It's a good first start.  We also need to do something about the workforce.  We need more workers and frankly, there's more tax reduction that needs to be done and spending restraint is very important at the end of the day.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  I want to go back to this question about a shutdown, Grover, which is, people are saying, they're almost using the reason why you couldn't cut government, because somehow, that would have a negative impact on our economic growth.  That seems like a very dangerous road to go down.</p><p>Isn't it true that all of this money that they are saying didn't get put into the economy, are you worried that the government actually won't spend all of that by the time that the authority over the money, expires?</p><p>NORQUIST:  For the government to -- I was taught this (INAUDIBLE) economics in college also.  The government takes your money, and then spends it.  It's much better for the economy than if it lets you spend it.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Right.</p><p>NORQUIST:  Because you would waste some of it by investing it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because they can spend money better than you, of course.</p><p>NORQUIST:  And that's the oddest thing because, of course, that's nonsense.  East Germany should have done very well, under this theory, but it doesn't, so --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  What the government is doing is borrowing other people's money and spending it, right?  I mean, we're talking about deficits that are nearing a trillion dollars.</p><p>NORQUIST:  The (INAUDIBLE) cost the government is how much the government spends, whether they borrowed or take it, it's still gone from the -- from the real economy.  The cost of government is total government spending.  We should have taxes low, and then the least destructive way possible, all taxes are somewhat destructive.  And you have less borrowing if you have less spending.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what about all of these new plans?  And by the way, we are getting earnings right now, as we're talking 3M and Xerox, both beat expectations, although 3M is cutting its forecast for the year.  What about all of these ideas about taxing the wealthy?  New York Congressman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez claims for a 70 percent marginal tax rate on the tippy top, as she calls it.</p><p>Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts senator, hopeful, for 2020, two percent tax on Americans whose assets exceed 50 million.  If you're a billionaire, three percent, what's the impact?</p><p>NORQUIST:  OK, magicians like to do this, so you're not looking at, you know -- watch my right hand, don't look at the left hand.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NORQUIST:  The reason they talk about high tax rates on rich people, is that they want to gouge the middle class.  The difference between the United States and Sweden, Finland, Denmark, the countries that Cortez talked about is, they don't have the 70 percent rate, just back up for sec -- there isn't a country in the world with a 70 percent income tax rate.</p><p>Many countries used to, the Beatle song, 19 for me, one for you, 95 percent tax rate, and then the Beatles moved to United States, and everybody who could pay tennis, left Sweden.  And all the countries of the world realize that tax rates that high were stupid and destructive and didn't help equality or growth or anything like that.</p><p>So, they got rid of them.  The whole world got rid of them.  We did it, it was stupid.  We back offed it and had strong economic growth as a result, so 70 percent stupid and destructive.  It's not America saying, the world says that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You probably showed the op-ed today, in the Journal, in California, and taxes as well.  The Journal, this week, by Cypress founder, T.J. Rodgers, which was very good, Another California Tax Grab, he writes.  In it, the politicians have fueled an affordability crisis that drives away businesses and exacerbates homelessness.</p><p>California Governor, Gavin Newsom, called for even higher taxes in his inauguration speech earlier this month.</p><p>NORQUIST:  California is a good example of 70 percent play.  They have a 13 percent rate on people making a million dollars, but they have 8 percent rate on people making $42,000.  So, they want the middle class people in California to think you're OK, because we're really screwing the other guy.</p><p>And point of fact, Florida has a zero percent first income tax, Texas has a zero percent first income tax, 8 percent looks good compared to 13.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NORQUIST:  Looks lousy compared to zero percent.  They want the middle class to think somebody else is paying the freight.  That's why they have those phoney high tax rates that don't raise much money.  It's to fool the middle class.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it is talking point, and it works for the populist.  Let me bring in Dagen McDowell on this, because we hear this every time we go into the tax discussion and we have a Democrat on which takes out another one of those talking points on taxes, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And I want to say that Senator Kamala Harris said that the first thing -- she said it last night, in the town hall, he first thing she do is to cut taxes for the middle class.  Well, roughly half this country pays no net federal income tax, number one, and the Republicans just did that particularly, doubling the standard deduction.</p><p>So, I don't know who she's going to cut taxes for.  But this is the ruse and this is the big liberal lie that all of these big new welfare state initiatives, whether it's green energy, even single payer, it's all going to be paid for by the super rich.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And that it's not going to be -- that the paying won't be spread across every person in this country to fund this welfare state.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And by the way, the numbers don't add up even if you tax all the rich, you're not going to get the amount of money you need for this green deal, Grover.</p><p>NORQUIST:  You don't even balance the budget if you do that, never mind half money for new things.  Look, the big difference between United States and Denmark, United States and Sweden, it's not how much money higher income people pay, it's what happens to middle-income people.</p><p>Denmark, Finland, Sweden, the tax rate on middle income people is 10, 15, 20 points higher than an American middle class person.  And, you add to that the value added tax.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NORQUIST:  The difference between United States and Europe is how heavily taxed middle income people are, and they have those (INAUDIBLE) high rates that very few people pay, to make people in the middle class think that they are getting a deal.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Speaking of middle income tax -- a lot of Democrats want a carbon tax, gasoline tax and even some big American business.  That's the way to address the issue of climate change.  Do you see any path towards a carbon tax that would be acceptable to your point --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I guess, but real quick, Grover.</p><p>NORQUIST:  No.  No, absolutely not.  And the reason is, you can look at Washington State, very deep blue Washington State.  They have twice had it on the ballot and twice defeated a carbon dioxide tax, gasoline taxes lose overwhelmingly.  This is too obvious tax on middle-income people.  It's a loser up.  They are having this fight in -- our dear friends in France or loggerhead down the subject.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We know how that played out.</p><p>NORQUIST:  We had the Ontario government and the Alberta government collapsed as a result of this, and three times, in Australia.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Grover, thank you.  Yes.</p><p>NORQUIST:  Bad politics and lousy economics.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Grover, thank you for the facts, we appreciate it, Grover Norquist, joining us there.</p><p>Five officers injured in a shooting in Texas, meanwhile, Cheryl Casone in New York, with the details, there.  Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  That's right, Maria.  Four officers were shot and another officer suffered a knee injury in Houston.  They were serving a search warrant at a suspected drug house.  Police say two of them were hit in the neck.  Those officers are in critical but stable condition.  Two suspects were killed at the scene.</p><p>Well, a key E.U. negotiator, warning the risk of Britain leaving the European Union without a deal, is very high, as parliament votes on amendments in Theresa May's exit plan today.  Lawmakers set to consider more than 10 different amendments before taking votes.  That's going to be at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>And those votes come after May's plan to leave the European Union was overwhelmingly rejected earlier this month, a lot of those votes against her from her own party.</p><p>Well, Americans will be betting an estimated $6 billion on the Super Bowl, that's according to the survey by the American Gaming Association.  About 22.7 million U.S. adults plan to place a bet on the upcoming Atlanta game, of those bets, 94.47 percent, reportedly illegal, but let the games begin, Maria, and those are your headlines.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Be there to watch it all, front-row seat.</p><p>CASONE:  I'm there for you, Maria.  I've got surprises for you, coming up.  You're going to love them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK, looking forward to it.  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, crisis in Venezuela to take a look at, new sanctions have been placed on the country's oil.  Plus, National Security Advisor, John Bolton, may have inadvertently revealed the administration's next move.  Why his notes are raising eyebrows this morning.</p><p>Then, farming in America, why farmers are being forced to rent water.  That's up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A look at some of the big headlines across America this morning.  The Chicago Tribune reporting on the Pension Agency criticizing Sears Chairman Eddie Lampert's plan to acquire the bankrupt retailer.  The article explaining that the agency sets to takeover Sears.  Pensions objects to the bid, calling it the final fulfillment of a year-long's scheme to deprive Sears and its creditors of assets and its employees of jobs while lining Lampert's on owns pockets.</p><p>The Daily Camera in Colorado, reporting on how Boulder County farmers are increasingly renting water.  The report explains how ownership from agricultural interests has dropped from 85 percent in the late 1950s to just 30 percent.  The water increasingly moving to municipal control.</p><p>And the Mercury News writing that how in one California city you can text 911 for emergency help.  According to the paper, the police department there announced that the service is now available in the city.  It is meant to help people who are hearing or voice impaired.  The police are also recommending that you not send emojis.  Well, yes, I would think not.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  What are we coming to?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  My God, but it is good that you can text 911.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  That's a good step, just don't text person emoji.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, crisis in Venezuela new sanctions placed on the country's oil, plus National Security Advisor John Bolton may have inadvertently revealed the administration's next move, why his notes on his legal pad are raising eyebrows this morning?  We're breaking that down when we come right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A framework for peace.  The U.S. and Taliban negotiators making a preliminary on key issues to end the war in Afghanistan -- the longest war in American history.  The two top points American troop withdrawal and insurgence vowing to end terrorist attacks abroad, that's according to the Wall Street Journal.  Many hurdles remain to ensure the peace is in place.  Joining me right now is Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst, General Jack Keane.  General, it's always a pleasure to see you.</p><p>GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST:  Good to see you, Maria, and welcome to Washington again.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  And what do you think about this?  I mean, are we supposed to be trusting the Taliban?</p><p>KEANE:  No, we can never ever trust the Taliban, that doesn't mean that we can't have a treaty with them.  But here's what I think is going on, a couple of things have changed: one is the Taliban in the last couple of years have gone all out as we have so dramatically reduced our forces, thinking that they will going to be able to overthrow the regime, because the only thing the United States is really doing is training and assisting the ground forces -- no longer doing the fighting, however provide an air power.  That didn't work.  They retook some territory but never took capitals or provinces and they never took -- they never able to secure a province.  So, what has happened?  The war stalemated.  The Taliban cannot take over the government and the government cannot defeat Taliban, even with our assistance.</p><p>Second thing, and this is crucial, Pakistan has gotten involved in this in a way they've never have before.  They forced the Taliban to go to the peace negotiation table, why?  Pakistan knows it's no longer in national interest to keep this thing stalemated.  There's growing al-Qaeda and growing ISIS presence in Afghanistan which gives the Pakistanis some concern.  So, those are the new things that are happening.  That's why the negotiations have some momentum.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's the thing, though.  I mean, so many people were worried when the president said: we were withdrawing the troops.  And where do you stand on that now?  I mean, do you feel better about it given this peace deal?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, let me answer it this way -- I mean, it is an essential question: the Taliban themselves, we are trying to get an agreement with them that, one, they'll stop trying to overthrow the government and number two, they'll power share with them and also, they will assist in taking down the al-Qaeda and the ISIS.  I don't think we can trust them to do that, based on the fact that they provided safe haven for Osama bin Laden for almost 10 years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  So, what do we do?</p><p>KEANE:  So, we leave in place, after we bring out the troops that are providing the training and assistance.  We leave in place a counterterrorism force and an intelligence capability indefinitely.  We're doing that in Yemen, we're doing it in Libya and we're doing it in Africa.  The one in Africa is off the coast.  It's a Maritime Joint Task Force.  That is what we need to do, that is the guaranty against the Taliban because the issue in Afghanistan has always been, we would never intervene in the civil war in Afghanistan between the northern alliance and Taliban for one reason only, we didn't evade, because they attacked the United States.  That's the reason we're there.  We don't want that to happen again and we cannot trust the Taliban to provide that guarantee for us.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, let me move on and ask you about sanctions on the Venezuelan oil industry.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin who will be here shortly this morning along with Security Adviser John Bolton, explain the decision in a briefing yesterday and issued warning for disputed President Nicolas Maduro.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN BOLTON, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR:  The president has made it very clear on this -- on this matter that all options are on the table.</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY:  There's no reason why these resources shouldn't be used for the economic benefit of the people there.  There's no reason for the poverty and the starvation and the humanitarian crisis.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to this announcement yesterday?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, increased pressure on Maduro regime is certainly a welcome thing.  I mean, this really comes down to the loyalty of the military to Maduro.  As long as that loyalty is there, it's unlikely that Maduro is going the leave.  If that loyalty starts to fall apart, I hope we're working a 'plan b', which is engineering right now some kind of exit path for Maduro, where he can go into exile with recriminations in Venezuela.  The Reagan administration did this very successfully on Ferdinand Marcos, back in 1986, overwhelming popular opposition to him, hundreds of thousands of people.  We engineered his exit.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me squeeze in this question before you go general.  This image from the briefing going viral and it shows John Bolton's notepad with the notation: \"5,000 troops to Colombia.\"  Whoa, do you think we should be sending troops to the region?  What do you think about this?  Caught on camera.</p><p>KEANE:  Look, when we deposed Noriega in 1989 operation just cost Panama, 26,000 troops, is what it took.  When we deposed a dictator in Haiti, 28,000.  The ease of troops that would only be in there, move into Venezuela, if there's a problem at the embassy to our diplomat.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How significance is revealing such a secret?</p><p>KEANE:  I think he'd probably wanted to reveal it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  General Jack Keane, good to see you sir.  Thank you so much.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Show: MORNINGS WITH MARIA][Date: January 29, 2019][Time: 07:00:00][Tran: 012902cb.231][Type: SHOW][Head: Interview with Rep.

It is Tuesday, January 29th.</p><p>Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>It is a busy day on the earnings calendar this morning.  3M among the Dow components reporting their fourth quarter.  The company cut its forecast for 2019.  Pfizer also cut this morning.  The stock under pressure this morning after the guidance came in below expectations.

Join us live as the Treasury Secretary will join the program, coming up.</p><p>Markets are under pressure this morning.  Futures pointing to a lower opening for the broader averages although right now it is more like a flat showing than lower.</p><p>The Dow Industrials are up 3 points right now.  S&amp;P 500 pretty much flat, up a quarter point.  And the Nasdaq is down 4 points.  It's been back and forth on futures this after declines across the board yesterday, of course.</p><p>Stocks finished off of the lows of the day but nonetheless, the Dow Industrials were down 209 points, almost 1 percent.  S&amp;P was down 20.  The Nasdaq was down 79, better than 1 percent lower.</p><p>Global markets this morning.  Take a look at European indices, higher across the board.  This right here, this is the high of the morning.  FT 100 up 1.5 percent, 97 points higher.  CAC 40 in Paris up 39 points, almost 1 percent.

We were talking about the shutdown.  So it's over for the time being.</p><p>The Democrats have actually been hurt by it as well.  Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows that positive feelings about the Democratic Party have fallen to 35 percent this month.  That's down 4 percentage points since December.  And that is essentially in line with the positive feelings that people have about Republicans.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean that's a really good point because the President really did not get hurt certainly on his base, from his base, by the shutdown.  What do you guys think?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Two things.  First is that the President's base was actually energized that he would make a spending fight.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Remember, immigration is a spending fight because if he can stop illegal immigration or reduce it, you don't have all these social services costs.</p><p>But the second thing is, the President's brand is that he will fight, he will fight harder than any politician on the field and he reiterated that brand.  So if he can increase that reputation, I think it appeals to Independents.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They said dig in.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  But isn't his brand also -- it's about fighting and continuing to fight and winning.  And he didn't win the wall in this case.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  I don't agree with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We don't know if he won the wall yet.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  There's three steps to this - -</p><p>HILSENRATH:  In this case, right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  In this case.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  -- there's three really important things.  Number one, the bill he signed has $1.3 billion in barrier funding annualized.</p><p>Number two, he's got to exhaust all legislative efforts if he's going to go the emergency route in order to have a good case in court.</p><p>And number three, the American people when it comes to immigration, he is on the right side of this policy argument.  And Democrats who are against border security, they're going to be sorry for this eventually.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  But you know what.  You better be --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, go ahead -- Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- but you better be careful about what you do and this goes to all politicians because I was flying on Friday and that was an utter nightmare.  If you want to anger everybody in the electorate, you pull another fast one like that where people are grounded and you've got an hour and-a-half plane flight where you're at 8,000 feet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But who are you blaming?</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They were blaming (INAUDIBLE) and blaming the Democrats because --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They were blaming everybody.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- Nancy Pelosi dug in.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They were blaming everybody.  But TSA agents down in Raleigh, Durham were going to food banks because they were spending what little money they had on gas trying to get to and from work.  So again, I don't care who is responsible for it.  They're all responsible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, businesses did start, you know, putting the uncertainty out there, sitting on cash, making decisions later.  We know.  I mean the SEC closed, can't get any IPOs through.  FDA closed, got to worry about obvious food shortages or food issues.</p><p>So we were beginning to see some real impact.  And Dagen saw it firsthand at the airport.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  That's true.  But if you're a federal employee in this town, let's face it, you make a little bit of a bargain.  Yes, every year you might have to go through a shutdown with your salary.</p><p>But you know, the other thing, Maria, that we don't talk about, it's almost impossible to fire a federal employee.  There's some pretty cushy gigs --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good point.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  -- in THIS town where you basically have an insurance policy against ever getting fired unless you do something just awful.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  And you can read all the GAO reports that's backed that up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're talking about all of that this morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But there are people barely making ends meet who are trying to drive to work, and spending all their money on gasoline and going to food banks who were working for the TSA and not getting paid.</p><p>And when the Republicans stop thinking about them and start talking about the workers who aren't needed, the ones who are furloughed you have really missed the boat.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, maybe.  But how about the fact that we've got a border wall in Nancy Pelosi's state?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that immoral, the wall that separates Tijuana from San Diego --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  But --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- is that immoral?  I don't think so.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They need to start asking all of these Democrats who think that the wall is immoral or don't want to fund it, ok, let's take down the walls that are there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's how you put --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will the three million people in Tijuana assimilate with the three million people in San Diego if that wall is torn down?  I think so.  And we're going to talk about that this morning.</p><p>We've got a big show this morning from D.C., live.  Coming up Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is here, live.  National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow has a thing or two to say about the CBO protections about what exactly the impact is on the economy from that shutdown.</p><p>House Minority Leader and California Congressman Kevin McCarthy will walk us through what these next three weeks look like with his colleagues in terms of this negotiating on border wall funding.</p><p>Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell is here.</p><p>Along with AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka.</p><p>Don't miss a moment of it.  A big two hours coming up.</p><p>And we kick it off this hour right now with markets.  Futures are pointing to a flat opening this morning amid all of this uncertainty over China trade, earnings.  It's an enormous week this week.</p><p>This after stocks finished to the downside yesterday on the China growth fears, the weak guidance from Nvidia and Caterpillar as well, and of course these worries about what happens with China and the U.S.  There's conversations happening tomorrow.</p><p>Joining us right now is the founder, CEO and chief investment strategist at Mainstay Capital Management David Kudla.  David -- good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>DAVID KUDLA, FOUNDER/CEO/CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, MAINSTAY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So we've been talking about what a week this is with the fourth quarter earnings coming out.  That's been pretty much driving the story.  We have a jobs report coming out at the end of the week on Friday.  Brexit discussions, the vote today.  U.S./China discussions tomorrow.  A fourth quarter GDP number.  How do you want to invest with all of this?</p><p>KUDLA:  I think investors should be looking at stocks right now that they want to own.  We've been invested through -- the past month has been very good for stock investors.  13 percent rise through Friday from the lows of December 24th.  And that's in both growth stocks and value stocks, so a broad market advance.</p><p>We're going to see some give and take here now after this nice advance of last month but investors should be picking, you know, their points here, have their list out on stocks they want to own.  We look for a good 2019 for stock investors.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is it good news, Jon Hilsenrath, that the Fed gave us a pivot that we know that the Fed is on pause right now and that we know that they're even ready to consider slowing down the unwind of the bond portfolio?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  I don't think it's good news.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I think it shows that the Fed is becoming less confident about how strong and sustainable the economy is.  I mean it is a sign that inflation isn't picking up and that's good news.  But you see some real trepidation coming out of the Fed right now with the global economy slowing, with markets being unstable and volatile.</p><p>I think the Fed is a little worried about the outlook and that shouldn't really give us a lot of encouragement.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about that, David?  I mean the economy's slowing.</p><p>KUDLA:  But Jon this -- yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLA:  But John -- the important thing here is what happened in the fourth quarter is we had mixed messages out of fed chair Jerome Powell.  We had on October 3rd we were far away from neutral.  Then by November we were close to neutral rates.  Then on the 16th in the Fed meeting they were going to do what's right no matter what.</p><p>Then he came in on January 4th and finally said we're going to be considerate of market and economic conditions and now we're seeing a more consistent and accommodative message out of the Fed.  And that's very important for the markets.</p><p>That's music to the market's ears and that's why we've now seen a sustained advance.  So the markets and investors are now looking at a Fed that seems as though they are going to be considerate of or accommodative or take into account what's happening with the markets, with the economy, and not just normalize rates for the sake of normalizing rates.</p><p>They won't have $50 billion rolling off the balance sheet on auto pilot and they won't raise rates just to raise rates to get to a normalized rate structure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that was the worry in the fourth quarter.</p><p>KUDLA:  -- in pause like in 2016 if the market and economy warrants it.  That's important.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That was they worry in the fourth quarter -- that they were on auto pilot-- Jon.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  Yes, I make two points.</p><p>KUDLA:  That drove volatility in the fourth quarter, the Fed.  .</p><p>HILSENRATH:  David makes a really important point, you know.  So this has been Jerome Powell's first year at the Fed.  He's had a bit of a honeymoon with the market.  And then what the market has discovered in the last month or two is that Mr. Powell, you know, he kind of prides himself on being a plain-spoken communicator but his communication has confused a lot of people in the market.  And he's really had to do a lot of corrections over the last few weeks --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- so that raised some questions about him.</p><p>But the other thing about -- you know, the market wants to see the Fed on an easier path.  Ok.  But the underlying message there is that this economy can't sustain very high rates.</p><p>So it doesn't send a really encouraging message about economic growth and the economic outlook when we see that the Fed is starting to recognize it just can't sustain a tighter monetary policy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But look, we're getting the news from the companies themselves with the fourth quarter numbers coming out.  Verizon just reported mixed earnings.  They beat on earnings, but they missed on revenue.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Caterpillar.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Technology reporting late today, Apple.  And we heard from Apple already.  Facebook, Amazon -- all reporting this week, Microsoft.  It's going to be a big week for technology.  And of course you mentioned Caterpillar.  That was the big kahuna yesterday that really set the tone for the markets because Caterpillar is a great indicator of economic activity across the world, in particular China.</p><p>So stay on earnings for a second, David.  Give me your take on technology.  Because you've got Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft coming out this week.</p><p>KUDLA:  Well, you know, tech stocks got beat up very bad in the fourth quarter.  They've come back in this rally and we think that tech stocks have further to go.</p><p>Look, we think that investors should stay with tech stocks.  We have an opportunity here to add value stocks to the portfolio.  Cyclicals came into 2019 at their lowest valuation relative to the S&amp;P 500 ever.</p><p>So investors now can diversify their portfolio in an opportunistic way, holding both growth stocks.  Those tech stocks that we think still have some rebound and some further runway ahead of them, and by adding value stocks that are very opportunistic.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  David -- it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>KUDLA:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Still bullish on this market.  David Kudla joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, the State of the Union is back on, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi extended officially the invitation to President Trump to do the State of the Union in the House Chamber.  He accepted the offer.</p><p>Plus we're taking a look at the enormous cost of the shutdown, what exactly is the number?  A lot of people say it wasn't very much at all.</p><p>Then, Snapchat's unthinkable change, how the photo sharing app is attempting to compete with Instagram by changing a key feature.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>New revelations in the sexual misconduct claims against the former CEO of Wynn Resorts.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with headlines now in New York -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Maria.  The \"Wall Street Journal\" is reporting that executives at Wynn Resort ignored allegations of sexual misconduct by Steve Wynn over more than a decade.  According to a regulator's report Wynn was accused of sexually assaulting or harassing salon workers, cocktail servers and flight attendants who worked for his company.</p><p>Under a proposed settlement, the Nevada Gaming Control Board won't try to revoke Wynn's regulatory licenses but Wynn is going to pay a fine.  Steve Wynn has denied any claims of misconduct.  There's a one year chart of Wynn's in front of you right there.</p><p>Well, Snapchat has named Lara Sweet as its interim CFO.  This is another shift in leadership at Snap as the company has lost several high profile employees over the last year.  Meanwhile Snap is reportedly considering allowing longer lasting or even permanent videos on Snapchat.  It will apply the Snap shared publicly on this story's features.  Snap is down 52 percent from one year ago.  There's that chart for you.</p><p>Well, Porsche is speeding past Tesla in a fast charging race.  The car maker says it new Porsche Taycan is going to be able to add more than 60 miles of charge in just four minutes.  That will be the fastest available today, exceeding Tesla's super charging stations which needs about 30 minutes to charge a vehicle's battery to at least 80 percent.  Charging times are a key selling point obviously for these car makers and now Porsche is giving Taycan owners three years of free charging.</p><p>And obviously we're going to be hearing from Tesla this week, Maria.  Earnings are coming out from Elon Musk and company.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Cheryl -- thank you so much.</p><p>Coming up next, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi challenged over her words describing a border wall as immoral.  We will break it down when we come back.</p><p>Then support on the links, fans rallying around a pro golfer whose two shot penalty was deemed unfair.  More on that.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Keeping America safe, the government is back open but the focus now is whether President Trump can make a deal with Democratic leadership on funding for the border wall.</p><p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has called it immoral, any wall is immoral.  But her home state of California protects the southern border in some places with an actual wall -- the wall separating Tijuana and San Diego.</p><p>Joining me right now is Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell.  And the last time you were on you said you wanted to look at this again.  Congresswoman -- it's good to see you.</p><p>REP. DEBBIE DINGELL (D), MICHIGAN:  It's good to see you.  Welcome to Washington.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.</p><p>What's your take on this?  I mean can Nancy Pelosi really get away with calling a wall immoral when she has a wall in her own state, separating Tijuana from San Diego?</p><p>DINGELL:  Here is what I think is going to happen.  You've got strong countries (ph), both sides of the aisle, both houses.  They're going to go into that room and they want to cut a deal that's going to keep our nation safe.  I don't think anybody wants to see what we just went through for 35 days.</p><p>It hurt the economy.  It hurt -- and I do believe -- this is going to sound corny but I don't -- you know, why do we point -- why do we need to have a Trump win, a Pelosi win.  We need an American win.</p><p>So I'm hoping they're going to go in that room.  I've talked to my colleagues on both sides.  I've talked to Roy Blunt.  I've talked to all my Democratic colleagues in the House.  They want to win.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DINGELL:  They want to go in and put together a package that's going to keep --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So how do you win?  What's the position in terms of wall funding?  Because they may very well -- your colleagues may very well come back and say ok, here's $5 billion towards border security, not a dime toward a wall.</p><p>DINGELL:  I don't know -- if people are really working together, that may not happen.  You know, there may be money, if there are appropriate places for a wall or fence or --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is there a movement within your party, do you think, among your colleagues that they feel that, yes, some money should go for an actual barrier?</p><p>DINGELL:  I think what I hear among my colleagues is let's go into a room and do something that makes sense.  Let's come up with -- we need to -- I've said this to you a million times.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DINGELL:  We need to strengthen our borders at both sides.  Everybody talks about the southern border.  I've got this northern border too which just had a huge human trafficking problem again in the last few --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But there are areas of the southern border that are very dense.  In other words like when you just look at the wall in Nancy's state and that is three million people on one side in Tijuana, three million people on the other side in San Diego.  If you tear that wall down -- I mean isn't it obvious many of the people on the Tijuana side will assimilate into the United States?</p><p>DINGELL:  Then let me ask you this question.  Build a wall, tear down a wall -- are there structures that are working that are in place?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  .</p><p>DINGELL:  So that's -- what I do think we need drones.  We need to fill the 3,000 open patrol --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's common ground, both sides believe in that.</p><p>DINGELL:  Both agree --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Technology and drones -- definitely.</p><p>DINGELL:  We need technology.  We need to make these ports safer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Specifically in a dense area, like Tijuana/San Diego, drones wouldn't work.  I mean maybe you want that in addition to a wall.  When you have such a dense area, where there's three million people on one side of the wall and three m million on the other, don't you need an actual barrier?</p><p>DINGELL:  But they are going to go in this room.  There are people that know what they're doing.  They're people -- they're senior people that have been on homeland security, people from the areas that are impacted --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think they're going to deal?  We won't shut down the government again?</p><p>DINGELL:  I pray to God, we never shut down the government.  Not only do I pray to God that doesn't come out of conference but you're going to see Republicans and Democrats working together.  We'll get --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This whole wall issue, Congresswoman, sort of underscores what's going on I think in both parties.  Now you've got former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz seeing an opening as a result of the radicalness on both sides.</p><p>He's facing backlash on his first stop for his book tour last night.  It was his first public appearance after announcing a possible Independent presidential run.  It did not go smoothly.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire (EXPLETIVE DELETED).  Go back to (INAUDIBLE) on Twitter.  Go back to Davos with the other billionaire elites who think they know how to run the world.  That's not what the country needs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  You know, I give you a lot of credit just being in politics, by the way.</p><p>Schultz is also being criticized by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, billionaire.  He tweeted this, \"In 2020 the great likelihood is that an Independent would just split the anti-Trump vote and end up reelecting the President.  That's a risk.  I refused to run in 2016 and we can't afford it right now.</p><p>Congresswoman -- do you think an Independent run is viable?  Do you think an Independent run from Schultz would hurt the Democrats?</p><p>DINGELL:  I think it's viable.  He has the money to spend it.  But I think he would hurt the Democrats.  I'm fearful that I am -- I'm trying to step back.  I'm not getting any candidate I want to see who is going to emerge, who's got people skills.</p><p>But this is dangerous.  And as you know, told you two years ago, Donald Trump could become president.  Nobody believed me.  You all thought I was crazy.  You may not have but most people did.</p><p>And I still think he could get reelected.  And if we do not run a strong campaign and we don't have somebody like that that pulls votes off --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  One of the issues is the messaging of what the platform is.  So what do you think the Democratic candidate for 2020 should have as their platform?  What's most important?</p><p>DINGELL:  You know what we didn't do and one of the reasons I believe firmly that President Trump became President Trump.  One, people are tired of partisan bickering.  They're tired of seeing things not get done in Washington.</p><p>There are a lot of people that are hurting in this country, just working men and women who want to know that we actually care about them.  They're scared about healthcare.  They're scared about escalating drug costs.  There's -- look at our --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So healthcare should be the platform?</p><p>DINGELL:  it's one piece of it.  Infrastructure, let's create jobs.  What are we going to do about education?  Trade?</p><p>Now, the President -- you want to know why he won Michigan?  Trade.  They're tired of bad trade deals that ship jobs overseas.  We don't have a level playing field.  The President's trade policy is all over the place.</p><p>It's not consistent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you going to vote for the ratification of USMCA?</p><p>DINGELL:  I don't call it USMC.  I call it NAFTA 2.0.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you going to vote for ratification.</p><p>DINGELL:  I haven't decided yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is on your plate now in the next month.</p><p>DINGELL:  Very much on my plate.  And talk to Lighthizer about it all the time.  But I'm not voting for any bill that doesn't have and acting legislation that keeps more manufacturing from going to Mexico.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wasn't that one of the key things of this new law?</p><p>DINGELL:  But Blazer still went to --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Keeping jobs here.</p><p>DINGELL:  Blazers went to Mexico in July.  I'm not seeing any more American cars go to Mexico and get built for $1.50 to $3.50 and then gets shipped back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you want a change before you vote for it?</p><p>DINGELL:  He knows how I feel.  I'm not -- one of the more likely people to vote for it but I'm not voting for it in the form that it's in right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.   We'll leave it there.</p><p>Congresswoman -- it's good to see you.</p><p>DINGELL:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.

The new teaser trailer for \"Toy Story 4\" drops with a big surprise.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Tuesday, January 29th.  Your top stories right now at 7:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Earnings season in full swing this morning for the fourth quarter.  Several Dow components reporting their fourth quarter this morning.  Verizon reported a mixed quarter earlier this hour.  Pfizer and 3M also under pressure this morning as you can see.  3M up three percent, although Pfizer and Verizon down better than one percent.</p><p>Rising tensions with China continuing, the U.S. bringing charges against Chinese telecom company Huawei as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning between the two nations.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will be joining me as my special guest this morning at the top of the hour, 8:00 a.m. Eastern.  Join us for that talk on China and the economy as we break it all down with the Treasury secretary.</p><p>Markets this morning are hovering around the flat line.  Take a look.  Dow Industrials up 20 points right now, 26 higher.  The S&amp;P 500 is down by almost one point and the NASDAQ down about three points.</p><p>All this after the major indices finished lower yesterday across the board at 04:00 on Wall Street.  Dow industrials were down 208 points and then actually was off of the lows of the -- of the day, down almost one percent at the close.  S&amp;P 500 gave up 21 points, that was three-quarters of one percent.  And the NASDAQ was down 79 points, better than one percent lower.</p><p>In Europe this morning, a mixed story, actually mostly higher.  FT-100 at the high of the morning right here, up 1-1/4 percent, 83 points higher, ahead of the British vote on the U.K. leaving the E.U.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is up 42 points, almost one percent higher and the DAX Index in Germany higher by 25, quarter of a percent higher there.</p><p>Asian markets mostly quiet overnight.  Take a look, as you can see, it was pretty much across the board.</p><p>$100,000 penalty, how one misstep cost a professional golfer big time.  The outcry, coming up.</p><p>And Woody and Buzz Lightyear are back, the new teaser trailer for \"Toy Story 4\" is out and it marks the return of one character after 20 years.  We will bring it to you.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning.  But first, our top story this half an hour, shutdown showdown, the government open for business again after the last -- at least for the next three weeks, rather.  But the main issue, funding the wall has not been resolved and the White House is not letting it go.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  What I do know is that if they don't come back with a deal, that means Democrats get virtually nothing.  That will make the president and force him to have to take executive action that does not give Democrats the things that they want.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is the House Minority leader, Congressman Kevin McCarthy.  Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you.</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  Thanks for having me back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So, what do the next three weeks look like?  Take us through these negotiating.  Do you expect any money for the wall?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  I expect us to solve this problem in the end.  What's interesting here is the whole time speaker Pelosi said I couldn't negotiate anything until you open up government.  The president put the public first and said OK, let's go through, I'll give you three weeks.</p><p>Now Wednesday, we'll have the conference committee, the senators and the congressional members' appropriation sit down and we'll see if they're serious about it, if they're willing to do something.  Because I believe Nancy Pelosi is out of step with her own party.  If you look at her number two, Steny Hoyer.  He said of course, that walls are not immoral, and that he believes some fencing involved.  From her Agricultural secretary to her Agricultural chair to our Armed Services chair, they both believe in a wall too.  Her Agriculture chairman said give Trump the money.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and she continues to say that it's immoral which I find incredible given the fact she has a wall in her own state.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  As my state too.  You know what I find --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And your state too, exactly.  California.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  You know what I find immoral?  When you really talk about this, this is about stopping human trafficking.  In 2016, they stopped more than 2,000 individuals involved in that.  I think it's immoral that you would allow that to continue.  I don't believe anybody in America that says they support border security believes that there is no such thing as some barrier.</p><p>And the president said, he does not a -- he does not want a wall from sea to shining sea.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  He just believes in the area you need some form of barrier and he's correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, where do you think are the most important areas that you would need the wall?  I mean, we talked earlier about this wall in your state, Tijuana, San Diego where it's very dense, three million people on one side, three million people on the other.  Can you make the case that that dense area is elsewhere where that's why the president is so stuck on having this wall there?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  And it's not the president saying, it's the experts.  The president sat down with the experts and they said this is what we need to be able to secure our border.</p><p>So in certain areas, like in San Diego, we stopped illegal movement by more than 95 percent.  You look at Yuma, Arizons, El Paso another -- El Paso became one of the safest cities in the nation after being able to put it through.  That's what we need, in certain parts of the country along the border, you need a barrier.  In other parts you could put the drones in this part area.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what are you expecting to give on?  And what -- do you think they're going to offer the $5.7 billion that the president wants for border security?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  But we're arguing over one-tenth of one percent of the budget.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a great point.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  The Democrats have voted for a wall before.  But now that the president brings forward what the experts want, they say no.  That is what's so confusing to me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, what -- why is this so important for the president right now?  Going into 2020, I mean, is she seeing this as a campaign promise and that's why he doesn't -- she won't agree to it.  Because I don't know how she can call it immoral, given the wall in her own state, your own state.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Again, it's such a little price to pay for so much more security when you look at the human trafficking.  Think of the number of lives that we will save from this process if we have a secure border.</p><p>But what's more importantly, it's the president that sat down and tried to be reasonable, find common ground.  He's the one who brought DACA into it.</p><p>And let's not forget, speaker Pelosi just a year ago holds the record for the longest speech on the floor, eight hours, over one issue, DACA, which she shut the government down over.  And now she thinks that's not important?  I think those people are important as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think that this -- a negotiation, an agreement will include a DACA deal?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  It could.  It doesn't have to.  But because the Democrats and speaker Pelosi have been saying no.  The president said he was willing to go there, three more years of DACA for a portion of the border security that the experts are asking for.  I just find her out of step with her own party.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, there seems to be a movement within the party, even some of the newer congress people coming in, fresher faces saying you know what, yes, we do need border security and we do need the money.  So, are they going head to head?  I mean, are they -- do they even have a voice?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  They don't even have a voice.  Because remember, she has so much power.  She will not allow the vote to come up.  I believe inside the conference we could come up with an agreement.  The question is, will speaker Pelosi even allow that to be voted on the floor?  If we had a vote on the floor, I believe it would pass.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think that the president will allow the government to shut down again?  I mean, is the president really prepared to have another government shutdown if he doesn't get the money?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Look, I think the president's going to try to find a way to solve this one way or another.  I don't know that shutting the government down solves it.  I there's other ways to do that the president can.  I know he firmly believes in a legislative process.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Should he call for a national emergency?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  He has the power to do that.  I think the best road forward right now is a legislative agreement.  And what's so interesting to me, I'd listened to these Democrats celebrate Nancy Pelosi.  You celebrated someone that got you status quo.  They're still a DACA problem, they're still a border security problem.</p><p>And government is designed to find common ground and compromise.  The president was the one person looking reasonable in all these discussions.  I know the president's committed to this.  He will get the border secure one way or another.  He's giving the Democrats an opportunity.  He gave them an opportunity all along this discussion.  They said then open up the government, they'll discuss it.  So he did that and gave them a three week time.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean, I think this whole thing, the government shutdown and the constant resist upsets people.  I mean, you have to wonder if in fact -- you know, she keeps resisting everything that the president wants, if the people will turn on her.  Because people want to see you guys get something done.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Yes, she is celebrating status quo.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  That's not where we need to be --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me move on and ask you about 2010, congressman.  Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz thinking about running for office.  He was at a book signing last night in New York and he was heckled over his bid.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump.  You egotistical billionaire (INAUDIBLE).  Go back to getting ratioed on Twitter.  Go back to Davos with the other billionaire elites who think they know how to run the world.  That's not what the country needs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This heckler not the only one weighing in.  Michael Bloomberg former mayor of New York City also told Schultz not to run as an independent.  He said this, given the strong pull of partisanship and the realities of the electoral college system, there's no way an independent can win.  That is truer today than ever before.  Is that where we are, an independent can't win, congressman?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  No, I think it's Bloomberg upset.  Because remember, he went from a Republican to an independent to a Democrat and he just spent $120 million giving to the Democrats so they can win the majority in the House and he doesn't want his money to be wasted, so he doesn't want competition.</p><p>Look, I think there's ample opportunity for an independent to get in this race, only because the Democrats are now become social Democrats.  They're talking about a 70 percent tax rate.  They're talking about these green deals.  They're talking about socialism.  If you listen to what some of these new Democrats say, they think Venezuela's problem is not because they're a socialist country, it's because of sanctions.  They're so out of step.  They are putting letters in to help those who want to go sign up for ISIS, to be easy on them to the judge.  I mean, I have -- this is not the America we live in, and that's the difference.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  This party is so out of step and I think you'll find a lot of moderate Democrats who say I want somebody else who could talk about this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, that's why a number of moderate Democrats can't really get the OK from the party leadership because they're not left enough.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  This new socialist Democrat Party has left the Democratic Party.  They are in to -- remember, Bernie Sanders is not registered as a Democrat.  He's registered as a socialist.  AOC does not call herself a Democrat, she calls herself a Democrat socialist.  This party is moving to a whole different place.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Real quick before you go, when the election happened back in November.  You said one of your priorities going to be to get the majority back.  How are you going to do it?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Well, first of all, you've got to make sure you can recruit.  I think, you put the ideas up there.  Ideas should win at the end of the day.  You look at where we are financially in this country.  A lot of that happens to do with the policies that we're able to create, from the tax policy, the battle we had with you human trafficking and other that we were able to do.  I think you're going to find as going directly to, we've got to find a suburban areas to be able to win again in and I think we're going to be very successful.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, it's good to see you.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Congressman Kevin McCarthy, joining us there.</p><p>Still ahead, Richard Trumka AFL-CIO president on the impact of the shutdown on American workers, what he'd like to see, back in a moment with that.</p><p>And then, support on the links, a pro golfer given a big fine and a two-shot penalty which many are calling grossly unfair.  What went wrong, right here.</p><p>Plus, you've got a friend and a big surprise, the trailer for \"Toy Story 4\" drops with a character we haven't seen in 20 years.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Prosecutors resting their case against Joaquin El Chapo Guzman.  Cheryl Casone in New York with details and headlines, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It; must something else, Maria.  The federal government has now rested its case.  They called 56 witnesses.  The trial of the notorious Mexican drug kingpin started back in mid-November.  El Chapo told the trial judge yesterday he will not take the stand in his own defense.  One witness is scheduled to appear for the defense today.  Closing arguments expected to take place tomorrow and Thursday.  Big story, a lot of New Yorkers have been following very closely.</p><p>Well, professional golfer Haotong Li is getting a huge outpouring of support from fellow golfers after losing out on nearly $100,000 Saturday for a minor infraction.  It happened at the Omega Dubai Desert Classic.  Li was on the 18th green when judges accuses caddie of standing too close behind him as he got ready to putt.  Well, the ensuing penalty dropped Li's score from 71 to 73.  And he went from third to 12th.  Tour officials say the correct call was made but acknowledge it was grossly unfair.  They're looking at the giving referees more discretion in cases like this going forward.</p><p>And then, get ready for \"Toy Story 4\".  Pixar is putting out this teaser video, shows the revival of Woody's love interest, Bo Peep.  And she is back with a new, more modern look.  She was last seen in \"Toy Story 2\", back in 1999.  It is now 20 years later, \"Toy Story 4\" is going to be released, Maria, this June .  Those are your headlines from New York, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like it.  Bo Peep.  All right, thank you Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, the lingering effects of the shutdown showdown.  AFL-CIO Richard Trumka will join us to talk about the impact on American workers.  He's up next.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We are focused on the American worker this morning.  White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney saying that the 800,000 federal workers who were not paid twice during the partial government shutdown should receive those checks by the end of this week.</p><p>Joining us right now is American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organization's president, AFL-CIO, Richard Trumka.  It's great to see you, Richard.  Thank you so much for being here.</p><p>RICHARD TRUMKA, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR AND CONGRESS OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION:  Maria, thanks for having me on today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Give us your take on what the impact of the shutdown was.</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, I think there's several impacts.  There's impact on the people and you not only have government workers who get back pay but you have the government contractors who won't get back pay unless something is done.  That was a devastating effect on them.  It had a devastating effect on the economy itself.  $11 billion, although we'll pick some of that back up later in the year.</p><p>But you had a devastating effect on the airline industry where you had people, airline controllers, traffic controllers that were in school that actually just up and left.  They said we're not going to do this anymore (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What could -- what could have been done about it then, Rich?  Because you as the leader that you are and representing so many workers across the country have to be unnerved when you see open borders and illegals coming in and taking your jobs.</p><p>TRUMKA:  Look, that's just not how it works anymore.  I mean, you have people that got laid off from the president's place that have been here 20 years.  They're not taking anybody's job.  What we want to do is make sure every worker in this country has the same rights so that they can't be exploited.</p><p>Because what happens right now with undocumented workers is, they're great when no one's around.  When they try to organize and get a voice, then they start squeezing them.  They start ex -- you know, doing, calling in ICE and different things.</p><p>The idea is if everybody has the same rights, then they can't exploit those people and everybody can actually have a fair playing field.  What happens to American workers -- employers right now, is you have an employer that hires people, makes them work in unfair condition, misclassifies them, underpays them, and they're competing against our employer.  That employer needs to pay everybody the same rate, live by the same working conditions, so that we can all compete.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you're OK with illegals coming in and as long as everybody's treated the same?</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, Maria, it's a -- it's a nice cliche, illegals coming in.  But you know yourself that most people that are here undocumented or illegally came in legally.  So the whole system needs to be addressed.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, but there are apprehensions that we could look at, just in the month of December, just in the month of November, where apprehensions were of illegal immigrants coming in and wanting asylum in the United States.</p><p>TRUMKA:  There's no question that the system is broken.  We need to fix the system and have a path towards citizenship so that those workers that have been here for years and are actually making the economy run, even the president's golf courses and things like that, they have a chance to get citizenship and they work their work there.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Just a question on the golf courses.  As you know, that's the H2B program, people who come here as foreign workers, come under a specified amount of time for DOL.  I think the real question is is that, what happens to all the people, not who have been here who came legally and overstayed the visa, but what about all the people who come every day at the southern border and can cross into our country?  That's really the pernicious problem.  And even on wall, built with American workers, you'd be for that.</p><p>TRUMKA:  But listen, the people that come back and forth, you have Americans that go to Mexico and Mexicans that come to America to work.  I think Mexico --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you don't think there's a problem at the border at all?</p><p>TRUMKA:  I didn't say that.  There is -- there is a problem.  We do need border security.  And no, I don't think that a wall's the answer to it.  Every time someone's tried to build a wall it's not been very successful.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, the one in Tijuana is successful.</p><p>TRUMKA:  Ask the Chinese, ask the French.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The wall -- the wall in Tijuana --</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Ask Tijuana (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tijuana and San Diego, what abut that Richard?</p><p>TRUMKA:  I'm sorry?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The wall, between Tijuana -- separating Tijuana from San Diego, is that successful?</p><p>TRUMKA:  There are places -- there are places probably where it works.  Is that the answer to everything?  No.  Should that have been the reason for a shutdown?  Absolutely not.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  I want -- I want to ask a broader political question.  We've seen in the last two elections that increasingly voters, blue collar voters, voters in manufacturing towns all over America, the kind of rank and file people that you represent are voting for Republicans, they're going for Trump.  Does the AFL-CIO need to realign its own approach to politics in this town, given that more and more of its people are going with people like Donald Trump and his trade policies and the Republican Party?</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, that's a -- that's a question we could talk about two or three hours for.  First of all, we have realigned our politics.  We are issuing -- we're issue oriented right now.  We put an issue out and if a politician supports that issue, then we support them.</p><p>In fact, in this last election we elected two union members to the Senate, three to governorship, 18 to the House of Representative, and 925 to state legislatures, because those workers will go and support our issues.  That's what we try to do.  We find it more and more difficult to find Republicans that actually support us.  Now, the American worker believes that neither the political system --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got to jump.</p><p>TRUMKA:  -- or the economic system works for them.  They want somebody to change the rules.  That's why they voted for Trump.  If he changes the rules to their advantage, some of them will vote for him again.  If he doesn't, he stands a chance of losing those workers and right now he's losing those workers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Richard, thank you so much for joining us.  We appreciate it.  Richard Trumka there.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Show: MORNINGS WITH MARIA][Date: January 29, 2019][Time: 08:00:00][Tran: 012903cb.231][Type: SHOW][Head: Apple Disables Group FaceTime Function That Was Allowing Callers To Listen And View Without Your Consent; British Parliament To Vote On Brexit Amendments; Kudlow on the Economy; Craft Brewers Impacts from the Government Shutdown; Kudlow on China Trade][Sect: News; Domestic][Byline: Maria Bartiromo, Gerri Willis, Ashley Webster, Hillary Vaughn, Dagen McDowell][Guest: Steven Mnuchin, Larry Kudlow, Matt Schlapp, Jon Hilsenrath][Spec: FaceTime; Huawei; Apple; Brexit; Federal Reserve; 3M; Harley-Davidson; Verizon; Oath Media; Channel Inventory; World War II; CBO; Trade Talks; Deregulations; Tax Plan; China Trade; Slowdown; Government Shutdown]</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good Tuesday morning.  Welcome back, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  Live from Washington this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is January 29th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  Earnings in focus.  Investors watching results from several Dow components this morning ahead of the opening bell.  One to watch after the bell tonight -- after the close is Apple.</p><p>Meanwhile, Apple under fire FaceTime hit with a new bug that allows people to eavesdrop on you without your knowledge and even if you don't take the call.  Rising tensions with China, the U.S. brings charges against Chinese telecom company, Huawei as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  The very latest on the state of negotiations with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin coming up.</p><p>Markets are searching for direction this morning.  Take a look at the futures ahead of the open this morning.  Dow industrials picking up speed up 55 points right now, a quarter of a percent higher.  S&amp;P 500 is up two and the NASDAQ right now right now showing a gain of 11 points at the open in about an hour and a half.  This after declines across the board yesterday.  Stocks finished off of the lows, but nonetheless the Dow Industrials gave up 209 points yesterday 4:00, almost one percent lower.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 gave up 21 points, three quarters of a percent lower.  And the NASDAQ was down 79 points.  That was better than one percent lower yesterday.  Global markets this morning are mostly higher.  Take a look at European indices with the FT-100-is at the high of the morning, up 86 points, 1-1/4 percent ahead of the vote on Brexit.  CAC quarante in Paris us up 44 points and the DAX index up 21, fractional gain there.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets were little changed.  Take a look, it was pretty much across the board.  Now, our top story this morning, concerns of a global slowdown.  Last week in Davos I spoke with Bridgewater Associates founder, Ray Dalio, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, and Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey.  Here's what they said about the possibility of an economic slowdown on the horizon.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RAY DALIO, FOUNDER, BRIDGEWATER ASSOCIATES:  Europe has a negative growth and the United States is going to have a negative growth environment.  I don't mean absolute negative, I mean slowing of growth in a material way that could be close to between zero and two percent over the next 18 months.</p><p>BRIAN MOYNIHAN, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, BANK OF AMERICA:  We have the top research firm in the world, and they have done a great job.  And they have the U.S. growing at 2-1/2 percent this year.  The world growing 3-1/2 percent GDP growth.  But that's down from last year.  And so the confusion in the environment right now is a slowdown or is it going in to a recession?</p><p>Nothing we see says it's close to a recession.</p><p>JAMES QUINCEY, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, COCA-COLA:  I think we are in danger of talking ourselves into a problem.  It's just a little bit slower growth.  It's not a recession or a decline.  So we see -- we see a little -- a little softer 2019, maybe a little less tail wind than 2018.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now in a Fox Business exclusive is the treasury secretary of the United States, Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  Great to see you, Secretary.</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, UNITED STATES TREASURY SECRETARY:  Great to see you as well, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.  Your reaction to really what seems like now a unanimous feeling that a slowdown is on the horizon.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, Maria, from everything we see, the U.S. economy is still quite strong.  The companies are doing quite well.  And we see still tremendous investment in capital and human investments.  There's no question that as it relates to Europe and China, there is a slowdown.  We're monitoring that carefully.  But we still see a tremendous opportunity and a lot of capital coming into the U.S.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Federal Reserve basically told us they are on pause.  They may even pause the balance sheet unwind which is also telling us that the Fed is also expecting a slowdown, but do you believe a recession is on the horizon in 2020 even though you're seeing strength and stability so far?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  We see no indications whatsoever of a recession on the horizon.  And from everything we see from speaking to a large across the board businesses, the combination of tax reform, regulatory relief and trade is still has a very strong impact on the U.S. economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And some people are saying that the impact of certainly of trade and tariffs is causing some uncertainty.  So how much of this slowdown that we're expecting later on even if it's not right now is due to what you say you're watching China and Europe and how much of it is uncertainty around the President's tariffs program?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, Maria, as you said, there are people who expect a slowdown but I would just comment a year ago with the projections were 2-1/2 percent.  And we were at three.  We feel very comfortable we're going to hit three for last year.  And we think there's still a very good case for three percent this year.  Now, as it relates to trade, we couldn't be more pleased with the USMCA.  We are looking forward to Congress passing that quickly.</p><p>That's a very important trade deal.  We have two days of talks with China starting tomorrow.  The President is going to be involved in those talks at the conclusion.  We've been updating him.  We have another 30 days after this.  So I think we're making significant progress, and I think on the trade front, these are all very positive impacts for the U.S. economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about the trade talks because this story of China, first off, thank you to the President and to the administration for pushing back on China because that's another unanimous feeling out there, that the President did the right thing in terms of stopping China from some of its practices.  What are you expecting out of these talks?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, the President wants fair trade with China.  It's got to be reciprocal.  Right now China has free access into our markets, and we have limited access to there.  So the critical issue that we've talked about is market access, making sure there aren't forced joint ventures, not forced transfer of technology and that we have a mechanism that when we reach an agreement that we can monitor that agreement and that they'll live up to it.</p><p>And that's how I expect we will make significant progress this week on those issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How much of a priority is espionage?  Obviously the administration unveiling a sweeping set of criminal charges against Huawei Technologies.  We have had on a number of CEOs that have said yes, they have stolen trade secrets from us.  Has this come into the conversation with your Chinese leadership?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  No, let me be clear.  Those are separate issues.  And that's a separate dialogue.  So as it relates to the Huawei issues that's being run by the Justice Department.  I have no involvement in that.  I found out about that yesterday when it was announced.  So those are not part of trade discussions.  Forced technology issues are part of trade discussions but any issues as it relates to violation of U.S. law or U.S. sanctions are going through a separate track, which is the Justice Department.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, I guess the broader issue is, is this a cultural thing in China?  I mean this weekend on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" over on Fox News I spoke with the ranking member of the Intel Committee, House Intel Committee Devin Nunes and he went through some of the practices that China does every day.  Listen to this.  I've got to get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  China might have accessed allied intelligence shared with Poland and passed it on to Moscow.</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R), CALIFORNIA:  What the Chinese are doing is that they have these companies that are essentially owned by the party, the Communist Party and essentially this is a dictatorship.  There's very few people that own these companies.  They weaponize the.  So when all over the -- all over the world you have Chinese technology specifically as it relates to infrastructure on -- communications infrastructure, they will go in and they beat every other company around the world.</p><p>And in fact, they've driven a lot of companies out of business because they come in undercut.  They want to have control over all the com systems or communication systems all over the globe.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's pretty incredible.  We will handle your infrastructure of telecom and then they have a way in of spying.  How can you separate that from the conversation on trade and on forced transfer of technology?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Maria, I think you can easily separate these issues.  So there are two different issues.  One is an issue of state subsidies where they do subsidize state enterprises and they compete unfairly.  Those are trade issues, those are violations of the WTO and that's something from an economic standpoint.  We are going to enforce very seriously.  I think you know among the National Security Council, so I'm going to be careful what I say on national security issues.</p><p>But I assure you whether it's China or anywhere else in the world, our security services, DHS and others will make sure that we protect the U.S. infrastructure, we protect from cyberattacks.  That's something we're very well aware of.  But these are separate issues and shouldn't be confused.  We are focused on what are unfair economic practices.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So the best case that you can get from China is what?  Opening up their markets?  Already we are seeing some likelihood of that, UBS I guess was the first bank that was allowed to operate in China and own 51 percent of that bank.  They say they're going to go to 100 percent in three years.  Are you seeing a significant opening in terms of the Chinese willingness to open their markets to foreigners?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I do, but I think that's a good start.  But why should we have to wait three years for a U.S. company to own 100 percent in the financial services?  China can operate and own 100 percent of companies here.  So that's an example where, you know, they're moving in the right direction.  We want to speed that up.  But the issue is really we want to make sure that U.S. companies can compete fairly in China.</p><p>And if we can do that, China has a very large growing middle class.  It's an enormous market.  As I have said before, this is one of the biggest opportunities for U.S. companies in U.S. business if we can get this right.  And President Trump is determined.  This is the first administration that has aggressively said to China, you need to play fair.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is the President willing to drop all tariffs, should he get a good deal that's acceptable?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I think everything is on the table.  So the President is -- will look at, again, the objective is to have a very fair deal.  Hopefully we'll make progress this week.  The President will be involved in these negotiations and discussions.  And we've still got a lot of work to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the President said look, I'm a tariff guy.  I like tariffs.  So does that mean these tariffs are for, you know, no end in sight or would he be willing to drop the tariffs all together?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  The President hasn't made any decisions on that.  There have been no recommendations from the economic team on that yet.  The first step is to make sure we get a good agreement.  And when we get a good agreement, we'll make a recommendation to the President and he will consider that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have seen the Chinese economy get impacted.  You're still talking about 6.4 percent growth, we think, but that is lower than some people think.  What's your worry or how concerning is it that the Chinese slowdown will impact the United States?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, there's no question that China is slowing down.  They still have significant growth rates.  We're beginning to see the impact on that on world growth.  Our objective is not to slow down China.  Our objective is to make sure that U.S. companies can do business in China and can do business fairly.  So we're monitoring these issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary, stay with us.  We want to get into the shutdown and get your impact on how much the shutdown cost the economy and what you're expecting there.  Stay with us.  More of my exclusive interview with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin when we come right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are life live this morning in Washington, D.C.  And I'm sitting right now with -- in a Fox Business exclusive with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  And Treasury Mnuchin, we were talking about the broad economy.  I want to ask your thoughts on the shutdown.  The CBO says that the shutdown caused $11 billion impact to the economy, $3 billion which is completely lost because of the 35-day shutdown.  Your reaction?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Maria, Kevin Hassett, the CEA is working on final numbers for us.  I think his view is that there's no question that there was some cost but those costs will be recovered as money comes back into the system.  I think it's -- he views that it will almost all be recovered.  Now as it relates to the exact numbers, I haven't seen the final numbers yet.  But the good news is we got the government open.</p><p>People are back to work and we have not seen any significant impact on the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Has -- is the President prepared to shut down the government again in three weeks if he doesn't get the money for the border wall?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Maria, I had dinner last night with the President, the Vice President, Senator Lindsey Graham.  We had a very good discussion on this issue.  There's no question in my mind that the President, the Vice President want to do a fair deal.  Lindsey has been terrific in helping to negotiate this.  I hope the Democrats are sincere.  If they are, there's a sincere deal that will include a lot of different issues that need to be resolved.</p><p>But if they're not sincere, the President has all his options on the table.  And he's determined that he's going to make sure we have border security.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's the impact on the IRS?  There's a lot of worry out there that people are not going to get their checks after April 15th as a result of this shutdown.  What can we expect?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, let me just comment on both the treasury, our bureaus, the IRS in particular, I want to thank the enormous number of government employees who came in and worked during the shutdown.  I think as you know, we had the ability to bring in critical employees.  We never would have been able to do the sanctions that we've been doing over the last month without the hardworking people.</p><p>And the IRS had a large number of critical employees to make sure that we were ready to open for business as usual.  So we're ready to open for tax season.  We're taking tax returns.  We'll be ready for tax refunds.  We will have the phones restaffed.  Now, let me just say that there's no question, this time of the year, there's very, very heavy call volume.  That's something we have to manage.  I encourage taxpayers who have questions to try to go to the web first.</p><p>But we are ready for tax season, and I can assure you that tax refunds will be paid as normal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  So, tax refunds will be paid as normal.  That's the bottom line.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  People were worried about that.  Let me move to the sanctions and in particular Venezuela because you've applied sanctions on the Venezuelan oil industry.  Tell us specifically what the impact here is.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, sanctions are a very important tool in our national security portfolio.  And when we look at national security issues, we look at economic tools.  We look at diplomacy.  We look at national security tools, military options.  So there's no question that what we're trying to do is to cut off the money to the regime that should not be in power and make sure that the President Guaido has access to funds and has access to the assets of the country.</p><p>And to make sure we protect these assets for the people of Venezuela.  It's really quite sad.  This is a country that is very, very rich in oil resources that has had extraordinary poverty and extraordinary humanitarian issues over the last issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And have you spoken with the opposition leader party about this?  What has been the response so far?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I haven't personally, but I know the Vice President has been in communication.  I think the response has been very positive.  We've been very careful in balancing this.  We've -- I've spoken to many of the refineries over the last week.  I want to make sure that there was significant capacity.  There's a lot of oil on the water already in transit to the U.S. refineries.  So I think on the one hand, we've been able to cut off Venezuelan oil going forward.</p><p>But we're managing this with the U.S. refineries.  We've issued licenses for the U.S. refineries to continue to operate.  And if Venezuela wants to continue to sell us oil, which we would like to buy that money would go into blocked accounts and will be protected for the people of Venezuela.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what about other industries in Venezuela?  I mean, the sanctions are on the oil industry.  What about other money, other imports that they still get that?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  We will always look at additional sanctions.  We want to make sure that things like medicine and other humanitarian issues continue to go to the people.  We will always look at additional sanctions to make sure we protect the assets of the country for the people of Venezuela.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why was it important for the President to back the opposition leader?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I think he is the rightful leader of the country, the national assembly, the constitution.  I think, you know, democracy is very important to the people of the United States.  And we want to make sure that there are free and fair elections and that there is a proper democracy that's very important to the national security of the United States.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary, it's good to have you on the program.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you very much.  Secretary Steven Mnuchin joining us.  Coming up, earnings in focus.  Major companies reporting this week including Apple after the bell tonight.  What you need to know ahead of those numbers.  Then the U.K. facing a crucial test.  British lawmakers voting later today on measures surrounding the U.K.'s potential exit from the European Union.  Back in a moment with that.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Earnings driving markets this morning.  3M, Harley-Davidson, Verizon out with mixed reports this morning.  Gerri Willis is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange watching markets.  Gerri?</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  That's right.  3M, Dow component, a split decision here missing on estimates beating on revenue.  The EPS line $2.27 a share.  Revenue 7.95 billion.  They lowered their 2019 guidance.  But they say they're positioned for success in 2019 despite the global slowdown.  Stock trading higher.  Harley-Davidson, let's get to that, a big miss on both the top and the bottom line.</p><p>EPS of 17 cents a share.  Revenue of 955 million.  The stock is down and down hard this morning nearly 10 percent.  They're citing restructuring charges, incremental tariffs and recall costs.  Big troubles for the hog.  Verizon beating on EPs but missing on revenue.  We're seeing yet another split decision here.  EPS of a $1.12 a share.  Revenue of 34.3 billion.  The stock trading down nearly four percent here.</p><p>Profit hurt by the restructuring of Oath Media business as we have discussed.  Apple coming after the bell, this is critical earnings release for the markets here.  EPS estimate of $4.17 a share.  Revenue of 84 billion.  We will be focused like a laser on iPhone.  iPhone sales in China, is there an iPhone recession going on in China right now?  Watch Channel Inventory for some of the details about that.</p><p>Meanwhile, Apple having trouble with FaceTime.  A bug where callers can eavesdrop on FaceTime calls has cropped up.  The company says they are checking it.  But you should know that Tim Cook on Monday, well, he was saying big things about International Data Privacy Day asking users to insist on reforms.  Oops, I guess they got a problem.  Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Gerri.  Thanks very much.  Gerri Willis on Wall Street.  British lawmakers will debate several amendments to the U.K.'s planned exit from the European Union today and let Prime Minister Theresa May know what parliament is prepared to vote for.  Ashley Webster is live in London right now with that.  Ashley?</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.  Good morning, Maria.  This is if Parliament knows exactly what it will vote for.  There will be at least 15 amendments to choose from -- will be debated.  That will be up to the Common Speaker John Bercow.  He will decide which ones will be debated.  And it could indeed shape the future of what Brexit will look like moving forward.</p><p>Now, among the most popular amendments that we are expecting to be the debated will be what's called the Cooper amendment, that's Yvette Cooper, the Labour M.P.  It basically says if no deal is reached by February the 26th, it would postpone Brexit for nine months essentially to end of the year from march 29th, that's the date that exists now.  Then there's the Brady amendment, the Graham Brady (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>He basically is putting forward an amendment that would replace the Irish backstop with what is called alternative arrangements, such pretty vague, basically anything elsewhere and what we have now and there is no time limit on that backstop.  We have heard that Prime Minister Theresa May has already told European leaders that she wants to reopen Brexit negotiations.  Let's not forget, just last month, in December, the Prime Minister said it wasn't going to be reopened that the E.U had given her their best deal.</p><p>Now she wants to turn around and say look, you need to reopen negotiations.  I'm going to find out from Parliament what they are prepared to vote for and let's go from there.  And it calls today is January 29th.  The Brexit deadline, March 29th.  We have exactly two months left to go, Maria.  And let's be honest, there is no sign yet of a -- of a deal in place that a majority of people in Parliament can get behind.</p><p>Yesterday we had a whole series of warnings about what would happen if there was a no deal scenario.  Just crashing out retail consortiums saying, look, there's going to be empty shelves, prices are going to go up, a break in the supply chain.  It will be very, very detrimental to the British economy.  So that is the background.  Later on today, we'll find out what Parliament can get behind.  Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Ashley.  Thanks so much.  We'll check back with you.  Ashley Webster in London this morning.  Coming up.  The shutdown impact on your wallet.  I will be speaking with National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow on the economic effects of the shutdown.  Plus Federal debt reportedly headed to the highest level since World War II.</p><p>That is next.  One brewery feeling the impact.  The shutdown hitting one San Diego beer company.  We've got that story.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thank so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo coming to you live this morning from Washington, D.C.  It is Tuesday, January 29th.  Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Earnings season in full swing.  We have heard from Harley-Davidson, hit in the pre-markets after disappointing numbers.  Xerox as well headed higher after beating expectations.  Look at Harley-Davidson's shares down almost 10 percent right now.  China, one of the issues, once again.  Meanwhile rising tensions with China on the U.S. level.  The U.S. bringing charges against Chinese telecom company, Huawei, as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  Moments ago, I spoke with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin who talked about what the U.S. is looking for in the coming talks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MNUCHIN:  The President wants fair trade with China.  It's got to be reciprocal.  Right now, China has free access into our markets and we have limited access to there.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Futures this morning are higher.  Take a look, we have the highs of the morning right here with the Dow Jones Industrial average up 73 points, a third of a percent.  The S&amp;P 500 up 4-1/2, and the NASDAQ higher by 18 points, one-quarter of one percent.  European indices this morning are also higher.  Take a look.  FT-100 in London is up almost 100 points, 1-1/2 percent.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is up 55, better than one percent.  And the DAX Index in Germany up 37 points, that's one-third of one percent.  Asian markets mostly flat overnight as you'll see that was pretty much across the board with Japan and Korea squeaking out a fractional gain.</p><p>Our top story this half an hour, the cost of the government shutdown.  The CBO says about $3 billion out of 2019's projected GDP was completely lost due to the shutdown.  Joining me right now in a FOX Business exclusive is National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow.  Larry, it's great to see you this morning.</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for being here.  So obviously 35 days, government shutdown, CBO says $3 billion is lost.  Never coming back.  Your reaction.</p><p>KUDLOW:  With respect, once again, we disagree with the CBO.  I don't think we're going to lose anything.  This is completely temporary.  None of the incentives in the economy have been changed by this.  You know, that's the key point.  President Trump lowered marginal tax rates on individuals and most especially businesses.  And then he had this massive sweeping rollback of costly and burden regulations, which freed up the whole economy, including the energy sector, which has turned out to be a boom.  Why would we lose something just because of a temporary issue regarding the government?  Now, I'm always interested in sort of counting angels on the head of a pin.  We have about a $20 trillion economy, fair?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  There -- what was their number, three billion out of 20 trillion?  Do you know what the --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Three billion.  Yes, no, you're right.  You're right.</p><p>KUDLOW:  - percentage that is?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I totally understand.</p><p>KUDLOW:  I don't understand why we even mess with it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Actually, they're saying the total impact was $8-11 billion.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But that will come back, except for the $3 billion they say that is completely lost.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, again, with all due respect to the professionals at the CBO, I disagree.  Again, because the incentives in the economy -- here's the big difference between I guess the administration and the Congressional Budget Office and a lot of other forecasters.  We believe the economy is growing at three percent plus.  By the way, the Commerce Department for 2018 has scored I believe 3.1 percent.  We'll get the rest of those numbers in a week or two.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KUDLOW:  The CBO does not.  They never have.  They've never given us credit for the incentive effect of lowering taxes and regulations.  Supply side incentives are kicking in.  If you look at the whole panoply all of the economic data, whether it's very strong Christmas retail sales, whether it's industrial production, manufacturing, the best since the '80s, whether it's business equipment, which means the capex boom is happening that we always hoped for.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KUDLOW:  You'll see in my judgment, at least, the three percent trend line will continue.  CBO and many others have us at two.  But this goes back before the President.  This goes back way before.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  They don't believe the economy can grow.  They don't give any credit --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, even somebody like a Steve Schwarzman will say 4.2 percent growth in the second quarter is very hard to sustain on a $20 trillion economy.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, I'll keep working on Steve Schwarzman.  He's a good guy.  But in a $20 trillion economy, which again will grow rapidly, I see no reason why we can't continue three percent plus.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That's the whole point.  The idea that was sold to everybody I guess going back several years, maybe going back 10 or 15 years, that we're in some secular stagnation is just plain wrong.  With the right set of policies, to unleash --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- American animal spirit --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we saw that with the tax plan and the deregulation.  I totally get that.</p><p>KUDLOW:  And you look at the --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But what about tariffs and trade, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  The -- just one --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because the CBO'S report also brings that up.</p><p>KUDLOW:  One last one on this, the face of the new Trump economy -- I just want to put this in here, it's the thought I've had for quite a while.  These are men and women running small businesses.  These are blue-collar workers.  You look at the evidence, the employment for blue-collar workers, the best increase since the mid to late '80s, when I was a Reagan Cub Scout here in Washington, D.C.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  The wage rates of blue-collar manufacturing autos, they're rising faster than white-collar workers.  This is a direct result --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- of the incentives we've put into the economy.  CBO, again, it's not personal to my friends at the CBO, they don't give us any credit for these incentives.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No, I understand that.  But the --</p><p>KUDLOW:  And I want to stay with that story.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- the report on the trade policies estimated that new tariffs on imports and exports will cut an average of one-tenth of a percent from economic growth through 2029.  What's your take on that, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because we know that these tariffs are in place.  They still are impacting business and uncertainties.  So, is the President prepared to do away with all tariffs if he gets that agreement from the other side?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, I don't want to go there.  I mean, that's going to be his decision as you know.  Vice Premier Liu He is coming and we will have high level discussions Wednesday and Thursday and we're all looking forward to that, as is the President.  The President, as I read him, moderately optimistic about this trade story.  So, that's good.  What was it, one-tenth of one percent by 2029?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  So then here we are in 2019, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, no.  One-tenth of a percent from economic growth through 2029.</p><p>KUDLOW:  See, this is too hard, Maria.  It's way too hard --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- to figure that stuff out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you don't think there's going to be any -- there's --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Could it be possible that there's no impact from the shutdown?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Yes, quite possible.  I never -- it's utterly totally temporary.  So, that's -- let me --- look, let me go back -- the growth potential from China trade, people tend to look at this as a negative.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Look, I don't know the outcome of these talks.  Here's what I know, the scope of the discussion will be the broadest and deepest in the history of U.S.-China trade.  Literally everything's on the table.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Point number one.  Point number two, if China opens its markets --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is a big deal.</p><p>KUDLOW:  OK?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it looks like there's (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>KUDLOW:  Which is huge.  You know, I don't want to predict, and as Ambassador Lighthizer said a million times, and I agree, the enforcement mechanisms are going to be crucial.  But if they were to open their markets as we have requested regarding tariffs and non-tariffs, if they would let American companies own the subsidiary in China, so there's no forced transfer of the family jewels of technology, if we have --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But it --</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- some rule of law regarding I.P. theft, here's my point, open markets will allow the United States to export like crazy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But I understand that, Larry.</p><p>KUDLOW:  And that has been hand -- we've been handcuffed.  If we do that, if we do that, not only will the United States grow faster --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- because of that, China will grow faster.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That all sounds great, but can you actually do that, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Competition is the solution.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's the point, because if you're saying, \"OK, China, we are agreeing that you are opening your markets, and as a result, we will meet your demands, but then they say okay, but you have to have a communist, a government leader on the board of any company that has 100 percent.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Which is -- which is extraordinary, you're absolutely right.  It's extraordinary.  And it's --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So I mean -- so you could say it's great --</p><p>KUDLOW:  And unacceptable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- that you're going to open markets.</p><p>KUDLOW:  It's unacceptable.  It's unacceptable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But they -- aren't they saying that a communist has to be on the board of any company that has 100 percent?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I think that's been the past and I think that's going to be a very hot topic in these trade talks because that is completely unacceptable to us.  No question about it.  We will see how this turns out.  China, unfortunately, you know, they're in a slump.  China's economy is slumping very bad.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  I think part of that slump is a function of the President's tough negotiating with tariffs, when necessary, OK, part of that slump is in the last five to ten years.  China has moved in the wrong direction, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  The market-based reforms have been moving in their own direction.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But they're not market-based.  They are communists and they want communists on the board of -- So I'm just wondering, all of this sounds great, if you can actually get it done.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Oh, I know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Larry, stay with us.  We want to talk to you about other things because the tax plan and the deregulations have worked.  But there are some other ideas coming into play ahead of 2020.</p><p>KUDLOW:  China should not use the Venezuelan form of the economic policy.  We need to go back to who is it that said free market capitalism is the best path to prosperity?  It was the (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, that would -- that would be you and Ronald Reagan.  Stay with us.  We will be right back.  More with Larry Kudlow.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Thank you.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We come to you live this morning from Washington, D.C. and I am sitting with National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow, in an exclusive interview this morning.  And we were talking about China and what you can get done.  How important is tomorrow and Thursday in terms of meeting a deadline, that March 1st, in terms of a deal on the table?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I think's very important.  Look, I --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think you'll get a deal by March 1?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I don't want to predict.  It's just too hard to predict.  And, of course, these are decisions that will be made by the President, who is his own best negotiator.  Best I can is, as I said, the scope of this thing's going to as wide and broad as anything we have ever seen.  That does not ensure positive negotiator.  Best I can is, as I said, the scope of this thing is going to be as wide and broad as anything we've ever seen.  That does not ensure positive outcomes --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- right?  I think everybody, including the President, is basically moderately optimistic about this, OK?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Wait, let me ask you, your tax plan --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Ultimately -- one other thought which the President believes that he and President Xi will probably be the ultimate negotiators.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  OK?  And the work being done tomorrow and Thursday is vitally important to lay out options, OK?  But --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So the President will be involved in these talks tomorrow and Thursday?</p><p>KUDLOW:  That is what he has been saying in our meetings.  And I hope so because he's a great negotiator.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me move on to the tax plan.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because we're hearing a lot of ideas in terms of taxes now, now with a lot of 2020 hopefuls.  The Tax and Jobs Act obviously did move the needle on economic growth along with the deregulation out of this administration.  Now you've got Elizabeth Warren talking about two to three percent tax on the very high wealth people.  So if you have $50 million in wealth, you'll get two percent tax.  If you've got a billion dollars in assets, you'll get taxed three percent.  And you've got Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez talking about tax of 70 percent tax --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- on the highest earners.  What is your take on this?  Give us your reaction and what kind of an impact those policies might have.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Right.  These are prosperity killers, these are growth killers, these are job killers, these are incentive killers.  This is a return to some heavy government planning essentially direct to the economy.  You know, I hate to dwell on this because it's a crisis right now, but take a look at Venezuela, just for the heck of it.  What (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There was a time when that was vibrant -- it was a vibrate country.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That is correct.  That is correct.  And investment was flocking to it.  Then they took, down through the years, really exact measures you're describing that are coming from some of these Democratic candidates --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- and the economy was destroyed.  I mean I hear this notion we have to have equality, equality of income, equality of results, which I think runs counter to all human nature.  You know what?  A place like Venezuela has equality.  Everybody's poor.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think they'll be able to reverse the tax cuts then?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Everybody's poor in Venezuela, except for a hand -- Maduro and a handful of this top military people.  Is that what we want in America?  We are growing right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So will the Dems be able to reverse your tax cut plans?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Never.  Never, not until the President's configuration.  I -- look, first of all, if they want to try to raise taxes, it will be defeated in the Senate, Republican.  I personally believe even if it went beyond that --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- the President would veto any efforts to turn back his program.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How important --</p><p>KUDLOW:  We're doing what people said we couldn't do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But how important is debt?</p><p>KUDLOW:  They said we couldn't grow at three, four percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But how important is debt, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  We're growing at three, four percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Let's not mess with it.  If it ain't broke, don't fix it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Congressional Budget --</p><p>KUDLOW:  There's a tremendous surge in prosperity here shared by the middle and lower middle income people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Congressional Budget Office is saying that the deficit is hit -- set to hit $897 billion this year.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That would be the highest level since World War II.  When does debt become a priority?  Do you think the President, let's say he does have another term, will try to attack the entitlements?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, look, I think right now the two issues are maintaining economic growth.  You know, growth is the single biggest factor in these budget calculations.  Growth brings income and revenues.  And in fact I haven't gone through it with a fine-toothed comb yet, but I will.  I think I see that the CBO is acknowledging that our faster growth, which they did not predict, is now paying for over 80 percent of the tax cuts.  OK?  And I think you'll see more about that as we get through.  The reports just came out yesterday.</p><p>Second point I want to make is we will have a tough spending budget coming up in a few weeks, a very tough spending budget with reductions of at least five percent across the board, in non-defense accounts.  So I think that's going to be very important.  Let's minimize government where possible.  Let's grow the economy to its max.  And you will see the debt burden, which I thought debt, as a share of GDP, will be coming down, and by the way, it already is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  OK.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That's what happened during the Reagan years.  That's what happened during the John F. Kennedy years.  So, I wrote about it in my book.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That -- that's the best way to measure that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But, Larry, you know what I don't understand?  I mean you're all about growth, you have been for all your entire career.  Why are so many people worried about the slowdown?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why are we hearing some people say a recession is on the horizon?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, there's just -- it's funny in this town and I guess a little bit in New York, this is a lot of pessimism.  I don't --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you expect a recession this year or 2020?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I do not.  I don't see it right now.  If I look at financial indicators, credit spreads, the actual numbers, you know, it's just -- we -- GDP will come out a week late because the Commerce Department has reopened.  We've seen stuff like falling unemployment claims, rising manufacturing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But what are the markets telling us, Larry?  In the month of December, there was no high-yield debt issuance at all.  Credit markets are still tight.</p><p>KUDLOW:  They've come back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They've come back a bit.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Come back.  I like that.  Profits, the mother's milk of stocks, I don't know who first that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You did.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Profits, the mother's milk of stocks are rising.  The early indications are they won't to 25 percent but they're going to rise 10, to 15 percent.  I like that a lot.  Interest rates, the level of rates, are historically low.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you're not worried about market volatility?</p><p>KUDLOW:  There's a million things to worry about when I get up in the morning, you know, mainly getting here on time so I could do this great interview.  But I just want to say, if you look at the sum total of all the evidence right now, there's no recession out there.  I am the happy warrior.  I am an optimist.  President Trump is an optimist.  I think America, right now, we are the hottest economy in the world and we should remain so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll end it there.  Larry Kudlow.  Good to see you, sir.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow.  Back in a moment.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The government shutdown may be over, but the effects are still being felt.  Hillary Vaughn is live this morning at a craft brewery in Escondido, California where the shutdown effects are actually still lingering.  Hillary.</p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Hi, Maria.  Good morning.  Craft beer is a $76.2 billion industry, and for many craft breweries, like Stone Brewery, where we are today, the effects of the government shutdown are not over.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOMINIC ENGELS, CEO, STONE BREWING:  When the industry craft is built on seasonal beers, it's built on new beers, it's the new sexy thing, and if we can't get the new sexy thing to market, then we're not going to connect with our fans.  They're going to be disappointed.  We're going to make the sales numbers we planned to make in our financial plans, and these things will have repercussions.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUGHN:  As Federal workers at the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau are finally back in the office, a mountain of paperwork is waiting, about 11,000 applications for alcohol labels have been backlogged leaving craft breweries waiting to ship and sell all their new beer across state line, which means they're in limbo until these approvals go through.  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Hillary.  Thanks very much.  We've be watching that.  Hillary Vaughn.  Stay with us.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  President Trump is tweeting this morning.  He's talking about a former staffer.  Here's what he just said.  \"A low level staffer that I hardly knew named Cliff Sims wrote yet another boring book based on made up stories in fiction.  He pretended to be an insider when, in fact, he was nothing more than a gofer.  He signed a non-disclosure agreement.  He is a mess.  Dagen McDowell, great to see you this morning thank you so much.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  John Hilsenrath, Matt Schlapp.  I don't know why the President tweets this.  He's got how many million view, you know, users and followers.  He just let everybody know who this guy is like --</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, THE AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Well, he literally sat in a -- he sat in a cubicle outside my wife's office in the West Wing, and so it is kind of amazing like this insider whole kind of mythology is something the President knows is not true.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  But he's got some extra sales thanks to that tweet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  That's what I'm saying.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think, Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  Again, everybody's got a book to write.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jim Comey, this guy.  Hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Oh, that was a good answer.  Hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, Jim Comey's book, yes, well, there's -- I think that will be a story that we're going to continue following, Jim Comey and the FBI.  You know what.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Everybody wants to be Norma Desmond, Maria.  I'm ready for my close up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  Thanks, everybody.  Great panel today.  Great to see you Dagen McDowell, Matt Schlapp, Jon Hilsenrath.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TECHWR-2172770028</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TECHWR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WFD-9FB1-DY0W-435C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">352430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"24032\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good morning, everyone, I'm Maria Bartiromo, thanks for joining us live this morning from Washington.  It is Tuesday, January 29th, your top stories right now 6:00 a.m. on the east coast.  Earnings in focus this morning, investors are watching results from several Dow components ahead of the open this morning.  The one to watch after the close is Apple.  We've got everything you need to know this morning previewing the report.  Apple under fire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile, FaceTime hit with a new bug that lets people eavesdrop on you without your knowledge.  How you can fix it, coming up -- big story.  Rising tensions with China meanwhile, the U.S. bringing charges against Huawei as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  The very latest on state of negotiations with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin this morning.  That interview at 8:00 a.m. Eastern, join us for that.  PG&amp;E makes it official, California's largest utility filed to bankruptcy protection, following the massive wild fires.  We've got all the details, coming up.</p><p>Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz roasted.  The billionaire hackled at an event last night as he gears up toward a possible independent run for the White House.  We've got a big show this morning coming from D.C., U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is here, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow is here along with House Minority, California Congressman Kevin McCarthy.  Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell will join me, along with AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka.  Don't miss a moment of it.  We've got a big three hours, coming up.</p><p>And we turn now -- right now, we kick it off with Wall Street markets.  We're looking to see a rebound this morning.  Take a look at Futures actually have just turned negative once again.  Futures down just fractionally, about 6 points on the Dow Industrials; 1-1/2 points lower on the S&amp;P; and the NASDAQ down 13 points.  This, after stocks finished lower yesterday on China growth fears along with weak guidance from Nvidia and Caterpillar.  We told you -- the Caterpillar numbers right here.  And of course, it did worsen throughout the day as investors react to a weaker-than-expected earnings and guidance.</p><p>Joining me right now is Federated Investors Chief Equity Market Strategist, Phil Orlando.  And Phil, it's good to see you this morning.</p><p>PHIL ORLANDO, CHIEF EQUITY MARKET STRATEGIST, FEDERATED INVESTORS:  Thanks for having me back, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All indications that we are seeing a slowdown and worries around China, among other issues, how do you see the markets here as more earnings have come into play?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, you had this 20 percent waterfall decline in stock prices in the fourth quarter of last year, we thought the market was attempting to price in the prospect of recession this year.  Multiples contracted from 18 times earnings down to 14 times earnings.  In our view, there's no risk of recession this year.  So, the rally that we've seen over the last month, 14 percent rally, the market is starting to price in the fact that maybe we're not going to have a recession.  But we've had a 14 percent rally in a month.  That's very, very powerful.  We would absolutely expect some consolidation here over the next month or two particularly as we've got these critical sign posts coming up in the month of March, but as we look out over the balance of the year, we do think that multiples will return to that 18 level, and we're going to end up with a pretty good year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  To what do you attribute the slowdown?  We've got earnings in focus and we're looking at a number of companies out that give weaker-than-expected guidance or miss on the top line.  Lockheed Martin, Pfizer, and Verizon are reporting this morning.  Apple is, of course, out after the bell, so when you look at the earnings picture, where in terms of industry are you seeing the most slowdown?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, I think in a word, uncertainty is what's impacting earnings and guidance to some degree.  You've got the Fed flip-flops that we saw in the fourth quarter last year, the uncertainty about whether or not the United States and China are going to be able to consummate this trade deal.  You've got Brexit overhanging on the global market and certainly the government shutdown, which was up there for 35 days, and it was just temporarily resolved last Friday.  You've got a number of issues there, all of which are impacting companies in some way, shape or form.  So, with earnings up 25 percent year-over-year in the first three quarters of last year, this fourth quarter is a little softer, I think we're up about 13 percent.  So far, we're about a quarter of the way through the earnings season.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>ORLANDO:  And I think what companies are pointing to are some combination of those four issues that I just mentioned.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you mentioned the shutdown.  The shutdown apparently costing the economy $11 billion according to new analysis from the Congressional Budget Office, although Larry Kudlow is disputing that number, and he's going to join us this morning live to talk about it.  The report says that it hit $3 billion, that's one-tenth of a percent of economic activity in the fourth quarter alone.  So, are there sectors that were -- that were hit hardest in that regard, or do you want to look at those companies that are largely tied to the China trade as one area of the real weakness?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the council of economic advisers under Trump had advised us that the shutdown was going to take about one-tenth of one percent out of GDP per week.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, remember, the shutdown started right around Christmas, so that makes sense that we lost, you know, a tenth of a percent in the fourth quarter, you know, maybe a half a percent here in the first quarter.  We're at 1.7 percent GDP growth in the first quarter, consensus blue chip is around 22, 23.  So, we think this pretext a little high and there will be, you know, sort of a downward revision as we get later in the quarter.  But in terms of industries, I think it's really across the board.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Across the board.</p><p>ORLANDO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about technology because it's big week for tech, Apple, of course, the big story today, reporting after the close tonight -- the only big tech reporting.  Microsoft, Facebook out tomorrow, Amazon is out on Thursday.  This is the week that we'll focus on technology and that's where really the growth stories have been.  Would you want to put new money to work in any of these names ahead of their earnings?</p><p>ORLANDO:  Short answer is probably no.  Again, you've had this 14 percent rally here in the last month, you've got concerns about slowing economic growth both in the U.S. and China.  We think that those issues will be resolved as we get into the back half of the year, but right now, you know, why run the risk of putting new money to work after you've had a big rally in some of these names ahead of what could be a disappointing earnings number or perhaps conservative guidance.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, the stock has come down because people were worried about it.  So, we'll see what the numbers are.  Would you, at some point, go back in to tech?  What's your favorite group right now, Phil?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, the areas that we like best in the U.S. markets are energy, financial services, industrials, and health care.  In terms of looking overseas, emerging markets look very attractive to us.  So, the areas that have really gotten hit the most are the ones that we've been attracted to.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there.  So, the valuations are better, I guess, is what you're saying.</p><p>ORLANDO:  The valuations are much more attractive.  We think the fundamentals are still very strong.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Phil, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>ORLANDO:  Great to see you.  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Phil Orlando joining us there.  Meanwhile, a bug in Apple's FaceTime app lets users listen in someone's phone without even the person knowing.  Dagen McDowell, what's happening this morning?  Good morning to you, Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well, Apple has some explaining to do, but particularly on this earnings call this afternoon.  So, there's a bug in the Apple iPhone that would allow people to eavesdrop on FaceTime users' calls.  A FaceTime user calling another person could listen in while the recipients phone is still ringing even if the person never accepts the call.  This was -- it involves several steps in the Group FaceTime feature on the iPhone.</p><p>Apple has disabled that Group FaceTime while it tries to come up with a fix for this, but you can eavesdrop in on somebody, essentially listening through the microphone, even if a person never takes that call, you could eavesdrop on rooms with unattended devices and even receive unauthorized video from the phone.  And again, it would take several steps to do this, but this is coming from a company, Maria, that loves to brag about its privacy protections and even throws shade at the likes of Facebook and other technology companies.</p><p>And adding embarrassment to embarrassment, yesterday was International Data Privacy Day and Tim Cook was tweeting about that.  Here's what he said on Twitter yesterday before this bug, this eavesdropping bug was disclosed.  We must keep fighting for the kind of world we want to live in.  On this Data Privacy Day, let us all insist on action and reform for vital privacy protections.  The dangers are real and the consequences are too important.  Big whoops for Apple, and of course, everything that happens in the business world is a political opportunity.  The Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo had to weigh in on this as well, putting out a statement late yesterday, say, \"Urging FaceTime users to temporarily disable the app.  So, Apple beat him to it, they're trying to fix it.  Embarrassment nonetheless.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible because you don't even know -- I mean, the phone could be ringing and you don't even know that they're listening.  I mean, that's the worst part of it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  I can explain later as the show goes on how this work, but you'd have to place a FaceTime call, go to the group, add yourself to the call and then the recipient of the call would have to hit maybe one like the on-button on the phone in order to activate it, but it was possible, and it was all over the internet yesterday how to do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, if -- so, if it's -- if it's not on and you say -- and you do -- and you decline the phone call, they can't listen in?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Unless you -- but you can't touch the phone at all.  Like, it's not even declining the phone.  Like, if you hit the up -- the up volume button on the phone, and so if I was playing this trick on you, it would activate it, and they could essentially hear what was going on in the room.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Unbelievable.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  I want to hear more about that, for sure.  Meanwhile, there's this, as expected, PG&amp;E filed for bankruptcy protection following those devastating wildfires in California.  Cheryl Casone on that in headlines right now.  Cheryl, good morning to you.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  Well, PG&amp;E is facing roughly about 30 billion in potential liabilities, as investigators are looking into whether the company's equipment played a role in starting California's deadliest fire.  More than 100 people died following a series of wildfires that burned hundreds of thousands of acres over a two-year period.  The utility providing energy service to 60 million people, we should add.  Taking a look at shares of PG&amp;E, look at that, in the premarket down nearly nine percent.  And those loses have actually paired back in the last hour or so, folks.</p><p>Well, China's Vice Premier has arrived in Washington for high-level trade talks that are going to start tomorrow.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and trade representative Robert Lighthizer will attend the two-day meeting.  Yesterday, the Trump administration announced a pair of indictments against Chinese telecom giant, Huawei.  The U.S. is accusing the company of trying to steal trade secrets from T-Mobile.  The Justice Department also charging Huawei with conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran.</p><p>And the China story continues, folks, shares of Nvidia are lower this morning.  The chipmaker is warning investors, and expects much weaker sales thanks in part, yes, to China's slowing economy.  It also previously cautioned the sales of its graphics processors that are used in video games PCs would be disappointing.  The China effect continues.  Chips for video gaming account for more than half of their business, they lost half their market value since hitting their peak back on October 1st, Maria.  So, Goldman Sachs had to come out last Friday, Maria, warning that a lot of these chip companies that have massive exposure to China are going to have really rough reports.  Micron Technology, even Wynn Resorts, the casino company, has got big China exposure, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, for sure.  All right, Cheryl, thanks so much.  Coming up next, five police officers are injured this morning, four of them shot while serving a search warrant.  The very latest coming up.  And then a venti-size disaster for Howard Schultz last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire (BLEEP).</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Former Starbucks CEO having a rough time exploring a 2020 Presidential run as he gets heckled.  We break it down right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Live from Washington, we are eyeing 2020, former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz facing backlash last night on his first stop of his book tour.  It was his first public appearance after announcing a possible Independent Presidential run.  It did not begin smoothly.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire (BLEEP).  Go back to getting ratio'd on Twitter.  Go back to Davos with the other billionaire elite who think they know how to run the world.  That's not what democracy needs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, my goodness.  Schultz is also facing backlash from former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.  Here's what he tweeted: \"In 2020, the great likelihood is that an Independent would just split the anti-Trump vote and end up re-electing the President.  That's a risk I refused to run in 2016, and we can't afford to run it now.\"</p><p>Here with me this morning to talk more about all of that is Dagen McDowell back in New York, Wall Street Journal Global Economics Editor Jon Hilsenrath here in D.C. with me, along with the American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp.  Gentlemen, it's good to see you.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Welcome to Washington.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, thank you so much.  And welcome to presidential politics, Howard Schultz.  What do you think about that?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Well, I'm going to get some popcorn.  This could be a real interesting Democratic primary, and whatever this Independent thing is, don't you love Michael Bloomberg who has probably spent a million dollars on polling, trying to figure out every way to become the President.  Publicly chastising Schultz for running as an Independent when that's exactly what Bloomberg would just love to do if he could.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  You know, on the one hand, Dagen, I feel like there is an opening for an Independent because there's such extremes and radical conversation going on certainly on the left.  And on the other hand, I don't know, how much is a cup of coffee at Starbucks?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Again, that $18.00 cup of Joe, I'm joking, I'm exaggerating.  It's helping --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think it's like $6.00.  I mean, seriously.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, we love cart coffee around this place.  But again, that's helping fund this run.  But Michael Bloomberg -- you know what, Michael Bloomberg should run for the Democratic nomination if he thinks he can win, it's just hilarious to have this multibillionaire lecturing Howard Schultz about an Independent run when actually a cup of Starbucks coffee has more charisma than Michael Bloomberg, number one.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Number two, it's going to be really interesting to see the narrative in the spring of 1992 with Ross Perot was -- Ross Perot was going to divide the Democratic vote, that it wouldn't hurt the Republican.  This could very well -- I mean, it depends on who -- what Howard Schultz says on the campaign trail and how far-left the Democrats go when they're running for the nomination.  But I'll say this, what he said so far about pay -- how to pay for Medicare For All and how that's impossible, I would be really interested to hear him talk about how to fix the health care system, because he might come to the table with some really interesting ideas and force the Democrats to answer the hard questions about paying for this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that is the thing, I mean, this party unfortunately, it's very hard for someone who's a centrist to actually have a shot.  You had Tim Ryan from Ohio, he wanted to do it, he's an economic thinker, he doesn't have a shot because of the same thing, you've got the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's 70 percent tax rate, the loudest voice in the room.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I mean, there's no question that these primaries are starting out very much from the left, you know, you have talk about a wealth tax, and 70 percent high-income tax threshold.  You have Elizabeth Warren who is going around beating up on the banks.  This is definitely a left-leaning primary season that we're going to be going into.  What I find so fascinating is the journeys that these different billionaires are traveling.  You know, you had President Trump who supported a lot of Democrats as a businessman in New York City traveling over to Republican Party, now you have Michael Bloomberg who started out as a Republican Mayor --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- traveling over to the Democratic Party, and Howard Schultz doesn't know where to go.  He doesn't know where he fits in.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He doesn't know where -- and what about Senator Kamala Harris?  Let's listen to her, because she held a CNN Townhall meeting in Iowa last night.  Harris is vowing to eliminate private health insurance with Medicare For All if elected president.  What's your take, Matt?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Making insurance companies illegal.  Look, the Democratic Party has become quite radicalized.  Think about this, less choices for the patient is the solution to our problems.  That seems insane.  Also, do we really think the government, when you get your tags to drive your car, or when you pay your taxes at the IRS, do you really think all the solutions to our problems are there?  I don't.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Let me ask you this, who does President Trump want to see come out of this whole --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think he wants Howard Schultz to run.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think -- he was taunting him yesterday.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH:  No, besides Howard Schultz, among the Democrats, who does he -- who does he want to (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>SCHLAPP:  I think most Republicans -- I'm not going to speak for the President -- but I think most Republicans believe that Elizabeth Warren is so far out there on the loony left, basically Marxism, socialism that I think they find that a delicious opportunity.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Can I --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- call the confiscation, Dagen.  He called it (INAUDIBLE) I mean, this two or three percent tax on assets, confiscation.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It is wealth confiscation.  It's totally communist and then to try and find people when they hand in their U.S. citizenship when other countries come calling, wanting you move there because they won't come and take your hard-earned money.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  One thing I want to point out that Jon Hilsenrath said that Howard Schultz doesn't know where to go.  President Trump should be worried about a Howard Schultz, because what if he comes to the table, like I said, with ideas that appeal to voters in this country who feel left out.  Who left out from the Republican Party and certainly left out by the left-leaning Democrats in this environment.  So, be very, very careful.  And one other thing I'll add with Howard Schultz at that -- at that bookstore, that's just the New York City welcome wagon.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's the way they treat all tourists in this city.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, I think you make a good point because there is that path.  That path of centrism.  I mean, that path of the center, because people do feel like it's gone wacky all the way on the left, for sure.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  It's a centrist country, but don't forget Hillary.  She's making noises.  Maybe that's the President's favorite opponent.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH:  We haven't seen any --</p><p>SCHLAPP:  She's making noises.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  We haven't seen anyone travel that centrist path as an Independent to presidency.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  So, it was a smart move on Howard Schultz's part.  We'll see.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Or a risky one for all those billions --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, certainly risky.  Take a quick break.  Extreme weather warning meanwhile on the other side of this break, millions of people across the country are gearing up for an Arctic blast as temperatures are plummeting, that's next.</p><p>Then showing their cards, British Prime Minister Theresa May asking Parliament to put up its plans from Britain's exit from the E.U.  Details on the historic debate.  And the vote happening later today, back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  It is cold out, and the deep freeze is setting in, hitting millions of Americans with subzero and dangerous temperatures.  Fox News Senior Meteorologist Janice Dean in the Fox Weather Center right now with the very latest.  Janice, tell us about it.</p><p>JANICE DEAN, FOX NEWS SENIOR METEOROLOGIST:  Hi, Maria, yes, we could be dealing with historic lows.  These are current windchills, what it feels like when you go outside and you are not protected.  Dangerous, potentially life-threatening windchills of -41 in International Falls, -18 in Chicago, but we still have another blast behind this.  So, these are morning lows, these are not windchill temperatures: Chicago -25 on Thursday, -31 in Minneapolis, -16 in Detroit.  Again, those are not windchill values.  Those are actual air temperatures.  But with the windchill, in some cases, we could get windchill values of -40 to -50.  If you go outside, your skin is going to freeze in minutes.</p><p>So, here's Chicago, Illinois.  Your all-time record low is -28.  So, we're going to flirt with historic lows, Maria.  This is a big deal.  The good news is it won't be long lasting.  By the weekend, we'll start to rebound, but I also want to make mention with this arctic cold front as we have snow across the deep south.  Snow that could cripple travel across portions of Atlanta, Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, and towards the southeast, so that's another dangerous part of the storm is the -- not only extreme cold but the snow as far as south as the gulf coast.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Janice.  Wow, what a story, thank you so much.</p><p>DEAN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will be watching.  Janice Dean.  Coming up next, the State of the Union is back on, it is February 5th.  Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi extending an invitation to the President, he accepted the offer.  Then, we're taking a look at the enormous cost of the shutdown.  What is the real number?  Plus, place your bets, Super Bowl fans getting ready to throw down an enormous amount of cash.  So, bet on the big game Sunday.  We break down all the numbers.  Stay with us.  Live from Washington this morning.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us.  We are coming to you live from Washington this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, January 29th, your top stories right now 6:31 on the east coast right now.  Earnings season is in full swing, a lot of big names reporting their fourth quarter today.  Xerox and Pfizer set to report in just a few moments, we'll bring you the numbers as soon as they hit the tape, and tell you how they are impacting markets.  Rising tensions with China, the U.S. is bringing charges against Huawei, as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will be my special guest, in about 90 minutes time.  We will break it all down with the Treasury Secretary, coming up.  So, stay with us.</p><p>Meanwhile, Futures relatively flat this morning, take a look at markets, down 20 points on the Dow Industrials, down 4 points on the S&amp;P, down 18 points on the NASDAQ.  We are expecting some pressure at the start of trading this morning, after all the major indices finished lower, yesterday, on Wall Street.</p><p>In fact, at 4:00, the Dow Industrials gave up 208 points, that was almost 1 percent lower, the S&amp;P 500 down 21, that was three quarters of a percent lower, and the NASDAQ with a 79-point decline yesterday, at the close, down better than 1 percent.</p><p>Investors are watching some big news this week, J.P. Morgan, calling this week the most important week of the first quarter, and here is why, you've got earnings, you've got the British vote, you've got U.S.-China trade talks, you've got a Federal Reserve decision, we're not expecting a Fed hike.</p><p>We've got fourth quarter GDP coming out.  And, of course, at the end of the week, the job's report for the month of January, a big week, investors want to watch it and will be covering it all.</p><p>European indices this morning look like this, in terms of trading.  We are looking at gains in Europe.  The FT-100 up one and a quarter percent, 86 points higher, the CAC Quarante in Paris is up a half a percent, 26 points higher, and the DAX Index in Germany, higher by a fraction, as you can see there.</p><p>Asian markets overnight, flat, take a look.  No real moves there, because mover was the KOSPI Index in Korea, up a quarter of a percent.</p><p>Well, there is tragedy in Houston to report, five police officers injured.  Four of them shot, while serving a search warrant.  We have the very latest, coming up.</p><p>And a debate in parliament, British lawmakers set to vote on the latest plan for the U.K. to leave the European Union.  We are previewing that and we will take a look at the impact across the world.</p><p>We've got a big program this morning from D.C., U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is coming up this morning, along National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow, they will take a look at all of these expectations that the economy is slowing.</p><p>Plus, House Minority Leader and California Congressman, Kevin McCarthy, is with us, along with Michigan Congresswoman, Debbie Dingell.  Plus, AFL CIO, President Richard Trumpa, here as well, big show, don't miss a moment of it, big three hours, coming up. And we are kicking off this half an hour right now, with this top story, feeling the effects of the shutdown, Washington, D.C. back in business for now, President Trump will give his State of the Union of Address on February 5th, Tuesday.  The address was originally supposed to be today.</p><p>Even though the shutdown is over, the U.S. is still feeling effects, new numbers from the Congressional Budget Office to report.  The U.S. GDP will be $3 billion lower during the fourth quarter of 2018, because of this shutdown.  On the immigration front, backlogs of immigration courts grew by at least 10 percent, according to Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about all of that is Americans for Tax Reform President, Grover Norquist, Grover, good to see you.</p><p>GROVER NORQUIST, PRESIDENT, AMERICANS FOR TAX REFORM:  Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So, the CBO is talking about a $3 billion-dollar hit, in fact, as a result of the shutdown, Larry Kudlow is having an issue with this.  He says, frequently disagrees with the CBO anyway.  What's your take in terms of what the shutdown cost the economy?</p><p>NORQUIST:  Look, the key thing is that the economy continues to grow and we're looking at a three percent rate of growth for the year, so $3 billion is a big number, unless you compare it to the GDP of the United States in the fourth quarter.</p><p>So, actually, we're doing fairly well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You don't think it had much of an impact then, Grover?</p><p>NORQUIST:  No, it's a small impact and we have a tremendous growth for the year, which is way beyond what the CBO said was possible, when they scored this.  The CBO needs to spend a little more time going back to explain why they were so wrong on all of their recent predictions, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  Go ahead.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Grover, the Federal Reserve and most of the economist that we surveyed at the Wall Street Journal are saying that the economy is slowing down in 2019.  We had a nice burst in 2018 in part, because of tax cuts and in part, because there's more spending, $300 billion of additional spending.</p><p>But now, they say the economy is slowing along with the global economy, what does that say about the impact of these tax cuts, are the tax cuts really created the long-run growth that Republicans said was going to happen?</p><p>NORQUIST:  The tax cuts do two things.  We were at 35 percent rate, which is the highest in the world.  It made sense for an American company like Burger King to be bought by Canadian company, because even though they're selling the same hamburgers, the same number of employees, it was worth more, because we had a worldwide tax system at 35 percent.</p><p>By taking 35 down to 21, we became competitive with Europe.  I mean, our friends, the Germans were at 25, the Japanese were at 25.  I'm sorry, the Japanese were at 30.  The Chinese were at 25.  And we were at 35.  We weren't even close to being competitive.  It's a huge change in the direction for the country.</p><p>And if the CBO tells you they're pessimistic, they didn't think you could do three percent, they laughed at three percent growth, said you could never do more than --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  The question is, is that three percent growth.  I think a lot of people understand that the corporate tax rate was uncompetitive, even some Democrats wanted to lower their corporate tax rate, but the question is, this new tax code that we've got, is that sufficient to sustain the three percent growth in 2019?</p><p>NORQUIST:  It's a good first start.  We also need to do something about the workforce.  We need more workers and frankly, there's more tax reduction that needs to be done and spending restraint is very important at the end of the day.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  I want to go back to this question about a shutdown, Grover, which is, people are saying, they're almost using the reason why you couldn't cut government, because somehow, that would have a negative impact on our economic growth.  That seems like a very dangerous road to go down.</p><p>Isn't it true that all of this money that they are saying didn't get put into the economy, are you worried that the government actually won't spend all of that by the time that the authority over the money, expires?</p><p>NORQUIST:  For the government to -- I was taught this (INAUDIBLE) economics in college also.  The government takes your money, and then spends it.  It's much better for the economy than if it lets you spend it.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Right.</p><p>NORQUIST:  Because you would waste some of it by investing it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because they can spend money better than you, of course.</p><p>NORQUIST:  And that's the oddest thing because, of course, that's nonsense.  East Germany should have done very well, under this theory, but it doesn't, so --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  What the government is doing is borrowing other people's money and spending it, right?  I mean, we're talking about deficits that are nearing a trillion dollars.</p><p>NORQUIST:  The (INAUDIBLE) cost the government is how much the government spends, whether they borrowed or take it, it's still gone from the -- from the real economy.  The cost of government is total government spending.  We should have taxes low, and then the least destructive way possible, all taxes are somewhat destructive.  And you have less borrowing if you have less spending.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what about all of these new plans?  And by the way, we are getting earnings right now, as we're talking 3M and Xerox, both beat expectations, although 3M is cutting its forecast for the year.  What about all of these ideas about taxing the wealthy?  New York Congressman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez claims for a 70 percent marginal tax rate on the tippy top, as she calls it.</p><p>Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts senator, hopeful, for 2020, two percent tax on Americans whose assets exceed 50 million.  If you're a billionaire, three percent, what's the impact?</p><p>NORQUIST:  OK, magicians like to do this, so you're not looking at, you know -- watch my right hand, don't look at the left hand.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NORQUIST:  The reason they talk about high tax rates on rich people, is that they want to gouge the middle class.  The difference between the United States and Sweden, Finland, Denmark, the countries that Cortez talked about is, they don't have the 70 percent rate, just back up for sec -- there isn't a country in the world with a 70 percent income tax rate.</p><p>Many countries used to, the Beatle song, 19 for me, one for you, 95 percent tax rate, and then the Beatles moved to United States, and everybody who could pay tennis, left Sweden.  And all the countries of the world realize that tax rates that high were stupid and destructive and didn't help equality or growth or anything like that.</p><p>So, they got rid of them.  The whole world got rid of them.  We did it, it was stupid.  We back offed it and had strong economic growth as a result, so 70 percent stupid and destructive.  It's not America saying, the world says that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You probably showed the op-ed today, in the Journal, in California, and taxes as well.  The Journal, this week, by Cypress founder, T.J. Rodgers, which was very good, Another California Tax Grab, he writes.  In it, the politicians have fueled an affordability crisis that drives away businesses and exacerbates homelessness.</p><p>California Governor, Gavin Newsom, called for even higher taxes in his inauguration speech earlier this month.</p><p>NORQUIST:  California is a good example of 70 percent play.  They have a 13 percent rate on people making a million dollars, but they have 8 percent rate on people making $42,000.  So, they want the middle class people in California to think you're OK, because we're really screwing the other guy.</p><p>And point of fact, Florida has a zero percent first income tax, Texas has a zero percent first income tax, 8 percent looks good compared to 13.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NORQUIST:  Looks lousy compared to zero percent.  They want the middle class to think somebody else is paying the freight.  That's why they have those phoney high tax rates that don't raise much money.  It's to fool the middle class.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it is talking point, and it works for the populist.  Let me bring in Dagen McDowell on this, because we hear this every time we go into the tax discussion and we have a Democrat on which takes out another one of those talking points on taxes, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And I want to say that Senator Kamala Harris said that the first thing -- she said it last night, in the town hall, he first thing she do is to cut taxes for the middle class.  Well, roughly half this country pays no net federal income tax, number one, and the Republicans just did that particularly, doubling the standard deduction.</p><p>So, I don't know who she's going to cut taxes for.  But this is the ruse and this is the big liberal lie that all of these big new welfare state initiatives, whether it's green energy, even single payer, it's all going to be paid for by the super rich.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And that it's not going to be -- that the paying won't be spread across every person in this country to fund this welfare state.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And by the way, the numbers don't add up even if you tax all the rich, you're not going to get the amount of money you need for this green deal, Grover.</p><p>NORQUIST:  You don't even balance the budget if you do that, never mind half money for new things.  Look, the big difference between United States and Denmark, United States and Sweden, it's not how much money higher income people pay, it's what happens to middle-income people.</p><p>Denmark, Finland, Sweden, the tax rate on middle income people is 10, 15, 20 points higher than an American middle class person.  And, you add to that the value added tax.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NORQUIST:  The difference between United States and Europe is how heavily taxed middle income people are, and they have those (INAUDIBLE) high rates that very few people pay, to make people in the middle class think that they are getting a deal.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Speaking of middle income tax -- a lot of Democrats want a carbon tax, gasoline tax and even some big American business.  That's the way to address the issue of climate change.  Do you see any path towards a carbon tax that would be acceptable to your point --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I guess, but real quick, Grover.</p><p>NORQUIST:  No.  No, absolutely not.  And the reason is, you can look at Washington State, very deep blue Washington State.  They have twice had it on the ballot and twice defeated a carbon dioxide tax, gasoline taxes lose overwhelmingly.  This is too obvious tax on middle-income people.  It's a loser up.  They are having this fight in -- our dear friends in France or loggerhead down the subject.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We know how that played out.</p><p>NORQUIST:  We had the Ontario government and the Alberta government collapsed as a result of this, and three times, in Australia.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Grover, thank you.  Yes.</p><p>NORQUIST:  Bad politics and lousy economics.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Grover, thank you for the facts, we appreciate it, Grover Norquist, joining us there.</p><p>Five officers injured in a shooting in Texas, meanwhile, Cheryl Casone in New York, with the details, there.  Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  That's right, Maria.  Four officers were shot and another officer suffered a knee injury in Houston.  They were serving a search warrant at a suspected drug house.  Police say two of them were hit in the neck.  Those officers are in critical but stable condition.  Two suspects were killed at the scene.</p><p>Well, a key E.U. negotiator, warning the risk of Britain leaving the European Union without a deal, is very high, as parliament votes on amendments in Theresa May's exit plan today.  Lawmakers set to consider more than 10 different amendments before taking votes.  That's going to be at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>And those votes come after May's plan to leave the European Union was overwhelmingly rejected earlier this month, a lot of those votes against her from her own party.</p><p>Well, Americans will be betting an estimated $6 billion on the Super Bowl, that's according to the survey by the American Gaming Association.  About 22.7 million U.S. adults plan to place a bet on the upcoming Atlanta game, of those bets, 94.47 percent, reportedly illegal, but let the games begin, Maria, and those are your headlines.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Be there to watch it all, front-row seat.</p><p>CASONE:  I'm there for you, Maria.  I've got surprises for you, coming up.  You're going to love them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK, looking forward to it.  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, crisis in Venezuela to take a look at, new sanctions have been placed on the country's oil.  Plus, National Security Advisor, John Bolton, may have inadvertently revealed the administration's next move.  Why his notes are raising eyebrows this morning.</p><p>Then, farming in America, why farmers are being forced to rent water.  That's up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A look at some of the big headlines across America this morning.  The Chicago Tribune reporting on the Pension Agency criticizing Sears Chairman Eddie Lampert's plan to acquire the bankrupt retailer.  The article explaining that the agency sets to takeover Sears.  Pensions objects to the bid, calling it the final fulfillment of a year-long's scheme to deprive Sears and its creditors of assets and its employees of jobs while lining Lampert's on owns pockets.</p><p>The Daily Camera in Colorado, reporting on how Boulder County farmers are increasingly renting water.  The report explains how ownership from agricultural interests has dropped from 85 percent in the late 1950s to just 30 percent.  The water increasingly moving to municipal control.</p><p>And the Mercury News writing that how in one California city you can text 911 for emergency help.  According to the paper, the police department there announced that the service is now available in the city.  It is meant to help people who are hearing or voice impaired.  The police are also recommending that you not send emojis.  Well, yes, I would think not.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  What are we coming to?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  My God, but it is good that you can text 911.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  That's a good step, just don't text person emoji.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, crisis in Venezuela new sanctions placed on the country's oil, plus National Security Advisor John Bolton may have inadvertently revealed the administration's next move, why his notes on his legal pad are raising eyebrows this morning?  We're breaking that down when we come right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A framework for peace.  The U.S. and Taliban negotiators making a preliminary on key issues to end the war in Afghanistan -- the longest war in American history.  The two top points American troop withdrawal and insurgence vowing to end terrorist attacks abroad, that's according to the Wall Street Journal.  Many hurdles remain to ensure the peace is in place.  Joining me right now is Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst, General Jack Keane.  General, it's always a pleasure to see you.</p><p>GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST:  Good to see you, Maria, and welcome to Washington again.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  And what do you think about this?  I mean, are we supposed to be trusting the Taliban?</p><p>KEANE:  No, we can never ever trust the Taliban, that doesn't mean that we can't have a treaty with them.  But here's what I think is going on, a couple of things have changed: one is the Taliban in the last couple of years have gone all out as we have so dramatically reduced our forces, thinking that they will going to be able to overthrow the regime, because the only thing the United States is really doing is training and assisting the ground forces -- no longer doing the fighting, however provide an air power.  That didn't work.  They retook some territory but never took capitals or provinces and they never took -- they never able to secure a province.  So, what has happened?  The war stalemated.  The Taliban cannot take over the government and the government cannot defeat Taliban, even with our assistance.</p><p>Second thing, and this is crucial, Pakistan has gotten involved in this in a way they've never have before.  They forced the Taliban to go to the peace negotiation table, why?  Pakistan knows it's no longer in national interest to keep this thing stalemated.  There's growing al-Qaeda and growing ISIS presence in Afghanistan which gives the Pakistanis some concern.  So, those are the new things that are happening.  That's why the negotiations have some momentum.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's the thing, though.  I mean, so many people were worried when the president said: we were withdrawing the troops.  And where do you stand on that now?  I mean, do you feel better about it given this peace deal?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, let me answer it this way -- I mean, it is an essential question: the Taliban themselves, we are trying to get an agreement with them that, one, they'll stop trying to overthrow the government and number two, they'll power share with them and also, they will assist in taking down the al-Qaeda and the ISIS.  I don't think we can trust them to do that, based on the fact that they provided safe haven for Osama bin Laden for almost 10 years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  So, what do we do?</p><p>KEANE:  So, we leave in place, after we bring out the troops that are providing the training and assistance.  We leave in place a counterterrorism force and an intelligence capability indefinitely.  We're doing that in Yemen, we're doing it in Libya and we're doing it in Africa.  The one in Africa is off the coast.  It's a Maritime Joint Task Force.  That is what we need to do, that is the guaranty against the Taliban because the issue in Afghanistan has always been, we would never intervene in the civil war in Afghanistan between the northern alliance and Taliban for one reason only, we didn't evade, because they attacked the United States.  That's the reason we're there.  We don't want that to happen again and we cannot trust the Taliban to provide that guarantee for us.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, let me move on and ask you about sanctions on the Venezuelan oil industry.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin who will be here shortly this morning along with Security Adviser John Bolton, explain the decision in a briefing yesterday and issued warning for disputed President Nicolas Maduro.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN BOLTON, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR:  The president has made it very clear on this -- on this matter that all options are on the table.</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY:  There's no reason why these resources shouldn't be used for the economic benefit of the people there.  There's no reason for the poverty and the starvation and the humanitarian crisis.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to this announcement yesterday?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, increased pressure on Maduro regime is certainly a welcome thing.  I mean, this really comes down to the loyalty of the military to Maduro.  As long as that loyalty is there, it's unlikely that Maduro is going the leave.  If that loyalty starts to fall apart, I hope we're working a 'plan b', which is engineering right now some kind of exit path for Maduro, where he can go into exile with recriminations in Venezuela.  The Reagan administration did this very successfully on Ferdinand Marcos, back in 1986, overwhelming popular opposition to him, hundreds of thousands of people.  We engineered his exit.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me squeeze in this question before you go general.  This image from the briefing going viral and it shows John Bolton's notepad with the notation: \"5,000 troops to Colombia.\"  Whoa, do you think we should be sending troops to the region?  What do you think about this?  Caught on camera.</p><p>KEANE:  Look, when we deposed Noriega in 1989 operation just cost Panama, 26,000 troops, is what it took.  When we deposed a dictator in Haiti, 28,000.  The ease of troops that would only be in there, move into Venezuela, if there's a problem at the embassy to our diplomat.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How significance is revealing such a secret?</p><p>KEANE:  I think he'd probably wanted to reveal it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  General Jack Keane, good to see you sir.  Thank you so much.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Show: MORNINGS WITH MARIA][Date: January 29, 2019][Time: 07:00:00][Tran: 012902cb.231][Type: SHOW][Head: Interview with Rep.

Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo coming to you live this morning from Washington, D.C.  It is Tuesday, January 29th.</p><p>Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>It is a busy day on the earnings calendar this morning.  3M among the Dow components reporting their fourth quarter.  The company cut its forecast for 2019.  Pfizer also cut this morning.  The stock under pressure this morning after the guidance came in below expectations.  Pfizer shares down almost 2 percent.  3M down two-thirds of a percent.</p><p>The big one to watch after the close tonight -- Apple.  We've got everything you need to know as Apple prepares to report its quarterly numbers.</p><p>Rising tensions meanwhile with China.  The U.S. has brought charges against Huawei as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin sounding optimistic on the state of the negotiations so far.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY:  I think there's been significant movement.  And we're working through what are still very complicated issues.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'll be sitting down with Secretary Mnuchin this morning at 8:00 a.m. Eastern.  Join us live as the Treasury Secretary will join the program, coming up.</p><p>Markets are under pressure this morning.  Futures pointing to a lower opening for the broader averages although right now it is more like a flat showing than lower.</p><p>The Dow Industrials are up 3 points right now.  S&amp;P 500 pretty much flat, up a quarter point.  And the Nasdaq is down 4 points.  It's been back and forth on futures this after declines across the board yesterday, of course.</p><p>Stocks finished off of the lows of the day but nonetheless, the Dow Industrials were down 209 points, almost 1 percent.  S&amp;P was down 20.  The Nasdaq was down 79, better than 1 percent lower.</p><p>Global markets this morning.  Take a look at European indices, higher across the board.  This right here, this is the high of the morning.  FT 100 up 1.5 percent, 97 points higher.  CAC 40 in Paris up 39 points, almost 1 percent.  And the DAX index in Germany up about 20 points right now.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets were little changed, pretty much across the board as you can see.</p><p>Well, the date is official now with the government back open, President Trump will give his State of the Union address one week from today.  We're taking a closer look at the fallout from the shutdown including the cost to the economy.</p><p>Snapchat's about-face.  Take a look, the social media service eyeing a major change to better compete with Instagram.  We'll tell you all about it coming up.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning.  And joining me to break it all down -- Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell in New York; the \"Wall Street Journal's\" global economics editor Jon Hilsenrath here in D.C. with me; and the American Conservative Union chairman, Matt Schlapp.  Great to see you -- guys.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Great to be here.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen -- good morning to you.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning.  We were talking about the shutdown.  So it's over for the time being.</p><p>The Democrats have actually been hurt by it as well.  Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows that positive feelings about the Democratic Party have fallen to 35 percent this month.  That's down 4 percentage points since December.  And that is essentially in line with the positive feelings that people have about Republicans.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean that's a really good point because the President really did not get hurt certainly on his base, from his base, by the shutdown.  What do you guys think?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Two things.  First is that the President's base was actually energized that he would make a spending fight.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Remember, immigration is a spending fight because if he can stop illegal immigration or reduce it, you don't have all these social services costs.</p><p>But the second thing is, the President's brand is that he will fight, he will fight harder than any politician on the field and he reiterated that brand.  So if he can increase that reputation, I think it appeals to Independents.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They said dig in.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  But isn't his brand also -- it's about fighting and continuing to fight and winning.  And he didn't win the wall in this case.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  I don't agree with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We don't know if he won the wall yet.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  There's three steps to this - -</p><p>HILSENRATH:  In this case, right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  In this case.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  -- there's three really important things.  Number one, the bill he signed has $1.3 billion in barrier funding annualized.</p><p>Number two, he's got to exhaust all legislative efforts if he's going to go the emergency route in order to have a good case in court.</p><p>And number three, the American people when it comes to immigration, he is on the right side of this policy argument.  And Democrats who are against border security, they're going to be sorry for this eventually.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  But you know what.  You better be --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, go ahead -- Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- but you better be careful about what you do and this goes to all politicians because I was flying on Friday and that was an utter nightmare.  If you want to anger everybody in the electorate, you pull another fast one like that where people are grounded and you've got an hour and-a-half plane flight where you're at 8,000 feet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But who are you blaming?</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They were blaming (INAUDIBLE) and blaming the Democrats because --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They were blaming everybody.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- Nancy Pelosi dug in.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They were blaming everybody.  But TSA agents down in Raleigh, Durham were going to food banks because they were spending what little money they had on gas trying to get to and from work.  So again, I don't care who is responsible for it.  They're all responsible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, businesses did start, you know, putting the uncertainty out there, sitting on cash, making decisions later.  We know.  I mean the SEC closed, can't get any IPOs through.  FDA closed, got to worry about obvious food shortages or food issues.</p><p>So we were beginning to see some real impact.  And Dagen saw it firsthand at the airport.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  That's true.  But if you're a federal employee in this town, let's face it, you make a little bit of a bargain.  Yes, every year you might have to go through a shutdown with your salary.</p><p>But you know, the other thing, Maria, that we don't talk about, it's almost impossible to fire a federal employee.  There's some pretty cushy gigs --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good point.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  -- in THIS town where you basically have an insurance policy against ever getting fired unless you do something just awful.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  And you can read all the GAO reports that's backed that up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're talking about all of that this morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But there are people barely making ends meet who are trying to drive to work, and spending all their money on gasoline and going to food banks who were working for the TSA and not getting paid.</p><p>And when the Republicans stop thinking about them and start talking about the workers who aren't needed, the ones who are furloughed you have really missed the boat.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, maybe.  But how about the fact that we've got a border wall in Nancy Pelosi's state?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that immoral, the wall that separates Tijuana from San Diego --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  But --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- is that immoral?  I don't think so.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They need to start asking all of these Democrats who think that the wall is immoral or don't want to fund it, ok, let's take down the walls that are there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's how you put --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will the three million people in Tijuana assimilate with the three million people in San Diego if that wall is torn down?  I think so.  And we're going to talk about that this morning.</p><p>We've got a big show this morning from D.C., live.  Coming up Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is here, live.  National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow has a thing or two to say about the CBO protections about what exactly the impact is on the economy from that shutdown.</p><p>House Minority Leader and California Congressman Kevin McCarthy will walk us through what these next three weeks look like with his colleagues in terms of this negotiating on border wall funding.</p><p>Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell is here.</p><p>Along with AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka.</p><p>Don't miss a moment of it.  A big two hours coming up.</p><p>And we kick it off this hour right now with markets.  Futures are pointing to a flat opening this morning amid all of this uncertainty over China trade, earnings.  It's an enormous week this week.</p><p>This after stocks finished to the downside yesterday on the China growth fears, the weak guidance from Nvidia and Caterpillar as well, and of course these worries about what happens with China and the U.S.  There's conversations happening tomorrow.</p><p>Joining us right now is the founder, CEO and chief investment strategist at Mainstay Capital Management David Kudla.  David -- good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>DAVID KUDLA, FOUNDER/CEO/CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, MAINSTAY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So we've been talking about what a week this is with the fourth quarter earnings coming out.  That's been pretty much driving the story.  We have a jobs report coming out at the end of the week on Friday.  Brexit discussions, the vote today.  U.S./China discussions tomorrow.  A fourth quarter GDP number.  How do you want to invest with all of this?</p><p>KUDLA:  I think investors should be looking at stocks right now that they want to own.  We've been invested through -- the past month has been very good for stock investors.  13 percent rise through Friday from the lows of December 24th.  And that's in both growth stocks and value stocks, so a broad market advance.</p><p>We're going to see some give and take here now after this nice advance of last month but investors should be picking, you know, their points here, have their list out on stocks they want to own.  We look for a good 2019 for stock investors.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is it good news, Jon Hilsenrath, that the Fed gave us a pivot that we know that the Fed is on pause right now and that we know that they're even ready to consider slowing down the unwind of the bond portfolio?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  I don't think it's good news.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I think it shows that the Fed is becoming less confident about how strong and sustainable the economy is.  I mean it is a sign that inflation isn't picking up and that's good news.  But you see some real trepidation coming out of the Fed right now with the global economy slowing, with markets being unstable and volatile.</p><p>I think the Fed is a little worried about the outlook and that shouldn't really give us a lot of encouragement.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about that, David?  I mean the economy's slowing.</p><p>KUDLA:  But Jon this -- yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLA:  But John -- the important thing here is what happened in the fourth quarter is we had mixed messages out of fed chair Jerome Powell.  We had on October 3rd we were far away from neutral.  Then by November we were close to neutral rates.  Then on the 16th in the Fed meeting they were going to do what's right no matter what.</p><p>Then he came in on January 4th and finally said we're going to be considerate of market and economic conditions and now we're seeing a more consistent and accommodative message out of the Fed.  And that's very important for the markets.</p><p>That's music to the market's ears and that's why we've now seen a sustained advance.  So the markets and investors are now looking at a Fed that seems as though they are going to be considerate of or accommodative or take into account what's happening with the markets, with the economy, and not just normalize rates for the sake of normalizing rates.</p><p>They won't have $50 billion rolling off the balance sheet on auto pilot and they won't raise rates just to raise rates to get to a normalized rate structure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that was the worry in the fourth quarter.</p><p>KUDLA:  -- in pause like in 2016 if the market and economy warrants it.  That's important.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That was they worry in the fourth quarter -- that they were on auto pilot-- Jon.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  Yes, I make two points.</p><p>KUDLA:  That drove volatility in the fourth quarter, the Fed.  .</p><p>HILSENRATH:  David makes a really important point, you know.  So this has been Jerome Powell's first year at the Fed.  He's had a bit of a honeymoon with the market.  And then what the market has discovered in the last month or two is that Mr. Powell, you know, he kind of prides himself on being a plain-spoken communicator but his communication has confused a lot of people in the market.  And he's really had to do a lot of corrections over the last few weeks --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- so that raised some questions about him.</p><p>But the other thing about -- you know, the market wants to see the Fed on an easier path.  Ok.  But the underlying message there is that this economy can't sustain very high rates.</p><p>So it doesn't send a really encouraging message about economic growth and the economic outlook when we see that the Fed is starting to recognize it just can't sustain a tighter monetary policy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But look, we're getting the news from the companies themselves with the fourth quarter numbers coming out.  Verizon just reported mixed earnings.  They beat on earnings, but they missed on revenue.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Caterpillar.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Technology reporting late today, Apple.  And we heard from Apple already.  Facebook, Amazon -- all reporting this week, Microsoft.  It's going to be a big week for technology.  And of course you mentioned Caterpillar.  That was the big kahuna yesterday that really set the tone for the markets because Caterpillar is a great indicator of economic activity across the world, in particular China.</p><p>So stay on earnings for a second, David.  Give me your take on technology.  Because you've got Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft coming out this week.</p><p>KUDLA:  Well, you know, tech stocks got beat up very bad in the fourth quarter.  They've come back in this rally and we think that tech stocks have further to go.</p><p>Look, we think that investors should stay with tech stocks.  We have an opportunity here to add value stocks to the portfolio.  Cyclicals came into 2019 at their lowest valuation relative to the S&amp;P 500 ever.</p><p>So investors now can diversify their portfolio in an opportunistic way, holding both growth stocks.  Those tech stocks that we think still have some rebound and some further runway ahead of them, and by adding value stocks that are very opportunistic.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  David -- it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>KUDLA:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Still bullish on this market.  David Kudla joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, the State of the Union is back on, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi extended officially the invitation to President Trump to do the State of the Union in the House Chamber.  He accepted the offer.</p><p>Plus we're taking a look at the enormous cost of the shutdown, what exactly is the number?  A lot of people say it wasn't very much at all.</p><p>Then, Snapchat's unthinkable change, how the photo sharing app is attempting to compete with Instagram by changing a key feature.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>New revelations in the sexual misconduct claims against the former CEO of Wynn Resorts.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with headlines now in New York -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Maria.  The \"Wall Street Journal\" is reporting that executives at Wynn Resort ignored allegations of sexual misconduct by Steve Wynn over more than a decade.  According to a regulator's report Wynn was accused of sexually assaulting or harassing salon workers, cocktail servers and flight attendants who worked for his company.</p><p>Under a proposed settlement, the Nevada Gaming Control Board won't try to revoke Wynn's regulatory licenses but Wynn is going to pay a fine.  Steve Wynn has denied any claims of misconduct.  There's a one year chart of Wynn's in front of you right there.</p><p>Well, Snapchat has named Lara Sweet as its interim CFO.  This is another shift in leadership at Snap as the company has lost several high profile employees over the last year.  Meanwhile Snap is reportedly considering allowing longer lasting or even permanent videos on Snapchat.  It will apply the Snap shared publicly on this story's features.  Snap is down 52 percent from one year ago.  There's that chart for you.</p><p>Well, Porsche is speeding past Tesla in a fast charging race.  The car maker says it new Porsche Taycan is going to be able to add more than 60 miles of charge in just four minutes.  That will be the fastest available today, exceeding Tesla's super charging stations which needs about 30 minutes to charge a vehicle's battery to at least 80 percent.  Charging times are a key selling point obviously for these car makers and now Porsche is giving Taycan owners three years of free charging.</p><p>And obviously we're going to be hearing from Tesla this week, Maria.  Earnings are coming out from Elon Musk and company.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Cheryl -- thank you so much.</p><p>Coming up next, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi challenged over her words describing a border wall as immoral.  We will break it down when we come back.</p><p>Then support on the links, fans rallying around a pro golfer whose two shot penalty was deemed unfair.  More on that.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Keeping America safe, the government is back open but the focus now is whether President Trump can make a deal with Democratic leadership on funding for the border wall.</p><p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has called it immoral, any wall is immoral.  But her home state of California protects the southern border in some places with an actual wall -- the wall separating Tijuana and San Diego.</p><p>Joining me right now is Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell.  And the last time you were on you said you wanted to look at this again.  Congresswoman -- it's good to see you.</p><p>REP. DEBBIE DINGELL (D), MICHIGAN:  It's good to see you.  Welcome to Washington.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.</p><p>What's your take on this?  I mean can Nancy Pelosi really get away with calling a wall immoral when she has a wall in her own state, separating Tijuana from San Diego?</p><p>DINGELL:  Here is what I think is going to happen.  You've got strong countries (ph), both sides of the aisle, both houses.  They're going to go into that room and they want to cut a deal that's going to keep our nation safe.  I don't think anybody wants to see what we just went through for 35 days.</p><p>It hurt the economy.  It hurt -- and I do believe -- this is going to sound corny but I don't -- you know, why do we point -- why do we need to have a Trump win, a Pelosi win.  We need an American win.</p><p>So I'm hoping they're going to go in that room.  I've talked to my colleagues on both sides.  I've talked to Roy Blunt.  I've talked to all my Democratic colleagues in the House.  They want to win.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DINGELL:  They want to go in and put together a package that's going to keep --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So how do you win?  What's the position in terms of wall funding?  Because they may very well -- your colleagues may very well come back and say ok, here's $5 billion towards border security, not a dime toward a wall.</p><p>DINGELL:  I don't know -- if people are really working together, that may not happen.  You know, there may be money, if there are appropriate places for a wall or fence or --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is there a movement within your party, do you think, among your colleagues that they feel that, yes, some money should go for an actual barrier?</p><p>DINGELL:  I think what I hear among my colleagues is let's go into a room and do something that makes sense.  Let's come up with -- we need to -- I've said this to you a million times.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DINGELL:  We need to strengthen our borders at both sides.  Everybody talks about the southern border.  I've got this northern border too which just had a huge human trafficking problem again in the last few --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But there are areas of the southern border that are very dense.  In other words like when you just look at the wall in Nancy's state and that is three million people on one side in Tijuana, three million people on the other side in San Diego.  If you tear that wall down -- I mean isn't it obvious many of the people on the Tijuana side will assimilate into the United States?</p><p>DINGELL:  Then let me ask you this question.  Build a wall, tear down a wall -- are there structures that are working that are in place?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  .</p><p>DINGELL:  So that's -- what I do think we need drones.  We need to fill the 3,000 open patrol --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's common ground, both sides believe in that.</p><p>DINGELL:  Both agree --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Technology and drones -- definitely.</p><p>DINGELL:  We need technology.  We need to make these ports safer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Specifically in a dense area, like Tijuana/San Diego, drones wouldn't work.  I mean maybe you want that in addition to a wall.  When you have such a dense area, where there's three million people on one side of the wall and three m million on the other, don't you need an actual barrier?</p><p>DINGELL:  But they are going to go in this room.  There are people that know what they're doing.  They're people -- they're senior people that have been on homeland security, people from the areas that are impacted --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think they're going to deal?  We won't shut down the government again?</p><p>DINGELL:  I pray to God, we never shut down the government.  Not only do I pray to God that doesn't come out of conference but you're going to see Republicans and Democrats working together.  We'll get --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This whole wall issue, Congresswoman, sort of underscores what's going on I think in both parties.  Now you've got former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz seeing an opening as a result of the radicalness on both sides.</p><p>He's facing backlash on his first stop for his book tour last night.  It was his first public appearance after announcing a possible Independent presidential run.  It did not go smoothly.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire (EXPLETIVE DELETED).  Go back to (INAUDIBLE) on Twitter.  Go back to Davos with the other billionaire elites who think they know how to run the world.  That's not what the country needs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  You know, I give you a lot of credit just being in politics, by the way.</p><p>Schultz is also being criticized by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, billionaire.  He tweeted this, \"In 2020 the great likelihood is that an Independent would just split the anti-Trump vote and end up reelecting the President.  That's a risk.  I refused to run in 2016 and we can't afford it right now.</p><p>Congresswoman -- do you think an Independent run is viable?  Do you think an Independent run from Schultz would hurt the Democrats?</p><p>DINGELL:  I think it's viable.  He has the money to spend it.  But I think he would hurt the Democrats.  I'm fearful that I am -- I'm trying to step back.  I'm not getting any candidate I want to see who is going to emerge, who's got people skills.</p><p>But this is dangerous.  And as you know, told you two years ago, Donald Trump could become president.  Nobody believed me.  You all thought I was crazy.  You may not have but most people did.</p><p>And I still think he could get reelected.  And if we do not run a strong campaign and we don't have somebody like that that pulls votes off --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  One of the issues is the messaging of what the platform is.  So what do you think the Democratic candidate for 2020 should have as their platform?  What's most important?</p><p>DINGELL:  You know what we didn't do and one of the reasons I believe firmly that President Trump became President Trump.  One, people are tired of partisan bickering.  They're tired of seeing things not get done in Washington.</p><p>There are a lot of people that are hurting in this country, just working men and women who want to know that we actually care about them.  They're scared about healthcare.  They're scared about escalating drug costs.  There's -- look at our --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So healthcare should be the platform?</p><p>DINGELL:  it's one piece of it.  Infrastructure, let's create jobs.  What are we going to do about education?  Trade?</p><p>Now, the President -- you want to know why he won Michigan?  Trade.  They're tired of bad trade deals that ship jobs overseas.  We don't have a level playing field.  The President's trade policy is all over the place.</p><p>It's not consistent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you going to vote for the ratification of USMCA?</p><p>DINGELL:  I don't call it USMC.  I call it NAFTA 2.0.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you going to vote for ratification.</p><p>DINGELL:  I haven't decided yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is on your plate now in the next month.</p><p>DINGELL:  Very much on my plate.  And talk to Lighthizer about it all the time.  But I'm not voting for any bill that doesn't have and acting legislation that keeps more manufacturing from going to Mexico.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wasn't that one of the key things of this new law?</p><p>DINGELL:  But Blazer still went to --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Keeping jobs here.</p><p>DINGELL:  Blazers went to Mexico in July.  I'm not seeing any more American cars go to Mexico and get built for $1.50 to $3.50 and then gets shipped back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you want a change before you vote for it?</p><p>DINGELL:  He knows how I feel.  I'm not -- one of the more likely people to vote for it but I'm not voting for it in the form that it's in right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.   We'll leave it there.</p><p>Congresswoman -- it's good to see you.</p><p>DINGELL:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.  Congresswoman Debbie Dingell joining us here.</p><p>Coming up, the longest government shutdown in American history is over.  But another shutdown threat is on the horizon.  We will talk about the next three weeks, what it looks like with House Minority Leader, Kevin McCarthy.  He's up next.</p><p>Then you've got a friend again.  The new teaser trailer for \"Toy Story 4\" drops with a big surprise.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Tuesday, January 29th.  Your top stories right now at 7:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Earnings season in full swing this morning for the fourth quarter.  Several Dow components reporting their fourth quarter this morning.  Verizon reported a mixed quarter earlier this hour.  Pfizer and 3M also under pressure this morning as you can see.  3M up three percent, although Pfizer and Verizon down better than one percent.</p><p>Rising tensions with China continuing, the U.S. bringing charges against Chinese telecom company Huawei as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning between the two nations.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will be joining me as my special guest this morning at the top of the hour, 8:00 a.m. Eastern.  Join us for that talk on China and the economy as we break it all down with the Treasury secretary.</p><p>Markets this morning are hovering around the flat line.  Take a look.  Dow Industrials up 20 points right now, 26 higher.  The S&amp;P 500 is down by almost one point and the NASDAQ down about three points.</p><p>All this after the major indices finished lower yesterday across the board at 04:00 on Wall Street.  Dow industrials were down 208 points and then actually was off of the lows of the -- of the day, down almost one percent at the close.  S&amp;P 500 gave up 21 points, that was three-quarters of one percent.  And the NASDAQ was down 79 points, better than one percent lower.</p><p>In Europe this morning, a mixed story, actually mostly higher.  FT-100 at the high of the morning right here, up 1-1/4 percent, 83 points higher, ahead of the British vote on the U.K. leaving the E.U.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is up 42 points, almost one percent higher and the DAX Index in Germany higher by 25, quarter of a percent higher there.</p><p>Asian markets mostly quiet overnight.  Take a look, as you can see, it was pretty much across the board.</p><p>$100,000 penalty, how one misstep cost a professional golfer big time.  The outcry, coming up.</p><p>And Woody and Buzz Lightyear are back, the new teaser trailer for \"Toy Story 4\" is out and it marks the return of one character after 20 years.  We will bring it to you.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning.  But first, our top story this half an hour, shutdown showdown, the government open for business again after the last -- at least for the next three weeks, rather.  But the main issue, funding the wall has not been resolved and the White House is not letting it go.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  What I do know is that if they don't come back with a deal, that means Democrats get virtually nothing.  That will make the president and force him to have to take executive action that does not give Democrats the things that they want.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is the House Minority leader, Congressman Kevin McCarthy.  Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you.</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  Thanks for having me back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So, what do the next three weeks look like?  Take us through these negotiating.  Do you expect any money for the wall?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  I expect us to solve this problem in the end.  What's interesting here is the whole time speaker Pelosi said I couldn't negotiate anything until you open up government.  The president put the public first and said OK, let's go through, I'll give you three weeks.</p><p>Now Wednesday, we'll have the conference committee, the senators and the congressional members' appropriation sit down and we'll see if they're serious about it, if they're willing to do something.  Because I believe Nancy Pelosi is out of step with her own party.  If you look at her number two, Steny Hoyer.  He said of course, that walls are not immoral, and that he believes some fencing involved.  From her Agricultural secretary to her Agricultural chair to our Armed Services chair, they both believe in a wall too.  Her Agriculture chairman said give Trump the money.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and she continues to say that it's immoral which I find incredible given the fact she has a wall in her own state.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  As my state too.  You know what I find --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And your state too, exactly.  California.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  You know what I find immoral?  When you really talk about this, this is about stopping human trafficking.  In 2016, they stopped more than 2,000 individuals involved in that.  I think it's immoral that you would allow that to continue.  I don't believe anybody in America that says they support border security believes that there is no such thing as some barrier.</p><p>And the president said, he does not a -- he does not want a wall from sea to shining sea.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  He just believes in the area you need some form of barrier and he's correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, where do you think are the most important areas that you would need the wall?  I mean, we talked earlier about this wall in your state, Tijuana, San Diego where it's very dense, three million people on one side, three million people on the other.  Can you make the case that that dense area is elsewhere where that's why the president is so stuck on having this wall there?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  And it's not the president saying, it's the experts.  The president sat down with the experts and they said this is what we need to be able to secure our border.</p><p>So in certain areas, like in San Diego, we stopped illegal movement by more than 95 percent.  You look at Yuma, Arizons, El Paso another -- El Paso became one of the safest cities in the nation after being able to put it through.  That's what we need, in certain parts of the country along the border, you need a barrier.  In other parts you could put the drones in this part area.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what are you expecting to give on?  And what -- do you think they're going to offer the $5.7 billion that the president wants for border security?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  But we're arguing over one-tenth of one percent of the budget.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a great point.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  The Democrats have voted for a wall before.  But now that the president brings forward what the experts want, they say no.  That is what's so confusing to me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, what -- why is this so important for the president right now?  Going into 2020, I mean, is she seeing this as a campaign promise and that's why he doesn't -- she won't agree to it.  Because I don't know how she can call it immoral, given the wall in her own state, your own state.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Again, it's such a little price to pay for so much more security when you look at the human trafficking.  Think of the number of lives that we will save from this process if we have a secure border.</p><p>But what's more importantly, it's the president that sat down and tried to be reasonable, find common ground.  He's the one who brought DACA into it.</p><p>And let's not forget, speaker Pelosi just a year ago holds the record for the longest speech on the floor, eight hours, over one issue, DACA, which she shut the government down over.  And now she thinks that's not important?  I think those people are important as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think that this -- a negotiation, an agreement will include a DACA deal?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  It could.  It doesn't have to.  But because the Democrats and speaker Pelosi have been saying no.  The president said he was willing to go there, three more years of DACA for a portion of the border security that the experts are asking for.  I just find her out of step with her own party.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, there seems to be a movement within the party, even some of the newer congress people coming in, fresher faces saying you know what, yes, we do need border security and we do need the money.  So, are they going head to head?  I mean, are they -- do they even have a voice?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  They don't even have a voice.  Because remember, she has so much power.  She will not allow the vote to come up.  I believe inside the conference we could come up with an agreement.  The question is, will speaker Pelosi even allow that to be voted on the floor?  If we had a vote on the floor, I believe it would pass.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think that the president will allow the government to shut down again?  I mean, is the president really prepared to have another government shutdown if he doesn't get the money?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Look, I think the president's going to try to find a way to solve this one way or another.  I don't know that shutting the government down solves it.  I there's other ways to do that the president can.  I know he firmly believes in a legislative process.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Should he call for a national emergency?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  He has the power to do that.  I think the best road forward right now is a legislative agreement.  And what's so interesting to me, I'd listened to these Democrats celebrate Nancy Pelosi.  You celebrated someone that got you status quo.  They're still a DACA problem, they're still a border security problem.</p><p>And government is designed to find common ground and compromise.  The president was the one person looking reasonable in all these discussions.  I know the president's committed to this.  He will get the border secure one way or another.  He's giving the Democrats an opportunity.  He gave them an opportunity all along this discussion.  They said then open up the government, they'll discuss it.  So he did that and gave them a three week time.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean, I think this whole thing, the government shutdown and the constant resist upsets people.  I mean, you have to wonder if in fact -- you know, she keeps resisting everything that the president wants, if the people will turn on her.  Because people want to see you guys get something done.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Yes, she is celebrating status quo.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  That's not where we need to be --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me move on and ask you about 2010, congressman.  Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz thinking about running for office.  He was at a book signing last night in New York and he was heckled over his bid.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump.  You egotistical billionaire (INAUDIBLE).  Go back to getting ratioed on Twitter.  Go back to Davos with the other billionaire elites who think they know how to run the world.  That's not what the country needs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This heckler not the only one weighing in.  Michael Bloomberg former mayor of New York City also told Schultz not to run as an independent.  He said this, given the strong pull of partisanship and the realities of the electoral college system, there's no way an independent can win.  That is truer today than ever before.  Is that where we are, an independent can't win, congressman?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  No, I think it's Bloomberg upset.  Because remember, he went from a Republican to an independent to a Democrat and he just spent $120 million giving to the Democrats so they can win the majority in the House and he doesn't want his money to be wasted, so he doesn't want competition.</p><p>Look, I think there's ample opportunity for an independent to get in this race, only because the Democrats are now become social Democrats.  They're talking about a 70 percent tax rate.  They're talking about these green deals.  They're talking about socialism.  If you listen to what some of these new Democrats say, they think Venezuela's problem is not because they're a socialist country, it's because of sanctions.  They're so out of step.  They are putting letters in to help those who want to go sign up for ISIS, to be easy on them to the judge.  I mean, I have -- this is not the America we live in, and that's the difference.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  This party is so out of step and I think you'll find a lot of moderate Democrats who say I want somebody else who could talk about this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, that's why a number of moderate Democrats can't really get the OK from the party leadership because they're not left enough.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  This new socialist Democrat Party has left the Democratic Party.  They are in to -- remember, Bernie Sanders is not registered as a Democrat.  He's registered as a socialist.  AOC does not call herself a Democrat, she calls herself a Democrat socialist.  This party is moving to a whole different place.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Real quick before you go, when the election happened back in November.  You said one of your priorities going to be to get the majority back.  How are you going to do it?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Well, first of all, you've got to make sure you can recruit.  I think, you put the ideas up there.  Ideas should win at the end of the day.  You look at where we are financially in this country.  A lot of that happens to do with the policies that we're able to create, from the tax policy, the battle we had with you human trafficking and other that we were able to do.  I think you're going to find as going directly to, we've got to find a suburban areas to be able to win again in and I think we're going to be very successful.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, it's good to see you.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Congressman Kevin McCarthy, joining us there.</p><p>Still ahead, Richard Trumka AFL-CIO president on the impact of the shutdown on American workers, what he'd like to see, back in a moment with that.</p><p>And then, support on the links, a pro golfer given a big fine and a two-shot penalty which many are calling grossly unfair.  What went wrong, right here.</p><p>Plus, you've got a friend and a big surprise, the trailer for \"Toy Story 4\" drops with a character we haven't seen in 20 years.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Prosecutors resting their case against Joaquin El Chapo Guzman.  Cheryl Casone in New York with details and headlines, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It; must something else, Maria.  The federal government has now rested its case.  They called 56 witnesses.  The trial of the notorious Mexican drug kingpin started back in mid-November.  El Chapo told the trial judge yesterday he will not take the stand in his own defense.  One witness is scheduled to appear for the defense today.  Closing arguments expected to take place tomorrow and Thursday.  Big story, a lot of New Yorkers have been following very closely.</p><p>Well, professional golfer Haotong Li is getting a huge outpouring of support from fellow golfers after losing out on nearly $100,000 Saturday for a minor infraction.  It happened at the Omega Dubai Desert Classic.  Li was on the 18th green when judges accuses caddie of standing too close behind him as he got ready to putt.  Well, the ensuing penalty dropped Li's score from 71 to 73.  And he went from third to 12th.  Tour officials say the correct call was made but acknowledge it was grossly unfair.  They're looking at the giving referees more discretion in cases like this going forward.</p><p>And then, get ready for \"Toy Story 4\".  Pixar is putting out this teaser video, shows the revival of Woody's love interest, Bo Peep.  And she is back with a new, more modern look.  She was last seen in \"Toy Story 2\", back in 1999.  It is now 20 years later, \"Toy Story 4\" is going to be released, Maria, this June .  Those are your headlines from New York, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like it.  Bo Peep.  All right, thank you Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, the lingering effects of the shutdown showdown.  AFL-CIO Richard Trumka will join us to talk about the impact on American workers.  He's up next.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We are focused on the American worker this morning.  White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney saying that the 800,000 federal workers who were not paid twice during the partial government shutdown should receive those checks by the end of this week.</p><p>Joining us right now is American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organization's president, AFL-CIO, Richard Trumka.  It's great to see you, Richard.  Thank you so much for being here.</p><p>RICHARD TRUMKA, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR AND CONGRESS OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION:  Maria, thanks for having me on today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Give us your take on what the impact of the shutdown was.</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, I think there's several impacts.  There's impact on the people and you not only have government workers who get back pay but you have the government contractors who won't get back pay unless something is done.  That was a devastating effect on them.  It had a devastating effect on the economy itself.  $11 billion, although we'll pick some of that back up later in the year.</p><p>But you had a devastating effect on the airline industry where you had people, airline controllers, traffic controllers that were in school that actually just up and left.  They said we're not going to do this anymore (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What could -- what could have been done about it then, Rich?  Because you as the leader that you are and representing so many workers across the country have to be unnerved when you see open borders and illegals coming in and taking your jobs.</p><p>TRUMKA:  Look, that's just not how it works anymore.  I mean, you have people that got laid off from the president's place that have been here 20 years.  They're not taking anybody's job.  What we want to do is make sure every worker in this country has the same rights so that they can't be exploited.</p><p>Because what happens right now with undocumented workers is, they're great when no one's around.  When they try to organize and get a voice, then they start squeezing them.  They start ex -- you know, doing, calling in ICE and different things.</p><p>The idea is if everybody has the same rights, then they can't exploit those people and everybody can actually have a fair playing field.  What happens to American workers -- employers right now, is you have an employer that hires people, makes them work in unfair condition, misclassifies them, underpays them, and they're competing against our employer.  That employer needs to pay everybody the same rate, live by the same working conditions, so that we can all compete.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you're OK with illegals coming in and as long as everybody's treated the same?</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, Maria, it's a -- it's a nice cliche, illegals coming in.  But you know yourself that most people that are here undocumented or illegally came in legally.  So the whole system needs to be addressed.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, but there are apprehensions that we could look at, just in the month of December, just in the month of November, where apprehensions were of illegal immigrants coming in and wanting asylum in the United States.</p><p>TRUMKA:  There's no question that the system is broken.  We need to fix the system and have a path towards citizenship so that those workers that have been here for years and are actually making the economy run, even the president's golf courses and things like that, they have a chance to get citizenship and they work their work there.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Just a question on the golf courses.  As you know, that's the H2B program, people who come here as foreign workers, come under a specified amount of time for DOL.  I think the real question is is that, what happens to all the people, not who have been here who came legally and overstayed the visa, but what about all the people who come every day at the southern border and can cross into our country?  That's really the pernicious problem.  And even on wall, built with American workers, you'd be for that.</p><p>TRUMKA:  But listen, the people that come back and forth, you have Americans that go to Mexico and Mexicans that come to America to work.  I think Mexico --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you don't think there's a problem at the border at all?</p><p>TRUMKA:  I didn't say that.  There is -- there is a problem.  We do need border security.  And no, I don't think that a wall's the answer to it.  Every time someone's tried to build a wall it's not been very successful.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, the one in Tijuana is successful.</p><p>TRUMKA:  Ask the Chinese, ask the French.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The wall -- the wall in Tijuana --</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Ask Tijuana (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tijuana and San Diego, what abut that Richard?</p><p>TRUMKA:  I'm sorry?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The wall, between Tijuana -- separating Tijuana from San Diego, is that successful?</p><p>TRUMKA:  There are places -- there are places probably where it works.  Is that the answer to everything?  No.  Should that have been the reason for a shutdown?  Absolutely not.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  I want -- I want to ask a broader political question.  We've seen in the last two elections that increasingly voters, blue collar voters, voters in manufacturing towns all over America, the kind of rank and file people that you represent are voting for Republicans, they're going for Trump.  Does the AFL-CIO need to realign its own approach to politics in this town, given that more and more of its people are going with people like Donald Trump and his trade policies and the Republican Party?</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, that's a -- that's a question we could talk about two or three hours for.  First of all, we have realigned our politics.  We are issuing -- we're issue oriented right now.  We put an issue out and if a politician supports that issue, then we support them.</p><p>In fact, in this last election we elected two union members to the Senate, three to governorship, 18 to the House of Representative, and 925 to state legislatures, because those workers will go and support our issues.  That's what we try to do.  We find it more and more difficult to find Republicans that actually support us.  Now, the American worker believes that neither the political system --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got to jump.</p><p>TRUMKA:  -- or the economic system works for them.  They want somebody to change the rules.  That's why they voted for Trump.  If he changes the rules to their advantage, some of them will vote for him again.  If he doesn't, he stands a chance of losing those workers and right now he's losing those workers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Richard, thank you so much for joining us.  We appreciate it.  Richard Trumka there.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Show: MORNINGS WITH MARIA][Date: January 29, 2019][Time: 08:00:00][Tran: 012903cb.231][Type: SHOW][Head: Apple Disables Group FaceTime Function That Was Allowing Callers To Listen And View Without Your Consent; British Parliament To Vote On Brexit Amendments; Kudlow on the Economy; Craft Brewers Impacts from the Government Shutdown; Kudlow on China Trade][Sect: News; Domestic][Byline: Maria Bartiromo, Gerri Willis, Ashley Webster, Hillary Vaughn, Dagen McDowell][Guest: Steven Mnuchin, Larry Kudlow, Matt Schlapp, Jon Hilsenrath][Spec: FaceTime; Huawei; Apple; Brexit; Federal Reserve; 3M; Harley-Davidson; Verizon; Oath Media; Channel Inventory; World War II; CBO; Trade Talks; Deregulations; Tax Plan; China Trade; Slowdown; Government Shutdown]</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good Tuesday morning.  Welcome back, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  Live from Washington this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is January 29th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  Earnings in focus.  Investors watching results from several Dow components this morning ahead of the opening bell.  One to watch after the bell tonight -- after the close is Apple.</p><p>Meanwhile, Apple under fire FaceTime hit with a new bug that allows people to eavesdrop on you without your knowledge and even if you don't take the call.  Rising tensions with China, the U.S. brings charges against Chinese telecom company, Huawei as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  The very latest on the state of negotiations with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin coming up.</p><p>Markets are searching for direction this morning.  Take a look at the futures ahead of the open this morning.  Dow industrials picking up speed up 55 points right now, a quarter of a percent higher.  S&amp;P 500 is up two and the NASDAQ right now right now showing a gain of 11 points at the open in about an hour and a half.  This after declines across the board yesterday.  Stocks finished off of the lows, but nonetheless the Dow Industrials gave up 209 points yesterday 4:00, almost one percent lower.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 gave up 21 points, three quarters of a percent lower.  And the NASDAQ was down 79 points.  That was better than one percent lower yesterday.  Global markets this morning are mostly higher.  Take a look at European indices with the FT-100-is at the high of the morning, up 86 points, 1-1/4 percent ahead of the vote on Brexit.  CAC quarante in Paris us up 44 points and the DAX index up 21, fractional gain there.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets were little changed.  Take a look, it was pretty much across the board.  Now, our top story this morning, concerns of a global slowdown.  Last week in Davos I spoke with Bridgewater Associates founder, Ray Dalio, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, and Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey.  Here's what they said about the possibility of an economic slowdown on the horizon.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RAY DALIO, FOUNDER, BRIDGEWATER ASSOCIATES:  Europe has a negative growth and the United States is going to have a negative growth environment.  I don't mean absolute negative, I mean slowing of growth in a material way that could be close to between zero and two percent over the next 18 months.</p><p>BRIAN MOYNIHAN, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, BANK OF AMERICA:  We have the top research firm in the world, and they have done a great job.  And they have the U.S. growing at 2-1/2 percent this year.  The world growing 3-1/2 percent GDP growth.  But that's down from last year.  And so the confusion in the environment right now is a slowdown or is it going in to a recession?</p><p>Nothing we see says it's close to a recession.</p><p>JAMES QUINCEY, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, COCA-COLA:  I think we are in danger of talking ourselves into a problem.  It's just a little bit slower growth.  It's not a recession or a decline.  So we see -- we see a little -- a little softer 2019, maybe a little less tail wind than 2018.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now in a Fox Business exclusive is the treasury secretary of the United States, Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  Great to see you, Secretary.</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, UNITED STATES TREASURY SECRETARY:  Great to see you as well, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.  Your reaction to really what seems like now a unanimous feeling that a slowdown is on the horizon.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, Maria, from everything we see, the U.S. economy is still quite strong.  The companies are doing quite well.  And we see still tremendous investment in capital and human investments.  There's no question that as it relates to Europe and China, there is a slowdown.  We're monitoring that carefully.  But we still see a tremendous opportunity and a lot of capital coming into the U.S.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Federal Reserve basically told us they are on pause.  They may even pause the balance sheet unwind which is also telling us that the Fed is also expecting a slowdown, but do you believe a recession is on the horizon in 2020 even though you're seeing strength and stability so far?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  We see no indications whatsoever of a recession on the horizon.  And from everything we see from speaking to a large across the board businesses, the combination of tax reform, regulatory relief and trade is still has a very strong impact on the U.S. economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And some people are saying that the impact of certainly of trade and tariffs is causing some uncertainty.  So how much of this slowdown that we're expecting later on even if it's not right now is due to what you say you're watching China and Europe and how much of it is uncertainty around the President's tariffs program?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, Maria, as you said, there are people who expect a slowdown but I would just comment a year ago with the projections were 2-1/2 percent.  And we were at three.  We feel very comfortable we're going to hit three for last year.  And we think there's still a very good case for three percent this year.  Now, as it relates to trade, we couldn't be more pleased with the USMCA.  We are looking forward to Congress passing that quickly.</p><p>That's a very important trade deal.  We have two days of talks with China starting tomorrow.  The President is going to be involved in those talks at the conclusion.  We've been updating him.  We have another 30 days after this.  So I think we're making significant progress, and I think on the trade front, these are all very positive impacts for the U.S. economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about the trade talks because this story of China, first off, thank you to the President and to the administration for pushing back on China because that's another unanimous feeling out there, that the President did the right thing in terms of stopping China from some of its practices.  What are you expecting out of these talks?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, the President wants fair trade with China.  It's got to be reciprocal.  Right now China has free access into our markets, and we have limited access to there.  So the critical issue that we've talked about is market access, making sure there aren't forced joint ventures, not forced transfer of technology and that we have a mechanism that when we reach an agreement that we can monitor that agreement and that they'll live up to it.</p><p>And that's how I expect we will make significant progress this week on those issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How much of a priority is espionage?  Obviously the administration unveiling a sweeping set of criminal charges against Huawei Technologies.  We have had on a number of CEOs that have said yes, they have stolen trade secrets from us.  Has this come into the conversation with your Chinese leadership?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  No, let me be clear.  Those are separate issues.  And that's a separate dialogue.  So as it relates to the Huawei issues that's being run by the Justice Department.  I have no involvement in that.  I found out about that yesterday when it was announced.  So those are not part of trade discussions.  Forced technology issues are part of trade discussions but any issues as it relates to violation of U.S. law or U.S. sanctions are going through a separate track, which is the Justice Department.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, I guess the broader issue is, is this a cultural thing in China?  I mean this weekend on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" over on Fox News I spoke with the ranking member of the Intel Committee, House Intel Committee Devin Nunes and he went through some of the practices that China does every day.  Listen to this.  I've got to get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  China might have accessed allied intelligence shared with Poland and passed it on to Moscow.</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R), CALIFORNIA:  What the Chinese are doing is that they have these companies that are essentially owned by the party, the Communist Party and essentially this is a dictatorship.  There's very few people that own these companies.  They weaponize the.  So when all over the -- all over the world you have Chinese technology specifically as it relates to infrastructure on -- communications infrastructure, they will go in and they beat every other company around the world.</p><p>And in fact, they've driven a lot of companies out of business because they come in undercut.  They want to have control over all the com systems or communication systems all over the globe.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's pretty incredible.  We will handle your infrastructure of telecom and then they have a way in of spying.  How can you separate that from the conversation on trade and on forced transfer of technology?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Maria, I think you can easily separate these issues.  So there are two different issues.  One is an issue of state subsidies where they do subsidize state enterprises and they compete unfairly.  Those are trade issues, those are violations of the WTO and that's something from an economic standpoint.  We are going to enforce very seriously.  I think you know among the National Security Council, so I'm going to be careful what I say on national security issues.</p><p>But I assure you whether it's China or anywhere else in the world, our security services, DHS and others will make sure that we protect the U.S. infrastructure, we protect from cyberattacks.  That's something we're very well aware of.  But these are separate issues and shouldn't be confused.  We are focused on what are unfair economic practices.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So the best case that you can get from China is what?  Opening up their markets?  Already we are seeing some likelihood of that, UBS I guess was the first bank that was allowed to operate in China and own 51 percent of that bank.  They say they're going to go to 100 percent in three years.  Are you seeing a significant opening in terms of the Chinese willingness to open their markets to foreigners?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I do, but I think that's a good start.  But why should we have to wait three years for a U.S. company to own 100 percent in the financial services?  China can operate and own 100 percent of companies here.  So that's an example where, you know, they're moving in the right direction.  We want to speed that up.  But the issue is really we want to make sure that U.S. companies can compete fairly in China.</p><p>And if we can do that, China has a very large growing middle class.  It's an enormous market.  As I have said before, this is one of the biggest opportunities for U.S. companies in U.S. business if we can get this right.  And President Trump is determined.  This is the first administration that has aggressively said to China, you need to play fair.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is the President willing to drop all tariffs, should he get a good deal that's acceptable?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I think everything is on the table.  So the President is -- will look at, again, the objective is to have a very fair deal.  Hopefully we'll make progress this week.  The President will be involved in these negotiations and discussions.  And we've still got a lot of work to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the President said look, I'm a tariff guy.  I like tariffs.  So does that mean these tariffs are for, you know, no end in sight or would he be willing to drop the tariffs all together?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  The President hasn't made any decisions on that.  There have been no recommendations from the economic team on that yet.  The first step is to make sure we get a good agreement.  And when we get a good agreement, we'll make a recommendation to the President and he will consider that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have seen the Chinese economy get impacted.  You're still talking about 6.4 percent growth, we think, but that is lower than some people think.  What's your worry or how concerning is it that the Chinese slowdown will impact the United States?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, there's no question that China is slowing down.  They still have significant growth rates.  We're beginning to see the impact on that on world growth.  Our objective is not to slow down China.  Our objective is to make sure that U.S. companies can do business in China and can do business fairly.  So we're monitoring these issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary, stay with us.  We want to get into the shutdown and get your impact on how much the shutdown cost the economy and what you're expecting there.  Stay with us.  More of my exclusive interview with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin when we come right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are life live this morning in Washington, D.C.  And I'm sitting right now with -- in a Fox Business exclusive with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  And Treasury Mnuchin, we were talking about the broad economy.  I want to ask your thoughts on the shutdown.  The CBO says that the shutdown caused $11 billion impact to the economy, $3 billion which is completely lost because of the 35-day shutdown.  Your reaction?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Maria, Kevin Hassett, the CEA is working on final numbers for us.  I think his view is that there's no question that there was some cost but those costs will be recovered as money comes back into the system.  I think it's -- he views that it will almost all be recovered.  Now as it relates to the exact numbers, I haven't seen the final numbers yet.  But the good news is we got the government open.</p><p>People are back to work and we have not seen any significant impact on the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Has -- is the President prepared to shut down the government again in three weeks if he doesn't get the money for the border wall?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Maria, I had dinner last night with the President, the Vice President, Senator Lindsey Graham.  We had a very good discussion on this issue.  There's no question in my mind that the President, the Vice President want to do a fair deal.  Lindsey has been terrific in helping to negotiate this.  I hope the Democrats are sincere.  If they are, there's a sincere deal that will include a lot of different issues that need to be resolved.</p><p>But if they're not sincere, the President has all his options on the table.  And he's determined that he's going to make sure we have border security.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's the impact on the IRS?  There's a lot of worry out there that people are not going to get their checks after April 15th as a result of this shutdown.  What can we expect?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, let me just comment on both the treasury, our bureaus, the IRS in particular, I want to thank the enormous number of government employees who came in and worked during the shutdown.  I think as you know, we had the ability to bring in critical employees.  We never would have been able to do the sanctions that we've been doing over the last month without the hardworking people.</p><p>And the IRS had a large number of critical employees to make sure that we were ready to open for business as usual.  So we're ready to open for tax season.  We're taking tax returns.  We'll be ready for tax refunds.  We will have the phones restaffed.  Now, let me just say that there's no question, this time of the year, there's very, very heavy call volume.  That's something we have to manage.  I encourage taxpayers who have questions to try to go to the web first.</p><p>But we are ready for tax season, and I can assure you that tax refunds will be paid as normal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  So, tax refunds will be paid as normal.  That's the bottom line.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  People were worried about that.  Let me move to the sanctions and in particular Venezuela because you've applied sanctions on the Venezuelan oil industry.  Tell us specifically what the impact here is.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, sanctions are a very important tool in our national security portfolio.  And when we look at national security issues, we look at economic tools.  We look at diplomacy.  We look at national security tools, military options.  So there's no question that what we're trying to do is to cut off the money to the regime that should not be in power and make sure that the President Guaido has access to funds and has access to the assets of the country.</p><p>And to make sure we protect these assets for the people of Venezuela.  It's really quite sad.  This is a country that is very, very rich in oil resources that has had extraordinary poverty and extraordinary humanitarian issues over the last issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And have you spoken with the opposition leader party about this?  What has been the response so far?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I haven't personally, but I know the Vice President has been in communication.  I think the response has been very positive.  We've been very careful in balancing this.  We've -- I've spoken to many of the refineries over the last week.  I want to make sure that there was significant capacity.  There's a lot of oil on the water already in transit to the U.S. refineries.  So I think on the one hand, we've been able to cut off Venezuelan oil going forward.</p><p>But we're managing this with the U.S. refineries.  We've issued licenses for the U.S. refineries to continue to operate.  And if Venezuela wants to continue to sell us oil, which we would like to buy that money would go into blocked accounts and will be protected for the people of Venezuela.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what about other industries in Venezuela?  I mean, the sanctions are on the oil industry.  What about other money, other imports that they still get that?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  We will always look at additional sanctions.  We want to make sure that things like medicine and other humanitarian issues continue to go to the people.  We will always look at additional sanctions to make sure we protect the assets of the country for the people of Venezuela.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why was it important for the President to back the opposition leader?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I think he is the rightful leader of the country, the national assembly, the constitution.  I think, you know, democracy is very important to the people of the United States.  And we want to make sure that there are free and fair elections and that there is a proper democracy that's very important to the national security of the United States.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary, it's good to have you on the program.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you very much.  Secretary Steven Mnuchin joining us.  Coming up, earnings in focus.  Major companies reporting this week including Apple after the bell tonight.  What you need to know ahead of those numbers.  Then the U.K. facing a crucial test.  British lawmakers voting later today on measures surrounding the U.K.'s potential exit from the European Union.  Back in a moment with that.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Earnings driving markets this morning.  3M, Harley-Davidson, Verizon out with mixed reports this morning.  Gerri Willis is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange watching markets.  Gerri?</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  That's right.  3M, Dow component, a split decision here missing on estimates beating on revenue.  The EPS line $2.27 a share.  Revenue 7.95 billion.  They lowered their 2019 guidance.  But they say they're positioned for success in 2019 despite the global slowdown.  Stock trading higher.  Harley-Davidson, let's get to that, a big miss on both the top and the bottom line.</p><p>EPS of 17 cents a share.  Revenue of 955 million.  The stock is down and down hard this morning nearly 10 percent.  They're citing restructuring charges, incremental tariffs and recall costs.  Big troubles for the hog.  Verizon beating on EPs but missing on revenue.  We're seeing yet another split decision here.  EPS of a $1.12 a share.  Revenue of 34.3 billion.  The stock trading down nearly four percent here.</p><p>Profit hurt by the restructuring of Oath Media business as we have discussed.  Apple coming after the bell, this is critical earnings release for the markets here.  EPS estimate of $4.17 a share.  Revenue of 84 billion.  We will be focused like a laser on iPhone.  iPhone sales in China, is there an iPhone recession going on in China right now?  Watch Channel Inventory for some of the details about that.</p><p>Meanwhile, Apple having trouble with FaceTime.  A bug where callers can eavesdrop on FaceTime calls has cropped up.  The company says they are checking it.  But you should know that Tim Cook on Monday, well, he was saying big things about International Data Privacy Day asking users to insist on reforms.  Oops, I guess they got a problem.  Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Gerri.  Thanks very much.  Gerri Willis on Wall Street.  British lawmakers will debate several amendments to the U.K.'s planned exit from the European Union today and let Prime Minister Theresa May know what parliament is prepared to vote for.  Ashley Webster is live in London right now with that.  Ashley?</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.  Good morning, Maria.  This is if Parliament knows exactly what it will vote for.  There will be at least 15 amendments to choose from -- will be debated.  That will be up to the Common Speaker John Bercow.  He will decide which ones will be debated.  And it could indeed shape the future of what Brexit will look like moving forward.</p><p>Now, among the most popular amendments that we are expecting to be the debated will be what's called the Cooper amendment, that's Yvette Cooper, the Labour M.P.  It basically says if no deal is reached by February the 26th, it would postpone Brexit for nine months essentially to end of the year from march 29th, that's the date that exists now.  Then there's the Brady amendment, the Graham Brady (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>He basically is putting forward an amendment that would replace the Irish backstop with what is called alternative arrangements, such pretty vague, basically anything elsewhere and what we have now and there is no time limit on that backstop.  We have heard that Prime Minister Theresa May has already told European leaders that she wants to reopen Brexit negotiations.  Let's not forget, just last month, in December, the Prime Minister said it wasn't going to be reopened that the E.U had given her their best deal.</p><p>Now she wants to turn around and say look, you need to reopen negotiations.  I'm going to find out from Parliament what they are prepared to vote for and let's go from there.  And it calls today is January 29th.  The Brexit deadline, March 29th.  We have exactly two months left to go, Maria.  And let's be honest, there is no sign yet of a -- of a deal in place that a majority of people in Parliament can get behind.</p><p>Yesterday we had a whole series of warnings about what would happen if there was a no deal scenario.  Just crashing out retail consortiums saying, look, there's going to be empty shelves, prices are going to go up, a break in the supply chain.  It will be very, very detrimental to the British economy.  So that is the background.  Later on today, we'll find out what Parliament can get behind.  Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Ashley.  Thanks so much.  We'll check back with you.  Ashley Webster in London this morning.  Coming up.  The shutdown impact on your wallet.  I will be speaking with National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow on the economic effects of the shutdown.  Plus Federal debt reportedly headed to the highest level since World War II.</p><p>That is next.  One brewery feeling the impact.  The shutdown hitting one San Diego beer company.  We've got that story.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thank so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo coming to you live this morning from Washington, D.C.  It is Tuesday, January 29th.  Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Earnings season in full swing.  We have heard from Harley-Davidson, hit in the pre-markets after disappointing numbers.  Xerox as well headed higher after beating expectations.  Look at Harley-Davidson's shares down almost 10 percent right now.  China, one of the issues, once again.  Meanwhile rising tensions with China on the U.S. level.  The U.S. bringing charges against Chinese telecom company, Huawei, as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  Moments ago, I spoke with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin who talked about what the U.S. is looking for in the coming talks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MNUCHIN:  The President wants fair trade with China.  It's got to be reciprocal.  Right now, China has free access into our markets and we have limited access to there.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Futures this morning are higher.  Take a look, we have the highs of the morning right here with the Dow Jones Industrial average up 73 points, a third of a percent.  The S&amp;P 500 up 4-1/2, and the NASDAQ higher by 18 points, one-quarter of one percent.  European indices this morning are also higher.  Take a look.  FT-100 in London is up almost 100 points, 1-1/2 percent.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is up 55, better than one percent.  And the DAX Index in Germany up 37 points, that's one-third of one percent.  Asian markets mostly flat overnight as you'll see that was pretty much across the board with Japan and Korea squeaking out a fractional gain.</p><p>Our top story this half an hour, the cost of the government shutdown.  The CBO says about $3 billion out of 2019's projected GDP was completely lost due to the shutdown.  Joining me right now in a FOX Business exclusive is National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow.  Larry, it's great to see you this morning.</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for being here.  So obviously 35 days, government shutdown, CBO says $3 billion is lost.  Never coming back.  Your reaction.</p><p>KUDLOW:  With respect, once again, we disagree with the CBO.  I don't think we're going to lose anything.  This is completely temporary.  None of the incentives in the economy have been changed by this.  You know, that's the key point.  President Trump lowered marginal tax rates on individuals and most especially businesses.  And then he had this massive sweeping rollback of costly and burden regulations, which freed up the whole economy, including the energy sector, which has turned out to be a boom.  Why would we lose something just because of a temporary issue regarding the government?  Now, I'm always interested in sort of counting angels on the head of a pin.  We have about a $20 trillion economy, fair?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  There -- what was their number, three billion out of 20 trillion?  Do you know what the --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Three billion.  Yes, no, you're right.  You're right.</p><p>KUDLOW:  - percentage that is?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I totally understand.</p><p>KUDLOW:  I don't understand why we even mess with it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Actually, they're saying the total impact was $8-11 billion.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But that will come back, except for the $3 billion they say that is completely lost.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, again, with all due respect to the professionals at the CBO, I disagree.  Again, because the incentives in the economy -- here's the big difference between I guess the administration and the Congressional Budget Office and a lot of other forecasters.  We believe the economy is growing at three percent plus.  By the way, the Commerce Department for 2018 has scored I believe 3.1 percent.  We'll get the rest of those numbers in a week or two.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KUDLOW:  The CBO does not.  They never have.  They've never given us credit for the incentive effect of lowering taxes and regulations.  Supply side incentives are kicking in.  If you look at the whole panoply all of the economic data, whether it's very strong Christmas retail sales, whether it's industrial production, manufacturing, the best since the '80s, whether it's business equipment, which means the capex boom is happening that we always hoped for.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KUDLOW:  You'll see in my judgment, at least, the three percent trend line will continue.  CBO and many others have us at two.  But this goes back before the President.  This goes back way before.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  They don't believe the economy can grow.  They don't give any credit --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, even somebody like a Steve Schwarzman will say 4.2 percent growth in the second quarter is very hard to sustain on a $20 trillion economy.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, I'll keep working on Steve Schwarzman.  He's a good guy.  But in a $20 trillion economy, which again will grow rapidly, I see no reason why we can't continue three percent plus.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That's the whole point.  The idea that was sold to everybody I guess going back several years, maybe going back 10 or 15 years, that we're in some secular stagnation is just plain wrong.  With the right set of policies, to unleash --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- American animal spirit --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we saw that with the tax plan and the deregulation.  I totally get that.</p><p>KUDLOW:  And you look at the --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But what about tariffs and trade, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  The -- just one --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because the CBO'S report also brings that up.</p><p>KUDLOW:  One last one on this, the face of the new Trump economy -- I just want to put this in here, it's the thought I've had for quite a while.  These are men and women running small businesses.  These are blue-collar workers.  You look at the evidence, the employment for blue-collar workers, the best increase since the mid to late '80s, when I was a Reagan Cub Scout here in Washington, D.C.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  The wage rates of blue-collar manufacturing autos, they're rising faster than white-collar workers.  This is a direct result --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- of the incentives we've put into the economy.  CBO, again, it's not personal to my friends at the CBO, they don't give us any credit for these incentives.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No, I understand that.  But the --</p><p>KUDLOW:  And I want to stay with that story.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- the report on the trade policies estimated that new tariffs on imports and exports will cut an average of one-tenth of a percent from economic growth through 2029.  What's your take on that, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because we know that these tariffs are in place.  They still are impacting business and uncertainties.  So, is the President prepared to do away with all tariffs if he gets that agreement from the other side?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, I don't want to go there.  I mean, that's going to be his decision as you know.  Vice Premier Liu He is coming and we will have high level discussions Wednesday and Thursday and we're all looking forward to that, as is the President.  The President, as I read him, moderately optimistic about this trade story.  So, that's good.  What was it, one-tenth of one percent by 2029?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  So then here we are in 2019, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, no.  One-tenth of a percent from economic growth through 2029.</p><p>KUDLOW:  See, this is too hard, Maria.  It's way too hard --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- to figure that stuff out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you don't think there's going to be any -- there's --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Could it be possible that there's no impact from the shutdown?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Yes, quite possible.  I never -- it's utterly totally temporary.  So, that's -- let me --- look, let me go back -- the growth potential from China trade, people tend to look at this as a negative.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Look, I don't know the outcome of these talks.  Here's what I know, the scope of the discussion will be the broadest and deepest in the history of U.S.-China trade.  Literally everything's on the table.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Point number one.  Point number two, if China opens its markets --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is a big deal.</p><p>KUDLOW:  OK?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it looks like there's (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>KUDLOW:  Which is huge.  You know, I don't want to predict, and as Ambassador Lighthizer said a million times, and I agree, the enforcement mechanisms are going to be crucial.  But if they were to open their markets as we have requested regarding tariffs and non-tariffs, if they would let American companies own the subsidiary in China, so there's no forced transfer of the family jewels of technology, if we have --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But it --</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- some rule of law regarding I.P. theft, here's my point, open markets will allow the United States to export like crazy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But I understand that, Larry.</p><p>KUDLOW:  And that has been hand -- we've been handcuffed.  If we do that, if we do that, not only will the United States grow faster --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- because of that, China will grow faster.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That all sounds great, but can you actually do that, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Competition is the solution.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's the point, because if you're saying, \"OK, China, we are agreeing that you are opening your markets, and as a result, we will meet your demands, but then they say okay, but you have to have a communist, a government leader on the board of any company that has 100 percent.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Which is -- which is extraordinary, you're absolutely right.  It's extraordinary.  And it's --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So I mean -- so you could say it's great --</p><p>KUDLOW:  And unacceptable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- that you're going to open markets.</p><p>KUDLOW:  It's unacceptable.  It's unacceptable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But they -- aren't they saying that a communist has to be on the board of any company that has 100 percent?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I think that's been the past and I think that's going to be a very hot topic in these trade talks because that is completely unacceptable to us.  No question about it.  We will see how this turns out.  China, unfortunately, you know, they're in a slump.  China's economy is slumping very bad.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  I think part of that slump is a function of the President's tough negotiating with tariffs, when necessary, OK, part of that slump is in the last five to ten years.  China has moved in the wrong direction, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  The market-based reforms have been moving in their own direction.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But they're not market-based.  They are communists and they want communists on the board of -- So I'm just wondering, all of this sounds great, if you can actually get it done.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Oh, I know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Larry, stay with us.  We want to talk to you about other things because the tax plan and the deregulations have worked.  But there are some other ideas coming into play ahead of 2020.</p><p>KUDLOW:  China should not use the Venezuelan form of the economic policy.  We need to go back to who is it that said free market capitalism is the best path to prosperity?  It was the (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, that would -- that would be you and Ronald Reagan.  Stay with us.  We will be right back.  More with Larry Kudlow.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Thank you.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We come to you live this morning from Washington, D.C. and I am sitting with National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow, in an exclusive interview this morning.  And we were talking about China and what you can get done.  How important is tomorrow and Thursday in terms of meeting a deadline, that March 1st, in terms of a deal on the table?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I think's very important.  Look, I --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think you'll get a deal by March 1?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I don't want to predict.  It's just too hard to predict.  And, of course, these are decisions that will be made by the President, who is his own best negotiator.  Best I can is, as I said, the scope of this thing's going to as wide and broad as anything we have ever seen.  That does not ensure positive negotiator.  Best I can is, as I said, the scope of this thing is going to be as wide and broad as anything we've ever seen.  That does not ensure positive outcomes --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- right?  I think everybody, including the President, is basically moderately optimistic about this, OK?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Wait, let me ask you, your tax plan --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Ultimately -- one other thought which the President believes that he and President Xi will probably be the ultimate negotiators.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  OK?  And the work being done tomorrow and Thursday is vitally important to lay out options, OK?  But --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So the President will be involved in these talks tomorrow and Thursday?</p><p>KUDLOW:  That is what he has been saying in our meetings.  And I hope so because he's a great negotiator.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me move on to the tax plan.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because we're hearing a lot of ideas in terms of taxes now, now with a lot of 2020 hopefuls.  The Tax and Jobs Act obviously did move the needle on economic growth along with the deregulation out of this administration.  Now you've got Elizabeth Warren talking about two to three percent tax on the very high wealth people.  So if you have $50 million in wealth, you'll get two percent tax.  If you've got a billion dollars in assets, you'll get taxed three percent.  And you've got Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez talking about tax of 70 percent tax --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- on the highest earners.  What is your take on this?  Give us your reaction and what kind of an impact those policies might have.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Right.  These are prosperity killers, these are growth killers, these are job killers, these are incentive killers.  This is a return to some heavy government planning essentially direct to the economy.  You know, I hate to dwell on this because it's a crisis right now, but take a look at Venezuela, just for the heck of it.  What (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There was a time when that was vibrant -- it was a vibrate country.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That is correct.  That is correct.  And investment was flocking to it.  Then they took, down through the years, really exact measures you're describing that are coming from some of these Democratic candidates --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- and the economy was destroyed.  I mean I hear this notion we have to have equality, equality of income, equality of results, which I think runs counter to all human nature.  You know what?  A place like Venezuela has equality.  Everybody's poor.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think they'll be able to reverse the tax cuts then?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Everybody's poor in Venezuela, except for a hand -- Maduro and a handful of this top military people.  Is that what we want in America?  We are growing right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So will the Dems be able to reverse your tax cut plans?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Never.  Never, not until the President's configuration.  I -- look, first of all, if they want to try to raise taxes, it will be defeated in the Senate, Republican.  I personally believe even if it went beyond that --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- the President would veto any efforts to turn back his program.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How important --</p><p>KUDLOW:  We're doing what people said we couldn't do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But how important is debt?</p><p>KUDLOW:  They said we couldn't grow at three, four percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But how important is debt, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  We're growing at three, four percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Let's not mess with it.  If it ain't broke, don't fix it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Congressional Budget --</p><p>KUDLOW:  There's a tremendous surge in prosperity here shared by the middle and lower middle income people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Congressional Budget Office is saying that the deficit is hit -- set to hit $897 billion this year.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That would be the highest level since World War II.  When does debt become a priority?  Do you think the President, let's say he does have another term, will try to attack the entitlements?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, look, I think right now the two issues are maintaining economic growth.  You know, growth is the single biggest factor in these budget calculations.  Growth brings income and revenues.  And in fact I haven't gone through it with a fine-toothed comb yet, but I will.  I think I see that the CBO is acknowledging that our faster growth, which they did not predict, is now paying for over 80 percent of the tax cuts.  OK?  And I think you'll see more about that as we get through.  The reports just came out yesterday.</p><p>Second point I want to make is we will have a tough spending budget coming up in a few weeks, a very tough spending budget with reductions of at least five percent across the board, in non-defense accounts.  So I think that's going to be very important.  Let's minimize government where possible.  Let's grow the economy to its max.  And you will see the debt burden, which I thought debt, as a share of GDP, will be coming down, and by the way, it already is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  OK.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That's what happened during the Reagan years.  That's what happened during the John F. Kennedy years.  So, I wrote about it in my book.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That -- that's the best way to measure that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But, Larry, you know what I don't understand?  I mean you're all about growth, you have been for all your entire career.  Why are so many people worried about the slowdown?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why are we hearing some people say a recession is on the horizon?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, there's just -- it's funny in this town and I guess a little bit in New York, this is a lot of pessimism.  I don't --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you expect a recession this year or 2020?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I do not.  I don't see it right now.  If I look at financial indicators, credit spreads, the actual numbers, you know, it's just -- we -- GDP will come out a week late because the Commerce Department has reopened.  We've seen stuff like falling unemployment claims, rising manufacturing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But what are the markets telling us, Larry?  In the month of December, there was no high-yield debt issuance at all.  Credit markets are still tight.</p><p>KUDLOW:  They've come back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They've come back a bit.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Come back.  I like that.  Profits, the mother's milk of stocks, I don't know who first that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You did.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Profits, the mother's milk of stocks are rising.  The early indications are they won't to 25 percent but they're going to rise 10, to 15 percent.  I like that a lot.  Interest rates, the level of rates, are historically low.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you're not worried about market volatility?</p><p>KUDLOW:  There's a million things to worry about when I get up in the morning, you know, mainly getting here on time so I could do this great interview.  But I just want to say, if you look at the sum total of all the evidence right now, there's no recession out there.  I am the happy warrior.  I am an optimist.  President Trump is an optimist.  I think America, right now, we are the hottest economy in the world and we should remain so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll end it there.  Larry Kudlow.  Good to see you, sir.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow.  Back in a moment.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The government shutdown may be over, but the effects are still being felt.  Hillary Vaughn is live this morning at a craft brewery in Escondido, California where the shutdown effects are actually still lingering.  Hillary.</p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Hi, Maria.  Good morning.  Craft beer is a $76.2 billion industry, and for many craft breweries, like Stone Brewery, where we are today, the effects of the government shutdown are not over.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOMINIC ENGELS, CEO, STONE BREWING:  When the industry craft is built on seasonal beers, it's built on new beers, it's the new sexy thing, and if we can't get the new sexy thing to market, then we're not going to connect with our fans.  They're going to be disappointed.  We're going to make the sales numbers we planned to make in our financial plans, and these things will have repercussions.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUGHN:  As Federal workers at the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau are finally back in the office, a mountain of paperwork is waiting, about 11,000 applications for alcohol labels have been backlogged leaving craft breweries waiting to ship and sell all their new beer across state line, which means they're in limbo until these approvals go through.  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Hillary.  Thanks very much.  We've be watching that.  Hillary Vaughn.  Stay with us.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  President Trump is tweeting this morning.  He's talking about a former staffer.  Here's what he just said.  \"A low level staffer that I hardly knew named Cliff Sims wrote yet another boring book based on made up stories in fiction.  He pretended to be an insider when, in fact, he was nothing more than a gofer.  He signed a non-disclosure agreement.  He is a mess.  Dagen McDowell, great to see you this morning thank you so much.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  John Hilsenrath, Matt Schlapp.  I don't know why the President tweets this.  He's got how many million view, you know, users and followers.  He just let everybody know who this guy is like --</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, THE AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Well, he literally sat in a -- he sat in a cubicle outside my wife's office in the West Wing, and so it is kind of amazing like this insider whole kind of mythology is something the President knows is not true.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  But he's got some extra sales thanks to that tweet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  That's what I'm saying.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think, Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  Again, everybody's got a book to write.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jim Comey, this guy.  Hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Oh, that was a good answer.  Hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, Jim Comey's book, yes, well, there's -- I think that will be a story that we're going to continue following, Jim Comey and the FBI.  You know what.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Everybody wants to be Norma Desmond, Maria.  I'm ready for my close up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  Thanks, everybody.  Great panel today.  Great to see you Dagen McDowell, Matt Schlapp, Jon Hilsenrath.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TECHWR-2172770028</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TECHWR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V9V-HP71-JBHT-D2W9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">352430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"24032\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good morning, everyone, I'm Maria Bartiromo, thanks for joining us live this morning from Washington.  It is Tuesday, January 29th, your top stories right now 6:00 a.m. on the east coast.  Earnings in focus this morning, investors are watching results from several Dow components ahead of the open this morning.  The one to watch after the close is Apple.  We've got everything you need to know this morning previewing the report.  Apple under fire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile, FaceTime hit with a new bug that lets people eavesdrop on you without your knowledge.  How you can fix it, coming up -- big story.  Rising tensions with China meanwhile, the U.S. bringing charges against Huawei as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  The very latest on state of negotiations with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin this morning.  That interview at 8:00 a.m. Eastern, join us for that.  PG&amp;E makes it official, California's largest utility filed to bankruptcy protection, following the massive wild fires.  We've got all the details, coming up.</p><p>Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz roasted.  The billionaire hackled at an event last night as he gears up toward a possible independent run for the White House.  We've got a big show this morning coming from D.C., U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is here, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow is here along with House Minority, California Congressman Kevin McCarthy.  Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell will join me, along with AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka.  Don't miss a moment of it.  We've got a big three hours, coming up.</p><p>And we turn now -- right now, we kick it off with Wall Street markets.  We're looking to see a rebound this morning.  Take a look at Futures actually have just turned negative once again.  Futures down just fractionally, about 6 points on the Dow Industrials; 1-1/2 points lower on the S&amp;P; and the NASDAQ down 13 points.  This, after stocks finished lower yesterday on China growth fears along with weak guidance from Nvidia and Caterpillar.  We told you -- the Caterpillar numbers right here.  And of course, it did worsen throughout the day as investors react to a weaker-than-expected earnings and guidance.</p><p>Joining me right now is Federated Investors Chief Equity Market Strategist, Phil Orlando.  And Phil, it's good to see you this morning.</p><p>PHIL ORLANDO, CHIEF EQUITY MARKET STRATEGIST, FEDERATED INVESTORS:  Thanks for having me back, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All indications that we are seeing a slowdown and worries around China, among other issues, how do you see the markets here as more earnings have come into play?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, you had this 20 percent waterfall decline in stock prices in the fourth quarter of last year, we thought the market was attempting to price in the prospect of recession this year.  Multiples contracted from 18 times earnings down to 14 times earnings.  In our view, there's no risk of recession this year.  So, the rally that we've seen over the last month, 14 percent rally, the market is starting to price in the fact that maybe we're not going to have a recession.  But we've had a 14 percent rally in a month.  That's very, very powerful.  We would absolutely expect some consolidation here over the next month or two particularly as we've got these critical sign posts coming up in the month of March, but as we look out over the balance of the year, we do think that multiples will return to that 18 level, and we're going to end up with a pretty good year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  To what do you attribute the slowdown?  We've got earnings in focus and we're looking at a number of companies out that give weaker-than-expected guidance or miss on the top line.  Lockheed Martin, Pfizer, and Verizon are reporting this morning.  Apple is, of course, out after the bell, so when you look at the earnings picture, where in terms of industry are you seeing the most slowdown?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, I think in a word, uncertainty is what's impacting earnings and guidance to some degree.  You've got the Fed flip-flops that we saw in the fourth quarter last year, the uncertainty about whether or not the United States and China are going to be able to consummate this trade deal.  You've got Brexit overhanging on the global market and certainly the government shutdown, which was up there for 35 days, and it was just temporarily resolved last Friday.  You've got a number of issues there, all of which are impacting companies in some way, shape or form.  So, with earnings up 25 percent year-over-year in the first three quarters of last year, this fourth quarter is a little softer, I think we're up about 13 percent.  So far, we're about a quarter of the way through the earnings season.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>ORLANDO:  And I think what companies are pointing to are some combination of those four issues that I just mentioned.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you mentioned the shutdown.  The shutdown apparently costing the economy $11 billion according to new analysis from the Congressional Budget Office, although Larry Kudlow is disputing that number, and he's going to join us this morning live to talk about it.  The report says that it hit $3 billion, that's one-tenth of a percent of economic activity in the fourth quarter alone.  So, are there sectors that were -- that were hit hardest in that regard, or do you want to look at those companies that are largely tied to the China trade as one area of the real weakness?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the council of economic advisers under Trump had advised us that the shutdown was going to take about one-tenth of one percent out of GDP per week.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, remember, the shutdown started right around Christmas, so that makes sense that we lost, you know, a tenth of a percent in the fourth quarter, you know, maybe a half a percent here in the first quarter.  We're at 1.7 percent GDP growth in the first quarter, consensus blue chip is around 22, 23.  So, we think this pretext a little high and there will be, you know, sort of a downward revision as we get later in the quarter.  But in terms of industries, I think it's really across the board.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Across the board.</p><p>ORLANDO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about technology because it's big week for tech, Apple, of course, the big story today, reporting after the close tonight -- the only big tech reporting.  Microsoft, Facebook out tomorrow, Amazon is out on Thursday.  This is the week that we'll focus on technology and that's where really the growth stories have been.  Would you want to put new money to work in any of these names ahead of their earnings?</p><p>ORLANDO:  Short answer is probably no.  Again, you've had this 14 percent rally here in the last month, you've got concerns about slowing economic growth both in the U.S. and China.  We think that those issues will be resolved as we get into the back half of the year, but right now, you know, why run the risk of putting new money to work after you've had a big rally in some of these names ahead of what could be a disappointing earnings number or perhaps conservative guidance.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, the stock has come down because people were worried about it.  So, we'll see what the numbers are.  Would you, at some point, go back in to tech?  What's your favorite group right now, Phil?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, the areas that we like best in the U.S. markets are energy, financial services, industrials, and health care.  In terms of looking overseas, emerging markets look very attractive to us.  So, the areas that have really gotten hit the most are the ones that we've been attracted to.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there.  So, the valuations are better, I guess, is what you're saying.</p><p>ORLANDO:  The valuations are much more attractive.  We think the fundamentals are still very strong.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Phil, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>ORLANDO:  Great to see you.  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Phil Orlando joining us there.  Meanwhile, a bug in Apple's FaceTime app lets users listen in someone's phone without even the person knowing.  Dagen McDowell, what's happening this morning?  Good morning to you, Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well, Apple has some explaining to do, but particularly on this earnings call this afternoon.  So, there's a bug in the Apple iPhone that would allow people to eavesdrop on FaceTime users' calls.  A FaceTime user calling another person could listen in while the recipients phone is still ringing even if the person never accepts the call.  This was -- it involves several steps in the Group FaceTime feature on the iPhone.</p><p>Apple has disabled that Group FaceTime while it tries to come up with a fix for this, but you can eavesdrop in on somebody, essentially listening through the microphone, even if a person never takes that call, you could eavesdrop on rooms with unattended devices and even receive unauthorized video from the phone.  And again, it would take several steps to do this, but this is coming from a company, Maria, that loves to brag about its privacy protections and even throws shade at the likes of Facebook and other technology companies.</p><p>And adding embarrassment to embarrassment, yesterday was International Data Privacy Day and Tim Cook was tweeting about that.  Here's what he said on Twitter yesterday before this bug, this eavesdropping bug was disclosed.  We must keep fighting for the kind of world we want to live in.  On this Data Privacy Day, let us all insist on action and reform for vital privacy protections.  The dangers are real and the consequences are too important.  Big whoops for Apple, and of course, everything that happens in the business world is a political opportunity.  The Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo had to weigh in on this as well, putting out a statement late yesterday, say, \"Urging FaceTime users to temporarily disable the app.  So, Apple beat him to it, they're trying to fix it.  Embarrassment nonetheless.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible because you don't even know -- I mean, the phone could be ringing and you don't even know that they're listening.  I mean, that's the worst part of it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  I can explain later as the show goes on how this work, but you'd have to place a FaceTime call, go to the group, add yourself to the call and then the recipient of the call would have to hit maybe one like the on-button on the phone in order to activate it, but it was possible, and it was all over the internet yesterday how to do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, if -- so, if it's -- if it's not on and you say -- and you do -- and you decline the phone call, they can't listen in?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Unless you -- but you can't touch the phone at all.  Like, it's not even declining the phone.  Like, if you hit the up -- the up volume button on the phone, and so if I was playing this trick on you, it would activate it, and they could essentially hear what was going on in the room.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Unbelievable.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  I want to hear more about that, for sure.  Meanwhile, there's this, as expected, PG&amp;E filed for bankruptcy protection following those devastating wildfires in California.  Cheryl Casone on that in headlines right now.  Cheryl, good morning to you.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  Well, PG&amp;E is facing roughly about 30 billion in potential liabilities, as investigators are looking into whether the company's equipment played a role in starting California's deadliest fire.  More than 100 people died following a series of wildfires that burned hundreds of thousands of acres over a two-year period.  The utility providing energy service to 60 million people, we should add.  Taking a look at shares of PG&amp;E, look at that, in the premarket down nearly nine percent.  And those loses have actually paired back in the last hour or so, folks.</p><p>Well, China's Vice Premier has arrived in Washington for high-level trade talks that are going to start tomorrow.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and trade representative Robert Lighthizer will attend the two-day meeting.  Yesterday, the Trump administration announced a pair of indictments against Chinese telecom giant, Huawei.  The U.S. is accusing the company of trying to steal trade secrets from T-Mobile.  The Justice Department also charging Huawei with conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran.</p><p>And the China story continues, folks, shares of Nvidia are lower this morning.  The chipmaker is warning investors, and expects much weaker sales thanks in part, yes, to China's slowing economy.  It also previously cautioned the sales of its graphics processors that are used in video games PCs would be disappointing.  The China effect continues.  Chips for video gaming account for more than half of their business, they lost half their market value since hitting their peak back on October 1st, Maria.  So, Goldman Sachs had to come out last Friday, Maria, warning that a lot of these chip companies that have massive exposure to China are going to have really rough reports.  Micron Technology, even Wynn Resorts, the casino company, has got big China exposure, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, for sure.  All right, Cheryl, thanks so much.  Coming up next, five police officers are injured this morning, four of them shot while serving a search warrant.  The very latest coming up.  And then a venti-size disaster for Howard Schultz last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire (BLEEP).</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Former Starbucks CEO having a rough time exploring a 2020 Presidential run as he gets heckled.  We break it down right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Live from Washington, we are eyeing 2020, former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz facing backlash last night on his first stop of his book tour.  It was his first public appearance after announcing a possible Independent Presidential run.  It did not begin smoothly.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire (BLEEP).  Go back to getting ratio'd on Twitter.  Go back to Davos with the other billionaire elite who think they know how to run the world.  That's not what democracy needs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, my goodness.  Schultz is also facing backlash from former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.  Here's what he tweeted: \"In 2020, the great likelihood is that an Independent would just split the anti-Trump vote and end up re-electing the President.  That's a risk I refused to run in 2016, and we can't afford to run it now.\"</p><p>Here with me this morning to talk more about all of that is Dagen McDowell back in New York, Wall Street Journal Global Economics Editor Jon Hilsenrath here in D.C. with me, along with the American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp.  Gentlemen, it's good to see you.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Welcome to Washington.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, thank you so much.  And welcome to presidential politics, Howard Schultz.  What do you think about that?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Well, I'm going to get some popcorn.  This could be a real interesting Democratic primary, and whatever this Independent thing is, don't you love Michael Bloomberg who has probably spent a million dollars on polling, trying to figure out every way to become the President.  Publicly chastising Schultz for running as an Independent when that's exactly what Bloomberg would just love to do if he could.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  You know, on the one hand, Dagen, I feel like there is an opening for an Independent because there's such extremes and radical conversation going on certainly on the left.  And on the other hand, I don't know, how much is a cup of coffee at Starbucks?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Again, that $18.00 cup of Joe, I'm joking, I'm exaggerating.  It's helping --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think it's like $6.00.  I mean, seriously.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, we love cart coffee around this place.  But again, that's helping fund this run.  But Michael Bloomberg -- you know what, Michael Bloomberg should run for the Democratic nomination if he thinks he can win, it's just hilarious to have this multibillionaire lecturing Howard Schultz about an Independent run when actually a cup of Starbucks coffee has more charisma than Michael Bloomberg, number one.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Number two, it's going to be really interesting to see the narrative in the spring of 1992 with Ross Perot was -- Ross Perot was going to divide the Democratic vote, that it wouldn't hurt the Republican.  This could very well -- I mean, it depends on who -- what Howard Schultz says on the campaign trail and how far-left the Democrats go when they're running for the nomination.  But I'll say this, what he said so far about pay -- how to pay for Medicare For All and how that's impossible, I would be really interested to hear him talk about how to fix the health care system, because he might come to the table with some really interesting ideas and force the Democrats to answer the hard questions about paying for this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that is the thing, I mean, this party unfortunately, it's very hard for someone who's a centrist to actually have a shot.  You had Tim Ryan from Ohio, he wanted to do it, he's an economic thinker, he doesn't have a shot because of the same thing, you've got the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's 70 percent tax rate, the loudest voice in the room.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I mean, there's no question that these primaries are starting out very much from the left, you know, you have talk about a wealth tax, and 70 percent high-income tax threshold.  You have Elizabeth Warren who is going around beating up on the banks.  This is definitely a left-leaning primary season that we're going to be going into.  What I find so fascinating is the journeys that these different billionaires are traveling.  You know, you had President Trump who supported a lot of Democrats as a businessman in New York City traveling over to Republican Party, now you have Michael Bloomberg who started out as a Republican Mayor --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- traveling over to the Democratic Party, and Howard Schultz doesn't know where to go.  He doesn't know where he fits in.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He doesn't know where -- and what about Senator Kamala Harris?  Let's listen to her, because she held a CNN Townhall meeting in Iowa last night.  Harris is vowing to eliminate private health insurance with Medicare For All if elected president.  What's your take, Matt?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Making insurance companies illegal.  Look, the Democratic Party has become quite radicalized.  Think about this, less choices for the patient is the solution to our problems.  That seems insane.  Also, do we really think the government, when you get your tags to drive your car, or when you pay your taxes at the IRS, do you really think all the solutions to our problems are there?  I don't.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Let me ask you this, who does President Trump want to see come out of this whole --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think he wants Howard Schultz to run.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think -- he was taunting him yesterday.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH:  No, besides Howard Schultz, among the Democrats, who does he -- who does he want to (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>SCHLAPP:  I think most Republicans -- I'm not going to speak for the President -- but I think most Republicans believe that Elizabeth Warren is so far out there on the loony left, basically Marxism, socialism that I think they find that a delicious opportunity.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Can I --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- call the confiscation, Dagen.  He called it (INAUDIBLE) I mean, this two or three percent tax on assets, confiscation.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It is wealth confiscation.  It's totally communist and then to try and find people when they hand in their U.S. citizenship when other countries come calling, wanting you move there because they won't come and take your hard-earned money.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  One thing I want to point out that Jon Hilsenrath said that Howard Schultz doesn't know where to go.  President Trump should be worried about a Howard Schultz, because what if he comes to the table, like I said, with ideas that appeal to voters in this country who feel left out.  Who left out from the Republican Party and certainly left out by the left-leaning Democrats in this environment.  So, be very, very careful.  And one other thing I'll add with Howard Schultz at that -- at that bookstore, that's just the New York City welcome wagon.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's the way they treat all tourists in this city.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, I think you make a good point because there is that path.  That path of centrism.  I mean, that path of the center, because people do feel like it's gone wacky all the way on the left, for sure.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  It's a centrist country, but don't forget Hillary.  She's making noises.  Maybe that's the President's favorite opponent.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH:  We haven't seen any --</p><p>SCHLAPP:  She's making noises.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  We haven't seen anyone travel that centrist path as an Independent to presidency.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  So, it was a smart move on Howard Schultz's part.  We'll see.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Or a risky one for all those billions --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, certainly risky.  Take a quick break.  Extreme weather warning meanwhile on the other side of this break, millions of people across the country are gearing up for an Arctic blast as temperatures are plummeting, that's next.</p><p>Then showing their cards, British Prime Minister Theresa May asking Parliament to put up its plans from Britain's exit from the E.U.  Details on the historic debate.  And the vote happening later today, back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  It is cold out, and the deep freeze is setting in, hitting millions of Americans with subzero and dangerous temperatures.  Fox News Senior Meteorologist Janice Dean in the Fox Weather Center right now with the very latest.  Janice, tell us about it.</p><p>JANICE DEAN, FOX NEWS SENIOR METEOROLOGIST:  Hi, Maria, yes, we could be dealing with historic lows.  These are current windchills, what it feels like when you go outside and you are not protected.  Dangerous, potentially life-threatening windchills of -41 in International Falls, -18 in Chicago, but we still have another blast behind this.  So, these are morning lows, these are not windchill temperatures: Chicago -25 on Thursday, -31 in Minneapolis, -16 in Detroit.  Again, those are not windchill values.  Those are actual air temperatures.  But with the windchill, in some cases, we could get windchill values of -40 to -50.  If you go outside, your skin is going to freeze in minutes.</p><p>So, here's Chicago, Illinois.  Your all-time record low is -28.  So, we're going to flirt with historic lows, Maria.  This is a big deal.  The good news is it won't be long lasting.  By the weekend, we'll start to rebound, but I also want to make mention with this arctic cold front as we have snow across the deep south.  Snow that could cripple travel across portions of Atlanta, Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, and towards the southeast, so that's another dangerous part of the storm is the -- not only extreme cold but the snow as far as south as the gulf coast.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Janice.  Wow, what a story, thank you so much.</p><p>DEAN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will be watching.  Janice Dean.  Coming up next, the State of the Union is back on, it is February 5th.  Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi extending an invitation to the President, he accepted the offer.  Then, we're taking a look at the enormous cost of the shutdown.  What is the real number?  Plus, place your bets, Super Bowl fans getting ready to throw down an enormous amount of cash.  So, bet on the big game Sunday.  We break down all the numbers.  Stay with us.  Live from Washington this morning.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us.  We are coming to you live from Washington this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, January 29th, your top stories right now 6:31 on the east coast right now.  Earnings season is in full swing, a lot of big names reporting their fourth quarter today.  Xerox and Pfizer set to report in just a few moments, we'll bring you the numbers as soon as they hit the tape, and tell you how they are impacting markets.  Rising tensions with China, the U.S. is bringing charges against Huawei, as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will be my special guest, in about 90 minutes time.  We will break it all down with the Treasury Secretary, coming up.  So, stay with us.</p><p>Meanwhile, Futures relatively flat this morning, take a look at markets, down 20 points on the Dow Industrials, down 4 points on the S&amp;P, down 18 points on the NASDAQ.  We are expecting some pressure at the start of trading this morning, after all the major indices finished lower, yesterday, on Wall Street.</p><p>In fact, at 4:00, the Dow Industrials gave up 208 points, that was almost 1 percent lower, the S&amp;P 500 down 21, that was three quarters of a percent lower, and the NASDAQ with a 79-point decline yesterday, at the close, down better than 1 percent.</p><p>Investors are watching some big news this week, J.P. Morgan, calling this week the most important week of the first quarter, and here is why, you've got earnings, you've got the British vote, you've got U.S.-China trade talks, you've got a Federal Reserve decision, we're not expecting a Fed hike.</p><p>We've got fourth quarter GDP coming out.  And, of course, at the end of the week, the job's report for the month of January, a big week, investors want to watch it and will be covering it all.</p><p>European indices this morning look like this, in terms of trading.  We are looking at gains in Europe.  The FT-100 up one and a quarter percent, 86 points higher, the CAC Quarante in Paris is up a half a percent, 26 points higher, and the DAX Index in Germany, higher by a fraction, as you can see there.</p><p>Asian markets overnight, flat, take a look.  No real moves there, because mover was the KOSPI Index in Korea, up a quarter of a percent.</p><p>Well, there is tragedy in Houston to report, five police officers injured.  Four of them shot, while serving a search warrant.  We have the very latest, coming up.</p><p>And a debate in parliament, British lawmakers set to vote on the latest plan for the U.K. to leave the European Union.  We are previewing that and we will take a look at the impact across the world.</p><p>We've got a big program this morning from D.C., U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is coming up this morning, along National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow, they will take a look at all of these expectations that the economy is slowing.</p><p>Plus, House Minority Leader and California Congressman, Kevin McCarthy, is with us, along with Michigan Congresswoman, Debbie Dingell.  Plus, AFL CIO, President Richard Trumpa, here as well, big show, don't miss a moment of it, big three hours, coming up. And we are kicking off this half an hour right now, with this top story, feeling the effects of the shutdown, Washington, D.C. back in business for now, President Trump will give his State of the Union of Address on February 5th, Tuesday.  The address was originally supposed to be today.</p><p>Even though the shutdown is over, the U.S. is still feeling effects, new numbers from the Congressional Budget Office to report.  The U.S. GDP will be $3 billion lower during the fourth quarter of 2018, because of this shutdown.  On the immigration front, backlogs of immigration courts grew by at least 10 percent, according to Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about all of that is Americans for Tax Reform President, Grover Norquist, Grover, good to see you.</p><p>GROVER NORQUIST, PRESIDENT, AMERICANS FOR TAX REFORM:  Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So, the CBO is talking about a $3 billion-dollar hit, in fact, as a result of the shutdown, Larry Kudlow is having an issue with this.  He says, frequently disagrees with the CBO anyway.  What's your take in terms of what the shutdown cost the economy?</p><p>NORQUIST:  Look, the key thing is that the economy continues to grow and we're looking at a three percent rate of growth for the year, so $3 billion is a big number, unless you compare it to the GDP of the United States in the fourth quarter.</p><p>So, actually, we're doing fairly well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You don't think it had much of an impact then, Grover?</p><p>NORQUIST:  No, it's a small impact and we have a tremendous growth for the year, which is way beyond what the CBO said was possible, when they scored this.  The CBO needs to spend a little more time going back to explain why they were so wrong on all of their recent predictions, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  Go ahead.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Grover, the Federal Reserve and most of the economist that we surveyed at the Wall Street Journal are saying that the economy is slowing down in 2019.  We had a nice burst in 2018 in part, because of tax cuts and in part, because there's more spending, $300 billion of additional spending.</p><p>But now, they say the economy is slowing along with the global economy, what does that say about the impact of these tax cuts, are the tax cuts really created the long-run growth that Republicans said was going to happen?</p><p>NORQUIST:  The tax cuts do two things.  We were at 35 percent rate, which is the highest in the world.  It made sense for an American company like Burger King to be bought by Canadian company, because even though they're selling the same hamburgers, the same number of employees, it was worth more, because we had a worldwide tax system at 35 percent.</p><p>By taking 35 down to 21, we became competitive with Europe.  I mean, our friends, the Germans were at 25, the Japanese were at 25.  I'm sorry, the Japanese were at 30.  The Chinese were at 25.  And we were at 35.  We weren't even close to being competitive.  It's a huge change in the direction for the country.</p><p>And if the CBO tells you they're pessimistic, they didn't think you could do three percent, they laughed at three percent growth, said you could never do more than --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  The question is, is that three percent growth.  I think a lot of people understand that the corporate tax rate was uncompetitive, even some Democrats wanted to lower their corporate tax rate, but the question is, this new tax code that we've got, is that sufficient to sustain the three percent growth in 2019?</p><p>NORQUIST:  It's a good first start.  We also need to do something about the workforce.  We need more workers and frankly, there's more tax reduction that needs to be done and spending restraint is very important at the end of the day.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  I want to go back to this question about a shutdown, Grover, which is, people are saying, they're almost using the reason why you couldn't cut government, because somehow, that would have a negative impact on our economic growth.  That seems like a very dangerous road to go down.</p><p>Isn't it true that all of this money that they are saying didn't get put into the economy, are you worried that the government actually won't spend all of that by the time that the authority over the money, expires?</p><p>NORQUIST:  For the government to -- I was taught this (INAUDIBLE) economics in college also.  The government takes your money, and then spends it.  It's much better for the economy than if it lets you spend it.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Right.</p><p>NORQUIST:  Because you would waste some of it by investing it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because they can spend money better than you, of course.</p><p>NORQUIST:  And that's the oddest thing because, of course, that's nonsense.  East Germany should have done very well, under this theory, but it doesn't, so --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  What the government is doing is borrowing other people's money and spending it, right?  I mean, we're talking about deficits that are nearing a trillion dollars.</p><p>NORQUIST:  The (INAUDIBLE) cost the government is how much the government spends, whether they borrowed or take it, it's still gone from the -- from the real economy.  The cost of government is total government spending.  We should have taxes low, and then the least destructive way possible, all taxes are somewhat destructive.  And you have less borrowing if you have less spending.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what about all of these new plans?  And by the way, we are getting earnings right now, as we're talking 3M and Xerox, both beat expectations, although 3M is cutting its forecast for the year.  What about all of these ideas about taxing the wealthy?  New York Congressman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez claims for a 70 percent marginal tax rate on the tippy top, as she calls it.</p><p>Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts senator, hopeful, for 2020, two percent tax on Americans whose assets exceed 50 million.  If you're a billionaire, three percent, what's the impact?</p><p>NORQUIST:  OK, magicians like to do this, so you're not looking at, you know -- watch my right hand, don't look at the left hand.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NORQUIST:  The reason they talk about high tax rates on rich people, is that they want to gouge the middle class.  The difference between the United States and Sweden, Finland, Denmark, the countries that Cortez talked about is, they don't have the 70 percent rate, just back up for sec -- there isn't a country in the world with a 70 percent income tax rate.</p><p>Many countries used to, the Beatle song, 19 for me, one for you, 95 percent tax rate, and then the Beatles moved to United States, and everybody who could pay tennis, left Sweden.  And all the countries of the world realize that tax rates that high were stupid and destructive and didn't help equality or growth or anything like that.</p><p>So, they got rid of them.  The whole world got rid of them.  We did it, it was stupid.  We back offed it and had strong economic growth as a result, so 70 percent stupid and destructive.  It's not America saying, the world says that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You probably showed the op-ed today, in the Journal, in California, and taxes as well.  The Journal, this week, by Cypress founder, T.J. Rodgers, which was very good, Another California Tax Grab, he writes.  In it, the politicians have fueled an affordability crisis that drives away businesses and exacerbates homelessness.</p><p>California Governor, Gavin Newsom, called for even higher taxes in his inauguration speech earlier this month.</p><p>NORQUIST:  California is a good example of 70 percent play.  They have a 13 percent rate on people making a million dollars, but they have 8 percent rate on people making $42,000.  So, they want the middle class people in California to think you're OK, because we're really screwing the other guy.</p><p>And point of fact, Florida has a zero percent first income tax, Texas has a zero percent first income tax, 8 percent looks good compared to 13.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NORQUIST:  Looks lousy compared to zero percent.  They want the middle class to think somebody else is paying the freight.  That's why they have those phoney high tax rates that don't raise much money.  It's to fool the middle class.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it is talking point, and it works for the populist.  Let me bring in Dagen McDowell on this, because we hear this every time we go into the tax discussion and we have a Democrat on which takes out another one of those talking points on taxes, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And I want to say that Senator Kamala Harris said that the first thing -- she said it last night, in the town hall, he first thing she do is to cut taxes for the middle class.  Well, roughly half this country pays no net federal income tax, number one, and the Republicans just did that particularly, doubling the standard deduction.</p><p>So, I don't know who she's going to cut taxes for.  But this is the ruse and this is the big liberal lie that all of these big new welfare state initiatives, whether it's green energy, even single payer, it's all going to be paid for by the super rich.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And that it's not going to be -- that the paying won't be spread across every person in this country to fund this welfare state.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And by the way, the numbers don't add up even if you tax all the rich, you're not going to get the amount of money you need for this green deal, Grover.</p><p>NORQUIST:  You don't even balance the budget if you do that, never mind half money for new things.  Look, the big difference between United States and Denmark, United States and Sweden, it's not how much money higher income people pay, it's what happens to middle-income people.</p><p>Denmark, Finland, Sweden, the tax rate on middle income people is 10, 15, 20 points higher than an American middle class person.  And, you add to that the value added tax.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NORQUIST:  The difference between United States and Europe is how heavily taxed middle income people are, and they have those (INAUDIBLE) high rates that very few people pay, to make people in the middle class think that they are getting a deal.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Speaking of middle income tax -- a lot of Democrats want a carbon tax, gasoline tax and even some big American business.  That's the way to address the issue of climate change.  Do you see any path towards a carbon tax that would be acceptable to your point --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I guess, but real quick, Grover.</p><p>NORQUIST:  No.  No, absolutely not.  And the reason is, you can look at Washington State, very deep blue Washington State.  They have twice had it on the ballot and twice defeated a carbon dioxide tax, gasoline taxes lose overwhelmingly.  This is too obvious tax on middle-income people.  It's a loser up.  They are having this fight in -- our dear friends in France or loggerhead down the subject.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We know how that played out.</p><p>NORQUIST:  We had the Ontario government and the Alberta government collapsed as a result of this, and three times, in Australia.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Grover, thank you.  Yes.</p><p>NORQUIST:  Bad politics and lousy economics.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Grover, thank you for the facts, we appreciate it, Grover Norquist, joining us there.</p><p>Five officers injured in a shooting in Texas, meanwhile, Cheryl Casone in New York, with the details, there.  Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  That's right, Maria.  Four officers were shot and another officer suffered a knee injury in Houston.  They were serving a search warrant at a suspected drug house.  Police say two of them were hit in the neck.  Those officers are in critical but stable condition.  Two suspects were killed at the scene.</p><p>Well, a key E.U. negotiator, warning the risk of Britain leaving the European Union without a deal, is very high, as parliament votes on amendments in Theresa May's exit plan today.  Lawmakers set to consider more than 10 different amendments before taking votes.  That's going to be at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>And those votes come after May's plan to leave the European Union was overwhelmingly rejected earlier this month, a lot of those votes against her from her own party.</p><p>Well, Americans will be betting an estimated $6 billion on the Super Bowl, that's according to the survey by the American Gaming Association.  About 22.7 million U.S. adults plan to place a bet on the upcoming Atlanta game, of those bets, 94.47 percent, reportedly illegal, but let the games begin, Maria, and those are your headlines.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Be there to watch it all, front-row seat.</p><p>CASONE:  I'm there for you, Maria.  I've got surprises for you, coming up.  You're going to love them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK, looking forward to it.  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, crisis in Venezuela to take a look at, new sanctions have been placed on the country's oil.  Plus, National Security Advisor, John Bolton, may have inadvertently revealed the administration's next move.  Why his notes are raising eyebrows this morning.</p><p>Then, farming in America, why farmers are being forced to rent water.  That's up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A look at some of the big headlines across America this morning.  The Chicago Tribune reporting on the Pension Agency criticizing Sears Chairman Eddie Lampert's plan to acquire the bankrupt retailer.  The article explaining that the agency sets to takeover Sears.  Pensions objects to the bid, calling it the final fulfillment of a year-long's scheme to deprive Sears and its creditors of assets and its employees of jobs while lining Lampert's on owns pockets.</p><p>The Daily Camera in Colorado, reporting on how Boulder County farmers are increasingly renting water.  The report explains how ownership from agricultural interests has dropped from 85 percent in the late 1950s to just 30 percent.  The water increasingly moving to municipal control.</p><p>And the Mercury News writing that how in one California city you can text 911 for emergency help.  According to the paper, the police department there announced that the service is now available in the city.  It is meant to help people who are hearing or voice impaired.  The police are also recommending that you not send emojis.  Well, yes, I would think not.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  What are we coming to?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  My God, but it is good that you can text 911.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  That's a good step, just don't text person emoji.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, crisis in Venezuela new sanctions placed on the country's oil, plus National Security Advisor John Bolton may have inadvertently revealed the administration's next move, why his notes on his legal pad are raising eyebrows this morning?  We're breaking that down when we come right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A framework for peace.  The U.S. and Taliban negotiators making a preliminary on key issues to end the war in Afghanistan -- the longest war in American history.  The two top points American troop withdrawal and insurgence vowing to end terrorist attacks abroad, that's according to the Wall Street Journal.  Many hurdles remain to ensure the peace is in place.  Joining me right now is Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst, General Jack Keane.  General, it's always a pleasure to see you.</p><p>GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST:  Good to see you, Maria, and welcome to Washington again.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  And what do you think about this?  I mean, are we supposed to be trusting the Taliban?</p><p>KEANE:  No, we can never ever trust the Taliban, that doesn't mean that we can't have a treaty with them.  But here's what I think is going on, a couple of things have changed: one is the Taliban in the last couple of years have gone all out as we have so dramatically reduced our forces, thinking that they will going to be able to overthrow the regime, because the only thing the United States is really doing is training and assisting the ground forces -- no longer doing the fighting, however provide an air power.  That didn't work.  They retook some territory but never took capitals or provinces and they never took -- they never able to secure a province.  So, what has happened?  The war stalemated.  The Taliban cannot take over the government and the government cannot defeat Taliban, even with our assistance.</p><p>Second thing, and this is crucial, Pakistan has gotten involved in this in a way they've never have before.  They forced the Taliban to go to the peace negotiation table, why?  Pakistan knows it's no longer in national interest to keep this thing stalemated.  There's growing al-Qaeda and growing ISIS presence in Afghanistan which gives the Pakistanis some concern.  So, those are the new things that are happening.  That's why the negotiations have some momentum.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's the thing, though.  I mean, so many people were worried when the president said: we were withdrawing the troops.  And where do you stand on that now?  I mean, do you feel better about it given this peace deal?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, let me answer it this way -- I mean, it is an essential question: the Taliban themselves, we are trying to get an agreement with them that, one, they'll stop trying to overthrow the government and number two, they'll power share with them and also, they will assist in taking down the al-Qaeda and the ISIS.  I don't think we can trust them to do that, based on the fact that they provided safe haven for Osama bin Laden for almost 10 years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  So, what do we do?</p><p>KEANE:  So, we leave in place, after we bring out the troops that are providing the training and assistance.  We leave in place a counterterrorism force and an intelligence capability indefinitely.  We're doing that in Yemen, we're doing it in Libya and we're doing it in Africa.  The one in Africa is off the coast.  It's a Maritime Joint Task Force.  That is what we need to do, that is the guaranty against the Taliban because the issue in Afghanistan has always been, we would never intervene in the civil war in Afghanistan between the northern alliance and Taliban for one reason only, we didn't evade, because they attacked the United States.  That's the reason we're there.  We don't want that to happen again and we cannot trust the Taliban to provide that guarantee for us.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, let me move on and ask you about sanctions on the Venezuelan oil industry.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin who will be here shortly this morning along with Security Adviser John Bolton, explain the decision in a briefing yesterday and issued warning for disputed President Nicolas Maduro.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN BOLTON, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR:  The president has made it very clear on this -- on this matter that all options are on the table.</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY:  There's no reason why these resources shouldn't be used for the economic benefit of the people there.  There's no reason for the poverty and the starvation and the humanitarian crisis.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to this announcement yesterday?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, increased pressure on Maduro regime is certainly a welcome thing.  I mean, this really comes down to the loyalty of the military to Maduro.  As long as that loyalty is there, it's unlikely that Maduro is going the leave.  If that loyalty starts to fall apart, I hope we're working a 'plan b', which is engineering right now some kind of exit path for Maduro, where he can go into exile with recriminations in Venezuela.  The Reagan administration did this very successfully on Ferdinand Marcos, back in 1986, overwhelming popular opposition to him, hundreds of thousands of people.  We engineered his exit.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me squeeze in this question before you go general.  This image from the briefing going viral and it shows John Bolton's notepad with the notation: \"5,000 troops to Colombia.\"  Whoa, do you think we should be sending troops to the region?  What do you think about this?  Caught on camera.</p><p>KEANE:  Look, when we deposed Noriega in 1989 operation just cost Panama, 26,000 troops, is what it took.  When we deposed a dictator in Haiti, 28,000.  The ease of troops that would only be in there, move into Venezuela, if there's a problem at the embassy to our diplomat.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How significance is revealing such a secret?</p><p>KEANE:  I think he'd probably wanted to reveal it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  General Jack Keane, good to see you sir.  Thank you so much.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Show: MORNINGS WITH MARIA][Date: January 29, 2019][Time: 07:00:00][Tran: 012902cb.231][Type: SHOW][Head: Interview with Rep.

Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo coming to you live this morning from Washington, D.C.  It is Tuesday, January 29th.</p><p>Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>It is a busy day on the earnings calendar this morning.  3M among the Dow components reporting their fourth quarter.  The company cut its forecast for 2019.  Pfizer also cut this morning.  The stock under pressure this morning after the guidance came in below expectations.  Pfizer shares down almost 2 percent.  3M down two-thirds of a percent.</p><p>The big one to watch after the close tonight -- Apple.  We've got everything you need to know as Apple prepares to report its quarterly numbers.</p><p>Rising tensions meanwhile with China.  The U.S. has brought charges against Huawei as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin sounding optimistic on the state of the negotiations so far.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY:  I think there's been significant movement.  And we're working through what are still very complicated issues.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'll be sitting down with Secretary Mnuchin this morning at 8:00 a.m. Eastern.  Join us live as the Treasury Secretary will join the program, coming up.</p><p>Markets are under pressure this morning.  Futures pointing to a lower opening for the broader averages although right now it is more like a flat showing than lower.</p><p>The Dow Industrials are up 3 points right now.  S&amp;P 500 pretty much flat, up a quarter point.  And the Nasdaq is down 4 points.  It's been back and forth on futures this after declines across the board yesterday, of course.</p><p>Stocks finished off of the lows of the day but nonetheless, the Dow Industrials were down 209 points, almost 1 percent.  S&amp;P was down 20.  The Nasdaq was down 79, better than 1 percent lower.</p><p>Global markets this morning.  Take a look at European indices, higher across the board.  This right here, this is the high of the morning.  FT 100 up 1.5 percent, 97 points higher.  CAC 40 in Paris up 39 points, almost 1 percent.  And the DAX index in Germany up about 20 points right now.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets were little changed, pretty much across the board as you can see.</p><p>Well, the date is official now with the government back open, President Trump will give his State of the Union address one week from today.  We're taking a closer look at the fallout from the shutdown including the cost to the economy.</p><p>Snapchat's about-face.  Take a look, the social media service eyeing a major change to better compete with Instagram.  We'll tell you all about it coming up.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning.  And joining me to break it all down -- Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell in New York; the \"Wall Street Journal's\" global economics editor Jon Hilsenrath here in D.C. with me; and the American Conservative Union chairman, Matt Schlapp.  Great to see you -- guys.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Great to be here.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen -- good morning to you.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning.  We were talking about the shutdown.  So it's over for the time being.</p><p>The Democrats have actually been hurt by it as well.  Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows that positive feelings about the Democratic Party have fallen to 35 percent this month.  That's down 4 percentage points since December.  And that is essentially in line with the positive feelings that people have about Republicans.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean that's a really good point because the President really did not get hurt certainly on his base, from his base, by the shutdown.  What do you guys think?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Two things.  First is that the President's base was actually energized that he would make a spending fight.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Remember, immigration is a spending fight because if he can stop illegal immigration or reduce it, you don't have all these social services costs.</p><p>But the second thing is, the President's brand is that he will fight, he will fight harder than any politician on the field and he reiterated that brand.  So if he can increase that reputation, I think it appeals to Independents.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They said dig in.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  But isn't his brand also -- it's about fighting and continuing to fight and winning.  And he didn't win the wall in this case.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  I don't agree with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We don't know if he won the wall yet.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  There's three steps to this - -</p><p>HILSENRATH:  In this case, right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  In this case.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  -- there's three really important things.  Number one, the bill he signed has $1.3 billion in barrier funding annualized.</p><p>Number two, he's got to exhaust all legislative efforts if he's going to go the emergency route in order to have a good case in court.</p><p>And number three, the American people when it comes to immigration, he is on the right side of this policy argument.  And Democrats who are against border security, they're going to be sorry for this eventually.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  But you know what.  You better be --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, go ahead -- Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- but you better be careful about what you do and this goes to all politicians because I was flying on Friday and that was an utter nightmare.  If you want to anger everybody in the electorate, you pull another fast one like that where people are grounded and you've got an hour and-a-half plane flight where you're at 8,000 feet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But who are you blaming?</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They were blaming (INAUDIBLE) and blaming the Democrats because --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They were blaming everybody.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- Nancy Pelosi dug in.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They were blaming everybody.  But TSA agents down in Raleigh, Durham were going to food banks because they were spending what little money they had on gas trying to get to and from work.  So again, I don't care who is responsible for it.  They're all responsible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, businesses did start, you know, putting the uncertainty out there, sitting on cash, making decisions later.  We know.  I mean the SEC closed, can't get any IPOs through.  FDA closed, got to worry about obvious food shortages or food issues.</p><p>So we were beginning to see some real impact.  And Dagen saw it firsthand at the airport.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  That's true.  But if you're a federal employee in this town, let's face it, you make a little bit of a bargain.  Yes, every year you might have to go through a shutdown with your salary.</p><p>But you know, the other thing, Maria, that we don't talk about, it's almost impossible to fire a federal employee.  There's some pretty cushy gigs --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good point.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  -- in THIS town where you basically have an insurance policy against ever getting fired unless you do something just awful.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  And you can read all the GAO reports that's backed that up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're talking about all of that this morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But there are people barely making ends meet who are trying to drive to work, and spending all their money on gasoline and going to food banks who were working for the TSA and not getting paid.</p><p>And when the Republicans stop thinking about them and start talking about the workers who aren't needed, the ones who are furloughed you have really missed the boat.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, maybe.  But how about the fact that we've got a border wall in Nancy Pelosi's state?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that immoral, the wall that separates Tijuana from San Diego --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  But --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- is that immoral?  I don't think so.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They need to start asking all of these Democrats who think that the wall is immoral or don't want to fund it, ok, let's take down the walls that are there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's how you put --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will the three million people in Tijuana assimilate with the three million people in San Diego if that wall is torn down?  I think so.  And we're going to talk about that this morning.</p><p>We've got a big show this morning from D.C., live.  Coming up Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is here, live.  National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow has a thing or two to say about the CBO protections about what exactly the impact is on the economy from that shutdown.</p><p>House Minority Leader and California Congressman Kevin McCarthy will walk us through what these next three weeks look like with his colleagues in terms of this negotiating on border wall funding.</p><p>Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell is here.</p><p>Along with AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka.</p><p>Don't miss a moment of it.  A big two hours coming up.</p><p>And we kick it off this hour right now with markets.  Futures are pointing to a flat opening this morning amid all of this uncertainty over China trade, earnings.  It's an enormous week this week.</p><p>This after stocks finished to the downside yesterday on the China growth fears, the weak guidance from Nvidia and Caterpillar as well, and of course these worries about what happens with China and the U.S.  There's conversations happening tomorrow.</p><p>Joining us right now is the founder, CEO and chief investment strategist at Mainstay Capital Management David Kudla.  David -- good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>DAVID KUDLA, FOUNDER/CEO/CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, MAINSTAY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So we've been talking about what a week this is with the fourth quarter earnings coming out.  That's been pretty much driving the story.  We have a jobs report coming out at the end of the week on Friday.  Brexit discussions, the vote today.  U.S./China discussions tomorrow.  A fourth quarter GDP number.  How do you want to invest with all of this?</p><p>KUDLA:  I think investors should be looking at stocks right now that they want to own.  We've been invested through -- the past month has been very good for stock investors.  13 percent rise through Friday from the lows of December 24th.  And that's in both growth stocks and value stocks, so a broad market advance.</p><p>We're going to see some give and take here now after this nice advance of last month but investors should be picking, you know, their points here, have their list out on stocks they want to own.  We look for a good 2019 for stock investors.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is it good news, Jon Hilsenrath, that the Fed gave us a pivot that we know that the Fed is on pause right now and that we know that they're even ready to consider slowing down the unwind of the bond portfolio?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  I don't think it's good news.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I think it shows that the Fed is becoming less confident about how strong and sustainable the economy is.  I mean it is a sign that inflation isn't picking up and that's good news.  But you see some real trepidation coming out of the Fed right now with the global economy slowing, with markets being unstable and volatile.</p><p>I think the Fed is a little worried about the outlook and that shouldn't really give us a lot of encouragement.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about that, David?  I mean the economy's slowing.</p><p>KUDLA:  But Jon this -- yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLA:  But John -- the important thing here is what happened in the fourth quarter is we had mixed messages out of fed chair Jerome Powell.  We had on October 3rd we were far away from neutral.  Then by November we were close to neutral rates.  Then on the 16th in the Fed meeting they were going to do what's right no matter what.</p><p>Then he came in on January 4th and finally said we're going to be considerate of market and economic conditions and now we're seeing a more consistent and accommodative message out of the Fed.  And that's very important for the markets.</p><p>That's music to the market's ears and that's why we've now seen a sustained advance.  So the markets and investors are now looking at a Fed that seems as though they are going to be considerate of or accommodative or take into account what's happening with the markets, with the economy, and not just normalize rates for the sake of normalizing rates.</p><p>They won't have $50 billion rolling off the balance sheet on auto pilot and they won't raise rates just to raise rates to get to a normalized rate structure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that was the worry in the fourth quarter.</p><p>KUDLA:  -- in pause like in 2016 if the market and economy warrants it.  That's important.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That was they worry in the fourth quarter -- that they were on auto pilot-- Jon.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  Yes, I make two points.</p><p>KUDLA:  That drove volatility in the fourth quarter, the Fed.  .</p><p>HILSENRATH:  David makes a really important point, you know.  So this has been Jerome Powell's first year at the Fed.  He's had a bit of a honeymoon with the market.  And then what the market has discovered in the last month or two is that Mr. Powell, you know, he kind of prides himself on being a plain-spoken communicator but his communication has confused a lot of people in the market.  And he's really had to do a lot of corrections over the last few weeks --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- so that raised some questions about him.</p><p>But the other thing about -- you know, the market wants to see the Fed on an easier path.  Ok.  But the underlying message there is that this economy can't sustain very high rates.</p><p>So it doesn't send a really encouraging message about economic growth and the economic outlook when we see that the Fed is starting to recognize it just can't sustain a tighter monetary policy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But look, we're getting the news from the companies themselves with the fourth quarter numbers coming out.  Verizon just reported mixed earnings.  They beat on earnings, but they missed on revenue.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Caterpillar.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Technology reporting late today, Apple.  And we heard from Apple already.  Facebook, Amazon -- all reporting this week, Microsoft.  It's going to be a big week for technology.  And of course you mentioned Caterpillar.  That was the big kahuna yesterday that really set the tone for the markets because Caterpillar is a great indicator of economic activity across the world, in particular China.</p><p>So stay on earnings for a second, David.  Give me your take on technology.  Because you've got Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft coming out this week.</p><p>KUDLA:  Well, you know, tech stocks got beat up very bad in the fourth quarter.  They've come back in this rally and we think that tech stocks have further to go.</p><p>Look, we think that investors should stay with tech stocks.  We have an opportunity here to add value stocks to the portfolio.  Cyclicals came into 2019 at their lowest valuation relative to the S&amp;P 500 ever.</p><p>So investors now can diversify their portfolio in an opportunistic way, holding both growth stocks.  Those tech stocks that we think still have some rebound and some further runway ahead of them, and by adding value stocks that are very opportunistic.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  David -- it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>KUDLA:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Still bullish on this market.  David Kudla joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, the State of the Union is back on, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi extended officially the invitation to President Trump to do the State of the Union in the House Chamber.  He accepted the offer.</p><p>Plus we're taking a look at the enormous cost of the shutdown, what exactly is the number?  A lot of people say it wasn't very much at all.</p><p>Then, Snapchat's unthinkable change, how the photo sharing app is attempting to compete with Instagram by changing a key feature.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>New revelations in the sexual misconduct claims against the former CEO of Wynn Resorts.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with headlines now in New York -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Maria.  The \"Wall Street Journal\" is reporting that executives at Wynn Resort ignored allegations of sexual misconduct by Steve Wynn over more than a decade.  According to a regulator's report Wynn was accused of sexually assaulting or harassing salon workers, cocktail servers and flight attendants who worked for his company.</p><p>Under a proposed settlement, the Nevada Gaming Control Board won't try to revoke Wynn's regulatory licenses but Wynn is going to pay a fine.  Steve Wynn has denied any claims of misconduct.  There's a one year chart of Wynn's in front of you right there.</p><p>Well, Snapchat has named Lara Sweet as its interim CFO.  This is another shift in leadership at Snap as the company has lost several high profile employees over the last year.  Meanwhile Snap is reportedly considering allowing longer lasting or even permanent videos on Snapchat.  It will apply the Snap shared publicly on this story's features.  Snap is down 52 percent from one year ago.  There's that chart for you.</p><p>Well, Porsche is speeding past Tesla in a fast charging race.  The car maker says it new Porsche Taycan is going to be able to add more than 60 miles of charge in just four minutes.  That will be the fastest available today, exceeding Tesla's super charging stations which needs about 30 minutes to charge a vehicle's battery to at least 80 percent.  Charging times are a key selling point obviously for these car makers and now Porsche is giving Taycan owners three years of free charging.</p><p>And obviously we're going to be hearing from Tesla this week, Maria.  Earnings are coming out from Elon Musk and company.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Cheryl -- thank you so much.</p><p>Coming up next, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi challenged over her words describing a border wall as immoral.  We will break it down when we come back.</p><p>Then support on the links, fans rallying around a pro golfer whose two shot penalty was deemed unfair.  More on that.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Keeping America safe, the government is back open but the focus now is whether President Trump can make a deal with Democratic leadership on funding for the border wall.</p><p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has called it immoral, any wall is immoral.  But her home state of California protects the southern border in some places with an actual wall -- the wall separating Tijuana and San Diego.</p><p>Joining me right now is Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell.  And the last time you were on you said you wanted to look at this again.  Congresswoman -- it's good to see you.</p><p>REP. DEBBIE DINGELL (D), MICHIGAN:  It's good to see you.  Welcome to Washington.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.</p><p>What's your take on this?  I mean can Nancy Pelosi really get away with calling a wall immoral when she has a wall in her own state, separating Tijuana from San Diego?</p><p>DINGELL:  Here is what I think is going to happen.  You've got strong countries (ph), both sides of the aisle, both houses.  They're going to go into that room and they want to cut a deal that's going to keep our nation safe.  I don't think anybody wants to see what we just went through for 35 days.</p><p>It hurt the economy.  It hurt -- and I do believe -- this is going to sound corny but I don't -- you know, why do we point -- why do we need to have a Trump win, a Pelosi win.  We need an American win.</p><p>So I'm hoping they're going to go in that room.  I've talked to my colleagues on both sides.  I've talked to Roy Blunt.  I've talked to all my Democratic colleagues in the House.  They want to win.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DINGELL:  They want to go in and put together a package that's going to keep --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So how do you win?  What's the position in terms of wall funding?  Because they may very well -- your colleagues may very well come back and say ok, here's $5 billion towards border security, not a dime toward a wall.</p><p>DINGELL:  I don't know -- if people are really working together, that may not happen.  You know, there may be money, if there are appropriate places for a wall or fence or --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is there a movement within your party, do you think, among your colleagues that they feel that, yes, some money should go for an actual barrier?</p><p>DINGELL:  I think what I hear among my colleagues is let's go into a room and do something that makes sense.  Let's come up with -- we need to -- I've said this to you a million times.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DINGELL:  We need to strengthen our borders at both sides.  Everybody talks about the southern border.  I've got this northern border too which just had a huge human trafficking problem again in the last few --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But there are areas of the southern border that are very dense.  In other words like when you just look at the wall in Nancy's state and that is three million people on one side in Tijuana, three million people on the other side in San Diego.  If you tear that wall down -- I mean isn't it obvious many of the people on the Tijuana side will assimilate into the United States?</p><p>DINGELL:  Then let me ask you this question.  Build a wall, tear down a wall -- are there structures that are working that are in place?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  .</p><p>DINGELL:  So that's -- what I do think we need drones.  We need to fill the 3,000 open patrol --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's common ground, both sides believe in that.</p><p>DINGELL:  Both agree --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Technology and drones -- definitely.</p><p>DINGELL:  We need technology.  We need to make these ports safer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Specifically in a dense area, like Tijuana/San Diego, drones wouldn't work.  I mean maybe you want that in addition to a wall.  When you have such a dense area, where there's three million people on one side of the wall and three m million on the other, don't you need an actual barrier?</p><p>DINGELL:  But they are going to go in this room.  There are people that know what they're doing.  They're people -- they're senior people that have been on homeland security, people from the areas that are impacted --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think they're going to deal?  We won't shut down the government again?</p><p>DINGELL:  I pray to God, we never shut down the government.  Not only do I pray to God that doesn't come out of conference but you're going to see Republicans and Democrats working together.  We'll get --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This whole wall issue, Congresswoman, sort of underscores what's going on I think in both parties.  Now you've got former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz seeing an opening as a result of the radicalness on both sides.</p><p>He's facing backlash on his first stop for his book tour last night.  It was his first public appearance after announcing a possible Independent presidential run.  It did not go smoothly.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire (EXPLETIVE DELETED).  Go back to (INAUDIBLE) on Twitter.  Go back to Davos with the other billionaire elites who think they know how to run the world.  That's not what the country needs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  You know, I give you a lot of credit just being in politics, by the way.</p><p>Schultz is also being criticized by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, billionaire.  He tweeted this, \"In 2020 the great likelihood is that an Independent would just split the anti-Trump vote and end up reelecting the President.  That's a risk.  I refused to run in 2016 and we can't afford it right now.</p><p>Congresswoman -- do you think an Independent run is viable?  Do you think an Independent run from Schultz would hurt the Democrats?</p><p>DINGELL:  I think it's viable.  He has the money to spend it.  But I think he would hurt the Democrats.  I'm fearful that I am -- I'm trying to step back.  I'm not getting any candidate I want to see who is going to emerge, who's got people skills.</p><p>But this is dangerous.  And as you know, told you two years ago, Donald Trump could become president.  Nobody believed me.  You all thought I was crazy.  You may not have but most people did.</p><p>And I still think he could get reelected.  And if we do not run a strong campaign and we don't have somebody like that that pulls votes off --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  One of the issues is the messaging of what the platform is.  So what do you think the Democratic candidate for 2020 should have as their platform?  What's most important?</p><p>DINGELL:  You know what we didn't do and one of the reasons I believe firmly that President Trump became President Trump.  One, people are tired of partisan bickering.  They're tired of seeing things not get done in Washington.</p><p>There are a lot of people that are hurting in this country, just working men and women who want to know that we actually care about them.  They're scared about healthcare.  They're scared about escalating drug costs.  There's -- look at our --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So healthcare should be the platform?</p><p>DINGELL:  it's one piece of it.  Infrastructure, let's create jobs.  What are we going to do about education?  Trade?</p><p>Now, the President -- you want to know why he won Michigan?  Trade.  They're tired of bad trade deals that ship jobs overseas.  We don't have a level playing field.  The President's trade policy is all over the place.</p><p>It's not consistent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you going to vote for the ratification of USMCA?</p><p>DINGELL:  I don't call it USMC.  I call it NAFTA 2.0.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you going to vote for ratification.</p><p>DINGELL:  I haven't decided yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is on your plate now in the next month.</p><p>DINGELL:  Very much on my plate.  And talk to Lighthizer about it all the time.  But I'm not voting for any bill that doesn't have and acting legislation that keeps more manufacturing from going to Mexico.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wasn't that one of the key things of this new law?</p><p>DINGELL:  But Blazer still went to --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Keeping jobs here.</p><p>DINGELL:  Blazers went to Mexico in July.  I'm not seeing any more American cars go to Mexico and get built for $1.50 to $3.50 and then gets shipped back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you want a change before you vote for it?</p><p>DINGELL:  He knows how I feel.  I'm not -- one of the more likely people to vote for it but I'm not voting for it in the form that it's in right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.   We'll leave it there.</p><p>Congresswoman -- it's good to see you.</p><p>DINGELL:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.  Congresswoman Debbie Dingell joining us here.</p><p>Coming up, the longest government shutdown in American history is over.  But another shutdown threat is on the horizon.  We will talk about the next three weeks, what it looks like with House Minority Leader, Kevin McCarthy.  He's up next.</p><p>Then you've got a friend again.  The new teaser trailer for \"Toy Story 4\" drops with a big surprise.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Tuesday, January 29th.  Your top stories right now at 7:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Earnings season in full swing this morning for the fourth quarter.  Several Dow components reporting their fourth quarter this morning.  Verizon reported a mixed quarter earlier this hour.  Pfizer and 3M also under pressure this morning as you can see.  3M up three percent, although Pfizer and Verizon down better than one percent.</p><p>Rising tensions with China continuing, the U.S. bringing charges against Chinese telecom company Huawei as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning between the two nations.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will be joining me as my special guest this morning at the top of the hour, 8:00 a.m. Eastern.  Join us for that talk on China and the economy as we break it all down with the Treasury secretary.</p><p>Markets this morning are hovering around the flat line.  Take a look.  Dow Industrials up 20 points right now, 26 higher.  The S&amp;P 500 is down by almost one point and the NASDAQ down about three points.</p><p>All this after the major indices finished lower yesterday across the board at 04:00 on Wall Street.  Dow industrials were down 208 points and then actually was off of the lows of the -- of the day, down almost one percent at the close.  S&amp;P 500 gave up 21 points, that was three-quarters of one percent.  And the NASDAQ was down 79 points, better than one percent lower.</p><p>In Europe this morning, a mixed story, actually mostly higher.  FT-100 at the high of the morning right here, up 1-1/4 percent, 83 points higher, ahead of the British vote on the U.K. leaving the E.U.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is up 42 points, almost one percent higher and the DAX Index in Germany higher by 25, quarter of a percent higher there.</p><p>Asian markets mostly quiet overnight.  Take a look, as you can see, it was pretty much across the board.</p><p>$100,000 penalty, how one misstep cost a professional golfer big time.  The outcry, coming up.</p><p>And Woody and Buzz Lightyear are back, the new teaser trailer for \"Toy Story 4\" is out and it marks the return of one character after 20 years.  We will bring it to you.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning.  But first, our top story this half an hour, shutdown showdown, the government open for business again after the last -- at least for the next three weeks, rather.  But the main issue, funding the wall has not been resolved and the White House is not letting it go.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  What I do know is that if they don't come back with a deal, that means Democrats get virtually nothing.  That will make the president and force him to have to take executive action that does not give Democrats the things that they want.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is the House Minority leader, Congressman Kevin McCarthy.  Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you.</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  Thanks for having me back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So, what do the next three weeks look like?  Take us through these negotiating.  Do you expect any money for the wall?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  I expect us to solve this problem in the end.  What's interesting here is the whole time speaker Pelosi said I couldn't negotiate anything until you open up government.  The president put the public first and said OK, let's go through, I'll give you three weeks.</p><p>Now Wednesday, we'll have the conference committee, the senators and the congressional members' appropriation sit down and we'll see if they're serious about it, if they're willing to do something.  Because I believe Nancy Pelosi is out of step with her own party.  If you look at her number two, Steny Hoyer.  He said of course, that walls are not immoral, and that he believes some fencing involved.  From her Agricultural secretary to her Agricultural chair to our Armed Services chair, they both believe in a wall too.  Her Agriculture chairman said give Trump the money.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and she continues to say that it's immoral which I find incredible given the fact she has a wall in her own state.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  As my state too.  You know what I find --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And your state too, exactly.  California.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  You know what I find immoral?  When you really talk about this, this is about stopping human trafficking.  In 2016, they stopped more than 2,000 individuals involved in that.  I think it's immoral that you would allow that to continue.  I don't believe anybody in America that says they support border security believes that there is no such thing as some barrier.</p><p>And the president said, he does not a -- he does not want a wall from sea to shining sea.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  He just believes in the area you need some form of barrier and he's correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, where do you think are the most important areas that you would need the wall?  I mean, we talked earlier about this wall in your state, Tijuana, San Diego where it's very dense, three million people on one side, three million people on the other.  Can you make the case that that dense area is elsewhere where that's why the president is so stuck on having this wall there?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  And it's not the president saying, it's the experts.  The president sat down with the experts and they said this is what we need to be able to secure our border.</p><p>So in certain areas, like in San Diego, we stopped illegal movement by more than 95 percent.  You look at Yuma, Arizons, El Paso another -- El Paso became one of the safest cities in the nation after being able to put it through.  That's what we need, in certain parts of the country along the border, you need a barrier.  In other parts you could put the drones in this part area.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what are you expecting to give on?  And what -- do you think they're going to offer the $5.7 billion that the president wants for border security?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  But we're arguing over one-tenth of one percent of the budget.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a great point.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  The Democrats have voted for a wall before.  But now that the president brings forward what the experts want, they say no.  That is what's so confusing to me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, what -- why is this so important for the president right now?  Going into 2020, I mean, is she seeing this as a campaign promise and that's why he doesn't -- she won't agree to it.  Because I don't know how she can call it immoral, given the wall in her own state, your own state.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Again, it's such a little price to pay for so much more security when you look at the human trafficking.  Think of the number of lives that we will save from this process if we have a secure border.</p><p>But what's more importantly, it's the president that sat down and tried to be reasonable, find common ground.  He's the one who brought DACA into it.</p><p>And let's not forget, speaker Pelosi just a year ago holds the record for the longest speech on the floor, eight hours, over one issue, DACA, which she shut the government down over.  And now she thinks that's not important?  I think those people are important as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think that this -- a negotiation, an agreement will include a DACA deal?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  It could.  It doesn't have to.  But because the Democrats and speaker Pelosi have been saying no.  The president said he was willing to go there, three more years of DACA for a portion of the border security that the experts are asking for.  I just find her out of step with her own party.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, there seems to be a movement within the party, even some of the newer congress people coming in, fresher faces saying you know what, yes, we do need border security and we do need the money.  So, are they going head to head?  I mean, are they -- do they even have a voice?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  They don't even have a voice.  Because remember, she has so much power.  She will not allow the vote to come up.  I believe inside the conference we could come up with an agreement.  The question is, will speaker Pelosi even allow that to be voted on the floor?  If we had a vote on the floor, I believe it would pass.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think that the president will allow the government to shut down again?  I mean, is the president really prepared to have another government shutdown if he doesn't get the money?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Look, I think the president's going to try to find a way to solve this one way or another.  I don't know that shutting the government down solves it.  I there's other ways to do that the president can.  I know he firmly believes in a legislative process.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Should he call for a national emergency?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  He has the power to do that.  I think the best road forward right now is a legislative agreement.  And what's so interesting to me, I'd listened to these Democrats celebrate Nancy Pelosi.  You celebrated someone that got you status quo.  They're still a DACA problem, they're still a border security problem.</p><p>And government is designed to find common ground and compromise.  The president was the one person looking reasonable in all these discussions.  I know the president's committed to this.  He will get the border secure one way or another.  He's giving the Democrats an opportunity.  He gave them an opportunity all along this discussion.  They said then open up the government, they'll discuss it.  So he did that and gave them a three week time.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean, I think this whole thing, the government shutdown and the constant resist upsets people.  I mean, you have to wonder if in fact -- you know, she keeps resisting everything that the president wants, if the people will turn on her.  Because people want to see you guys get something done.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Yes, she is celebrating status quo.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  That's not where we need to be --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me move on and ask you about 2010, congressman.  Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz thinking about running for office.  He was at a book signing last night in New York and he was heckled over his bid.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump.  You egotistical billionaire (INAUDIBLE).  Go back to getting ratioed on Twitter.  Go back to Davos with the other billionaire elites who think they know how to run the world.  That's not what the country needs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This heckler not the only one weighing in.  Michael Bloomberg former mayor of New York City also told Schultz not to run as an independent.  He said this, given the strong pull of partisanship and the realities of the electoral college system, there's no way an independent can win.  That is truer today than ever before.  Is that where we are, an independent can't win, congressman?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  No, I think it's Bloomberg upset.  Because remember, he went from a Republican to an independent to a Democrat and he just spent $120 million giving to the Democrats so they can win the majority in the House and he doesn't want his money to be wasted, so he doesn't want competition.</p><p>Look, I think there's ample opportunity for an independent to get in this race, only because the Democrats are now become social Democrats.  They're talking about a 70 percent tax rate.  They're talking about these green deals.  They're talking about socialism.  If you listen to what some of these new Democrats say, they think Venezuela's problem is not because they're a socialist country, it's because of sanctions.  They're so out of step.  They are putting letters in to help those who want to go sign up for ISIS, to be easy on them to the judge.  I mean, I have -- this is not the America we live in, and that's the difference.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  This party is so out of step and I think you'll find a lot of moderate Democrats who say I want somebody else who could talk about this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, that's why a number of moderate Democrats can't really get the OK from the party leadership because they're not left enough.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  This new socialist Democrat Party has left the Democratic Party.  They are in to -- remember, Bernie Sanders is not registered as a Democrat.  He's registered as a socialist.  AOC does not call herself a Democrat, she calls herself a Democrat socialist.  This party is moving to a whole different place.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Real quick before you go, when the election happened back in November.  You said one of your priorities going to be to get the majority back.  How are you going to do it?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Well, first of all, you've got to make sure you can recruit.  I think, you put the ideas up there.  Ideas should win at the end of the day.  You look at where we are financially in this country.  A lot of that happens to do with the policies that we're able to create, from the tax policy, the battle we had with you human trafficking and other that we were able to do.  I think you're going to find as going directly to, we've got to find a suburban areas to be able to win again in and I think we're going to be very successful.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, it's good to see you.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Congressman Kevin McCarthy, joining us there.</p><p>Still ahead, Richard Trumka AFL-CIO president on the impact of the shutdown on American workers, what he'd like to see, back in a moment with that.</p><p>And then, support on the links, a pro golfer given a big fine and a two-shot penalty which many are calling grossly unfair.  What went wrong, right here.</p><p>Plus, you've got a friend and a big surprise, the trailer for \"Toy Story 4\" drops with a character we haven't seen in 20 years.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Prosecutors resting their case against Joaquin El Chapo Guzman.  Cheryl Casone in New York with details and headlines, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It; must something else, Maria.  The federal government has now rested its case.  They called 56 witnesses.  The trial of the notorious Mexican drug kingpin started back in mid-November.  El Chapo told the trial judge yesterday he will not take the stand in his own defense.  One witness is scheduled to appear for the defense today.  Closing arguments expected to take place tomorrow and Thursday.  Big story, a lot of New Yorkers have been following very closely.</p><p>Well, professional golfer Haotong Li is getting a huge outpouring of support from fellow golfers after losing out on nearly $100,000 Saturday for a minor infraction.  It happened at the Omega Dubai Desert Classic.  Li was on the 18th green when judges accuses caddie of standing too close behind him as he got ready to putt.  Well, the ensuing penalty dropped Li's score from 71 to 73.  And he went from third to 12th.  Tour officials say the correct call was made but acknowledge it was grossly unfair.  They're looking at the giving referees more discretion in cases like this going forward.</p><p>And then, get ready for \"Toy Story 4\".  Pixar is putting out this teaser video, shows the revival of Woody's love interest, Bo Peep.  And she is back with a new, more modern look.  She was last seen in \"Toy Story 2\", back in 1999.  It is now 20 years later, \"Toy Story 4\" is going to be released, Maria, this June .  Those are your headlines from New York, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like it.  Bo Peep.  All right, thank you Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, the lingering effects of the shutdown showdown.  AFL-CIO Richard Trumka will join us to talk about the impact on American workers.  He's up next.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We are focused on the American worker this morning.  White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney saying that the 800,000 federal workers who were not paid twice during the partial government shutdown should receive those checks by the end of this week.</p><p>Joining us right now is American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organization's president, AFL-CIO, Richard Trumka.  It's great to see you, Richard.  Thank you so much for being here.</p><p>RICHARD TRUMKA, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR AND CONGRESS OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION:  Maria, thanks for having me on today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Give us your take on what the impact of the shutdown was.</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, I think there's several impacts.  There's impact on the people and you not only have government workers who get back pay but you have the government contractors who won't get back pay unless something is done.  That was a devastating effect on them.  It had a devastating effect on the economy itself.  $11 billion, although we'll pick some of that back up later in the year.</p><p>But you had a devastating effect on the airline industry where you had people, airline controllers, traffic controllers that were in school that actually just up and left.  They said we're not going to do this anymore (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What could -- what could have been done about it then, Rich?  Because you as the leader that you are and representing so many workers across the country have to be unnerved when you see open borders and illegals coming in and taking your jobs.</p><p>TRUMKA:  Look, that's just not how it works anymore.  I mean, you have people that got laid off from the president's place that have been here 20 years.  They're not taking anybody's job.  What we want to do is make sure every worker in this country has the same rights so that they can't be exploited.</p><p>Because what happens right now with undocumented workers is, they're great when no one's around.  When they try to organize and get a voice, then they start squeezing them.  They start ex -- you know, doing, calling in ICE and different things.</p><p>The idea is if everybody has the same rights, then they can't exploit those people and everybody can actually have a fair playing field.  What happens to American workers -- employers right now, is you have an employer that hires people, makes them work in unfair condition, misclassifies them, underpays them, and they're competing against our employer.  That employer needs to pay everybody the same rate, live by the same working conditions, so that we can all compete.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you're OK with illegals coming in and as long as everybody's treated the same?</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, Maria, it's a -- it's a nice cliche, illegals coming in.  But you know yourself that most people that are here undocumented or illegally came in legally.  So the whole system needs to be addressed.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, but there are apprehensions that we could look at, just in the month of December, just in the month of November, where apprehensions were of illegal immigrants coming in and wanting asylum in the United States.</p><p>TRUMKA:  There's no question that the system is broken.  We need to fix the system and have a path towards citizenship so that those workers that have been here for years and are actually making the economy run, even the president's golf courses and things like that, they have a chance to get citizenship and they work their work there.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Just a question on the golf courses.  As you know, that's the H2B program, people who come here as foreign workers, come under a specified amount of time for DOL.  I think the real question is is that, what happens to all the people, not who have been here who came legally and overstayed the visa, but what about all the people who come every day at the southern border and can cross into our country?  That's really the pernicious problem.  And even on wall, built with American workers, you'd be for that.</p><p>TRUMKA:  But listen, the people that come back and forth, you have Americans that go to Mexico and Mexicans that come to America to work.  I think Mexico --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you don't think there's a problem at the border at all?</p><p>TRUMKA:  I didn't say that.  There is -- there is a problem.  We do need border security.  And no, I don't think that a wall's the answer to it.  Every time someone's tried to build a wall it's not been very successful.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, the one in Tijuana is successful.</p><p>TRUMKA:  Ask the Chinese, ask the French.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The wall -- the wall in Tijuana --</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Ask Tijuana (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tijuana and San Diego, what abut that Richard?</p><p>TRUMKA:  I'm sorry?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The wall, between Tijuana -- separating Tijuana from San Diego, is that successful?</p><p>TRUMKA:  There are places -- there are places probably where it works.  Is that the answer to everything?  No.  Should that have been the reason for a shutdown?  Absolutely not.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  I want -- I want to ask a broader political question.  We've seen in the last two elections that increasingly voters, blue collar voters, voters in manufacturing towns all over America, the kind of rank and file people that you represent are voting for Republicans, they're going for Trump.  Does the AFL-CIO need to realign its own approach to politics in this town, given that more and more of its people are going with people like Donald Trump and his trade policies and the Republican Party?</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, that's a -- that's a question we could talk about two or three hours for.  First of all, we have realigned our politics.  We are issuing -- we're issue oriented right now.  We put an issue out and if a politician supports that issue, then we support them.</p><p>In fact, in this last election we elected two union members to the Senate, three to governorship, 18 to the House of Representative, and 925 to state legislatures, because those workers will go and support our issues.  That's what we try to do.  We find it more and more difficult to find Republicans that actually support us.  Now, the American worker believes that neither the political system --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got to jump.</p><p>TRUMKA:  -- or the economic system works for them.  They want somebody to change the rules.  That's why they voted for Trump.  If he changes the rules to their advantage, some of them will vote for him again.  If he doesn't, he stands a chance of losing those workers and right now he's losing those workers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Richard, thank you so much for joining us.  We appreciate it.  Richard Trumka there.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Show: MORNINGS WITH MARIA][Date: January 29, 2019][Time: 08:00:00][Tran: 012903cb.231][Type: SHOW][Head: Apple Disables Group FaceTime Function That Was Allowing Callers To Listen And View Without Your Consent; British Parliament To Vote On Brexit Amendments; Kudlow on the Economy; Craft Brewers Impacts from the Government Shutdown; Kudlow on China Trade][Sect: News; Domestic][Byline: Maria Bartiromo, Gerri Willis, Ashley Webster, Hillary Vaughn, Dagen McDowell][Guest: Steven Mnuchin, Larry Kudlow, Matt Schlapp, Jon Hilsenrath][Spec: FaceTime; Huawei; Apple; Brexit; Federal Reserve; 3M; Harley-Davidson; Verizon; Oath Media; Channel Inventory; World War II; CBO; Trade Talks; Deregulations; Tax Plan; China Trade; Slowdown; Government Shutdown]</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good Tuesday morning.  Welcome back, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  Live from Washington this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is January 29th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  Earnings in focus.  Investors watching results from several Dow components this morning ahead of the opening bell.  One to watch after the bell tonight -- after the close is Apple.</p><p>Meanwhile, Apple under fire FaceTime hit with a new bug that allows people to eavesdrop on you without your knowledge and even if you don't take the call.  Rising tensions with China, the U.S. brings charges against Chinese telecom company, Huawei as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  The very latest on the state of negotiations with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin coming up.</p><p>Markets are searching for direction this morning.  Take a look at the futures ahead of the open this morning.  Dow industrials picking up speed up 55 points right now, a quarter of a percent higher.  S&amp;P 500 is up two and the NASDAQ right now right now showing a gain of 11 points at the open in about an hour and a half.  This after declines across the board yesterday.  Stocks finished off of the lows, but nonetheless the Dow Industrials gave up 209 points yesterday 4:00, almost one percent lower.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 gave up 21 points, three quarters of a percent lower.  And the NASDAQ was down 79 points.  That was better than one percent lower yesterday.  Global markets this morning are mostly higher.  Take a look at European indices with the FT-100-is at the high of the morning, up 86 points, 1-1/4 percent ahead of the vote on Brexit.  CAC quarante in Paris us up 44 points and the DAX index up 21, fractional gain there.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets were little changed.  Take a look, it was pretty much across the board.  Now, our top story this morning, concerns of a global slowdown.  Last week in Davos I spoke with Bridgewater Associates founder, Ray Dalio, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, and Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey.  Here's what they said about the possibility of an economic slowdown on the horizon.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RAY DALIO, FOUNDER, BRIDGEWATER ASSOCIATES:  Europe has a negative growth and the United States is going to have a negative growth environment.  I don't mean absolute negative, I mean slowing of growth in a material way that could be close to between zero and two percent over the next 18 months.</p><p>BRIAN MOYNIHAN, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, BANK OF AMERICA:  We have the top research firm in the world, and they have done a great job.  And they have the U.S. growing at 2-1/2 percent this year.  The world growing 3-1/2 percent GDP growth.  But that's down from last year.  And so the confusion in the environment right now is a slowdown or is it going in to a recession?</p><p>Nothing we see says it's close to a recession.</p><p>JAMES QUINCEY, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, COCA-COLA:  I think we are in danger of talking ourselves into a problem.  It's just a little bit slower growth.  It's not a recession or a decline.  So we see -- we see a little -- a little softer 2019, maybe a little less tail wind than 2018.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now in a Fox Business exclusive is the treasury secretary of the United States, Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  Great to see you, Secretary.</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, UNITED STATES TREASURY SECRETARY:  Great to see you as well, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.  Your reaction to really what seems like now a unanimous feeling that a slowdown is on the horizon.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, Maria, from everything we see, the U.S. economy is still quite strong.  The companies are doing quite well.  And we see still tremendous investment in capital and human investments.  There's no question that as it relates to Europe and China, there is a slowdown.  We're monitoring that carefully.  But we still see a tremendous opportunity and a lot of capital coming into the U.S.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Federal Reserve basically told us they are on pause.  They may even pause the balance sheet unwind which is also telling us that the Fed is also expecting a slowdown, but do you believe a recession is on the horizon in 2020 even though you're seeing strength and stability so far?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  We see no indications whatsoever of a recession on the horizon.  And from everything we see from speaking to a large across the board businesses, the combination of tax reform, regulatory relief and trade is still has a very strong impact on the U.S. economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And some people are saying that the impact of certainly of trade and tariffs is causing some uncertainty.  So how much of this slowdown that we're expecting later on even if it's not right now is due to what you say you're watching China and Europe and how much of it is uncertainty around the President's tariffs program?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, Maria, as you said, there are people who expect a slowdown but I would just comment a year ago with the projections were 2-1/2 percent.  And we were at three.  We feel very comfortable we're going to hit three for last year.  And we think there's still a very good case for three percent this year.  Now, as it relates to trade, we couldn't be more pleased with the USMCA.  We are looking forward to Congress passing that quickly.</p><p>That's a very important trade deal.  We have two days of talks with China starting tomorrow.  The President is going to be involved in those talks at the conclusion.  We've been updating him.  We have another 30 days after this.  So I think we're making significant progress, and I think on the trade front, these are all very positive impacts for the U.S. economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about the trade talks because this story of China, first off, thank you to the President and to the administration for pushing back on China because that's another unanimous feeling out there, that the President did the right thing in terms of stopping China from some of its practices.  What are you expecting out of these talks?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, the President wants fair trade with China.  It's got to be reciprocal.  Right now China has free access into our markets, and we have limited access to there.  So the critical issue that we've talked about is market access, making sure there aren't forced joint ventures, not forced transfer of technology and that we have a mechanism that when we reach an agreement that we can monitor that agreement and that they'll live up to it.</p><p>And that's how I expect we will make significant progress this week on those issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How much of a priority is espionage?  Obviously the administration unveiling a sweeping set of criminal charges against Huawei Technologies.  We have had on a number of CEOs that have said yes, they have stolen trade secrets from us.  Has this come into the conversation with your Chinese leadership?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  No, let me be clear.  Those are separate issues.  And that's a separate dialogue.  So as it relates to the Huawei issues that's being run by the Justice Department.  I have no involvement in that.  I found out about that yesterday when it was announced.  So those are not part of trade discussions.  Forced technology issues are part of trade discussions but any issues as it relates to violation of U.S. law or U.S. sanctions are going through a separate track, which is the Justice Department.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, I guess the broader issue is, is this a cultural thing in China?  I mean this weekend on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" over on Fox News I spoke with the ranking member of the Intel Committee, House Intel Committee Devin Nunes and he went through some of the practices that China does every day.  Listen to this.  I've got to get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  China might have accessed allied intelligence shared with Poland and passed it on to Moscow.</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R), CALIFORNIA:  What the Chinese are doing is that they have these companies that are essentially owned by the party, the Communist Party and essentially this is a dictatorship.  There's very few people that own these companies.  They weaponize the.  So when all over the -- all over the world you have Chinese technology specifically as it relates to infrastructure on -- communications infrastructure, they will go in and they beat every other company around the world.</p><p>And in fact, they've driven a lot of companies out of business because they come in undercut.  They want to have control over all the com systems or communication systems all over the globe.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's pretty incredible.  We will handle your infrastructure of telecom and then they have a way in of spying.  How can you separate that from the conversation on trade and on forced transfer of technology?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Maria, I think you can easily separate these issues.  So there are two different issues.  One is an issue of state subsidies where they do subsidize state enterprises and they compete unfairly.  Those are trade issues, those are violations of the WTO and that's something from an economic standpoint.  We are going to enforce very seriously.  I think you know among the National Security Council, so I'm going to be careful what I say on national security issues.</p><p>But I assure you whether it's China or anywhere else in the world, our security services, DHS and others will make sure that we protect the U.S. infrastructure, we protect from cyberattacks.  That's something we're very well aware of.  But these are separate issues and shouldn't be confused.  We are focused on what are unfair economic practices.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So the best case that you can get from China is what?  Opening up their markets?  Already we are seeing some likelihood of that, UBS I guess was the first bank that was allowed to operate in China and own 51 percent of that bank.  They say they're going to go to 100 percent in three years.  Are you seeing a significant opening in terms of the Chinese willingness to open their markets to foreigners?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I do, but I think that's a good start.  But why should we have to wait three years for a U.S. company to own 100 percent in the financial services?  China can operate and own 100 percent of companies here.  So that's an example where, you know, they're moving in the right direction.  We want to speed that up.  But the issue is really we want to make sure that U.S. companies can compete fairly in China.</p><p>And if we can do that, China has a very large growing middle class.  It's an enormous market.  As I have said before, this is one of the biggest opportunities for U.S. companies in U.S. business if we can get this right.  And President Trump is determined.  This is the first administration that has aggressively said to China, you need to play fair.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is the President willing to drop all tariffs, should he get a good deal that's acceptable?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I think everything is on the table.  So the President is -- will look at, again, the objective is to have a very fair deal.  Hopefully we'll make progress this week.  The President will be involved in these negotiations and discussions.  And we've still got a lot of work to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the President said look, I'm a tariff guy.  I like tariffs.  So does that mean these tariffs are for, you know, no end in sight or would he be willing to drop the tariffs all together?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  The President hasn't made any decisions on that.  There have been no recommendations from the economic team on that yet.  The first step is to make sure we get a good agreement.  And when we get a good agreement, we'll make a recommendation to the President and he will consider that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have seen the Chinese economy get impacted.  You're still talking about 6.4 percent growth, we think, but that is lower than some people think.  What's your worry or how concerning is it that the Chinese slowdown will impact the United States?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, there's no question that China is slowing down.  They still have significant growth rates.  We're beginning to see the impact on that on world growth.  Our objective is not to slow down China.  Our objective is to make sure that U.S. companies can do business in China and can do business fairly.  So we're monitoring these issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary, stay with us.  We want to get into the shutdown and get your impact on how much the shutdown cost the economy and what you're expecting there.  Stay with us.  More of my exclusive interview with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin when we come right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are life live this morning in Washington, D.C.  And I'm sitting right now with -- in a Fox Business exclusive with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  And Treasury Mnuchin, we were talking about the broad economy.  I want to ask your thoughts on the shutdown.  The CBO says that the shutdown caused $11 billion impact to the economy, $3 billion which is completely lost because of the 35-day shutdown.  Your reaction?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Maria, Kevin Hassett, the CEA is working on final numbers for us.  I think his view is that there's no question that there was some cost but those costs will be recovered as money comes back into the system.  I think it's -- he views that it will almost all be recovered.  Now as it relates to the exact numbers, I haven't seen the final numbers yet.  But the good news is we got the government open.</p><p>People are back to work and we have not seen any significant impact on the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Has -- is the President prepared to shut down the government again in three weeks if he doesn't get the money for the border wall?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Maria, I had dinner last night with the President, the Vice President, Senator Lindsey Graham.  We had a very good discussion on this issue.  There's no question in my mind that the President, the Vice President want to do a fair deal.  Lindsey has been terrific in helping to negotiate this.  I hope the Democrats are sincere.  If they are, there's a sincere deal that will include a lot of different issues that need to be resolved.</p><p>But if they're not sincere, the President has all his options on the table.  And he's determined that he's going to make sure we have border security.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's the impact on the IRS?  There's a lot of worry out there that people are not going to get their checks after April 15th as a result of this shutdown.  What can we expect?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, let me just comment on both the treasury, our bureaus, the IRS in particular, I want to thank the enormous number of government employees who came in and worked during the shutdown.  I think as you know, we had the ability to bring in critical employees.  We never would have been able to do the sanctions that we've been doing over the last month without the hardworking people.</p><p>And the IRS had a large number of critical employees to make sure that we were ready to open for business as usual.  So we're ready to open for tax season.  We're taking tax returns.  We'll be ready for tax refunds.  We will have the phones restaffed.  Now, let me just say that there's no question, this time of the year, there's very, very heavy call volume.  That's something we have to manage.  I encourage taxpayers who have questions to try to go to the web first.</p><p>But we are ready for tax season, and I can assure you that tax refunds will be paid as normal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  So, tax refunds will be paid as normal.  That's the bottom line.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  People were worried about that.  Let me move to the sanctions and in particular Venezuela because you've applied sanctions on the Venezuelan oil industry.  Tell us specifically what the impact here is.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, sanctions are a very important tool in our national security portfolio.  And when we look at national security issues, we look at economic tools.  We look at diplomacy.  We look at national security tools, military options.  So there's no question that what we're trying to do is to cut off the money to the regime that should not be in power and make sure that the President Guaido has access to funds and has access to the assets of the country.</p><p>And to make sure we protect these assets for the people of Venezuela.  It's really quite sad.  This is a country that is very, very rich in oil resources that has had extraordinary poverty and extraordinary humanitarian issues over the last issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And have you spoken with the opposition leader party about this?  What has been the response so far?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I haven't personally, but I know the Vice President has been in communication.  I think the response has been very positive.  We've been very careful in balancing this.  We've -- I've spoken to many of the refineries over the last week.  I want to make sure that there was significant capacity.  There's a lot of oil on the water already in transit to the U.S. refineries.  So I think on the one hand, we've been able to cut off Venezuelan oil going forward.</p><p>But we're managing this with the U.S. refineries.  We've issued licenses for the U.S. refineries to continue to operate.  And if Venezuela wants to continue to sell us oil, which we would like to buy that money would go into blocked accounts and will be protected for the people of Venezuela.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what about other industries in Venezuela?  I mean, the sanctions are on the oil industry.  What about other money, other imports that they still get that?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  We will always look at additional sanctions.  We want to make sure that things like medicine and other humanitarian issues continue to go to the people.  We will always look at additional sanctions to make sure we protect the assets of the country for the people of Venezuela.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why was it important for the President to back the opposition leader?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I think he is the rightful leader of the country, the national assembly, the constitution.  I think, you know, democracy is very important to the people of the United States.  And we want to make sure that there are free and fair elections and that there is a proper democracy that's very important to the national security of the United States.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary, it's good to have you on the program.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you very much.  Secretary Steven Mnuchin joining us.  Coming up, earnings in focus.  Major companies reporting this week including Apple after the bell tonight.  What you need to know ahead of those numbers.  Then the U.K. facing a crucial test.  British lawmakers voting later today on measures surrounding the U.K.'s potential exit from the European Union.  Back in a moment with that.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Earnings driving markets this morning.  3M, Harley-Davidson, Verizon out with mixed reports this morning.  Gerri Willis is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange watching markets.  Gerri?</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  That's right.  3M, Dow component, a split decision here missing on estimates beating on revenue.  The EPS line $2.27 a share.  Revenue 7.95 billion.  They lowered their 2019 guidance.  But they say they're positioned for success in 2019 despite the global slowdown.  Stock trading higher.  Harley-Davidson, let's get to that, a big miss on both the top and the bottom line.</p><p>EPS of 17 cents a share.  Revenue of 955 million.  The stock is down and down hard this morning nearly 10 percent.  They're citing restructuring charges, incremental tariffs and recall costs.  Big troubles for the hog.  Verizon beating on EPs but missing on revenue.  We're seeing yet another split decision here.  EPS of a $1.12 a share.  Revenue of 34.3 billion.  The stock trading down nearly four percent here.</p><p>Profit hurt by the restructuring of Oath Media business as we have discussed.  Apple coming after the bell, this is critical earnings release for the markets here.  EPS estimate of $4.17 a share.  Revenue of 84 billion.  We will be focused like a laser on iPhone.  iPhone sales in China, is there an iPhone recession going on in China right now?  Watch Channel Inventory for some of the details about that.</p><p>Meanwhile, Apple having trouble with FaceTime.  A bug where callers can eavesdrop on FaceTime calls has cropped up.  The company says they are checking it.  But you should know that Tim Cook on Monday, well, he was saying big things about International Data Privacy Day asking users to insist on reforms.  Oops, I guess they got a problem.  Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Gerri.  Thanks very much.  Gerri Willis on Wall Street.  British lawmakers will debate several amendments to the U.K.'s planned exit from the European Union today and let Prime Minister Theresa May know what parliament is prepared to vote for.  Ashley Webster is live in London right now with that.  Ashley?</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.  Good morning, Maria.  This is if Parliament knows exactly what it will vote for.  There will be at least 15 amendments to choose from -- will be debated.  That will be up to the Common Speaker John Bercow.  He will decide which ones will be debated.  And it could indeed shape the future of what Brexit will look like moving forward.</p><p>Now, among the most popular amendments that we are expecting to be the debated will be what's called the Cooper amendment, that's Yvette Cooper, the Labour M.P.  It basically says if no deal is reached by February the 26th, it would postpone Brexit for nine months essentially to end of the year from march 29th, that's the date that exists now.  Then there's the Brady amendment, the Graham Brady (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>He basically is putting forward an amendment that would replace the Irish backstop with what is called alternative arrangements, such pretty vague, basically anything elsewhere and what we have now and there is no time limit on that backstop.  We have heard that Prime Minister Theresa May has already told European leaders that she wants to reopen Brexit negotiations.  Let's not forget, just last month, in December, the Prime Minister said it wasn't going to be reopened that the E.U had given her their best deal.</p><p>Now she wants to turn around and say look, you need to reopen negotiations.  I'm going to find out from Parliament what they are prepared to vote for and let's go from there.  And it calls today is January 29th.  The Brexit deadline, March 29th.  We have exactly two months left to go, Maria.  And let's be honest, there is no sign yet of a -- of a deal in place that a majority of people in Parliament can get behind.</p><p>Yesterday we had a whole series of warnings about what would happen if there was a no deal scenario.  Just crashing out retail consortiums saying, look, there's going to be empty shelves, prices are going to go up, a break in the supply chain.  It will be very, very detrimental to the British economy.  So that is the background.  Later on today, we'll find out what Parliament can get behind.  Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Ashley.  Thanks so much.  We'll check back with you.  Ashley Webster in London this morning.  Coming up.  The shutdown impact on your wallet.  I will be speaking with National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow on the economic effects of the shutdown.  Plus Federal debt reportedly headed to the highest level since World War II.</p><p>That is next.  One brewery feeling the impact.  The shutdown hitting one San Diego beer company.  We've got that story.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thank so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo coming to you live this morning from Washington, D.C.  It is Tuesday, January 29th.  Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Earnings season in full swing.  We have heard from Harley-Davidson, hit in the pre-markets after disappointing numbers.  Xerox as well headed higher after beating expectations.  Look at Harley-Davidson's shares down almost 10 percent right now.  China, one of the issues, once again.  Meanwhile rising tensions with China on the U.S. level.  The U.S. bringing charges against Chinese telecom company, Huawei, as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  Moments ago, I spoke with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin who talked about what the U.S. is looking for in the coming talks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MNUCHIN:  The President wants fair trade with China.  It's got to be reciprocal.  Right now, China has free access into our markets and we have limited access to there.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Futures this morning are higher.  Take a look, we have the highs of the morning right here with the Dow Jones Industrial average up 73 points, a third of a percent.  The S&amp;P 500 up 4-1/2, and the NASDAQ higher by 18 points, one-quarter of one percent.  European indices this morning are also higher.  Take a look.  FT-100 in London is up almost 100 points, 1-1/2 percent.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is up 55, better than one percent.  And the DAX Index in Germany up 37 points, that's one-third of one percent.  Asian markets mostly flat overnight as you'll see that was pretty much across the board with Japan and Korea squeaking out a fractional gain.</p><p>Our top story this half an hour, the cost of the government shutdown.  The CBO says about $3 billion out of 2019's projected GDP was completely lost due to the shutdown.  Joining me right now in a FOX Business exclusive is National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow.  Larry, it's great to see you this morning.</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for being here.  So obviously 35 days, government shutdown, CBO says $3 billion is lost.  Never coming back.  Your reaction.</p><p>KUDLOW:  With respect, once again, we disagree with the CBO.  I don't think we're going to lose anything.  This is completely temporary.  None of the incentives in the economy have been changed by this.  You know, that's the key point.  President Trump lowered marginal tax rates on individuals and most especially businesses.  And then he had this massive sweeping rollback of costly and burden regulations, which freed up the whole economy, including the energy sector, which has turned out to be a boom.  Why would we lose something just because of a temporary issue regarding the government?  Now, I'm always interested in sort of counting angels on the head of a pin.  We have about a $20 trillion economy, fair?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  There -- what was their number, three billion out of 20 trillion?  Do you know what the --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Three billion.  Yes, no, you're right.  You're right.</p><p>KUDLOW:  - percentage that is?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I totally understand.</p><p>KUDLOW:  I don't understand why we even mess with it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Actually, they're saying the total impact was $8-11 billion.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But that will come back, except for the $3 billion they say that is completely lost.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, again, with all due respect to the professionals at the CBO, I disagree.  Again, because the incentives in the economy -- here's the big difference between I guess the administration and the Congressional Budget Office and a lot of other forecasters.  We believe the economy is growing at three percent plus.  By the way, the Commerce Department for 2018 has scored I believe 3.1 percent.  We'll get the rest of those numbers in a week or two.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KUDLOW:  The CBO does not.  They never have.  They've never given us credit for the incentive effect of lowering taxes and regulations.  Supply side incentives are kicking in.  If you look at the whole panoply all of the economic data, whether it's very strong Christmas retail sales, whether it's industrial production, manufacturing, the best since the '80s, whether it's business equipment, which means the capex boom is happening that we always hoped for.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KUDLOW:  You'll see in my judgment, at least, the three percent trend line will continue.  CBO and many others have us at two.  But this goes back before the President.  This goes back way before.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  They don't believe the economy can grow.  They don't give any credit --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, even somebody like a Steve Schwarzman will say 4.2 percent growth in the second quarter is very hard to sustain on a $20 trillion economy.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, I'll keep working on Steve Schwarzman.  He's a good guy.  But in a $20 trillion economy, which again will grow rapidly, I see no reason why we can't continue three percent plus.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That's the whole point.  The idea that was sold to everybody I guess going back several years, maybe going back 10 or 15 years, that we're in some secular stagnation is just plain wrong.  With the right set of policies, to unleash --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- American animal spirit --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we saw that with the tax plan and the deregulation.  I totally get that.</p><p>KUDLOW:  And you look at the --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But what about tariffs and trade, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  The -- just one --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because the CBO'S report also brings that up.</p><p>KUDLOW:  One last one on this, the face of the new Trump economy -- I just want to put this in here, it's the thought I've had for quite a while.  These are men and women running small businesses.  These are blue-collar workers.  You look at the evidence, the employment for blue-collar workers, the best increase since the mid to late '80s, when I was a Reagan Cub Scout here in Washington, D.C.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  The wage rates of blue-collar manufacturing autos, they're rising faster than white-collar workers.  This is a direct result --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- of the incentives we've put into the economy.  CBO, again, it's not personal to my friends at the CBO, they don't give us any credit for these incentives.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No, I understand that.  But the --</p><p>KUDLOW:  And I want to stay with that story.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- the report on the trade policies estimated that new tariffs on imports and exports will cut an average of one-tenth of a percent from economic growth through 2029.  What's your take on that, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because we know that these tariffs are in place.  They still are impacting business and uncertainties.  So, is the President prepared to do away with all tariffs if he gets that agreement from the other side?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, I don't want to go there.  I mean, that's going to be his decision as you know.  Vice Premier Liu He is coming and we will have high level discussions Wednesday and Thursday and we're all looking forward to that, as is the President.  The President, as I read him, moderately optimistic about this trade story.  So, that's good.  What was it, one-tenth of one percent by 2029?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  So then here we are in 2019, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, no.  One-tenth of a percent from economic growth through 2029.</p><p>KUDLOW:  See, this is too hard, Maria.  It's way too hard --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- to figure that stuff out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you don't think there's going to be any -- there's --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Could it be possible that there's no impact from the shutdown?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Yes, quite possible.  I never -- it's utterly totally temporary.  So, that's -- let me --- look, let me go back -- the growth potential from China trade, people tend to look at this as a negative.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Look, I don't know the outcome of these talks.  Here's what I know, the scope of the discussion will be the broadest and deepest in the history of U.S.-China trade.  Literally everything's on the table.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Point number one.  Point number two, if China opens its markets --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is a big deal.</p><p>KUDLOW:  OK?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it looks like there's (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>KUDLOW:  Which is huge.  You know, I don't want to predict, and as Ambassador Lighthizer said a million times, and I agree, the enforcement mechanisms are going to be crucial.  But if they were to open their markets as we have requested regarding tariffs and non-tariffs, if they would let American companies own the subsidiary in China, so there's no forced transfer of the family jewels of technology, if we have --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But it --</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- some rule of law regarding I.P. theft, here's my point, open markets will allow the United States to export like crazy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But I understand that, Larry.</p><p>KUDLOW:  And that has been hand -- we've been handcuffed.  If we do that, if we do that, not only will the United States grow faster --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- because of that, China will grow faster.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That all sounds great, but can you actually do that, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Competition is the solution.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's the point, because if you're saying, \"OK, China, we are agreeing that you are opening your markets, and as a result, we will meet your demands, but then they say okay, but you have to have a communist, a government leader on the board of any company that has 100 percent.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Which is -- which is extraordinary, you're absolutely right.  It's extraordinary.  And it's --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So I mean -- so you could say it's great --</p><p>KUDLOW:  And unacceptable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- that you're going to open markets.</p><p>KUDLOW:  It's unacceptable.  It's unacceptable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But they -- aren't they saying that a communist has to be on the board of any company that has 100 percent?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I think that's been the past and I think that's going to be a very hot topic in these trade talks because that is completely unacceptable to us.  No question about it.  We will see how this turns out.  China, unfortunately, you know, they're in a slump.  China's economy is slumping very bad.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  I think part of that slump is a function of the President's tough negotiating with tariffs, when necessary, OK, part of that slump is in the last five to ten years.  China has moved in the wrong direction, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  The market-based reforms have been moving in their own direction.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But they're not market-based.  They are communists and they want communists on the board of -- So I'm just wondering, all of this sounds great, if you can actually get it done.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Oh, I know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Larry, stay with us.  We want to talk to you about other things because the tax plan and the deregulations have worked.  But there are some other ideas coming into play ahead of 2020.</p><p>KUDLOW:  China should not use the Venezuelan form of the economic policy.  We need to go back to who is it that said free market capitalism is the best path to prosperity?  It was the (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, that would -- that would be you and Ronald Reagan.  Stay with us.  We will be right back.  More with Larry Kudlow.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Thank you.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We come to you live this morning from Washington, D.C. and I am sitting with National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow, in an exclusive interview this morning.  And we were talking about China and what you can get done.  How important is tomorrow and Thursday in terms of meeting a deadline, that March 1st, in terms of a deal on the table?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I think's very important.  Look, I --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think you'll get a deal by March 1?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I don't want to predict.  It's just too hard to predict.  And, of course, these are decisions that will be made by the President, who is his own best negotiator.  Best I can is, as I said, the scope of this thing's going to as wide and broad as anything we have ever seen.  That does not ensure positive negotiator.  Best I can is, as I said, the scope of this thing is going to be as wide and broad as anything we've ever seen.  That does not ensure positive outcomes --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- right?  I think everybody, including the President, is basically moderately optimistic about this, OK?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Wait, let me ask you, your tax plan --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Ultimately -- one other thought which the President believes that he and President Xi will probably be the ultimate negotiators.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  OK?  And the work being done tomorrow and Thursday is vitally important to lay out options, OK?  But --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So the President will be involved in these talks tomorrow and Thursday?</p><p>KUDLOW:  That is what he has been saying in our meetings.  And I hope so because he's a great negotiator.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me move on to the tax plan.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because we're hearing a lot of ideas in terms of taxes now, now with a lot of 2020 hopefuls.  The Tax and Jobs Act obviously did move the needle on economic growth along with the deregulation out of this administration.  Now you've got Elizabeth Warren talking about two to three percent tax on the very high wealth people.  So if you have $50 million in wealth, you'll get two percent tax.  If you've got a billion dollars in assets, you'll get taxed three percent.  And you've got Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez talking about tax of 70 percent tax --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- on the highest earners.  What is your take on this?  Give us your reaction and what kind of an impact those policies might have.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Right.  These are prosperity killers, these are growth killers, these are job killers, these are incentive killers.  This is a return to some heavy government planning essentially direct to the economy.  You know, I hate to dwell on this because it's a crisis right now, but take a look at Venezuela, just for the heck of it.  What (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There was a time when that was vibrant -- it was a vibrate country.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That is correct.  That is correct.  And investment was flocking to it.  Then they took, down through the years, really exact measures you're describing that are coming from some of these Democratic candidates --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- and the economy was destroyed.  I mean I hear this notion we have to have equality, equality of income, equality of results, which I think runs counter to all human nature.  You know what?  A place like Venezuela has equality.  Everybody's poor.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think they'll be able to reverse the tax cuts then?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Everybody's poor in Venezuela, except for a hand -- Maduro and a handful of this top military people.  Is that what we want in America?  We are growing right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So will the Dems be able to reverse your tax cut plans?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Never.  Never, not until the President's configuration.  I -- look, first of all, if they want to try to raise taxes, it will be defeated in the Senate, Republican.  I personally believe even if it went beyond that --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- the President would veto any efforts to turn back his program.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How important --</p><p>KUDLOW:  We're doing what people said we couldn't do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But how important is debt?</p><p>KUDLOW:  They said we couldn't grow at three, four percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But how important is debt, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  We're growing at three, four percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Let's not mess with it.  If it ain't broke, don't fix it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Congressional Budget --</p><p>KUDLOW:  There's a tremendous surge in prosperity here shared by the middle and lower middle income people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Congressional Budget Office is saying that the deficit is hit -- set to hit $897 billion this year.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That would be the highest level since World War II.  When does debt become a priority?  Do you think the President, let's say he does have another term, will try to attack the entitlements?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, look, I think right now the two issues are maintaining economic growth.  You know, growth is the single biggest factor in these budget calculations.  Growth brings income and revenues.  And in fact I haven't gone through it with a fine-toothed comb yet, but I will.  I think I see that the CBO is acknowledging that our faster growth, which they did not predict, is now paying for over 80 percent of the tax cuts.  OK?  And I think you'll see more about that as we get through.  The reports just came out yesterday.</p><p>Second point I want to make is we will have a tough spending budget coming up in a few weeks, a very tough spending budget with reductions of at least five percent across the board, in non-defense accounts.  So I think that's going to be very important.  Let's minimize government where possible.  Let's grow the economy to its max.  And you will see the debt burden, which I thought debt, as a share of GDP, will be coming down, and by the way, it already is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  OK.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That's what happened during the Reagan years.  That's what happened during the John F. Kennedy years.  So, I wrote about it in my book.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That -- that's the best way to measure that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But, Larry, you know what I don't understand?  I mean you're all about growth, you have been for all your entire career.  Why are so many people worried about the slowdown?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why are we hearing some people say a recession is on the horizon?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, there's just -- it's funny in this town and I guess a little bit in New York, this is a lot of pessimism.  I don't --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you expect a recession this year or 2020?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I do not.  I don't see it right now.  If I look at financial indicators, credit spreads, the actual numbers, you know, it's just -- we -- GDP will come out a week late because the Commerce Department has reopened.  We've seen stuff like falling unemployment claims, rising manufacturing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But what are the markets telling us, Larry?  In the month of December, there was no high-yield debt issuance at all.  Credit markets are still tight.</p><p>KUDLOW:  They've come back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They've come back a bit.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Come back.  I like that.  Profits, the mother's milk of stocks, I don't know who first that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You did.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Profits, the mother's milk of stocks are rising.  The early indications are they won't to 25 percent but they're going to rise 10, to 15 percent.  I like that a lot.  Interest rates, the level of rates, are historically low.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you're not worried about market volatility?</p><p>KUDLOW:  There's a million things to worry about when I get up in the morning, you know, mainly getting here on time so I could do this great interview.  But I just want to say, if you look at the sum total of all the evidence right now, there's no recession out there.  I am the happy warrior.  I am an optimist.  President Trump is an optimist.  I think America, right now, we are the hottest economy in the world and we should remain so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll end it there.  Larry Kudlow.  Good to see you, sir.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow.  Back in a moment.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The government shutdown may be over, but the effects are still being felt.  Hillary Vaughn is live this morning at a craft brewery in Escondido, California where the shutdown effects are actually still lingering.  Hillary.</p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Hi, Maria.  Good morning.  Craft beer is a $76.2 billion industry, and for many craft breweries, like Stone Brewery, where we are today, the effects of the government shutdown are not over.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOMINIC ENGELS, CEO, STONE BREWING:  When the industry craft is built on seasonal beers, it's built on new beers, it's the new sexy thing, and if we can't get the new sexy thing to market, then we're not going to connect with our fans.  They're going to be disappointed.  We're going to make the sales numbers we planned to make in our financial plans, and these things will have repercussions.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUGHN:  As Federal workers at the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau are finally back in the office, a mountain of paperwork is waiting, about 11,000 applications for alcohol labels have been backlogged leaving craft breweries waiting to ship and sell all their new beer across state line, which means they're in limbo until these approvals go through.  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Hillary.  Thanks very much.  We've be watching that.  Hillary Vaughn.  Stay with us.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  President Trump is tweeting this morning.  He's talking about a former staffer.  Here's what he just said.  \"A low level staffer that I hardly knew named Cliff Sims wrote yet another boring book based on made up stories in fiction.  He pretended to be an insider when, in fact, he was nothing more than a gofer.  He signed a non-disclosure agreement.  He is a mess.  Dagen McDowell, great to see you this morning thank you so much.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  John Hilsenrath, Matt Schlapp.  I don't know why the President tweets this.  He's got how many million view, you know, users and followers.  He just let everybody know who this guy is like --</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, THE AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Well, he literally sat in a -- he sat in a cubicle outside my wife's office in the West Wing, and so it is kind of amazing like this insider whole kind of mythology is something the President knows is not true.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  But he's got some extra sales thanks to that tweet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  That's what I'm saying.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think, Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  Again, everybody's got a book to write.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jim Comey, this guy.  Hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Oh, that was a good answer.  Hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, Jim Comey's book, yes, well, there's -- I think that will be a story that we're going to continue following, Jim Comey and the FBI.  You know what.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Everybody wants to be Norma Desmond, Maria.  I'm ready for my close up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  Thanks, everybody.  Great panel today.  Great to see you Dagen McDowell, Matt Schlapp, Jon Hilsenrath.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TECHWR-2172770028</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TECHWR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W2T-RYV1-DY0W-4262-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">352430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"24032\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good morning, everyone, I'm Maria Bartiromo, thanks for joining us live this morning from Washington.  It is Tuesday, January 29th, your top stories right now 6:00 a.m. on the east coast.  Earnings in focus this morning, investors are watching results from several Dow components ahead of the open this morning.  The one to watch after the close is Apple.  We've got everything you need to know this morning previewing the report.  Apple under fire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile, FaceTime hit with a new bug that lets people eavesdrop on you without your knowledge.  How you can fix it, coming up -- big story.  Rising tensions with China meanwhile, the U.S. bringing charges against Huawei as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  The very latest on state of negotiations with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin this morning.  That interview at 8:00 a.m. Eastern, join us for that.  PG&amp;E makes it official, California's largest utility filed to bankruptcy protection, following the massive wild fires.  We've got all the details, coming up.</p><p>Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz roasted.  The billionaire hackled at an event last night as he gears up toward a possible independent run for the White House.  We've got a big show this morning coming from D.C., U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is here, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow is here along with House Minority, California Congressman Kevin McCarthy.  Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell will join me, along with AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka.  Don't miss a moment of it.  We've got a big three hours, coming up.</p><p>And we turn now -- right now, we kick it off with Wall Street markets.  We're looking to see a rebound this morning.  Take a look at Futures actually have just turned negative once again.  Futures down just fractionally, about 6 points on the Dow Industrials; 1-1/2 points lower on the S&amp;P; and the NASDAQ down 13 points.  This, after stocks finished lower yesterday on China growth fears along with weak guidance from Nvidia and Caterpillar.  We told you -- the Caterpillar numbers right here.  And of course, it did worsen throughout the day as investors react to a weaker-than-expected earnings and guidance.</p><p>Joining me right now is Federated Investors Chief Equity Market Strategist, Phil Orlando.  And Phil, it's good to see you this morning.</p><p>PHIL ORLANDO, CHIEF EQUITY MARKET STRATEGIST, FEDERATED INVESTORS:  Thanks for having me back, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All indications that we are seeing a slowdown and worries around China, among other issues, how do you see the markets here as more earnings have come into play?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, you had this 20 percent waterfall decline in stock prices in the fourth quarter of last year, we thought the market was attempting to price in the prospect of recession this year.  Multiples contracted from 18 times earnings down to 14 times earnings.  In our view, there's no risk of recession this year.  So, the rally that we've seen over the last month, 14 percent rally, the market is starting to price in the fact that maybe we're not going to have a recession.  But we've had a 14 percent rally in a month.  That's very, very powerful.  We would absolutely expect some consolidation here over the next month or two particularly as we've got these critical sign posts coming up in the month of March, but as we look out over the balance of the year, we do think that multiples will return to that 18 level, and we're going to end up with a pretty good year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  To what do you attribute the slowdown?  We've got earnings in focus and we're looking at a number of companies out that give weaker-than-expected guidance or miss on the top line.  Lockheed Martin, Pfizer, and Verizon are reporting this morning.  Apple is, of course, out after the bell, so when you look at the earnings picture, where in terms of industry are you seeing the most slowdown?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, I think in a word, uncertainty is what's impacting earnings and guidance to some degree.  You've got the Fed flip-flops that we saw in the fourth quarter last year, the uncertainty about whether or not the United States and China are going to be able to consummate this trade deal.  You've got Brexit overhanging on the global market and certainly the government shutdown, which was up there for 35 days, and it was just temporarily resolved last Friday.  You've got a number of issues there, all of which are impacting companies in some way, shape or form.  So, with earnings up 25 percent year-over-year in the first three quarters of last year, this fourth quarter is a little softer, I think we're up about 13 percent.  So far, we're about a quarter of the way through the earnings season.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>ORLANDO:  And I think what companies are pointing to are some combination of those four issues that I just mentioned.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you mentioned the shutdown.  The shutdown apparently costing the economy $11 billion according to new analysis from the Congressional Budget Office, although Larry Kudlow is disputing that number, and he's going to join us this morning live to talk about it.  The report says that it hit $3 billion, that's one-tenth of a percent of economic activity in the fourth quarter alone.  So, are there sectors that were -- that were hit hardest in that regard, or do you want to look at those companies that are largely tied to the China trade as one area of the real weakness?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the council of economic advisers under Trump had advised us that the shutdown was going to take about one-tenth of one percent out of GDP per week.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, remember, the shutdown started right around Christmas, so that makes sense that we lost, you know, a tenth of a percent in the fourth quarter, you know, maybe a half a percent here in the first quarter.  We're at 1.7 percent GDP growth in the first quarter, consensus blue chip is around 22, 23.  So, we think this pretext a little high and there will be, you know, sort of a downward revision as we get later in the quarter.  But in terms of industries, I think it's really across the board.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Across the board.</p><p>ORLANDO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about technology because it's big week for tech, Apple, of course, the big story today, reporting after the close tonight -- the only big tech reporting.  Microsoft, Facebook out tomorrow, Amazon is out on Thursday.  This is the week that we'll focus on technology and that's where really the growth stories have been.  Would you want to put new money to work in any of these names ahead of their earnings?</p><p>ORLANDO:  Short answer is probably no.  Again, you've had this 14 percent rally here in the last month, you've got concerns about slowing economic growth both in the U.S. and China.  We think that those issues will be resolved as we get into the back half of the year, but right now, you know, why run the risk of putting new money to work after you've had a big rally in some of these names ahead of what could be a disappointing earnings number or perhaps conservative guidance.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, the stock has come down because people were worried about it.  So, we'll see what the numbers are.  Would you, at some point, go back in to tech?  What's your favorite group right now, Phil?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, the areas that we like best in the U.S. markets are energy, financial services, industrials, and health care.  In terms of looking overseas, emerging markets look very attractive to us.  So, the areas that have really gotten hit the most are the ones that we've been attracted to.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there.  So, the valuations are better, I guess, is what you're saying.</p><p>ORLANDO:  The valuations are much more attractive.  We think the fundamentals are still very strong.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Phil, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>ORLANDO:  Great to see you.  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Phil Orlando joining us there.  Meanwhile, a bug in Apple's FaceTime app lets users listen in someone's phone without even the person knowing.  Dagen McDowell, what's happening this morning?  Good morning to you, Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well, Apple has some explaining to do, but particularly on this earnings call this afternoon.  So, there's a bug in the Apple iPhone that would allow people to eavesdrop on FaceTime users' calls.  A FaceTime user calling another person could listen in while the recipients phone is still ringing even if the person never accepts the call.  This was -- it involves several steps in the Group FaceTime feature on the iPhone.</p><p>Apple has disabled that Group FaceTime while it tries to come up with a fix for this, but you can eavesdrop in on somebody, essentially listening through the microphone, even if a person never takes that call, you could eavesdrop on rooms with unattended devices and even receive unauthorized video from the phone.  And again, it would take several steps to do this, but this is coming from a company, Maria, that loves to brag about its privacy protections and even throws shade at the likes of Facebook and other technology companies.</p><p>And adding embarrassment to embarrassment, yesterday was International Data Privacy Day and Tim Cook was tweeting about that.  Here's what he said on Twitter yesterday before this bug, this eavesdropping bug was disclosed.  We must keep fighting for the kind of world we want to live in.  On this Data Privacy Day, let us all insist on action and reform for vital privacy protections.  The dangers are real and the consequences are too important.  Big whoops for Apple, and of course, everything that happens in the business world is a political opportunity.  The Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo had to weigh in on this as well, putting out a statement late yesterday, say, \"Urging FaceTime users to temporarily disable the app.  So, Apple beat him to it, they're trying to fix it.  Embarrassment nonetheless.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible because you don't even know -- I mean, the phone could be ringing and you don't even know that they're listening.  I mean, that's the worst part of it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  I can explain later as the show goes on how this work, but you'd have to place a FaceTime call, go to the group, add yourself to the call and then the recipient of the call would have to hit maybe one like the on-button on the phone in order to activate it, but it was possible, and it was all over the internet yesterday how to do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, if -- so, if it's -- if it's not on and you say -- and you do -- and you decline the phone call, they can't listen in?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Unless you -- but you can't touch the phone at all.  Like, it's not even declining the phone.  Like, if you hit the up -- the up volume button on the phone, and so if I was playing this trick on you, it would activate it, and they could essentially hear what was going on in the room.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Unbelievable.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  I want to hear more about that, for sure.  Meanwhile, there's this, as expected, PG&amp;E filed for bankruptcy protection following those devastating wildfires in California.  Cheryl Casone on that in headlines right now.  Cheryl, good morning to you.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  Well, PG&amp;E is facing roughly about 30 billion in potential liabilities, as investigators are looking into whether the company's equipment played a role in starting California's deadliest fire.  More than 100 people died following a series of wildfires that burned hundreds of thousands of acres over a two-year period.  The utility providing energy service to 60 million people, we should add.  Taking a look at shares of PG&amp;E, look at that, in the premarket down nearly nine percent.  And those loses have actually paired back in the last hour or so, folks.</p><p>Well, China's Vice Premier has arrived in Washington for high-level trade talks that are going to start tomorrow.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and trade representative Robert Lighthizer will attend the two-day meeting.  Yesterday, the Trump administration announced a pair of indictments against Chinese telecom giant, Huawei.  The U.S. is accusing the company of trying to steal trade secrets from T-Mobile.  The Justice Department also charging Huawei with conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran.</p><p>And the China story continues, folks, shares of Nvidia are lower this morning.  The chipmaker is warning investors, and expects much weaker sales thanks in part, yes, to China's slowing economy.  It also previously cautioned the sales of its graphics processors that are used in video games PCs would be disappointing.  The China effect continues.  Chips for video gaming account for more than half of their business, they lost half their market value since hitting their peak back on October 1st, Maria.  So, Goldman Sachs had to come out last Friday, Maria, warning that a lot of these chip companies that have massive exposure to China are going to have really rough reports.  Micron Technology, even Wynn Resorts, the casino company, has got big China exposure, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, for sure.  All right, Cheryl, thanks so much.  Coming up next, five police officers are injured this morning, four of them shot while serving a search warrant.  The very latest coming up.  And then a venti-size disaster for Howard Schultz last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire (BLEEP).</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Former Starbucks CEO having a rough time exploring a 2020 Presidential run as he gets heckled.  We break it down right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Live from Washington, we are eyeing 2020, former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz facing backlash last night on his first stop of his book tour.  It was his first public appearance after announcing a possible Independent Presidential run.  It did not begin smoothly.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire (BLEEP).  Go back to getting ratio'd on Twitter.  Go back to Davos with the other billionaire elite who think they know how to run the world.  That's not what democracy needs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, my goodness.  Schultz is also facing backlash from former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.  Here's what he tweeted: \"In 2020, the great likelihood is that an Independent would just split the anti-Trump vote and end up re-electing the President.  That's a risk I refused to run in 2016, and we can't afford to run it now.\"</p><p>Here with me this morning to talk more about all of that is Dagen McDowell back in New York, Wall Street Journal Global Economics Editor Jon Hilsenrath here in D.C. with me, along with the American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp.  Gentlemen, it's good to see you.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Welcome to Washington.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, thank you so much.  And welcome to presidential politics, Howard Schultz.  What do you think about that?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Well, I'm going to get some popcorn.  This could be a real interesting Democratic primary, and whatever this Independent thing is, don't you love Michael Bloomberg who has probably spent a million dollars on polling, trying to figure out every way to become the President.  Publicly chastising Schultz for running as an Independent when that's exactly what Bloomberg would just love to do if he could.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  You know, on the one hand, Dagen, I feel like there is an opening for an Independent because there's such extremes and radical conversation going on certainly on the left.  And on the other hand, I don't know, how much is a cup of coffee at Starbucks?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Again, that $18.00 cup of Joe, I'm joking, I'm exaggerating.  It's helping --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think it's like $6.00.  I mean, seriously.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, we love cart coffee around this place.  But again, that's helping fund this run.  But Michael Bloomberg -- you know what, Michael Bloomberg should run for the Democratic nomination if he thinks he can win, it's just hilarious to have this multibillionaire lecturing Howard Schultz about an Independent run when actually a cup of Starbucks coffee has more charisma than Michael Bloomberg, number one.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Number two, it's going to be really interesting to see the narrative in the spring of 1992 with Ross Perot was -- Ross Perot was going to divide the Democratic vote, that it wouldn't hurt the Republican.  This could very well -- I mean, it depends on who -- what Howard Schultz says on the campaign trail and how far-left the Democrats go when they're running for the nomination.  But I'll say this, what he said so far about pay -- how to pay for Medicare For All and how that's impossible, I would be really interested to hear him talk about how to fix the health care system, because he might come to the table with some really interesting ideas and force the Democrats to answer the hard questions about paying for this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that is the thing, I mean, this party unfortunately, it's very hard for someone who's a centrist to actually have a shot.  You had Tim Ryan from Ohio, he wanted to do it, he's an economic thinker, he doesn't have a shot because of the same thing, you've got the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's 70 percent tax rate, the loudest voice in the room.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I mean, there's no question that these primaries are starting out very much from the left, you know, you have talk about a wealth tax, and 70 percent high-income tax threshold.  You have Elizabeth Warren who is going around beating up on the banks.  This is definitely a left-leaning primary season that we're going to be going into.  What I find so fascinating is the journeys that these different billionaires are traveling.  You know, you had President Trump who supported a lot of Democrats as a businessman in New York City traveling over to Republican Party, now you have Michael Bloomberg who started out as a Republican Mayor --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- traveling over to the Democratic Party, and Howard Schultz doesn't know where to go.  He doesn't know where he fits in.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He doesn't know where -- and what about Senator Kamala Harris?  Let's listen to her, because she held a CNN Townhall meeting in Iowa last night.  Harris is vowing to eliminate private health insurance with Medicare For All if elected president.  What's your take, Matt?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Making insurance companies illegal.  Look, the Democratic Party has become quite radicalized.  Think about this, less choices for the patient is the solution to our problems.  That seems insane.  Also, do we really think the government, when you get your tags to drive your car, or when you pay your taxes at the IRS, do you really think all the solutions to our problems are there?  I don't.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Let me ask you this, who does President Trump want to see come out of this whole --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think he wants Howard Schultz to run.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think -- he was taunting him yesterday.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH:  No, besides Howard Schultz, among the Democrats, who does he -- who does he want to (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>SCHLAPP:  I think most Republicans -- I'm not going to speak for the President -- but I think most Republicans believe that Elizabeth Warren is so far out there on the loony left, basically Marxism, socialism that I think they find that a delicious opportunity.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Can I --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- call the confiscation, Dagen.  He called it (INAUDIBLE) I mean, this two or three percent tax on assets, confiscation.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It is wealth confiscation.  It's totally communist and then to try and find people when they hand in their U.S. citizenship when other countries come calling, wanting you move there because they won't come and take your hard-earned money.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  One thing I want to point out that Jon Hilsenrath said that Howard Schultz doesn't know where to go.  President Trump should be worried about a Howard Schultz, because what if he comes to the table, like I said, with ideas that appeal to voters in this country who feel left out.  Who left out from the Republican Party and certainly left out by the left-leaning Democrats in this environment.  So, be very, very careful.  And one other thing I'll add with Howard Schultz at that -- at that bookstore, that's just the New York City welcome wagon.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's the way they treat all tourists in this city.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, I think you make a good point because there is that path.  That path of centrism.  I mean, that path of the center, because people do feel like it's gone wacky all the way on the left, for sure.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  It's a centrist country, but don't forget Hillary.  She's making noises.  Maybe that's the President's favorite opponent.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH:  We haven't seen any --</p><p>SCHLAPP:  She's making noises.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  We haven't seen anyone travel that centrist path as an Independent to presidency.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  So, it was a smart move on Howard Schultz's part.  We'll see.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Or a risky one for all those billions --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, certainly risky.  Take a quick break.  Extreme weather warning meanwhile on the other side of this break, millions of people across the country are gearing up for an Arctic blast as temperatures are plummeting, that's next.</p><p>Then showing their cards, British Prime Minister Theresa May asking Parliament to put up its plans from Britain's exit from the E.U.  Details on the historic debate.  And the vote happening later today, back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  It is cold out, and the deep freeze is setting in, hitting millions of Americans with subzero and dangerous temperatures.  Fox News Senior Meteorologist Janice Dean in the Fox Weather Center right now with the very latest.  Janice, tell us about it.</p><p>JANICE DEAN, FOX NEWS SENIOR METEOROLOGIST:  Hi, Maria, yes, we could be dealing with historic lows.  These are current windchills, what it feels like when you go outside and you are not protected.  Dangerous, potentially life-threatening windchills of -41 in International Falls, -18 in Chicago, but we still have another blast behind this.  So, these are morning lows, these are not windchill temperatures: Chicago -25 on Thursday, -31 in Minneapolis, -16 in Detroit.  Again, those are not windchill values.  Those are actual air temperatures.  But with the windchill, in some cases, we could get windchill values of -40 to -50.  If you go outside, your skin is going to freeze in minutes.</p><p>So, here's Chicago, Illinois.  Your all-time record low is -28.  So, we're going to flirt with historic lows, Maria.  This is a big deal.  The good news is it won't be long lasting.  By the weekend, we'll start to rebound, but I also want to make mention with this arctic cold front as we have snow across the deep south.  Snow that could cripple travel across portions of Atlanta, Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, and towards the southeast, so that's another dangerous part of the storm is the -- not only extreme cold but the snow as far as south as the gulf coast.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Janice.  Wow, what a story, thank you so much.</p><p>DEAN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will be watching.  Janice Dean.  Coming up next, the State of the Union is back on, it is February 5th.  Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi extending an invitation to the President, he accepted the offer.  Then, we're taking a look at the enormous cost of the shutdown.  What is the real number?  Plus, place your bets, Super Bowl fans getting ready to throw down an enormous amount of cash.  So, bet on the big game Sunday.  We break down all the numbers.  Stay with us.  Live from Washington this morning.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us.  We are coming to you live from Washington this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, January 29th, your top stories right now 6:31 on the east coast right now.  Earnings season is in full swing, a lot of big names reporting their fourth quarter today.  Xerox and Pfizer set to report in just a few moments, we'll bring you the numbers as soon as they hit the tape, and tell you how they are impacting markets.  Rising tensions with China, the U.S. is bringing charges against Huawei, as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will be my special guest, in about 90 minutes time.  We will break it all down with the Treasury Secretary, coming up.  So, stay with us.</p><p>Meanwhile, Futures relatively flat this morning, take a look at markets, down 20 points on the Dow Industrials, down 4 points on the S&amp;P, down 18 points on the NASDAQ.  We are expecting some pressure at the start of trading this morning, after all the major indices finished lower, yesterday, on Wall Street.</p><p>In fact, at 4:00, the Dow Industrials gave up 208 points, that was almost 1 percent lower, the S&amp;P 500 down 21, that was three quarters of a percent lower, and the NASDAQ with a 79-point decline yesterday, at the close, down better than 1 percent.</p><p>Investors are watching some big news this week, J.P. Morgan, calling this week the most important week of the first quarter, and here is why, you've got earnings, you've got the British vote, you've got U.S.-China trade talks, you've got a Federal Reserve decision, we're not expecting a Fed hike.</p><p>We've got fourth quarter GDP coming out.  And, of course, at the end of the week, the job's report for the month of January, a big week, investors want to watch it and will be covering it all.</p><p>European indices this morning look like this, in terms of trading.  We are looking at gains in Europe.  The FT-100 up one and a quarter percent, 86 points higher, the CAC Quarante in Paris is up a half a percent, 26 points higher, and the DAX Index in Germany, higher by a fraction, as you can see there.</p><p>Asian markets overnight, flat, take a look.  No real moves there, because mover was the KOSPI Index in Korea, up a quarter of a percent.</p><p>Well, there is tragedy in Houston to report, five police officers injured.  Four of them shot, while serving a search warrant.  We have the very latest, coming up.</p><p>And a debate in parliament, British lawmakers set to vote on the latest plan for the U.K. to leave the European Union.  We are previewing that and we will take a look at the impact across the world.</p><p>We've got a big program this morning from D.C., U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is coming up this morning, along National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow, they will take a look at all of these expectations that the economy is slowing.</p><p>Plus, House Minority Leader and California Congressman, Kevin McCarthy, is with us, along with Michigan Congresswoman, Debbie Dingell.  Plus, AFL CIO, President Richard Trumpa, here as well, big show, don't miss a moment of it, big three hours, coming up. And we are kicking off this half an hour right now, with this top story, feeling the effects of the shutdown, Washington, D.C. back in business for now, President Trump will give his State of the Union of Address on February 5th, Tuesday.  The address was originally supposed to be today.</p><p>Even though the shutdown is over, the U.S. is still feeling effects, new numbers from the Congressional Budget Office to report.  The U.S. GDP will be $3 billion lower during the fourth quarter of 2018, because of this shutdown.  On the immigration front, backlogs of immigration courts grew by at least 10 percent, according to Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about all of that is Americans for Tax Reform President, Grover Norquist, Grover, good to see you.</p><p>GROVER NORQUIST, PRESIDENT, AMERICANS FOR TAX REFORM:  Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So, the CBO is talking about a $3 billion-dollar hit, in fact, as a result of the shutdown, Larry Kudlow is having an issue with this.  He says, frequently disagrees with the CBO anyway.  What's your take in terms of what the shutdown cost the economy?</p><p>NORQUIST:  Look, the key thing is that the economy continues to grow and we're looking at a three percent rate of growth for the year, so $3 billion is a big number, unless you compare it to the GDP of the United States in the fourth quarter.</p><p>So, actually, we're doing fairly well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You don't think it had much of an impact then, Grover?</p><p>NORQUIST:  No, it's a small impact and we have a tremendous growth for the year, which is way beyond what the CBO said was possible, when they scored this.  The CBO needs to spend a little more time going back to explain why they were so wrong on all of their recent predictions, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  Go ahead.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Grover, the Federal Reserve and most of the economist that we surveyed at the Wall Street Journal are saying that the economy is slowing down in 2019.  We had a nice burst in 2018 in part, because of tax cuts and in part, because there's more spending, $300 billion of additional spending.</p><p>But now, they say the economy is slowing along with the global economy, what does that say about the impact of these tax cuts, are the tax cuts really created the long-run growth that Republicans said was going to happen?</p><p>NORQUIST:  The tax cuts do two things.  We were at 35 percent rate, which is the highest in the world.  It made sense for an American company like Burger King to be bought by Canadian company, because even though they're selling the same hamburgers, the same number of employees, it was worth more, because we had a worldwide tax system at 35 percent.</p><p>By taking 35 down to 21, we became competitive with Europe.  I mean, our friends, the Germans were at 25, the Japanese were at 25.  I'm sorry, the Japanese were at 30.  The Chinese were at 25.  And we were at 35.  We weren't even close to being competitive.  It's a huge change in the direction for the country.</p><p>And if the CBO tells you they're pessimistic, they didn't think you could do three percent, they laughed at three percent growth, said you could never do more than --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  The question is, is that three percent growth.  I think a lot of people understand that the corporate tax rate was uncompetitive, even some Democrats wanted to lower their corporate tax rate, but the question is, this new tax code that we've got, is that sufficient to sustain the three percent growth in 2019?</p><p>NORQUIST:  It's a good first start.  We also need to do something about the workforce.  We need more workers and frankly, there's more tax reduction that needs to be done and spending restraint is very important at the end of the day.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  I want to go back to this question about a shutdown, Grover, which is, people are saying, they're almost using the reason why you couldn't cut government, because somehow, that would have a negative impact on our economic growth.  That seems like a very dangerous road to go down.</p><p>Isn't it true that all of this money that they are saying didn't get put into the economy, are you worried that the government actually won't spend all of that by the time that the authority over the money, expires?</p><p>NORQUIST:  For the government to -- I was taught this (INAUDIBLE) economics in college also.  The government takes your money, and then spends it.  It's much better for the economy than if it lets you spend it.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Right.</p><p>NORQUIST:  Because you would waste some of it by investing it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because they can spend money better than you, of course.</p><p>NORQUIST:  And that's the oddest thing because, of course, that's nonsense.  East Germany should have done very well, under this theory, but it doesn't, so --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  What the government is doing is borrowing other people's money and spending it, right?  I mean, we're talking about deficits that are nearing a trillion dollars.</p><p>NORQUIST:  The (INAUDIBLE) cost the government is how much the government spends, whether they borrowed or take it, it's still gone from the -- from the real economy.  The cost of government is total government spending.  We should have taxes low, and then the least destructive way possible, all taxes are somewhat destructive.  And you have less borrowing if you have less spending.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what about all of these new plans?  And by the way, we are getting earnings right now, as we're talking 3M and Xerox, both beat expectations, although 3M is cutting its forecast for the year.  What about all of these ideas about taxing the wealthy?  New York Congressman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez claims for a 70 percent marginal tax rate on the tippy top, as she calls it.</p><p>Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts senator, hopeful, for 2020, two percent tax on Americans whose assets exceed 50 million.  If you're a billionaire, three percent, what's the impact?</p><p>NORQUIST:  OK, magicians like to do this, so you're not looking at, you know -- watch my right hand, don't look at the left hand.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NORQUIST:  The reason they talk about high tax rates on rich people, is that they want to gouge the middle class.  The difference between the United States and Sweden, Finland, Denmark, the countries that Cortez talked about is, they don't have the 70 percent rate, just back up for sec -- there isn't a country in the world with a 70 percent income tax rate.</p><p>Many countries used to, the Beatle song, 19 for me, one for you, 95 percent tax rate, and then the Beatles moved to United States, and everybody who could pay tennis, left Sweden.  And all the countries of the world realize that tax rates that high were stupid and destructive and didn't help equality or growth or anything like that.</p><p>So, they got rid of them.  The whole world got rid of them.  We did it, it was stupid.  We back offed it and had strong economic growth as a result, so 70 percent stupid and destructive.  It's not America saying, the world says that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You probably showed the op-ed today, in the Journal, in California, and taxes as well.  The Journal, this week, by Cypress founder, T.J. Rodgers, which was very good, Another California Tax Grab, he writes.  In it, the politicians have fueled an affordability crisis that drives away businesses and exacerbates homelessness.</p><p>California Governor, Gavin Newsom, called for even higher taxes in his inauguration speech earlier this month.</p><p>NORQUIST:  California is a good example of 70 percent play.  They have a 13 percent rate on people making a million dollars, but they have 8 percent rate on people making $42,000.  So, they want the middle class people in California to think you're OK, because we're really screwing the other guy.</p><p>And point of fact, Florida has a zero percent first income tax, Texas has a zero percent first income tax, 8 percent looks good compared to 13.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NORQUIST:  Looks lousy compared to zero percent.  They want the middle class to think somebody else is paying the freight.  That's why they have those phoney high tax rates that don't raise much money.  It's to fool the middle class.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it is talking point, and it works for the populist.  Let me bring in Dagen McDowell on this, because we hear this every time we go into the tax discussion and we have a Democrat on which takes out another one of those talking points on taxes, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And I want to say that Senator Kamala Harris said that the first thing -- she said it last night, in the town hall, he first thing she do is to cut taxes for the middle class.  Well, roughly half this country pays no net federal income tax, number one, and the Republicans just did that particularly, doubling the standard deduction.</p><p>So, I don't know who she's going to cut taxes for.  But this is the ruse and this is the big liberal lie that all of these big new welfare state initiatives, whether it's green energy, even single payer, it's all going to be paid for by the super rich.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And that it's not going to be -- that the paying won't be spread across every person in this country to fund this welfare state.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And by the way, the numbers don't add up even if you tax all the rich, you're not going to get the amount of money you need for this green deal, Grover.</p><p>NORQUIST:  You don't even balance the budget if you do that, never mind half money for new things.  Look, the big difference between United States and Denmark, United States and Sweden, it's not how much money higher income people pay, it's what happens to middle-income people.</p><p>Denmark, Finland, Sweden, the tax rate on middle income people is 10, 15, 20 points higher than an American middle class person.  And, you add to that the value added tax.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NORQUIST:  The difference between United States and Europe is how heavily taxed middle income people are, and they have those (INAUDIBLE) high rates that very few people pay, to make people in the middle class think that they are getting a deal.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Speaking of middle income tax -- a lot of Democrats want a carbon tax, gasoline tax and even some big American business.  That's the way to address the issue of climate change.  Do you see any path towards a carbon tax that would be acceptable to your point --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I guess, but real quick, Grover.</p><p>NORQUIST:  No.  No, absolutely not.  And the reason is, you can look at Washington State, very deep blue Washington State.  They have twice had it on the ballot and twice defeated a carbon dioxide tax, gasoline taxes lose overwhelmingly.  This is too obvious tax on middle-income people.  It's a loser up.  They are having this fight in -- our dear friends in France or loggerhead down the subject.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We know how that played out.</p><p>NORQUIST:  We had the Ontario government and the Alberta government collapsed as a result of this, and three times, in Australia.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Grover, thank you.  Yes.</p><p>NORQUIST:  Bad politics and lousy economics.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Grover, thank you for the facts, we appreciate it, Grover Norquist, joining us there.</p><p>Five officers injured in a shooting in Texas, meanwhile, Cheryl Casone in New York, with the details, there.  Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  That's right, Maria.  Four officers were shot and another officer suffered a knee injury in Houston.  They were serving a search warrant at a suspected drug house.  Police say two of them were hit in the neck.  Those officers are in critical but stable condition.  Two suspects were killed at the scene.</p><p>Well, a key E.U. negotiator, warning the risk of Britain leaving the European Union without a deal, is very high, as parliament votes on amendments in Theresa May's exit plan today.  Lawmakers set to consider more than 10 different amendments before taking votes.  That's going to be at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>And those votes come after May's plan to leave the European Union was overwhelmingly rejected earlier this month, a lot of those votes against her from her own party.</p><p>Well, Americans will be betting an estimated $6 billion on the Super Bowl, that's according to the survey by the American Gaming Association.  About 22.7 million U.S. adults plan to place a bet on the upcoming Atlanta game, of those bets, 94.47 percent, reportedly illegal, but let the games begin, Maria, and those are your headlines.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Be there to watch it all, front-row seat.</p><p>CASONE:  I'm there for you, Maria.  I've got surprises for you, coming up.  You're going to love them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK, looking forward to it.  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, crisis in Venezuela to take a look at, new sanctions have been placed on the country's oil.  Plus, National Security Advisor, John Bolton, may have inadvertently revealed the administration's next move.  Why his notes are raising eyebrows this morning.</p><p>Then, farming in America, why farmers are being forced to rent water.  That's up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A look at some of the big headlines across America this morning.  The Chicago Tribune reporting on the Pension Agency criticizing Sears Chairman Eddie Lampert's plan to acquire the bankrupt retailer.  The article explaining that the agency sets to takeover Sears.  Pensions objects to the bid, calling it the final fulfillment of a year-long's scheme to deprive Sears and its creditors of assets and its employees of jobs while lining Lampert's on owns pockets.</p><p>The Daily Camera in Colorado, reporting on how Boulder County farmers are increasingly renting water.  The report explains how ownership from agricultural interests has dropped from 85 percent in the late 1950s to just 30 percent.  The water increasingly moving to municipal control.</p><p>And the Mercury News writing that how in one California city you can text 911 for emergency help.  According to the paper, the police department there announced that the service is now available in the city.  It is meant to help people who are hearing or voice impaired.  The police are also recommending that you not send emojis.  Well, yes, I would think not.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  What are we coming to?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  My God, but it is good that you can text 911.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  That's a good step, just don't text person emoji.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, crisis in Venezuela new sanctions placed on the country's oil, plus National Security Advisor John Bolton may have inadvertently revealed the administration's next move, why his notes on his legal pad are raising eyebrows this morning?  We're breaking that down when we come right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A framework for peace.  The U.S. and Taliban negotiators making a preliminary on key issues to end the war in Afghanistan -- the longest war in American history.  The two top points American troop withdrawal and insurgence vowing to end terrorist attacks abroad, that's according to the Wall Street Journal.  Many hurdles remain to ensure the peace is in place.  Joining me right now is Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst, General Jack Keane.  General, it's always a pleasure to see you.</p><p>GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST:  Good to see you, Maria, and welcome to Washington again.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  And what do you think about this?  I mean, are we supposed to be trusting the Taliban?</p><p>KEANE:  No, we can never ever trust the Taliban, that doesn't mean that we can't have a treaty with them.  But here's what I think is going on, a couple of things have changed: one is the Taliban in the last couple of years have gone all out as we have so dramatically reduced our forces, thinking that they will going to be able to overthrow the regime, because the only thing the United States is really doing is training and assisting the ground forces -- no longer doing the fighting, however provide an air power.  That didn't work.  They retook some territory but never took capitals or provinces and they never took -- they never able to secure a province.  So, what has happened?  The war stalemated.  The Taliban cannot take over the government and the government cannot defeat Taliban, even with our assistance.</p><p>Second thing, and this is crucial, Pakistan has gotten involved in this in a way they've never have before.  They forced the Taliban to go to the peace negotiation table, why?  Pakistan knows it's no longer in national interest to keep this thing stalemated.  There's growing al-Qaeda and growing ISIS presence in Afghanistan which gives the Pakistanis some concern.  So, those are the new things that are happening.  That's why the negotiations have some momentum.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's the thing, though.  I mean, so many people were worried when the president said: we were withdrawing the troops.  And where do you stand on that now?  I mean, do you feel better about it given this peace deal?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, let me answer it this way -- I mean, it is an essential question: the Taliban themselves, we are trying to get an agreement with them that, one, they'll stop trying to overthrow the government and number two, they'll power share with them and also, they will assist in taking down the al-Qaeda and the ISIS.  I don't think we can trust them to do that, based on the fact that they provided safe haven for Osama bin Laden for almost 10 years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  So, what do we do?</p><p>KEANE:  So, we leave in place, after we bring out the troops that are providing the training and assistance.  We leave in place a counterterrorism force and an intelligence capability indefinitely.  We're doing that in Yemen, we're doing it in Libya and we're doing it in Africa.  The one in Africa is off the coast.  It's a Maritime Joint Task Force.  That is what we need to do, that is the guaranty against the Taliban because the issue in Afghanistan has always been, we would never intervene in the civil war in Afghanistan between the northern alliance and Taliban for one reason only, we didn't evade, because they attacked the United States.  That's the reason we're there.  We don't want that to happen again and we cannot trust the Taliban to provide that guarantee for us.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, let me move on and ask you about sanctions on the Venezuelan oil industry.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin who will be here shortly this morning along with Security Adviser John Bolton, explain the decision in a briefing yesterday and issued warning for disputed President Nicolas Maduro.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN BOLTON, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR:  The president has made it very clear on this -- on this matter that all options are on the table.</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY:  There's no reason why these resources shouldn't be used for the economic benefit of the people there.  There's no reason for the poverty and the starvation and the humanitarian crisis.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to this announcement yesterday?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, increased pressure on Maduro regime is certainly a welcome thing.  I mean, this really comes down to the loyalty of the military to Maduro.  As long as that loyalty is there, it's unlikely that Maduro is going the leave.  If that loyalty starts to fall apart, I hope we're working a 'plan b', which is engineering right now some kind of exit path for Maduro, where he can go into exile with recriminations in Venezuela.  The Reagan administration did this very successfully on Ferdinand Marcos, back in 1986, overwhelming popular opposition to him, hundreds of thousands of people.  We engineered his exit.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me squeeze in this question before you go general.  This image from the briefing going viral and it shows John Bolton's notepad with the notation: \"5,000 troops to Colombia.\"  Whoa, do you think we should be sending troops to the region?  What do you think about this?  Caught on camera.</p><p>KEANE:  Look, when we deposed Noriega in 1989 operation just cost Panama, 26,000 troops, is what it took.  When we deposed a dictator in Haiti, 28,000.  The ease of troops that would only be in there, move into Venezuela, if there's a problem at the embassy to our diplomat.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How significance is revealing such a secret?</p><p>KEANE:  I think he'd probably wanted to reveal it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  General Jack Keane, good to see you sir.  Thank you so much.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Show: MORNINGS WITH MARIA][Date: January 29, 2019][Time: 07:00:00][Tran: 012902cb.231][Type: SHOW][Head: Interview with Rep.

Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo coming to you live this morning from Washington, D.C.  It is Tuesday, January 29th.</p><p>Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>It is a busy day on the earnings calendar this morning.  3M among the Dow components reporting their fourth quarter.  The company cut its forecast for 2019.  Pfizer also cut this morning.  The stock under pressure this morning after the guidance came in below expectations.  Pfizer shares down almost 2 percent.  3M down two-thirds of a percent.</p><p>The big one to watch after the close tonight -- Apple.  We've got everything you need to know as Apple prepares to report its quarterly numbers.</p><p>Rising tensions meanwhile with China.  The U.S. has brought charges against Huawei as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin sounding optimistic on the state of the negotiations so far.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY:  I think there's been significant movement.  And we're working through what are still very complicated issues.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'll be sitting down with Secretary Mnuchin this morning at 8:00 a.m. Eastern.  Join us live as the Treasury Secretary will join the program, coming up.</p><p>Markets are under pressure this morning.  Futures pointing to a lower opening for the broader averages although right now it is more like a flat showing than lower.</p><p>The Dow Industrials are up 3 points right now.  S&amp;P 500 pretty much flat, up a quarter point.  And the Nasdaq is down 4 points.  It's been back and forth on futures this after declines across the board yesterday, of course.</p><p>Stocks finished off of the lows of the day but nonetheless, the Dow Industrials were down 209 points, almost 1 percent.  S&amp;P was down 20.  The Nasdaq was down 79, better than 1 percent lower.</p><p>Global markets this morning.  Take a look at European indices, higher across the board.  This right here, this is the high of the morning.  FT 100 up 1.5 percent, 97 points higher.  CAC 40 in Paris up 39 points, almost 1 percent.  And the DAX index in Germany up about 20 points right now.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets were little changed, pretty much across the board as you can see.</p><p>Well, the date is official now with the government back open, President Trump will give his State of the Union address one week from today.  We're taking a closer look at the fallout from the shutdown including the cost to the economy.</p><p>Snapchat's about-face.  Take a look, the social media service eyeing a major change to better compete with Instagram.  We'll tell you all about it coming up.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning.  And joining me to break it all down -- Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell in New York; the \"Wall Street Journal's\" global economics editor Jon Hilsenrath here in D.C. with me; and the American Conservative Union chairman, Matt Schlapp.  Great to see you -- guys.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Great to be here.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen -- good morning to you.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning.  We were talking about the shutdown.  So it's over for the time being.</p><p>The Democrats have actually been hurt by it as well.  Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows that positive feelings about the Democratic Party have fallen to 35 percent this month.  That's down 4 percentage points since December.  And that is essentially in line with the positive feelings that people have about Republicans.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean that's a really good point because the President really did not get hurt certainly on his base, from his base, by the shutdown.  What do you guys think?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Two things.  First is that the President's base was actually energized that he would make a spending fight.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Remember, immigration is a spending fight because if he can stop illegal immigration or reduce it, you don't have all these social services costs.</p><p>But the second thing is, the President's brand is that he will fight, he will fight harder than any politician on the field and he reiterated that brand.  So if he can increase that reputation, I think it appeals to Independents.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They said dig in.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  But isn't his brand also -- it's about fighting and continuing to fight and winning.  And he didn't win the wall in this case.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  I don't agree with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We don't know if he won the wall yet.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  There's three steps to this - -</p><p>HILSENRATH:  In this case, right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  In this case.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  -- there's three really important things.  Number one, the bill he signed has $1.3 billion in barrier funding annualized.</p><p>Number two, he's got to exhaust all legislative efforts if he's going to go the emergency route in order to have a good case in court.</p><p>And number three, the American people when it comes to immigration, he is on the right side of this policy argument.  And Democrats who are against border security, they're going to be sorry for this eventually.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  But you know what.  You better be --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, go ahead -- Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- but you better be careful about what you do and this goes to all politicians because I was flying on Friday and that was an utter nightmare.  If you want to anger everybody in the electorate, you pull another fast one like that where people are grounded and you've got an hour and-a-half plane flight where you're at 8,000 feet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But who are you blaming?</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They were blaming (INAUDIBLE) and blaming the Democrats because --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They were blaming everybody.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- Nancy Pelosi dug in.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They were blaming everybody.  But TSA agents down in Raleigh, Durham were going to food banks because they were spending what little money they had on gas trying to get to and from work.  So again, I don't care who is responsible for it.  They're all responsible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, businesses did start, you know, putting the uncertainty out there, sitting on cash, making decisions later.  We know.  I mean the SEC closed, can't get any IPOs through.  FDA closed, got to worry about obvious food shortages or food issues.</p><p>So we were beginning to see some real impact.  And Dagen saw it firsthand at the airport.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  That's true.  But if you're a federal employee in this town, let's face it, you make a little bit of a bargain.  Yes, every year you might have to go through a shutdown with your salary.</p><p>But you know, the other thing, Maria, that we don't talk about, it's almost impossible to fire a federal employee.  There's some pretty cushy gigs --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good point.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  -- in THIS town where you basically have an insurance policy against ever getting fired unless you do something just awful.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  And you can read all the GAO reports that's backed that up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're talking about all of that this morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But there are people barely making ends meet who are trying to drive to work, and spending all their money on gasoline and going to food banks who were working for the TSA and not getting paid.</p><p>And when the Republicans stop thinking about them and start talking about the workers who aren't needed, the ones who are furloughed you have really missed the boat.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, maybe.  But how about the fact that we've got a border wall in Nancy Pelosi's state?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that immoral, the wall that separates Tijuana from San Diego --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  But --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- is that immoral?  I don't think so.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They need to start asking all of these Democrats who think that the wall is immoral or don't want to fund it, ok, let's take down the walls that are there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's how you put --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will the three million people in Tijuana assimilate with the three million people in San Diego if that wall is torn down?  I think so.  And we're going to talk about that this morning.</p><p>We've got a big show this morning from D.C., live.  Coming up Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is here, live.  National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow has a thing or two to say about the CBO protections about what exactly the impact is on the economy from that shutdown.</p><p>House Minority Leader and California Congressman Kevin McCarthy will walk us through what these next three weeks look like with his colleagues in terms of this negotiating on border wall funding.</p><p>Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell is here.</p><p>Along with AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka.</p><p>Don't miss a moment of it.  A big two hours coming up.</p><p>And we kick it off this hour right now with markets.  Futures are pointing to a flat opening this morning amid all of this uncertainty over China trade, earnings.  It's an enormous week this week.</p><p>This after stocks finished to the downside yesterday on the China growth fears, the weak guidance from Nvidia and Caterpillar as well, and of course these worries about what happens with China and the U.S.  There's conversations happening tomorrow.</p><p>Joining us right now is the founder, CEO and chief investment strategist at Mainstay Capital Management David Kudla.  David -- good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>DAVID KUDLA, FOUNDER/CEO/CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, MAINSTAY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So we've been talking about what a week this is with the fourth quarter earnings coming out.  That's been pretty much driving the story.  We have a jobs report coming out at the end of the week on Friday.  Brexit discussions, the vote today.  U.S./China discussions tomorrow.  A fourth quarter GDP number.  How do you want to invest with all of this?</p><p>KUDLA:  I think investors should be looking at stocks right now that they want to own.  We've been invested through -- the past month has been very good for stock investors.  13 percent rise through Friday from the lows of December 24th.  And that's in both growth stocks and value stocks, so a broad market advance.</p><p>We're going to see some give and take here now after this nice advance of last month but investors should be picking, you know, their points here, have their list out on stocks they want to own.  We look for a good 2019 for stock investors.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is it good news, Jon Hilsenrath, that the Fed gave us a pivot that we know that the Fed is on pause right now and that we know that they're even ready to consider slowing down the unwind of the bond portfolio?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  I don't think it's good news.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I think it shows that the Fed is becoming less confident about how strong and sustainable the economy is.  I mean it is a sign that inflation isn't picking up and that's good news.  But you see some real trepidation coming out of the Fed right now with the global economy slowing, with markets being unstable and volatile.</p><p>I think the Fed is a little worried about the outlook and that shouldn't really give us a lot of encouragement.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about that, David?  I mean the economy's slowing.</p><p>KUDLA:  But Jon this -- yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLA:  But John -- the important thing here is what happened in the fourth quarter is we had mixed messages out of fed chair Jerome Powell.  We had on October 3rd we were far away from neutral.  Then by November we were close to neutral rates.  Then on the 16th in the Fed meeting they were going to do what's right no matter what.</p><p>Then he came in on January 4th and finally said we're going to be considerate of market and economic conditions and now we're seeing a more consistent and accommodative message out of the Fed.  And that's very important for the markets.</p><p>That's music to the market's ears and that's why we've now seen a sustained advance.  So the markets and investors are now looking at a Fed that seems as though they are going to be considerate of or accommodative or take into account what's happening with the markets, with the economy, and not just normalize rates for the sake of normalizing rates.</p><p>They won't have $50 billion rolling off the balance sheet on auto pilot and they won't raise rates just to raise rates to get to a normalized rate structure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that was the worry in the fourth quarter.</p><p>KUDLA:  -- in pause like in 2016 if the market and economy warrants it.  That's important.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That was they worry in the fourth quarter -- that they were on auto pilot-- Jon.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  Yes, I make two points.</p><p>KUDLA:  That drove volatility in the fourth quarter, the Fed.  .</p><p>HILSENRATH:  David makes a really important point, you know.  So this has been Jerome Powell's first year at the Fed.  He's had a bit of a honeymoon with the market.  And then what the market has discovered in the last month or two is that Mr. Powell, you know, he kind of prides himself on being a plain-spoken communicator but his communication has confused a lot of people in the market.  And he's really had to do a lot of corrections over the last few weeks --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- so that raised some questions about him.</p><p>But the other thing about -- you know, the market wants to see the Fed on an easier path.  Ok.  But the underlying message there is that this economy can't sustain very high rates.</p><p>So it doesn't send a really encouraging message about economic growth and the economic outlook when we see that the Fed is starting to recognize it just can't sustain a tighter monetary policy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But look, we're getting the news from the companies themselves with the fourth quarter numbers coming out.  Verizon just reported mixed earnings.  They beat on earnings, but they missed on revenue.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Caterpillar.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Technology reporting late today, Apple.  And we heard from Apple already.  Facebook, Amazon -- all reporting this week, Microsoft.  It's going to be a big week for technology.  And of course you mentioned Caterpillar.  That was the big kahuna yesterday that really set the tone for the markets because Caterpillar is a great indicator of economic activity across the world, in particular China.</p><p>So stay on earnings for a second, David.  Give me your take on technology.  Because you've got Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft coming out this week.</p><p>KUDLA:  Well, you know, tech stocks got beat up very bad in the fourth quarter.  They've come back in this rally and we think that tech stocks have further to go.</p><p>Look, we think that investors should stay with tech stocks.  We have an opportunity here to add value stocks to the portfolio.  Cyclicals came into 2019 at their lowest valuation relative to the S&amp;P 500 ever.</p><p>So investors now can diversify their portfolio in an opportunistic way, holding both growth stocks.  Those tech stocks that we think still have some rebound and some further runway ahead of them, and by adding value stocks that are very opportunistic.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  David -- it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>KUDLA:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Still bullish on this market.  David Kudla joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, the State of the Union is back on, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi extended officially the invitation to President Trump to do the State of the Union in the House Chamber.  He accepted the offer.</p><p>Plus we're taking a look at the enormous cost of the shutdown, what exactly is the number?  A lot of people say it wasn't very much at all.</p><p>Then, Snapchat's unthinkable change, how the photo sharing app is attempting to compete with Instagram by changing a key feature.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>New revelations in the sexual misconduct claims against the former CEO of Wynn Resorts.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with headlines now in New York -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Maria.  The \"Wall Street Journal\" is reporting that executives at Wynn Resort ignored allegations of sexual misconduct by Steve Wynn over more than a decade.  According to a regulator's report Wynn was accused of sexually assaulting or harassing salon workers, cocktail servers and flight attendants who worked for his company.</p><p>Under a proposed settlement, the Nevada Gaming Control Board won't try to revoke Wynn's regulatory licenses but Wynn is going to pay a fine.  Steve Wynn has denied any claims of misconduct.  There's a one year chart of Wynn's in front of you right there.</p><p>Well, Snapchat has named Lara Sweet as its interim CFO.  This is another shift in leadership at Snap as the company has lost several high profile employees over the last year.  Meanwhile Snap is reportedly considering allowing longer lasting or even permanent videos on Snapchat.  It will apply the Snap shared publicly on this story's features.  Snap is down 52 percent from one year ago.  There's that chart for you.</p><p>Well, Porsche is speeding past Tesla in a fast charging race.  The car maker says it new Porsche Taycan is going to be able to add more than 60 miles of charge in just four minutes.  That will be the fastest available today, exceeding Tesla's super charging stations which needs about 30 minutes to charge a vehicle's battery to at least 80 percent.  Charging times are a key selling point obviously for these car makers and now Porsche is giving Taycan owners three years of free charging.</p><p>And obviously we're going to be hearing from Tesla this week, Maria.  Earnings are coming out from Elon Musk and company.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Cheryl -- thank you so much.</p><p>Coming up next, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi challenged over her words describing a border wall as immoral.  We will break it down when we come back.</p><p>Then support on the links, fans rallying around a pro golfer whose two shot penalty was deemed unfair.  More on that.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Keeping America safe, the government is back open but the focus now is whether President Trump can make a deal with Democratic leadership on funding for the border wall.</p><p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has called it immoral, any wall is immoral.  But her home state of California protects the southern border in some places with an actual wall -- the wall separating Tijuana and San Diego.</p><p>Joining me right now is Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell.  And the last time you were on you said you wanted to look at this again.  Congresswoman -- it's good to see you.</p><p>REP. DEBBIE DINGELL (D), MICHIGAN:  It's good to see you.  Welcome to Washington.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.</p><p>What's your take on this?  I mean can Nancy Pelosi really get away with calling a wall immoral when she has a wall in her own state, separating Tijuana from San Diego?</p><p>DINGELL:  Here is what I think is going to happen.  You've got strong countries (ph), both sides of the aisle, both houses.  They're going to go into that room and they want to cut a deal that's going to keep our nation safe.  I don't think anybody wants to see what we just went through for 35 days.</p><p>It hurt the economy.  It hurt -- and I do believe -- this is going to sound corny but I don't -- you know, why do we point -- why do we need to have a Trump win, a Pelosi win.  We need an American win.</p><p>So I'm hoping they're going to go in that room.  I've talked to my colleagues on both sides.  I've talked to Roy Blunt.  I've talked to all my Democratic colleagues in the House.  They want to win.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DINGELL:  They want to go in and put together a package that's going to keep --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So how do you win?  What's the position in terms of wall funding?  Because they may very well -- your colleagues may very well come back and say ok, here's $5 billion towards border security, not a dime toward a wall.</p><p>DINGELL:  I don't know -- if people are really working together, that may not happen.  You know, there may be money, if there are appropriate places for a wall or fence or --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is there a movement within your party, do you think, among your colleagues that they feel that, yes, some money should go for an actual barrier?</p><p>DINGELL:  I think what I hear among my colleagues is let's go into a room and do something that makes sense.  Let's come up with -- we need to -- I've said this to you a million times.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DINGELL:  We need to strengthen our borders at both sides.  Everybody talks about the southern border.  I've got this northern border too which just had a huge human trafficking problem again in the last few --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But there are areas of the southern border that are very dense.  In other words like when you just look at the wall in Nancy's state and that is three million people on one side in Tijuana, three million people on the other side in San Diego.  If you tear that wall down -- I mean isn't it obvious many of the people on the Tijuana side will assimilate into the United States?</p><p>DINGELL:  Then let me ask you this question.  Build a wall, tear down a wall -- are there structures that are working that are in place?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  .</p><p>DINGELL:  So that's -- what I do think we need drones.  We need to fill the 3,000 open patrol --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's common ground, both sides believe in that.</p><p>DINGELL:  Both agree --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Technology and drones -- definitely.</p><p>DINGELL:  We need technology.  We need to make these ports safer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Specifically in a dense area, like Tijuana/San Diego, drones wouldn't work.  I mean maybe you want that in addition to a wall.  When you have such a dense area, where there's three million people on one side of the wall and three m million on the other, don't you need an actual barrier?</p><p>DINGELL:  But they are going to go in this room.  There are people that know what they're doing.  They're people -- they're senior people that have been on homeland security, people from the areas that are impacted --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think they're going to deal?  We won't shut down the government again?</p><p>DINGELL:  I pray to God, we never shut down the government.  Not only do I pray to God that doesn't come out of conference but you're going to see Republicans and Democrats working together.  We'll get --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This whole wall issue, Congresswoman, sort of underscores what's going on I think in both parties.  Now you've got former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz seeing an opening as a result of the radicalness on both sides.</p><p>He's facing backlash on his first stop for his book tour last night.  It was his first public appearance after announcing a possible Independent presidential run.  It did not go smoothly.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire (EXPLETIVE DELETED).  Go back to (INAUDIBLE) on Twitter.  Go back to Davos with the other billionaire elites who think they know how to run the world.  That's not what the country needs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  You know, I give you a lot of credit just being in politics, by the way.</p><p>Schultz is also being criticized by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, billionaire.  He tweeted this, \"In 2020 the great likelihood is that an Independent would just split the anti-Trump vote and end up reelecting the President.  That's a risk.  I refused to run in 2016 and we can't afford it right now.</p><p>Congresswoman -- do you think an Independent run is viable?  Do you think an Independent run from Schultz would hurt the Democrats?</p><p>DINGELL:  I think it's viable.  He has the money to spend it.  But I think he would hurt the Democrats.  I'm fearful that I am -- I'm trying to step back.  I'm not getting any candidate I want to see who is going to emerge, who's got people skills.</p><p>But this is dangerous.  And as you know, told you two years ago, Donald Trump could become president.  Nobody believed me.  You all thought I was crazy.  You may not have but most people did.</p><p>And I still think he could get reelected.  And if we do not run a strong campaign and we don't have somebody like that that pulls votes off --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  One of the issues is the messaging of what the platform is.  So what do you think the Democratic candidate for 2020 should have as their platform?  What's most important?</p><p>DINGELL:  You know what we didn't do and one of the reasons I believe firmly that President Trump became President Trump.  One, people are tired of partisan bickering.  They're tired of seeing things not get done in Washington.</p><p>There are a lot of people that are hurting in this country, just working men and women who want to know that we actually care about them.  They're scared about healthcare.  They're scared about escalating drug costs.  There's -- look at our --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So healthcare should be the platform?</p><p>DINGELL:  it's one piece of it.  Infrastructure, let's create jobs.  What are we going to do about education?  Trade?</p><p>Now, the President -- you want to know why he won Michigan?  Trade.  They're tired of bad trade deals that ship jobs overseas.  We don't have a level playing field.  The President's trade policy is all over the place.</p><p>It's not consistent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you going to vote for the ratification of USMCA?</p><p>DINGELL:  I don't call it USMC.  I call it NAFTA 2.0.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you going to vote for ratification.</p><p>DINGELL:  I haven't decided yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is on your plate now in the next month.</p><p>DINGELL:  Very much on my plate.  And talk to Lighthizer about it all the time.  But I'm not voting for any bill that doesn't have and acting legislation that keeps more manufacturing from going to Mexico.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wasn't that one of the key things of this new law?</p><p>DINGELL:  But Blazer still went to --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Keeping jobs here.</p><p>DINGELL:  Blazers went to Mexico in July.  I'm not seeing any more American cars go to Mexico and get built for $1.50 to $3.50 and then gets shipped back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you want a change before you vote for it?</p><p>DINGELL:  He knows how I feel.  I'm not -- one of the more likely people to vote for it but I'm not voting for it in the form that it's in right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.   We'll leave it there.</p><p>Congresswoman -- it's good to see you.</p><p>DINGELL:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.  Congresswoman Debbie Dingell joining us here.</p><p>Coming up, the longest government shutdown in American history is over.  But another shutdown threat is on the horizon.  We will talk about the next three weeks, what it looks like with House Minority Leader, Kevin McCarthy.  He's up next.</p><p>Then you've got a friend again.  The new teaser trailer for \"Toy Story 4\" drops with a big surprise.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Tuesday, January 29th.  Your top stories right now at 7:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Earnings season in full swing this morning for the fourth quarter.  Several Dow components reporting their fourth quarter this morning.  Verizon reported a mixed quarter earlier this hour.  Pfizer and 3M also under pressure this morning as you can see.  3M up three percent, although Pfizer and Verizon down better than one percent.</p><p>Rising tensions with China continuing, the U.S. bringing charges against Chinese telecom company Huawei as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning between the two nations.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will be joining me as my special guest this morning at the top of the hour, 8:00 a.m. Eastern.  Join us for that talk on China and the economy as we break it all down with the Treasury secretary.</p><p>Markets this morning are hovering around the flat line.  Take a look.  Dow Industrials up 20 points right now, 26 higher.  The S&amp;P 500 is down by almost one point and the NASDAQ down about three points.</p><p>All this after the major indices finished lower yesterday across the board at 04:00 on Wall Street.  Dow industrials were down 208 points and then actually was off of the lows of the -- of the day, down almost one percent at the close.  S&amp;P 500 gave up 21 points, that was three-quarters of one percent.  And the NASDAQ was down 79 points, better than one percent lower.</p><p>In Europe this morning, a mixed story, actually mostly higher.  FT-100 at the high of the morning right here, up 1-1/4 percent, 83 points higher, ahead of the British vote on the U.K. leaving the E.U.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is up 42 points, almost one percent higher and the DAX Index in Germany higher by 25, quarter of a percent higher there.</p><p>Asian markets mostly quiet overnight.  Take a look, as you can see, it was pretty much across the board.</p><p>$100,000 penalty, how one misstep cost a professional golfer big time.  The outcry, coming up.</p><p>And Woody and Buzz Lightyear are back, the new teaser trailer for \"Toy Story 4\" is out and it marks the return of one character after 20 years.  We will bring it to you.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning.  But first, our top story this half an hour, shutdown showdown, the government open for business again after the last -- at least for the next three weeks, rather.  But the main issue, funding the wall has not been resolved and the White House is not letting it go.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  What I do know is that if they don't come back with a deal, that means Democrats get virtually nothing.  That will make the president and force him to have to take executive action that does not give Democrats the things that they want.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is the House Minority leader, Congressman Kevin McCarthy.  Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you.</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  Thanks for having me back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So, what do the next three weeks look like?  Take us through these negotiating.  Do you expect any money for the wall?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  I expect us to solve this problem in the end.  What's interesting here is the whole time speaker Pelosi said I couldn't negotiate anything until you open up government.  The president put the public first and said OK, let's go through, I'll give you three weeks.</p><p>Now Wednesday, we'll have the conference committee, the senators and the congressional members' appropriation sit down and we'll see if they're serious about it, if they're willing to do something.  Because I believe Nancy Pelosi is out of step with her own party.  If you look at her number two, Steny Hoyer.  He said of course, that walls are not immoral, and that he believes some fencing involved.  From her Agricultural secretary to her Agricultural chair to our Armed Services chair, they both believe in a wall too.  Her Agriculture chairman said give Trump the money.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and she continues to say that it's immoral which I find incredible given the fact she has a wall in her own state.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  As my state too.  You know what I find --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And your state too, exactly.  California.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  You know what I find immoral?  When you really talk about this, this is about stopping human trafficking.  In 2016, they stopped more than 2,000 individuals involved in that.  I think it's immoral that you would allow that to continue.  I don't believe anybody in America that says they support border security believes that there is no such thing as some barrier.</p><p>And the president said, he does not a -- he does not want a wall from sea to shining sea.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  He just believes in the area you need some form of barrier and he's correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, where do you think are the most important areas that you would need the wall?  I mean, we talked earlier about this wall in your state, Tijuana, San Diego where it's very dense, three million people on one side, three million people on the other.  Can you make the case that that dense area is elsewhere where that's why the president is so stuck on having this wall there?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  And it's not the president saying, it's the experts.  The president sat down with the experts and they said this is what we need to be able to secure our border.</p><p>So in certain areas, like in San Diego, we stopped illegal movement by more than 95 percent.  You look at Yuma, Arizons, El Paso another -- El Paso became one of the safest cities in the nation after being able to put it through.  That's what we need, in certain parts of the country along the border, you need a barrier.  In other parts you could put the drones in this part area.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what are you expecting to give on?  And what -- do you think they're going to offer the $5.7 billion that the president wants for border security?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  But we're arguing over one-tenth of one percent of the budget.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a great point.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  The Democrats have voted for a wall before.  But now that the president brings forward what the experts want, they say no.  That is what's so confusing to me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, what -- why is this so important for the president right now?  Going into 2020, I mean, is she seeing this as a campaign promise and that's why he doesn't -- she won't agree to it.  Because I don't know how she can call it immoral, given the wall in her own state, your own state.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Again, it's such a little price to pay for so much more security when you look at the human trafficking.  Think of the number of lives that we will save from this process if we have a secure border.</p><p>But what's more importantly, it's the president that sat down and tried to be reasonable, find common ground.  He's the one who brought DACA into it.</p><p>And let's not forget, speaker Pelosi just a year ago holds the record for the longest speech on the floor, eight hours, over one issue, DACA, which she shut the government down over.  And now she thinks that's not important?  I think those people are important as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think that this -- a negotiation, an agreement will include a DACA deal?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  It could.  It doesn't have to.  But because the Democrats and speaker Pelosi have been saying no.  The president said he was willing to go there, three more years of DACA for a portion of the border security that the experts are asking for.  I just find her out of step with her own party.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, there seems to be a movement within the party, even some of the newer congress people coming in, fresher faces saying you know what, yes, we do need border security and we do need the money.  So, are they going head to head?  I mean, are they -- do they even have a voice?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  They don't even have a voice.  Because remember, she has so much power.  She will not allow the vote to come up.  I believe inside the conference we could come up with an agreement.  The question is, will speaker Pelosi even allow that to be voted on the floor?  If we had a vote on the floor, I believe it would pass.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think that the president will allow the government to shut down again?  I mean, is the president really prepared to have another government shutdown if he doesn't get the money?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Look, I think the president's going to try to find a way to solve this one way or another.  I don't know that shutting the government down solves it.  I there's other ways to do that the president can.  I know he firmly believes in a legislative process.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Should he call for a national emergency?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  He has the power to do that.  I think the best road forward right now is a legislative agreement.  And what's so interesting to me, I'd listened to these Democrats celebrate Nancy Pelosi.  You celebrated someone that got you status quo.  They're still a DACA problem, they're still a border security problem.</p><p>And government is designed to find common ground and compromise.  The president was the one person looking reasonable in all these discussions.  I know the president's committed to this.  He will get the border secure one way or another.  He's giving the Democrats an opportunity.  He gave them an opportunity all along this discussion.  They said then open up the government, they'll discuss it.  So he did that and gave them a three week time.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean, I think this whole thing, the government shutdown and the constant resist upsets people.  I mean, you have to wonder if in fact -- you know, she keeps resisting everything that the president wants, if the people will turn on her.  Because people want to see you guys get something done.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Yes, she is celebrating status quo.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  That's not where we need to be --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me move on and ask you about 2010, congressman.  Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz thinking about running for office.  He was at a book signing last night in New York and he was heckled over his bid.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump.  You egotistical billionaire (INAUDIBLE).  Go back to getting ratioed on Twitter.  Go back to Davos with the other billionaire elites who think they know how to run the world.  That's not what the country needs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This heckler not the only one weighing in.  Michael Bloomberg former mayor of New York City also told Schultz not to run as an independent.  He said this, given the strong pull of partisanship and the realities of the electoral college system, there's no way an independent can win.  That is truer today than ever before.  Is that where we are, an independent can't win, congressman?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  No, I think it's Bloomberg upset.  Because remember, he went from a Republican to an independent to a Democrat and he just spent $120 million giving to the Democrats so they can win the majority in the House and he doesn't want his money to be wasted, so he doesn't want competition.</p><p>Look, I think there's ample opportunity for an independent to get in this race, only because the Democrats are now become social Democrats.  They're talking about a 70 percent tax rate.  They're talking about these green deals.  They're talking about socialism.  If you listen to what some of these new Democrats say, they think Venezuela's problem is not because they're a socialist country, it's because of sanctions.  They're so out of step.  They are putting letters in to help those who want to go sign up for ISIS, to be easy on them to the judge.  I mean, I have -- this is not the America we live in, and that's the difference.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  This party is so out of step and I think you'll find a lot of moderate Democrats who say I want somebody else who could talk about this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, that's why a number of moderate Democrats can't really get the OK from the party leadership because they're not left enough.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  This new socialist Democrat Party has left the Democratic Party.  They are in to -- remember, Bernie Sanders is not registered as a Democrat.  He's registered as a socialist.  AOC does not call herself a Democrat, she calls herself a Democrat socialist.  This party is moving to a whole different place.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Real quick before you go, when the election happened back in November.  You said one of your priorities going to be to get the majority back.  How are you going to do it?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Well, first of all, you've got to make sure you can recruit.  I think, you put the ideas up there.  Ideas should win at the end of the day.  You look at where we are financially in this country.  A lot of that happens to do with the policies that we're able to create, from the tax policy, the battle we had with you human trafficking and other that we were able to do.  I think you're going to find as going directly to, we've got to find a suburban areas to be able to win again in and I think we're going to be very successful.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, it's good to see you.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Congressman Kevin McCarthy, joining us there.</p><p>Still ahead, Richard Trumka AFL-CIO president on the impact of the shutdown on American workers, what he'd like to see, back in a moment with that.</p><p>And then, support on the links, a pro golfer given a big fine and a two-shot penalty which many are calling grossly unfair.  What went wrong, right here.</p><p>Plus, you've got a friend and a big surprise, the trailer for \"Toy Story 4\" drops with a character we haven't seen in 20 years.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Prosecutors resting their case against Joaquin El Chapo Guzman.  Cheryl Casone in New York with details and headlines, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It; must something else, Maria.  The federal government has now rested its case.  They called 56 witnesses.  The trial of the notorious Mexican drug kingpin started back in mid-November.  El Chapo told the trial judge yesterday he will not take the stand in his own defense.  One witness is scheduled to appear for the defense today.  Closing arguments expected to take place tomorrow and Thursday.  Big story, a lot of New Yorkers have been following very closely.</p><p>Well, professional golfer Haotong Li is getting a huge outpouring of support from fellow golfers after losing out on nearly $100,000 Saturday for a minor infraction.  It happened at the Omega Dubai Desert Classic.  Li was on the 18th green when judges accuses caddie of standing too close behind him as he got ready to putt.  Well, the ensuing penalty dropped Li's score from 71 to 73.  And he went from third to 12th.  Tour officials say the correct call was made but acknowledge it was grossly unfair.  They're looking at the giving referees more discretion in cases like this going forward.</p><p>And then, get ready for \"Toy Story 4\".  Pixar is putting out this teaser video, shows the revival of Woody's love interest, Bo Peep.  And she is back with a new, more modern look.  She was last seen in \"Toy Story 2\", back in 1999.  It is now 20 years later, \"Toy Story 4\" is going to be released, Maria, this June .  Those are your headlines from New York, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like it.  Bo Peep.  All right, thank you Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, the lingering effects of the shutdown showdown.  AFL-CIO Richard Trumka will join us to talk about the impact on American workers.  He's up next.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We are focused on the American worker this morning.  White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney saying that the 800,000 federal workers who were not paid twice during the partial government shutdown should receive those checks by the end of this week.</p><p>Joining us right now is American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organization's president, AFL-CIO, Richard Trumka.  It's great to see you, Richard.  Thank you so much for being here.</p><p>RICHARD TRUMKA, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR AND CONGRESS OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION:  Maria, thanks for having me on today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Give us your take on what the impact of the shutdown was.</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, I think there's several impacts.  There's impact on the people and you not only have government workers who get back pay but you have the government contractors who won't get back pay unless something is done.  That was a devastating effect on them.  It had a devastating effect on the economy itself.  $11 billion, although we'll pick some of that back up later in the year.</p><p>But you had a devastating effect on the airline industry where you had people, airline controllers, traffic controllers that were in school that actually just up and left.  They said we're not going to do this anymore (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What could -- what could have been done about it then, Rich?  Because you as the leader that you are and representing so many workers across the country have to be unnerved when you see open borders and illegals coming in and taking your jobs.</p><p>TRUMKA:  Look, that's just not how it works anymore.  I mean, you have people that got laid off from the president's place that have been here 20 years.  They're not taking anybody's job.  What we want to do is make sure every worker in this country has the same rights so that they can't be exploited.</p><p>Because what happens right now with undocumented workers is, they're great when no one's around.  When they try to organize and get a voice, then they start squeezing them.  They start ex -- you know, doing, calling in ICE and different things.</p><p>The idea is if everybody has the same rights, then they can't exploit those people and everybody can actually have a fair playing field.  What happens to American workers -- employers right now, is you have an employer that hires people, makes them work in unfair condition, misclassifies them, underpays them, and they're competing against our employer.  That employer needs to pay everybody the same rate, live by the same working conditions, so that we can all compete.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you're OK with illegals coming in and as long as everybody's treated the same?</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, Maria, it's a -- it's a nice cliche, illegals coming in.  But you know yourself that most people that are here undocumented or illegally came in legally.  So the whole system needs to be addressed.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, but there are apprehensions that we could look at, just in the month of December, just in the month of November, where apprehensions were of illegal immigrants coming in and wanting asylum in the United States.</p><p>TRUMKA:  There's no question that the system is broken.  We need to fix the system and have a path towards citizenship so that those workers that have been here for years and are actually making the economy run, even the president's golf courses and things like that, they have a chance to get citizenship and they work their work there.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Just a question on the golf courses.  As you know, that's the H2B program, people who come here as foreign workers, come under a specified amount of time for DOL.  I think the real question is is that, what happens to all the people, not who have been here who came legally and overstayed the visa, but what about all the people who come every day at the southern border and can cross into our country?  That's really the pernicious problem.  And even on wall, built with American workers, you'd be for that.</p><p>TRUMKA:  But listen, the people that come back and forth, you have Americans that go to Mexico and Mexicans that come to America to work.  I think Mexico --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you don't think there's a problem at the border at all?</p><p>TRUMKA:  I didn't say that.  There is -- there is a problem.  We do need border security.  And no, I don't think that a wall's the answer to it.  Every time someone's tried to build a wall it's not been very successful.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, the one in Tijuana is successful.</p><p>TRUMKA:  Ask the Chinese, ask the French.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The wall -- the wall in Tijuana --</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Ask Tijuana (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tijuana and San Diego, what abut that Richard?</p><p>TRUMKA:  I'm sorry?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The wall, between Tijuana -- separating Tijuana from San Diego, is that successful?</p><p>TRUMKA:  There are places -- there are places probably where it works.  Is that the answer to everything?  No.  Should that have been the reason for a shutdown?  Absolutely not.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  I want -- I want to ask a broader political question.  We've seen in the last two elections that increasingly voters, blue collar voters, voters in manufacturing towns all over America, the kind of rank and file people that you represent are voting for Republicans, they're going for Trump.  Does the AFL-CIO need to realign its own approach to politics in this town, given that more and more of its people are going with people like Donald Trump and his trade policies and the Republican Party?</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, that's a -- that's a question we could talk about two or three hours for.  First of all, we have realigned our politics.  We are issuing -- we're issue oriented right now.  We put an issue out and if a politician supports that issue, then we support them.</p><p>In fact, in this last election we elected two union members to the Senate, three to governorship, 18 to the House of Representative, and 925 to state legislatures, because those workers will go and support our issues.  That's what we try to do.  We find it more and more difficult to find Republicans that actually support us.  Now, the American worker believes that neither the political system --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got to jump.</p><p>TRUMKA:  -- or the economic system works for them.  They want somebody to change the rules.  That's why they voted for Trump.  If he changes the rules to their advantage, some of them will vote for him again.  If he doesn't, he stands a chance of losing those workers and right now he's losing those workers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Richard, thank you so much for joining us.  We appreciate it.  Richard Trumka there.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Show: MORNINGS WITH MARIA][Date: January 29, 2019][Time: 08:00:00][Tran: 012903cb.231][Type: SHOW][Head: Apple Disables Group FaceTime Function That Was Allowing Callers To Listen And View Without Your Consent; British Parliament To Vote On Brexit Amendments; Kudlow on the Economy; Craft Brewers Impacts from the Government Shutdown; Kudlow on China Trade][Sect: News; Domestic][Byline: Maria Bartiromo, Gerri Willis, Ashley Webster, Hillary Vaughn, Dagen McDowell][Guest: Steven Mnuchin, Larry Kudlow, Matt Schlapp, Jon Hilsenrath][Spec: FaceTime; Huawei; Apple; Brexit; Federal Reserve; 3M; Harley-Davidson; Verizon; Oath Media; Channel Inventory; World War II; CBO; Trade Talks; Deregulations; Tax Plan; China Trade; Slowdown; Government Shutdown]</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good Tuesday morning.

CAC quarante in Paris us up 44 points and the DAX index up 21, fractional gain there.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets were little changed.  Take a look, it was pretty much across the board.  Now, our top story this morning, concerns of a global slowdown.  Last week in Davos I spoke with Bridgewater Associates founder, Ray Dalio, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, and Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey.  Here's what they said about the possibility of an economic slowdown on the horizon.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RAY DALIO, FOUNDER, BRIDGEWATER ASSOCIATES:  Europe has a negative growth and the United States is going to have a negative growth environment.  I don't mean absolute negative, I mean slowing of growth in a material way that could be close to between zero and two percent over the next 18 months.</p><p>BRIAN MOYNIHAN, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, BANK OF AMERICA:  We have the top research firm in the world, and they have done a great job.  And they have the U.S. growing at 2-1/2 percent this year.  The world growing 3-1/2 percent GDP growth.  But that's down from last year.  And so the confusion in the environment right now is a slowdown or is it going in to a recession?</p><p>Nothing we see says it's close to a recession.</p><p>JAMES QUINCEY, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, COCA-COLA:  I think we are in danger of talking ourselves into a problem.  It's just a little bit slower growth.  It's not a recession or a decline.  So we see -- we see a little -- a little softer 2019, maybe a little less tail wind than 2018.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now in a Fox Business exclusive is the treasury secretary of the United States, Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  Great to see you, Secretary.</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, UNITED STATES TREASURY SECRETARY:  Great to see you as well, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.  Your reaction to really what seems like now a unanimous feeling that a slowdown is on the horizon.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, Maria, from everything we see, the U.S. economy is still quite strong.  The companies are doing quite well.  And we see still tremendous investment in capital and human investments.  There's no question that as it relates to Europe and China, there is a slowdown.  We're monitoring that carefully.  But we still see a tremendous opportunity and a lot of capital coming into the U.S.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Federal Reserve basically told us they are on pause.  They may even pause the balance sheet unwind which is also telling us that the Fed is also expecting a slowdown, but do you believe a recession is on the horizon in 2020 even though you're seeing strength and stability so far?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  We see no indications whatsoever of a recession on the horizon.  And from everything we see from speaking to a large across the board businesses, the combination of tax reform, regulatory relief and trade is still has a very strong impact on the U.S. economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And some people are saying that the impact of certainly of trade and tariffs is causing some uncertainty.  So how much of this slowdown that we're expecting later on even if it's not right now is due to what you say you're watching China and Europe and how much of it is uncertainty around the President's tariffs program?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, Maria, as you said, there are people who expect a slowdown but I would just comment a year ago with the projections were 2-1/2 percent.  And we were at three.  We feel very comfortable we're going to hit three for last year.  And we think there's still a very good case for three percent this year.  Now, as it relates to trade, we couldn't be more pleased with the USMCA.  We are looking forward to Congress passing that quickly.</p><p>That's a very important trade deal.  We have two days of talks with China starting tomorrow.  The President is going to be involved in those talks at the conclusion.  We've been updating him.  We have another 30 days after this.  So I think we're making significant progress, and I think on the trade front, these are all very positive impacts for the U.S. economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about the trade talks because this story of China, first off, thank you to the President and to the administration for pushing back on China because that's another unanimous feeling out there, that the President did the right thing in terms of stopping China from some of its practices.  What are you expecting out of these talks?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, the President wants fair trade with China.  It's got to be reciprocal.  Right now China has free access into our markets, and we have limited access to there.  So the critical issue that we've talked about is market access, making sure there aren't forced joint ventures, not forced transfer of technology and that we have a mechanism that when we reach an agreement that we can monitor that agreement and that they'll live up to it.</p><p>And that's how I expect we will make significant progress this week on those issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How much of a priority is espionage?  Obviously the administration unveiling a sweeping set of criminal charges against Huawei Technologies.  We have had on a number of CEOs that have said yes, they have stolen trade secrets from us.  Has this come into the conversation with your Chinese leadership?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  No, let me be clear.  Those are separate issues.  And that's a separate dialogue.  So as it relates to the Huawei issues that's being run by the Justice Department.  I have no involvement in that.  I found out about that yesterday when it was announced.  So those are not part of trade discussions.  Forced technology issues are part of trade discussions but any issues as it relates to violation of U.S. law or U.S. sanctions are going through a separate track, which is the Justice Department.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, I guess the broader issue is, is this a cultural thing in China?  I mean this weekend on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" over on Fox News I spoke with the ranking member of the Intel Committee, House Intel Committee Devin Nunes and he went through some of the practices that China does every day.  Listen to this.  I've got to get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  China might have accessed allied intelligence shared with Poland and passed it on to Moscow.</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R), CALIFORNIA:  What the Chinese are doing is that they have these companies that are essentially owned by the party, the Communist Party and essentially this is a dictatorship.  There's very few people that own these companies.  They weaponize the.  So when all over the -- all over the world you have Chinese technology specifically as it relates to infrastructure on -- communications infrastructure, they will go in and they beat every other company around the world.</p><p>And in fact, they've driven a lot of companies out of business because they come in undercut.  They want to have control over all the com systems or communication systems all over the globe.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's pretty incredible.  We will handle your infrastructure of telecom and then they have a way in of spying.  How can you separate that from the conversation on trade and on forced transfer of technology?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Maria, I think you can easily separate these issues.  So there are two different issues.  One is an issue of state subsidies where they do subsidize state enterprises and they compete unfairly.  Those are trade issues, those are violations of the WTO and that's something from an economic standpoint.  We are going to enforce very seriously.  I think you know among the National Security Council, so I'm going to be careful what I say on national security issues.</p><p>But I assure you whether it's China or anywhere else in the world, our security services, DHS and others will make sure that we protect the U.S. infrastructure, we protect from cyberattacks.  That's something we're very well aware of.  But these are separate issues and shouldn't be confused.  We are focused on what are unfair economic practices.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So the best case that you can get from China is what?  Opening up their markets?  Already we are seeing some likelihood of that, UBS I guess was the first bank that was allowed to operate in China and own 51 percent of that bank.  They say they're going to go to 100 percent in three years.  Are you seeing a significant opening in terms of the Chinese willingness to open their markets to foreigners?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I do, but I think that's a good start.  But why should we have to wait three years for a U.S. company to own 100 percent in the financial services?  China can operate and own 100 percent of companies here.  So that's an example where, you know, they're moving in the right direction.  We want to speed that up.  But the issue is really we want to make sure that U.S. companies can compete fairly in China.</p><p>And if we can do that, China has a very large growing middle class.  It's an enormous market.  As I have said before, this is one of the biggest opportunities for U.S. companies in U.S. business if we can get this right.  And President Trump is determined.  This is the first administration that has aggressively said to China, you need to play fair.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is the President willing to drop all tariffs, should he get a good deal that's acceptable?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I think everything is on the table.  So the President is -- will look at, again, the objective is to have a very fair deal.  Hopefully we'll make progress this week.  The President will be involved in these negotiations and discussions.  And we've still got a lot of work to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the President said look, I'm a tariff guy.  I like tariffs.  So does that mean these tariffs are for, you know, no end in sight or would he be willing to drop the tariffs all together?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  The President hasn't made any decisions on that.  There have been no recommendations from the economic team on that yet.  The first step is to make sure we get a good agreement.  And when we get a good agreement, we'll make a recommendation to the President and he will consider that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have seen the Chinese economy get impacted.  You're still talking about 6.4 percent growth, we think, but that is lower than some people think.  What's your worry or how concerning is it that the Chinese slowdown will impact the United States?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, there's no question that China is slowing down.  They still have significant growth rates.  We're beginning to see the impact on that on world growth.  Our objective is not to slow down China.  Our objective is to make sure that U.S. companies can do business in China and can do business fairly.  So we're monitoring these issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary, stay with us.  We want to get into the shutdown and get your impact on how much the shutdown cost the economy and what you're expecting there.  Stay with us.  More of my exclusive interview with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin when we come right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are life live this morning in Washington, D.C.  And I'm sitting right now with -- in a Fox Business exclusive with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  And Treasury Mnuchin, we were talking about the broad economy.  I want to ask your thoughts on the shutdown.  The CBO says that the shutdown caused $11 billion impact to the economy, $3 billion which is completely lost because of the 35-day shutdown.  Your reaction?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Maria, Kevin Hassett, the CEA is working on final numbers for us.  I think his view is that there's no question that there was some cost but those costs will be recovered as money comes back into the system.  I think it's -- he views that it will almost all be recovered.  Now as it relates to the exact numbers, I haven't seen the final numbers yet.  But the good news is we got the government open.</p><p>People are back to work and we have not seen any significant impact on the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Has -- is the President prepared to shut down the government again in three weeks if he doesn't get the money for the border wall?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Maria, I had dinner last night with the President, the Vice President, Senator Lindsey Graham.  We had a very good discussion on this issue.  There's no question in my mind that the President, the Vice President want to do a fair deal.  Lindsey has been terrific in helping to negotiate this.  I hope the Democrats are sincere.  If they are, there's a sincere deal that will include a lot of different issues that need to be resolved.</p><p>But if they're not sincere, the President has all his options on the table.  And he's determined that he's going to make sure we have border security.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's the impact on the IRS?  There's a lot of worry out there that people are not going to get their checks after April 15th as a result of this shutdown.  What can we expect?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, let me just comment on both the treasury, our bureaus, the IRS in particular, I want to thank the enormous number of government employees who came in and worked during the shutdown.  I think as you know, we had the ability to bring in critical employees.  We never would have been able to do the sanctions that we've been doing over the last month without the hardworking people.</p><p>And the IRS had a large number of critical employees to make sure that we were ready to open for business as usual.  So we're ready to open for tax season.  We're taking tax returns.  We'll be ready for tax refunds.  We will have the phones restaffed.  Now, let me just say that there's no question, this time of the year, there's very, very heavy call volume.  That's something we have to manage.  I encourage taxpayers who have questions to try to go to the web first.</p><p>But we are ready for tax season, and I can assure you that tax refunds will be paid as normal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  So, tax refunds will be paid as normal.  That's the bottom line.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  People were worried about that.  Let me move to the sanctions and in particular Venezuela because you've applied sanctions on the Venezuelan oil industry.  Tell us specifically what the impact here is.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, sanctions are a very important tool in our national security portfolio.  And when we look at national security issues, we look at economic tools.  We look at diplomacy.  We look at national security tools, military options.  So there's no question that what we're trying to do is to cut off the money to the regime that should not be in power and make sure that the President Guaido has access to funds and has access to the assets of the country.</p><p>And to make sure we protect these assets for the people of Venezuela.  It's really quite sad.  This is a country that is very, very rich in oil resources that has had extraordinary poverty and extraordinary humanitarian issues over the last issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And have you spoken with the opposition leader party about this?  What has been the response so far?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I haven't personally, but I know the Vice President has been in communication.  I think the response has been very positive.  We've been very careful in balancing this.  We've -- I've spoken to many of the refineries over the last week.  I want to make sure that there was significant capacity.  There's a lot of oil on the water already in transit to the U.S. refineries.  So I think on the one hand, we've been able to cut off Venezuelan oil going forward.</p><p>But we're managing this with the U.S. refineries.  We've issued licenses for the U.S. refineries to continue to operate.  And if Venezuela wants to continue to sell us oil, which we would like to buy that money would go into blocked accounts and will be protected for the people of Venezuela.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what about other industries in Venezuela?  I mean, the sanctions are on the oil industry.  What about other money, other imports that they still get that?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  We will always look at additional sanctions.  We want to make sure that things like medicine and other humanitarian issues continue to go to the people.  We will always look at additional sanctions to make sure we protect the assets of the country for the people of Venezuela.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why was it important for the President to back the opposition leader?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I think he is the rightful leader of the country, the national assembly, the constitution.  I think, you know, democracy is very important to the people of the United States.  And we want to make sure that there are free and fair elections and that there is a proper democracy that's very important to the national security of the United States.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary, it's good to have you on the program.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you very much.  Secretary Steven Mnuchin joining us.  Coming up, earnings in focus.  Major companies reporting this week including Apple after the bell tonight.  What you need to know ahead of those numbers.  Then the U.K. facing a crucial test.  British lawmakers voting later today on measures surrounding the U.K.'s potential exit from the European Union.  Back in a moment with that.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Earnings driving markets this morning.  3M, Harley-Davidson, Verizon out with mixed reports this morning.  Gerri Willis is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange watching markets.  Gerri?</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  That's right.  3M, Dow component, a split decision here missing on estimates beating on revenue.  The EPS line $2.27 a share.  Revenue 7.95 billion.  They lowered their 2019 guidance.  But they say they're positioned for success in 2019 despite the global slowdown.  Stock trading higher.  Harley-Davidson, let's get to that, a big miss on both the top and the bottom line.</p><p>EPS of 17 cents a share.  Revenue of 955 million.  The stock is down and down hard this morning nearly 10 percent.  They're citing restructuring charges, incremental tariffs and recall costs.  Big troubles for the hog.  Verizon beating on EPs but missing on revenue.  We're seeing yet another split decision here.  EPS of a $1.12 a share.  Revenue of 34.3 billion.  The stock trading down nearly four percent here.</p><p>Profit hurt by the restructuring of Oath Media business as we have discussed.  Apple coming after the bell, this is critical earnings release for the markets here.  EPS estimate of $4.17 a share.  Revenue of 84 billion.  We will be focused like a laser on iPhone.  iPhone sales in China, is there an iPhone recession going on in China right now?  Watch Channel Inventory for some of the details about that.</p><p>Meanwhile, Apple having trouble with FaceTime.  A bug where callers can eavesdrop on FaceTime calls has cropped up.  The company says they are checking it.  But you should know that Tim Cook on Monday, well, he was saying big things about International Data Privacy Day asking users to insist on reforms.  Oops, I guess they got a problem.  Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Gerri.  Thanks very much.  Gerri Willis on Wall Street.  British lawmakers will debate several amendments to the U.K.'s planned exit from the European Union today and let Prime Minister Theresa May know what parliament is prepared to vote for.  Ashley Webster is live in London right now with that.  Ashley?</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.  Good morning, Maria.  This is if Parliament knows exactly what it will vote for.  There will be at least 15 amendments to choose from -- will be debated.  That will be up to the Common Speaker John Bercow.  He will decide which ones will be debated.  And it could indeed shape the future of what Brexit will look like moving forward.</p><p>Now, among the most popular amendments that we are expecting to be the debated will be what's called the Cooper amendment, that's Yvette Cooper, the Labour M.P.  It basically says if no deal is reached by February the 26th, it would postpone Brexit for nine months essentially to end of the year from march 29th, that's the date that exists now.  Then there's the Brady amendment, the Graham Brady (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>He basically is putting forward an amendment that would replace the Irish backstop with what is called alternative arrangements, such pretty vague, basically anything elsewhere and what we have now and there is no time limit on that backstop.  We have heard that Prime Minister Theresa May has already told European leaders that she wants to reopen Brexit negotiations.  Let's not forget, just last month, in December, the Prime Minister said it wasn't going to be reopened that the E.U had given her their best deal.</p><p>Now she wants to turn around and say look, you need to reopen negotiations.  I'm going to find out from Parliament what they are prepared to vote for and let's go from there.  And it calls today is January 29th.  The Brexit deadline, March 29th.  We have exactly two months left to go, Maria.  And let's be honest, there is no sign yet of a -- of a deal in place that a majority of people in Parliament can get behind.</p><p>Yesterday we had a whole series of warnings about what would happen if there was a no deal scenario.  Just crashing out retail consortiums saying, look, there's going to be empty shelves, prices are going to go up, a break in the supply chain.  It will be very, very detrimental to the British economy.  So that is the background.  Later on today, we'll find out what Parliament can get behind.  Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Ashley.  Thanks so much.  We'll check back with you.  Ashley Webster in London this morning.  Coming up.  The shutdown impact on your wallet.  I will be speaking with National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow on the economic effects of the shutdown.  Plus Federal debt reportedly headed to the highest level since World War II.</p><p>That is next.  One brewery feeling the impact.  The shutdown hitting one San Diego beer company.  We've got that story.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thank so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo coming to you live this morning from Washington, D.C.  It is Tuesday, January 29th.  Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Earnings season in full swing.  We have heard from Harley-Davidson, hit in the pre-markets after disappointing numbers.  Xerox as well headed higher after beating expectations.  Look at Harley-Davidson's shares down almost 10 percent right now.  China, one of the issues, once again.  Meanwhile rising tensions with China on the U.S. level.  The U.S. bringing charges against Chinese telecom company, Huawei, as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  Moments ago, I spoke with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin who talked about what the U.S. is looking for in the coming talks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MNUCHIN:  The President wants fair trade with China.  It's got to be reciprocal.  Right now, China has free access into our markets and we have limited access to there.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Futures this morning are higher.  Take a look, we have the highs of the morning right here with the Dow Jones Industrial average up 73 points, a third of a percent.  The S&amp;P 500 up 4-1/2, and the NASDAQ higher by 18 points, one-quarter of one percent.  European indices this morning are also higher.  Take a look.  FT-100 in London is up almost 100 points, 1-1/2 percent.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is up 55, better than one percent.  And the DAX Index in Germany up 37 points, that's one-third of one percent.  Asian markets mostly flat overnight as you'll see that was pretty much across the board with Japan and Korea squeaking out a fractional gain.</p><p>Our top story this half an hour, the cost of the government shutdown.  The CBO says about $3 billion out of 2019's projected GDP was completely lost due to the shutdown.  Joining me right now in a FOX Business exclusive is National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow.  Larry, it's great to see you this morning.</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for being here.  So obviously 35 days, government shutdown, CBO says $3 billion is lost.  Never coming back.  Your reaction.</p><p>KUDLOW:  With respect, once again, we disagree with the CBO.  I don't think we're going to lose anything.  This is completely temporary.  None of the incentives in the economy have been changed by this.  You know, that's the key point.  President Trump lowered marginal tax rates on individuals and most especially businesses.  And then he had this massive sweeping rollback of costly and burden regulations, which freed up the whole economy, including the energy sector, which has turned out to be a boom.  Why would we lose something just because of a temporary issue regarding the government?  Now, I'm always interested in sort of counting angels on the head of a pin.  We have about a $20 trillion economy, fair?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  There -- what was their number, three billion out of 20 trillion?  Do you know what the --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Three billion.  Yes, no, you're right.  You're right.</p><p>KUDLOW:  - percentage that is?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I totally understand.</p><p>KUDLOW:  I don't understand why we even mess with it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Actually, they're saying the total impact was $8-11 billion.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But that will come back, except for the $3 billion they say that is completely lost.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, again, with all due respect to the professionals at the CBO, I disagree.  Again, because the incentives in the economy -- here's the big difference between I guess the administration and the Congressional Budget Office and a lot of other forecasters.  We believe the economy is growing at three percent plus.  By the way, the Commerce Department for 2018 has scored I believe 3.1 percent.  We'll get the rest of those numbers in a week or two.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KUDLOW:  The CBO does not.  They never have.  They've never given us credit for the incentive effect of lowering taxes and regulations.  Supply side incentives are kicking in.  If you look at the whole panoply all of the economic data, whether it's very strong Christmas retail sales, whether it's industrial production, manufacturing, the best since the '80s, whether it's business equipment, which means the capex boom is happening that we always hoped for.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KUDLOW:  You'll see in my judgment, at least, the three percent trend line will continue.  CBO and many others have us at two.  But this goes back before the President.  This goes back way before.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  They don't believe the economy can grow.  They don't give any credit --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, even somebody like a Steve Schwarzman will say 4.2 percent growth in the second quarter is very hard to sustain on a $20 trillion economy.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, I'll keep working on Steve Schwarzman.  He's a good guy.  But in a $20 trillion economy, which again will grow rapidly, I see no reason why we can't continue three percent plus.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That's the whole point.  The idea that was sold to everybody I guess going back several years, maybe going back 10 or 15 years, that we're in some secular stagnation is just plain wrong.  With the right set of policies, to unleash --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- American animal spirit --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we saw that with the tax plan and the deregulation.  I totally get that.</p><p>KUDLOW:  And you look at the --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But what about tariffs and trade, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  The -- just one --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because the CBO'S report also brings that up.</p><p>KUDLOW:  One last one on this, the face of the new Trump economy -- I just want to put this in here, it's the thought I've had for quite a while.  These are men and women running small businesses.  These are blue-collar workers.  You look at the evidence, the employment for blue-collar workers, the best increase since the mid to late '80s, when I was a Reagan Cub Scout here in Washington, D.C.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  The wage rates of blue-collar manufacturing autos, they're rising faster than white-collar workers.  This is a direct result --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- of the incentives we've put into the economy.  CBO, again, it's not personal to my friends at the CBO, they don't give us any credit for these incentives.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No, I understand that.  But the --</p><p>KUDLOW:  And I want to stay with that story.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- the report on the trade policies estimated that new tariffs on imports and exports will cut an average of one-tenth of a percent from economic growth through 2029.  What's your take on that, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because we know that these tariffs are in place.  They still are impacting business and uncertainties.  So, is the President prepared to do away with all tariffs if he gets that agreement from the other side?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, I don't want to go there.  I mean, that's going to be his decision as you know.  Vice Premier Liu He is coming and we will have high level discussions Wednesday and Thursday and we're all looking forward to that, as is the President.  The President, as I read him, moderately optimistic about this trade story.  So, that's good.  What was it, one-tenth of one percent by 2029?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  So then here we are in 2019, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, no.  One-tenth of a percent from economic growth through 2029.</p><p>KUDLOW:  See, this is too hard, Maria.  It's way too hard --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- to figure that stuff out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you don't think there's going to be any -- there's --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Could it be possible that there's no impact from the shutdown?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Yes, quite possible.  I never -- it's utterly totally temporary.  So, that's -- let me --- look, let me go back -- the growth potential from China trade, people tend to look at this as a negative.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Look, I don't know the outcome of these talks.  Here's what I know, the scope of the discussion will be the broadest and deepest in the history of U.S.-China trade.  Literally everything's on the table.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Point number one.  Point number two, if China opens its markets --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is a big deal.</p><p>KUDLOW:  OK?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it looks like there's (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>KUDLOW:  Which is huge.  You know, I don't want to predict, and as Ambassador Lighthizer said a million times, and I agree, the enforcement mechanisms are going to be crucial.  But if they were to open their markets as we have requested regarding tariffs and non-tariffs, if they would let American companies own the subsidiary in China, so there's no forced transfer of the family jewels of technology, if we have --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But it --</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- some rule of law regarding I.P. theft, here's my point, open markets will allow the United States to export like crazy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But I understand that, Larry.</p><p>KUDLOW:  And that has been hand -- we've been handcuffed.  If we do that, if we do that, not only will the United States grow faster --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- because of that, China will grow faster.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That all sounds great, but can you actually do that, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Competition is the solution.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's the point, because if you're saying, \"OK, China, we are agreeing that you are opening your markets, and as a result, we will meet your demands, but then they say okay, but you have to have a communist, a government leader on the board of any company that has 100 percent.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Which is -- which is extraordinary, you're absolutely right.  It's extraordinary.  And it's --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So I mean -- so you could say it's great --</p><p>KUDLOW:  And unacceptable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- that you're going to open markets.</p><p>KUDLOW:  It's unacceptable.  It's unacceptable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But they -- aren't they saying that a communist has to be on the board of any company that has 100 percent?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I think that's been the past and I think that's going to be a very hot topic in these trade talks because that is completely unacceptable to us.  No question about it.  We will see how this turns out.  China, unfortunately, you know, they're in a slump.  China's economy is slumping very bad.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  I think part of that slump is a function of the President's tough negotiating with tariffs, when necessary, OK, part of that slump is in the last five to ten years.  China has moved in the wrong direction, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  The market-based reforms have been moving in their own direction.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But they're not market-based.  They are communists and they want communists on the board of -- So I'm just wondering, all of this sounds great, if you can actually get it done.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Oh, I know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Larry, stay with us.  We want to talk to you about other things because the tax plan and the deregulations have worked.  But there are some other ideas coming into play ahead of 2020.</p><p>KUDLOW:  China should not use the Venezuelan form of the economic policy.  We need to go back to who is it that said free market capitalism is the best path to prosperity?  It was the (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, that would -- that would be you and Ronald Reagan.  Stay with us.  We will be right back.  More with Larry Kudlow.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Thank you.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We come to you live this morning from Washington, D.C. and I am sitting with National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow, in an exclusive interview this morning.  And we were talking about China and what you can get done.  How important is tomorrow and Thursday in terms of meeting a deadline, that March 1st, in terms of a deal on the table?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I think's very important.  Look, I --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think you'll get a deal by March 1?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I don't want to predict.  It's just too hard to predict.  And, of course, these are decisions that will be made by the President, who is his own best negotiator.  Best I can is, as I said, the scope of this thing's going to as wide and broad as anything we have ever seen.  That does not ensure positive negotiator.  Best I can is, as I said, the scope of this thing is going to be as wide and broad as anything we've ever seen.  That does not ensure positive outcomes --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- right?  I think everybody, including the President, is basically moderately optimistic about this, OK?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Wait, let me ask you, your tax plan --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Ultimately -- one other thought which the President believes that he and President Xi will probably be the ultimate negotiators.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  OK?  And the work being done tomorrow and Thursday is vitally important to lay out options, OK?  But --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So the President will be involved in these talks tomorrow and Thursday?</p><p>KUDLOW:  That is what he has been saying in our meetings.  And I hope so because he's a great negotiator.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me move on to the tax plan.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because we're hearing a lot of ideas in terms of taxes now, now with a lot of 2020 hopefuls.  The Tax and Jobs Act obviously did move the needle on economic growth along with the deregulation out of this administration.  Now you've got Elizabeth Warren talking about two to three percent tax on the very high wealth people.  So if you have $50 million in wealth, you'll get two percent tax.  If you've got a billion dollars in assets, you'll get taxed three percent.  And you've got Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez talking about tax of 70 percent tax --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- on the highest earners.  What is your take on this?  Give us your reaction and what kind of an impact those policies might have.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Right.  These are prosperity killers, these are growth killers, these are job killers, these are incentive killers.  This is a return to some heavy government planning essentially direct to the economy.  You know, I hate to dwell on this because it's a crisis right now, but take a look at Venezuela, just for the heck of it.  What (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There was a time when that was vibrant -- it was a vibrate country.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That is correct.  That is correct.  And investment was flocking to it.  Then they took, down through the years, really exact measures you're describing that are coming from some of these Democratic candidates --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- and the economy was destroyed.  I mean I hear this notion we have to have equality, equality of income, equality of results, which I think runs counter to all human nature.  You know what?  A place like Venezuela has equality.  Everybody's poor.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think they'll be able to reverse the tax cuts then?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Everybody's poor in Venezuela, except for a hand -- Maduro and a handful of this top military people.  Is that what we want in America?  We are growing right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So will the Dems be able to reverse your tax cut plans?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Never.  Never, not until the President's configuration.  I -- look, first of all, if they want to try to raise taxes, it will be defeated in the Senate, Republican.  I personally believe even if it went beyond that --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- the President would veto any efforts to turn back his program.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How important --</p><p>KUDLOW:  We're doing what people said we couldn't do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But how important is debt?</p><p>KUDLOW:  They said we couldn't grow at three, four percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But how important is debt, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  We're growing at three, four percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Let's not mess with it.  If it ain't broke, don't fix it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Congressional Budget --</p><p>KUDLOW:  There's a tremendous surge in prosperity here shared by the middle and lower middle income people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Congressional Budget Office is saying that the deficit is hit -- set to hit $897 billion this year.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That would be the highest level since World War II.  When does debt become a priority?  Do you think the President, let's say he does have another term, will try to attack the entitlements?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, look, I think right now the two issues are maintaining economic growth.  You know, growth is the single biggest factor in these budget calculations.  Growth brings income and revenues.  And in fact I haven't gone through it with a fine-toothed comb yet, but I will.  I think I see that the CBO is acknowledging that our faster growth, which they did not predict, is now paying for over 80 percent of the tax cuts.  OK?  And I think you'll see more about that as we get through.  The reports just came out yesterday.</p><p>Second point I want to make is we will have a tough spending budget coming up in a few weeks, a very tough spending budget with reductions of at least five percent across the board, in non-defense accounts.  So I think that's going to be very important.  Let's minimize government where possible.  Let's grow the economy to its max.  And you will see the debt burden, which I thought debt, as a share of GDP, will be coming down, and by the way, it already is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  OK.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That's what happened during the Reagan years.  That's what happened during the John F. Kennedy years.  So, I wrote about it in my book.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That -- that's the best way to measure that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But, Larry, you know what I don't understand?  I mean you're all about growth, you have been for all your entire career.  Why are so many people worried about the slowdown?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why are we hearing some people say a recession is on the horizon?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, there's just -- it's funny in this town and I guess a little bit in New York, this is a lot of pessimism.  I don't --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you expect a recession this year or 2020?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I do not.  I don't see it right now.  If I look at financial indicators, credit spreads, the actual numbers, you know, it's just -- we -- GDP will come out a week late because the Commerce Department has reopened.  We've seen stuff like falling unemployment claims, rising manufacturing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But what are the markets telling us, Larry?  In the month of December, there was no high-yield debt issuance at all.  Credit markets are still tight.</p><p>KUDLOW:  They've come back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They've come back a bit.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Come back.  I like that.  Profits, the mother's milk of stocks, I don't know who first that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You did.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Profits, the mother's milk of stocks are rising.  The early indications are they won't to 25 percent but they're going to rise 10, to 15 percent.  I like that a lot.  Interest rates, the level of rates, are historically low.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you're not worried about market volatility?</p><p>KUDLOW:  There's a million things to worry about when I get up in the morning, you know, mainly getting here on time so I could do this great interview.  But I just want to say, if you look at the sum total of all the evidence right now, there's no recession out there.  I am the happy warrior.  I am an optimist.  President Trump is an optimist.  I think America, right now, we are the hottest economy in the world and we should remain so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll end it there.  Larry Kudlow.  Good to see you, sir.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow.  Back in a moment.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The government shutdown may be over, but the effects are still being felt.  Hillary Vaughn is live this morning at a craft brewery in Escondido, California where the shutdown effects are actually still lingering.  Hillary.</p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Hi, Maria.  Good morning.  Craft beer is a $76.2 billion industry, and for many craft breweries, like Stone Brewery, where we are today, the effects of the government shutdown are not over.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOMINIC ENGELS, CEO, STONE BREWING:  When the industry craft is built on seasonal beers, it's built on new beers, it's the new sexy thing, and if we can't get the new sexy thing to market, then we're not going to connect with our fans.  They're going to be disappointed.  We're going to make the sales numbers we planned to make in our financial plans, and these things will have repercussions.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUGHN:  As Federal workers at the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau are finally back in the office, a mountain of paperwork is waiting, about 11,000 applications for alcohol labels have been backlogged leaving craft breweries waiting to ship and sell all their new beer across state line, which means they're in limbo until these approvals go through.  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Hillary.  Thanks very much.  We've be watching that.  Hillary Vaughn.  Stay with us.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  President Trump is tweeting this morning.  He's talking about a former staffer.  Here's what he just said.  \"A low level staffer that I hardly knew named Cliff Sims wrote yet another boring book based on made up stories in fiction.  He pretended to be an insider when, in fact, he was nothing more than a gofer.  He signed a non-disclosure agreement.  He is a mess.  Dagen McDowell, great to see you this morning thank you so much.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  John Hilsenrath, Matt Schlapp.  I don't know why the President tweets this.  He's got how many million view, you know, users and followers.  He just let everybody know who this guy is like --</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, THE AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Well, he literally sat in a -- he sat in a cubicle outside my wife's office in the West Wing, and so it is kind of amazing like this insider whole kind of mythology is something the President knows is not true.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  But he's got some extra sales thanks to that tweet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  That's what I'm saying.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think, Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  Again, everybody's got a book to write.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jim Comey, this guy.  Hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Oh, that was a good answer.  Hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, Jim Comey's book, yes, well, there's -- I think that will be a story that we're going to continue following, Jim Comey and the FBI.  You know what.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Everybody wants to be Norma Desmond, Maria.  I'm ready for my close up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  Thanks, everybody.  Great panel today.  Great to see you Dagen McDowell, Matt Schlapp, Jon Hilsenrath.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TECHWR-2172770028</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TECHWR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKP-4B11-JBHT-D4VR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">352430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"24032\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good morning, everyone, I'm Maria Bartiromo, thanks for joining us live this morning from Washington.  It is Tuesday, January 29th, your top stories right now 6:00 a.m. on the east coast.  Earnings in focus this morning, investors are watching results from several Dow components ahead of the open this morning.  The one to watch after the close is Apple.  We've got everything you need to know this morning previewing the report.  Apple under fire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile, FaceTime hit with a new bug that lets people eavesdrop on you without your knowledge.  How you can fix it, coming up -- big story.  Rising tensions with China meanwhile, the U.S. bringing charges against Huawei as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  The very latest on state of negotiations with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin this morning.  That interview at 8:00 a.m. Eastern, join us for that.  PG&amp;E makes it official, California's largest utility filed to bankruptcy protection, following the massive wild fires.  We've got all the details, coming up.</p><p>Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz roasted.  The billionaire hackled at an event last night as he gears up toward a possible independent run for the White House.  We've got a big show this morning coming from D.C., U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is here, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow is here along with House Minority, California Congressman Kevin McCarthy.  Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell will join me, along with AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka.  Don't miss a moment of it.  We've got a big three hours, coming up.</p><p>And we turn now -- right now, we kick it off with Wall Street markets.  We're looking to see a rebound this morning.  Take a look at Futures actually have just turned negative once again.  Futures down just fractionally, about 6 points on the Dow Industrials; 1-1/2 points lower on the S&amp;P; and the NASDAQ down 13 points.  This, after stocks finished lower yesterday on China growth fears along with weak guidance from Nvidia and Caterpillar.  We told you -- the Caterpillar numbers right here.  And of course, it did worsen throughout the day as investors react to a weaker-than-expected earnings and guidance.</p><p>Joining me right now is Federated Investors Chief Equity Market Strategist, Phil Orlando.  And Phil, it's good to see you this morning.</p><p>PHIL ORLANDO, CHIEF EQUITY MARKET STRATEGIST, FEDERATED INVESTORS:  Thanks for having me back, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All indications that we are seeing a slowdown and worries around China, among other issues, how do you see the markets here as more earnings have come into play?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, you had this 20 percent waterfall decline in stock prices in the fourth quarter of last year, we thought the market was attempting to price in the prospect of recession this year.  Multiples contracted from 18 times earnings down to 14 times earnings.  In our view, there's no risk of recession this year.  So, the rally that we've seen over the last month, 14 percent rally, the market is starting to price in the fact that maybe we're not going to have a recession.  But we've had a 14 percent rally in a month.  That's very, very powerful.  We would absolutely expect some consolidation here over the next month or two particularly as we've got these critical sign posts coming up in the month of March, but as we look out over the balance of the year, we do think that multiples will return to that 18 level, and we're going to end up with a pretty good year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  To what do you attribute the slowdown?  We've got earnings in focus and we're looking at a number of companies out that give weaker-than-expected guidance or miss on the top line.  Lockheed Martin, Pfizer, and Verizon are reporting this morning.  Apple is, of course, out after the bell, so when you look at the earnings picture, where in terms of industry are you seeing the most slowdown?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, I think in a word, uncertainty is what's impacting earnings and guidance to some degree.  You've got the Fed flip-flops that we saw in the fourth quarter last year, the uncertainty about whether or not the United States and China are going to be able to consummate this trade deal.  You've got Brexit overhanging on the global market and certainly the government shutdown, which was up there for 35 days, and it was just temporarily resolved last Friday.  You've got a number of issues there, all of which are impacting companies in some way, shape or form.  So, with earnings up 25 percent year-over-year in the first three quarters of last year, this fourth quarter is a little softer, I think we're up about 13 percent.  So far, we're about a quarter of the way through the earnings season.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>ORLANDO:  And I think what companies are pointing to are some combination of those four issues that I just mentioned.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you mentioned the shutdown.  The shutdown apparently costing the economy $11 billion according to new analysis from the Congressional Budget Office, although Larry Kudlow is disputing that number, and he's going to join us this morning live to talk about it.  The report says that it hit $3 billion, that's one-tenth of a percent of economic activity in the fourth quarter alone.  So, are there sectors that were -- that were hit hardest in that regard, or do you want to look at those companies that are largely tied to the China trade as one area of the real weakness?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the council of economic advisers under Trump had advised us that the shutdown was going to take about one-tenth of one percent out of GDP per week.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, remember, the shutdown started right around Christmas, so that makes sense that we lost, you know, a tenth of a percent in the fourth quarter, you know, maybe a half a percent here in the first quarter.  We're at 1.7 percent GDP growth in the first quarter, consensus blue chip is around 22, 23.  So, we think this pretext a little high and there will be, you know, sort of a downward revision as we get later in the quarter.  But in terms of industries, I think it's really across the board.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Across the board.</p><p>ORLANDO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about technology because it's big week for tech, Apple, of course, the big story today, reporting after the close tonight -- the only big tech reporting.  Microsoft, Facebook out tomorrow, Amazon is out on Thursday.  This is the week that we'll focus on technology and that's where really the growth stories have been.  Would you want to put new money to work in any of these names ahead of their earnings?</p><p>ORLANDO:  Short answer is probably no.  Again, you've had this 14 percent rally here in the last month, you've got concerns about slowing economic growth both in the U.S. and China.  We think that those issues will be resolved as we get into the back half of the year, but right now, you know, why run the risk of putting new money to work after you've had a big rally in some of these names ahead of what could be a disappointing earnings number or perhaps conservative guidance.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, the stock has come down because people were worried about it.  So, we'll see what the numbers are.  Would you, at some point, go back in to tech?  What's your favorite group right now, Phil?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, the areas that we like best in the U.S. markets are energy, financial services, industrials, and health care.  In terms of looking overseas, emerging markets look very attractive to us.  So, the areas that have really gotten hit the most are the ones that we've been attracted to.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there.  So, the valuations are better, I guess, is what you're saying.</p><p>ORLANDO:  The valuations are much more attractive.  We think the fundamentals are still very strong.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Phil, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>ORLANDO:  Great to see you.  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Phil Orlando joining us there.  Meanwhile, a bug in Apple's FaceTime app lets users listen in someone's phone without even the person knowing.  Dagen McDowell, what's happening this morning?  Good morning to you, Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well, Apple has some explaining to do, but particularly on this earnings call this afternoon.  So, there's a bug in the Apple iPhone that would allow people to eavesdrop on FaceTime users' calls.  A FaceTime user calling another person could listen in while the recipients phone is still ringing even if the person never accepts the call.  This was -- it involves several steps in the Group FaceTime feature on the iPhone.</p><p>Apple has disabled that Group FaceTime while it tries to come up with a fix for this, but you can eavesdrop in on somebody, essentially listening through the microphone, even if a person never takes that call, you could eavesdrop on rooms with unattended devices and even receive unauthorized video from the phone.  And again, it would take several steps to do this, but this is coming from a company, Maria, that loves to brag about its privacy protections and even throws shade at the likes of Facebook and other technology companies.</p><p>And adding embarrassment to embarrassment, yesterday was International Data Privacy Day and Tim Cook was tweeting about that.  Here's what he said on Twitter yesterday before this bug, this eavesdropping bug was disclosed.  We must keep fighting for the kind of world we want to live in.  On this Data Privacy Day, let us all insist on action and reform for vital privacy protections.  The dangers are real and the consequences are too important.  Big whoops for Apple, and of course, everything that happens in the business world is a political opportunity.  The Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo had to weigh in on this as well, putting out a statement late yesterday, say, \"Urging FaceTime users to temporarily disable the app.  So, Apple beat him to it, they're trying to fix it.  Embarrassment nonetheless.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible because you don't even know -- I mean, the phone could be ringing and you don't even know that they're listening.  I mean, that's the worst part of it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  I can explain later as the show goes on how this work, but you'd have to place a FaceTime call, go to the group, add yourself to the call and then the recipient of the call would have to hit maybe one like the on-button on the phone in order to activate it, but it was possible, and it was all over the internet yesterday how to do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, if -- so, if it's -- if it's not on and you say -- and you do -- and you decline the phone call, they can't listen in?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Unless you -- but you can't touch the phone at all.  Like, it's not even declining the phone.  Like, if you hit the up -- the up volume button on the phone, and so if I was playing this trick on you, it would activate it, and they could essentially hear what was going on in the room.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Unbelievable.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  I want to hear more about that, for sure.  Meanwhile, there's this, as expected, PG&amp;E filed for bankruptcy protection following those devastating wildfires in California.  Cheryl Casone on that in headlines right now.  Cheryl, good morning to you.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  Well, PG&amp;E is facing roughly about 30 billion in potential liabilities, as investigators are looking into whether the company's equipment played a role in starting California's deadliest fire.  More than 100 people died following a series of wildfires that burned hundreds of thousands of acres over a two-year period.  The utility providing energy service to 60 million people, we should add.  Taking a look at shares of PG&amp;E, look at that, in the premarket down nearly nine percent.  And those loses have actually paired back in the last hour or so, folks.</p><p>Well, China's Vice Premier has arrived in Washington for high-level trade talks that are going to start tomorrow.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and trade representative Robert Lighthizer will attend the two-day meeting.  Yesterday, the Trump administration announced a pair of indictments against Chinese telecom giant, Huawei.  The U.S. is accusing the company of trying to steal trade secrets from T-Mobile.  The Justice Department also charging Huawei with conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran.</p><p>And the China story continues, folks, shares of Nvidia are lower this morning.  The chipmaker is warning investors, and expects much weaker sales thanks in part, yes, to China's slowing economy.  It also previously cautioned the sales of its graphics processors that are used in video games PCs would be disappointing.  The China effect continues.  Chips for video gaming account for more than half of their business, they lost half their market value since hitting their peak back on October 1st, Maria.  So, Goldman Sachs had to come out last Friday, Maria, warning that a lot of these chip companies that have massive exposure to China are going to have really rough reports.  Micron Technology, even Wynn Resorts, the casino company, has got big China exposure, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, for sure.  All right, Cheryl, thanks so much.  Coming up next, five police officers are injured this morning, four of them shot while serving a search warrant.  The very latest coming up.  And then a venti-size disaster for Howard Schultz last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire (BLEEP).</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Former Starbucks CEO having a rough time exploring a 2020 Presidential run as he gets heckled.  We break it down right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Live from Washington, we are eyeing 2020, former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz facing backlash last night on his first stop of his book tour.  It was his first public appearance after announcing a possible Independent Presidential run.  It did not begin smoothly.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire (BLEEP).  Go back to getting ratio'd on Twitter.  Go back to Davos with the other billionaire elite who think they know how to run the world.  That's not what democracy needs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, my goodness.  Schultz is also facing backlash from former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.  Here's what he tweeted: \"In 2020, the great likelihood is that an Independent would just split the anti-Trump vote and end up re-electing the President.  That's a risk I refused to run in 2016, and we can't afford to run it now.\"</p><p>Here with me this morning to talk more about all of that is Dagen McDowell back in New York, Wall Street Journal Global Economics Editor Jon Hilsenrath here in D.C. with me, along with the American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp.  Gentlemen, it's good to see you.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Welcome to Washington.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, thank you so much.  And welcome to presidential politics, Howard Schultz.  What do you think about that?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Well, I'm going to get some popcorn.  This could be a real interesting Democratic primary, and whatever this Independent thing is, don't you love Michael Bloomberg who has probably spent a million dollars on polling, trying to figure out every way to become the President.  Publicly chastising Schultz for running as an Independent when that's exactly what Bloomberg would just love to do if he could.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  You know, on the one hand, Dagen, I feel like there is an opening for an Independent because there's such extremes and radical conversation going on certainly on the left.  And on the other hand, I don't know, how much is a cup of coffee at Starbucks?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Again, that $18.00 cup of Joe, I'm joking, I'm exaggerating.  It's helping --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think it's like $6.00.  I mean, seriously.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, we love cart coffee around this place.  But again, that's helping fund this run.  But Michael Bloomberg -- you know what, Michael Bloomberg should run for the Democratic nomination if he thinks he can win, it's just hilarious to have this multibillionaire lecturing Howard Schultz about an Independent run when actually a cup of Starbucks coffee has more charisma than Michael Bloomberg, number one.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Number two, it's going to be really interesting to see the narrative in the spring of 1992 with Ross Perot was -- Ross Perot was going to divide the Democratic vote, that it wouldn't hurt the Republican.  This could very well -- I mean, it depends on who -- what Howard Schultz says on the campaign trail and how far-left the Democrats go when they're running for the nomination.  But I'll say this, what he said so far about pay -- how to pay for Medicare For All and how that's impossible, I would be really interested to hear him talk about how to fix the health care system, because he might come to the table with some really interesting ideas and force the Democrats to answer the hard questions about paying for this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that is the thing, I mean, this party unfortunately, it's very hard for someone who's a centrist to actually have a shot.  You had Tim Ryan from Ohio, he wanted to do it, he's an economic thinker, he doesn't have a shot because of the same thing, you've got the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's 70 percent tax rate, the loudest voice in the room.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I mean, there's no question that these primaries are starting out very much from the left, you know, you have talk about a wealth tax, and 70 percent high-income tax threshold.  You have Elizabeth Warren who is going around beating up on the banks.  This is definitely a left-leaning primary season that we're going to be going into.  What I find so fascinating is the journeys that these different billionaires are traveling.  You know, you had President Trump who supported a lot of Democrats as a businessman in New York City traveling over to Republican Party, now you have Michael Bloomberg who started out as a Republican Mayor --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- traveling over to the Democratic Party, and Howard Schultz doesn't know where to go.  He doesn't know where he fits in.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He doesn't know where -- and what about Senator Kamala Harris?  Let's listen to her, because she held a CNN Townhall meeting in Iowa last night.  Harris is vowing to eliminate private health insurance with Medicare For All if elected president.  What's your take, Matt?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Making insurance companies illegal.  Look, the Democratic Party has become quite radicalized.  Think about this, less choices for the patient is the solution to our problems.  That seems insane.  Also, do we really think the government, when you get your tags to drive your car, or when you pay your taxes at the IRS, do you really think all the solutions to our problems are there?  I don't.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Let me ask you this, who does President Trump want to see come out of this whole --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think he wants Howard Schultz to run.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think -- he was taunting him yesterday.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH:  No, besides Howard Schultz, among the Democrats, who does he -- who does he want to (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>SCHLAPP:  I think most Republicans -- I'm not going to speak for the President -- but I think most Republicans believe that Elizabeth Warren is so far out there on the loony left, basically Marxism, socialism that I think they find that a delicious opportunity.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Can I --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- call the confiscation, Dagen.  He called it (INAUDIBLE) I mean, this two or three percent tax on assets, confiscation.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It is wealth confiscation.  It's totally communist and then to try and find people when they hand in their U.S. citizenship when other countries come calling, wanting you move there because they won't come and take your hard-earned money.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  One thing I want to point out that Jon Hilsenrath said that Howard Schultz doesn't know where to go.  President Trump should be worried about a Howard Schultz, because what if he comes to the table, like I said, with ideas that appeal to voters in this country who feel left out.  Who left out from the Republican Party and certainly left out by the left-leaning Democrats in this environment.  So, be very, very careful.  And one other thing I'll add with Howard Schultz at that -- at that bookstore, that's just the New York City welcome wagon.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's the way they treat all tourists in this city.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, I think you make a good point because there is that path.  That path of centrism.  I mean, that path of the center, because people do feel like it's gone wacky all the way on the left, for sure.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  It's a centrist country, but don't forget Hillary.  She's making noises.  Maybe that's the President's favorite opponent.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH:  We haven't seen any --</p><p>SCHLAPP:  She's making noises.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  We haven't seen anyone travel that centrist path as an Independent to presidency.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  So, it was a smart move on Howard Schultz's part.  We'll see.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Or a risky one for all those billions --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, certainly risky.  Take a quick break.  Extreme weather warning meanwhile on the other side of this break, millions of people across the country are gearing up for an Arctic blast as temperatures are plummeting, that's next.</p><p>Then showing their cards, British Prime Minister Theresa May asking Parliament to put up its plans from Britain's exit from the E.U.  Details on the historic debate.  And the vote happening later today, back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  It is cold out, and the deep freeze is setting in, hitting millions of Americans with subzero and dangerous temperatures.  Fox News Senior Meteorologist Janice Dean in the Fox Weather Center right now with the very latest.  Janice, tell us about it.</p><p>JANICE DEAN, FOX NEWS SENIOR METEOROLOGIST:  Hi, Maria, yes, we could be dealing with historic lows.  These are current windchills, what it feels like when you go outside and you are not protected.  Dangerous, potentially life-threatening windchills of -41 in International Falls, -18 in Chicago, but we still have another blast behind this.  So, these are morning lows, these are not windchill temperatures: Chicago -25 on Thursday, -31 in Minneapolis, -16 in Detroit.  Again, those are not windchill values.  Those are actual air temperatures.  But with the windchill, in some cases, we could get windchill values of -40 to -50.  If you go outside, your skin is going to freeze in minutes.</p><p>So, here's Chicago, Illinois.  Your all-time record low is -28.  So, we're going to flirt with historic lows, Maria.  This is a big deal.  The good news is it won't be long lasting.  By the weekend, we'll start to rebound, but I also want to make mention with this arctic cold front as we have snow across the deep south.  Snow that could cripple travel across portions of Atlanta, Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, and towards the southeast, so that's another dangerous part of the storm is the -- not only extreme cold but the snow as far as south as the gulf coast.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Janice.  Wow, what a story, thank you so much.</p><p>DEAN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will be watching.  Janice Dean.  Coming up next, the State of the Union is back on, it is February 5th.  Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi extending an invitation to the President, he accepted the offer.  Then, we're taking a look at the enormous cost of the shutdown.  What is the real number?  Plus, place your bets, Super Bowl fans getting ready to throw down an enormous amount of cash.  So, bet on the big game Sunday.  We break down all the numbers.  Stay with us.  Live from Washington this morning.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us.  We are coming to you live from Washington this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, January 29th, your top stories right now 6:31 on the east coast right now.  Earnings season is in full swing, a lot of big names reporting their fourth quarter today.  Xerox and Pfizer set to report in just a few moments, we'll bring you the numbers as soon as they hit the tape, and tell you how they are impacting markets.  Rising tensions with China, the U.S. is bringing charges against Huawei, as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will be my special guest, in about 90 minutes time.  We will break it all down with the Treasury Secretary, coming up.  So, stay with us.</p><p>Meanwhile, Futures relatively flat this morning, take a look at markets, down 20 points on the Dow Industrials, down 4 points on the S&amp;P, down 18 points on the NASDAQ.  We are expecting some pressure at the start of trading this morning, after all the major indices finished lower, yesterday, on Wall Street.</p><p>In fact, at 4:00, the Dow Industrials gave up 208 points, that was almost 1 percent lower, the S&amp;P 500 down 21, that was three quarters of a percent lower, and the NASDAQ with a 79-point decline yesterday, at the close, down better than 1 percent.</p><p>Investors are watching some big news this week, J.P. Morgan, calling this week the most important week of the first quarter, and here is why, you've got earnings, you've got the British vote, you've got U.S.-China trade talks, you've got a Federal Reserve decision, we're not expecting a Fed hike.</p><p>We've got fourth quarter GDP coming out.  And, of course, at the end of the week, the job's report for the month of January, a big week, investors want to watch it and will be covering it all.</p><p>European indices this morning look like this, in terms of trading.  We are looking at gains in Europe.  The FT-100 up one and a quarter percent, 86 points higher, the CAC Quarante in Paris is up a half a percent, 26 points higher, and the DAX Index in Germany, higher by a fraction, as you can see there.</p><p>Asian markets overnight, flat, take a look.  No real moves there, because mover was the KOSPI Index in Korea, up a quarter of a percent.</p><p>Well, there is tragedy in Houston to report, five police officers injured.  Four of them shot, while serving a search warrant.  We have the very latest, coming up.</p><p>And a debate in parliament, British lawmakers set to vote on the latest plan for the U.K. to leave the European Union.  We are previewing that and we will take a look at the impact across the world.</p><p>We've got a big program this morning from D.C., U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is coming up this morning, along National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow, they will take a look at all of these expectations that the economy is slowing.</p><p>Plus, House Minority Leader and California Congressman, Kevin McCarthy, is with us, along with Michigan Congresswoman, Debbie Dingell.  Plus, AFL CIO, President Richard Trumpa, here as well, big show, don't miss a moment of it, big three hours, coming up. And we are kicking off this half an hour right now, with this top story, feeling the effects of the shutdown, Washington, D.C. back in business for now, President Trump will give his State of the Union of Address on February 5th, Tuesday.  The address was originally supposed to be today.</p><p>Even though the shutdown is over, the U.S. is still feeling effects, new numbers from the Congressional Budget Office to report.  The U.S. GDP will be $3 billion lower during the fourth quarter of 2018, because of this shutdown.  On the immigration front, backlogs of immigration courts grew by at least 10 percent, according to Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about all of that is Americans for Tax Reform President, Grover Norquist, Grover, good to see you.</p><p>GROVER NORQUIST, PRESIDENT, AMERICANS FOR TAX REFORM:  Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So, the CBO is talking about a $3 billion-dollar hit, in fact, as a result of the shutdown, Larry Kudlow is having an issue with this.  He says, frequently disagrees with the CBO anyway.  What's your take in terms of what the shutdown cost the economy?</p><p>NORQUIST:  Look, the key thing is that the economy continues to grow and we're looking at a three percent rate of growth for the year, so $3 billion is a big number, unless you compare it to the GDP of the United States in the fourth quarter.</p><p>So, actually, we're doing fairly well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You don't think it had much of an impact then, Grover?</p><p>NORQUIST:  No, it's a small impact and we have a tremendous growth for the year, which is way beyond what the CBO said was possible, when they scored this.  The CBO needs to spend a little more time going back to explain why they were so wrong on all of their recent predictions, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  Go ahead.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Grover, the Federal Reserve and most of the economist that we surveyed at the Wall Street Journal are saying that the economy is slowing down in 2019.  We had a nice burst in 2018 in part, because of tax cuts and in part, because there's more spending, $300 billion of additional spending.</p><p>But now, they say the economy is slowing along with the global economy, what does that say about the impact of these tax cuts, are the tax cuts really created the long-run growth that Republicans said was going to happen?</p><p>NORQUIST:  The tax cuts do two things.  We were at 35 percent rate, which is the highest in the world.  It made sense for an American company like Burger King to be bought by Canadian company, because even though they're selling the same hamburgers, the same number of employees, it was worth more, because we had a worldwide tax system at 35 percent.</p><p>By taking 35 down to 21, we became competitive with Europe.  I mean, our friends, the Germans were at 25, the Japanese were at 25.  I'm sorry, the Japanese were at 30.  The Chinese were at 25.  And we were at 35.  We weren't even close to being competitive.  It's a huge change in the direction for the country.</p><p>And if the CBO tells you they're pessimistic, they didn't think you could do three percent, they laughed at three percent growth, said you could never do more than --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  The question is, is that three percent growth.  I think a lot of people understand that the corporate tax rate was uncompetitive, even some Democrats wanted to lower their corporate tax rate, but the question is, this new tax code that we've got, is that sufficient to sustain the three percent growth in 2019?</p><p>NORQUIST:  It's a good first start.  We also need to do something about the workforce.  We need more workers and frankly, there's more tax reduction that needs to be done and spending restraint is very important at the end of the day.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  I want to go back to this question about a shutdown, Grover, which is, people are saying, they're almost using the reason why you couldn't cut government, because somehow, that would have a negative impact on our economic growth.  That seems like a very dangerous road to go down.</p><p>Isn't it true that all of this money that they are saying didn't get put into the economy, are you worried that the government actually won't spend all of that by the time that the authority over the money, expires?</p><p>NORQUIST:  For the government to -- I was taught this (INAUDIBLE) economics in college also.  The government takes your money, and then spends it.  It's much better for the economy than if it lets you spend it.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Right.</p><p>NORQUIST:  Because you would waste some of it by investing it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because they can spend money better than you, of course.</p><p>NORQUIST:  And that's the oddest thing because, of course, that's nonsense.  East Germany should have done very well, under this theory, but it doesn't, so --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  What the government is doing is borrowing other people's money and spending it, right?  I mean, we're talking about deficits that are nearing a trillion dollars.</p><p>NORQUIST:  The (INAUDIBLE) cost the government is how much the government spends, whether they borrowed or take it, it's still gone from the -- from the real economy.  The cost of government is total government spending.  We should have taxes low, and then the least destructive way possible, all taxes are somewhat destructive.  And you have less borrowing if you have less spending.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what about all of these new plans?  And by the way, we are getting earnings right now, as we're talking 3M and Xerox, both beat expectations, although 3M is cutting its forecast for the year.  What about all of these ideas about taxing the wealthy?  New York Congressman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez claims for a 70 percent marginal tax rate on the tippy top, as she calls it.</p><p>Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts senator, hopeful, for 2020, two percent tax on Americans whose assets exceed 50 million.  If you're a billionaire, three percent, what's the impact?</p><p>NORQUIST:  OK, magicians like to do this, so you're not looking at, you know -- watch my right hand, don't look at the left hand.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NORQUIST:  The reason they talk about high tax rates on rich people, is that they want to gouge the middle class.  The difference between the United States and Sweden, Finland, Denmark, the countries that Cortez talked about is, they don't have the 70 percent rate, just back up for sec -- there isn't a country in the world with a 70 percent income tax rate.</p><p>Many countries used to, the Beatle song, 19 for me, one for you, 95 percent tax rate, and then the Beatles moved to United States, and everybody who could pay tennis, left Sweden.  And all the countries of the world realize that tax rates that high were stupid and destructive and didn't help equality or growth or anything like that.</p><p>So, they got rid of them.  The whole world got rid of them.  We did it, it was stupid.  We back offed it and had strong economic growth as a result, so 70 percent stupid and destructive.  It's not America saying, the world says that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You probably showed the op-ed today, in the Journal, in California, and taxes as well.  The Journal, this week, by Cypress founder, T.J. Rodgers, which was very good, Another California Tax Grab, he writes.  In it, the politicians have fueled an affordability crisis that drives away businesses and exacerbates homelessness.</p><p>California Governor, Gavin Newsom, called for even higher taxes in his inauguration speech earlier this month.</p><p>NORQUIST:  California is a good example of 70 percent play.  They have a 13 percent rate on people making a million dollars, but they have 8 percent rate on people making $42,000.  So, they want the middle class people in California to think you're OK, because we're really screwing the other guy.</p><p>And point of fact, Florida has a zero percent first income tax, Texas has a zero percent first income tax, 8 percent looks good compared to 13.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NORQUIST:  Looks lousy compared to zero percent.  They want the middle class to think somebody else is paying the freight.  That's why they have those phoney high tax rates that don't raise much money.  It's to fool the middle class.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it is talking point, and it works for the populist.  Let me bring in Dagen McDowell on this, because we hear this every time we go into the tax discussion and we have a Democrat on which takes out another one of those talking points on taxes, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And I want to say that Senator Kamala Harris said that the first thing -- she said it last night, in the town hall, he first thing she do is to cut taxes for the middle class.  Well, roughly half this country pays no net federal income tax, number one, and the Republicans just did that particularly, doubling the standard deduction.</p><p>So, I don't know who she's going to cut taxes for.  But this is the ruse and this is the big liberal lie that all of these big new welfare state initiatives, whether it's green energy, even single payer, it's all going to be paid for by the super rich.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And that it's not going to be -- that the paying won't be spread across every person in this country to fund this welfare state.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And by the way, the numbers don't add up even if you tax all the rich, you're not going to get the amount of money you need for this green deal, Grover.</p><p>NORQUIST:  You don't even balance the budget if you do that, never mind half money for new things.  Look, the big difference between United States and Denmark, United States and Sweden, it's not how much money higher income people pay, it's what happens to middle-income people.</p><p>Denmark, Finland, Sweden, the tax rate on middle income people is 10, 15, 20 points higher than an American middle class person.  And, you add to that the value added tax.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NORQUIST:  The difference between United States and Europe is how heavily taxed middle income people are, and they have those (INAUDIBLE) high rates that very few people pay, to make people in the middle class think that they are getting a deal.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Speaking of middle income tax -- a lot of Democrats want a carbon tax, gasoline tax and even some big American business.  That's the way to address the issue of climate change.  Do you see any path towards a carbon tax that would be acceptable to your point --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I guess, but real quick, Grover.</p><p>NORQUIST:  No.  No, absolutely not.  And the reason is, you can look at Washington State, very deep blue Washington State.  They have twice had it on the ballot and twice defeated a carbon dioxide tax, gasoline taxes lose overwhelmingly.  This is too obvious tax on middle-income people.  It's a loser up.  They are having this fight in -- our dear friends in France or loggerhead down the subject.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We know how that played out.</p><p>NORQUIST:  We had the Ontario government and the Alberta government collapsed as a result of this, and three times, in Australia.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Grover, thank you.  Yes.</p><p>NORQUIST:  Bad politics and lousy economics.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Grover, thank you for the facts, we appreciate it, Grover Norquist, joining us there.</p><p>Five officers injured in a shooting in Texas, meanwhile, Cheryl Casone in New York, with the details, there.  Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  That's right, Maria.  Four officers were shot and another officer suffered a knee injury in Houston.  They were serving a search warrant at a suspected drug house.  Police say two of them were hit in the neck.  Those officers are in critical but stable condition.  Two suspects were killed at the scene.</p><p>Well, a key E.U. negotiator, warning the risk of Britain leaving the European Union without a deal, is very high, as parliament votes on amendments in Theresa May's exit plan today.  Lawmakers set to consider more than 10 different amendments before taking votes.  That's going to be at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>And those votes come after May's plan to leave the European Union was overwhelmingly rejected earlier this month, a lot of those votes against her from her own party.</p><p>Well, Americans will be betting an estimated $6 billion on the Super Bowl, that's according to the survey by the American Gaming Association.  About 22.7 million U.S. adults plan to place a bet on the upcoming Atlanta game, of those bets, 94.47 percent, reportedly illegal, but let the games begin, Maria, and those are your headlines.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Be there to watch it all, front-row seat.</p><p>CASONE:  I'm there for you, Maria.  I've got surprises for you, coming up.  You're going to love them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK, looking forward to it.  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, crisis in Venezuela to take a look at, new sanctions have been placed on the country's oil.  Plus, National Security Advisor, John Bolton, may have inadvertently revealed the administration's next move.  Why his notes are raising eyebrows this morning.</p><p>Then, farming in America, why farmers are being forced to rent water.  That's up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A look at some of the big headlines across America this morning.  The Chicago Tribune reporting on the Pension Agency criticizing Sears Chairman Eddie Lampert's plan to acquire the bankrupt retailer.  The article explaining that the agency sets to takeover Sears.  Pensions objects to the bid, calling it the final fulfillment of a year-long's scheme to deprive Sears and its creditors of assets and its employees of jobs while lining Lampert's on owns pockets.</p><p>The Daily Camera in Colorado, reporting on how Boulder County farmers are increasingly renting water.  The report explains how ownership from agricultural interests has dropped from 85 percent in the late 1950s to just 30 percent.  The water increasingly moving to municipal control.</p><p>And the Mercury News writing that how in one California city you can text 911 for emergency help.  According to the paper, the police department there announced that the service is now available in the city.  It is meant to help people who are hearing or voice impaired.  The police are also recommending that you not send emojis.  Well, yes, I would think not.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  What are we coming to?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  My God, but it is good that you can text 911.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  That's a good step, just don't text person emoji.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, crisis in Venezuela new sanctions placed on the country's oil, plus National Security Advisor John Bolton may have inadvertently revealed the administration's next move, why his notes on his legal pad are raising eyebrows this morning?  We're breaking that down when we come right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A framework for peace.  The U.S. and Taliban negotiators making a preliminary on key issues to end the war in Afghanistan -- the longest war in American history.  The two top points American troop withdrawal and insurgence vowing to end terrorist attacks abroad, that's according to the Wall Street Journal.  Many hurdles remain to ensure the peace is in place.  Joining me right now is Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst, General Jack Keane.  General, it's always a pleasure to see you.</p><p>GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST:  Good to see you, Maria, and welcome to Washington again.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  And what do you think about this?  I mean, are we supposed to be trusting the Taliban?</p><p>KEANE:  No, we can never ever trust the Taliban, that doesn't mean that we can't have a treaty with them.  But here's what I think is going on, a couple of things have changed: one is the Taliban in the last couple of years have gone all out as we have so dramatically reduced our forces, thinking that they will going to be able to overthrow the regime, because the only thing the United States is really doing is training and assisting the ground forces -- no longer doing the fighting, however provide an air power.  That didn't work.  They retook some territory but never took capitals or provinces and they never took -- they never able to secure a province.  So, what has happened?  The war stalemated.  The Taliban cannot take over the government and the government cannot defeat Taliban, even with our assistance.</p><p>Second thing, and this is crucial, Pakistan has gotten involved in this in a way they've never have before.  They forced the Taliban to go to the peace negotiation table, why?  Pakistan knows it's no longer in national interest to keep this thing stalemated.  There's growing al-Qaeda and growing ISIS presence in Afghanistan which gives the Pakistanis some concern.  So, those are the new things that are happening.  That's why the negotiations have some momentum.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's the thing, though.  I mean, so many people were worried when the president said: we were withdrawing the troops.  And where do you stand on that now?  I mean, do you feel better about it given this peace deal?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, let me answer it this way -- I mean, it is an essential question: the Taliban themselves, we are trying to get an agreement with them that, one, they'll stop trying to overthrow the government and number two, they'll power share with them and also, they will assist in taking down the al-Qaeda and the ISIS.  I don't think we can trust them to do that, based on the fact that they provided safe haven for Osama bin Laden for almost 10 years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  So, what do we do?</p><p>KEANE:  So, we leave in place, after we bring out the troops that are providing the training and assistance.  We leave in place a counterterrorism force and an intelligence capability indefinitely.  We're doing that in Yemen, we're doing it in Libya and we're doing it in Africa.  The one in Africa is off the coast.  It's a Maritime Joint Task Force.  That is what we need to do, that is the guaranty against the Taliban because the issue in Afghanistan has always been, we would never intervene in the civil war in Afghanistan between the northern alliance and Taliban for one reason only, we didn't evade, because they attacked the United States.  That's the reason we're there.  We don't want that to happen again and we cannot trust the Taliban to provide that guarantee for us.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, let me move on and ask you about sanctions on the Venezuelan oil industry.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin who will be here shortly this morning along with Security Adviser John Bolton, explain the decision in a briefing yesterday and issued warning for disputed President Nicolas Maduro.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN BOLTON, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR:  The president has made it very clear on this -- on this matter that all options are on the table.</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY:  There's no reason why these resources shouldn't be used for the economic benefit of the people there.  There's no reason for the poverty and the starvation and the humanitarian crisis.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to this announcement yesterday?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, increased pressure on Maduro regime is certainly a welcome thing.  I mean, this really comes down to the loyalty of the military to Maduro.  As long as that loyalty is there, it's unlikely that Maduro is going the leave.  If that loyalty starts to fall apart, I hope we're working a 'plan b', which is engineering right now some kind of exit path for Maduro, where he can go into exile with recriminations in Venezuela.  The Reagan administration did this very successfully on Ferdinand Marcos, back in 1986, overwhelming popular opposition to him, hundreds of thousands of people.  We engineered his exit.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me squeeze in this question before you go general.  This image from the briefing going viral and it shows John Bolton's notepad with the notation: \"5,000 troops to Colombia.\"  Whoa, do you think we should be sending troops to the region?  What do you think about this?  Caught on camera.</p><p>KEANE:  Look, when we deposed Noriega in 1989 operation just cost Panama, 26,000 troops, is what it took.  When we deposed a dictator in Haiti, 28,000.  The ease of troops that would only be in there, move into Venezuela, if there's a problem at the embassy to our diplomat.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How significance is revealing such a secret?</p><p>KEANE:  I think he'd probably wanted to reveal it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  General Jack Keane, good to see you sir.  Thank you so much.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Show: MORNINGS WITH MARIA][Date: January 29, 2019][Time: 07:00:00][Tran: 012902cb.231][Type: SHOW][Head: Interview with Rep.

Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo coming to you live this morning from Washington, D.C.  It is Tuesday, January 29th.</p><p>Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>It is a busy day on the earnings calendar this morning.  3M among the Dow components reporting their fourth quarter.  The company cut its forecast for 2019.  Pfizer also cut this morning.  The stock under pressure this morning after the guidance came in below expectations.  Pfizer shares down almost 2 percent.  3M down two-thirds of a percent.</p><p>The big one to watch after the close tonight -- Apple.  We've got everything you need to know as Apple prepares to report its quarterly numbers.</p><p>Rising tensions meanwhile with China.  The U.S. has brought charges against Huawei as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.

And we're working through what are still very complicated issues.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'll be sitting down with Secretary Mnuchin this morning at 8:00 a.m. Eastern.  Join us live as the Treasury Secretary will join the program, coming up.</p><p>Markets are under pressure this morning.  Futures pointing to a lower opening for the broader averages although right now it is more like a flat showing than lower.</p><p>The Dow Industrials are up 3 points right now.  S&amp;P 500 pretty much flat, up a quarter point.  And the Nasdaq is down 4 points.  It's been back and forth on futures this after declines across the board yesterday, of course.</p><p>Stocks finished off of the lows of the day but nonetheless, the Dow Industrials were down 209 points, almost 1 percent.  S&amp;P was down 20.  The Nasdaq was down 79, better than 1 percent lower.</p><p>Global markets this morning.  Take a look at European indices, higher across the board.  This right here, this is the high of the morning.  FT 100 up 1.5 percent, 97 points higher.  CAC 40 in Paris up 39 points, almost 1 percent.  And the DAX index in Germany up about 20 points right now.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets were little changed, pretty much across the board as you can see.</p><p>Well, the date is official now with the government back open, President Trump will give his State of the Union address one week from today.  We're taking a closer look at the fallout from the shutdown including the cost to the economy.</p><p>Snapchat's about-face.  Take a look, the social media service eyeing a major change to better compete with Instagram.  We'll tell you all about it coming up.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning.  And joining me to break it all down -- Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell in New York; the \"Wall Street Journal's\" global economics editor Jon Hilsenrath here in D.C. with me; and the American Conservative Union chairman, Matt Schlapp.  Great to see you -- guys.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Great to be here.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen -- good morning to you.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning.  We were talking about the shutdown.  So it's over for the time being.</p><p>The Democrats have actually been hurt by it as well.  Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows that positive feelings about the Democratic Party have fallen to 35 percent this month.  That's down 4 percentage points since December.  And that is essentially in line with the positive feelings that people have about Republicans.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean that's a really good point because the President really did not get hurt certainly on his base, from his base, by the shutdown.  What do you guys think?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Two things.  First is that the President's base was actually energized that he would make a spending fight.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Remember, immigration is a spending fight because if he can stop illegal immigration or reduce it, you don't have all these social services costs.</p><p>But the second thing is, the President's brand is that he will fight, he will fight harder than any politician on the field and he reiterated that brand.  So if he can increase that reputation, I think it appeals to Independents.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They said dig in.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  But isn't his brand also -- it's about fighting and continuing to fight and winning.  And he didn't win the wall in this case.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  I don't agree with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We don't know if he won the wall yet.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  There's three steps to this - -</p><p>HILSENRATH:  In this case, right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  In this case.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  -- there's three really important things.  Number one, the bill he signed has $1.3 billion in barrier funding annualized.</p><p>Number two, he's got to exhaust all legislative efforts if he's going to go the emergency route in order to have a good case in court.</p><p>And number three, the American people when it comes to immigration, he is on the right side of this policy argument.  And Democrats who are against border security, they're going to be sorry for this eventually.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  But you know what.  You better be --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, go ahead -- Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- but you better be careful about what you do and this goes to all politicians because I was flying on Friday and that was an utter nightmare.  If you want to anger everybody in the electorate, you pull another fast one like that where people are grounded and you've got an hour and-a-half plane flight where you're at 8,000 feet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But who are you blaming?</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They were blaming (INAUDIBLE) and blaming the Democrats because --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They were blaming everybody.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- Nancy Pelosi dug in.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They were blaming everybody.  But TSA agents down in Raleigh, Durham were going to food banks because they were spending what little money they had on gas trying to get to and from work.  So again, I don't care who is responsible for it.  They're all responsible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, businesses did start, you know, putting the uncertainty out there, sitting on cash, making decisions later.  We know.  I mean the SEC closed, can't get any IPOs through.  FDA closed, got to worry about obvious food shortages or food issues.</p><p>So we were beginning to see some real impact.  And Dagen saw it firsthand at the airport.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  That's true.  But if you're a federal employee in this town, let's face it, you make a little bit of a bargain.  Yes, every year you might have to go through a shutdown with your salary.</p><p>But you know, the other thing, Maria, that we don't talk about, it's almost impossible to fire a federal employee.  There's some pretty cushy gigs --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good point.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  -- in THIS town where you basically have an insurance policy against ever getting fired unless you do something just awful.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  And you can read all the GAO reports that's backed that up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're talking about all of that this morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But there are people barely making ends meet who are trying to drive to work, and spending all their money on gasoline and going to food banks who were working for the TSA and not getting paid.</p><p>And when the Republicans stop thinking about them and start talking about the workers who aren't needed, the ones who are furloughed you have really missed the boat.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, maybe.  But how about the fact that we've got a border wall in Nancy Pelosi's state?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that immoral, the wall that separates Tijuana from San Diego --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  But --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- is that immoral?  I don't think so.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They need to start asking all of these Democrats who think that the wall is immoral or don't want to fund it, ok, let's take down the walls that are there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's how you put --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will the three million people in Tijuana assimilate with the three million people in San Diego if that wall is torn down?  I think so.  And we're going to talk about that this morning.</p><p>We've got a big show this morning from D.C., live.  Coming up Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is here, live.  National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow has a thing or two to say about the CBO protections about what exactly the impact is on the economy from that shutdown.</p><p>House Minority Leader and California Congressman Kevin McCarthy will walk us through what these next three weeks look like with his colleagues in terms of this negotiating on border wall funding.</p><p>Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell is here.</p><p>Along with AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka.</p><p>Don't miss a moment of it.  A big two hours coming up.</p><p>And we kick it off this hour right now with markets.  Futures are pointing to a flat opening this morning amid all of this uncertainty over China trade, earnings.  It's an enormous week this week.</p><p>This after stocks finished to the downside yesterday on the China growth fears, the weak guidance from Nvidia and Caterpillar as well, and of course these worries about what happens with China and the U.S.  There's conversations happening tomorrow.</p><p>Joining us right now is the founder, CEO and chief investment strategist at Mainstay Capital Management David Kudla.  David -- good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>DAVID KUDLA, FOUNDER/CEO/CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, MAINSTAY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So we've been talking about what a week this is with the fourth quarter earnings coming out.  That's been pretty much driving the story.  We have a jobs report coming out at the end of the week on Friday.  Brexit discussions, the vote today.  U.S./China discussions tomorrow.  A fourth quarter GDP number.  How do you want to invest with all of this?</p><p>KUDLA:  I think investors should be looking at stocks right now that they want to own.  We've been invested through -- the past month has been very good for stock investors.  13 percent rise through Friday from the lows of December 24th.  And that's in both growth stocks and value stocks, so a broad market advance.</p><p>We're going to see some give and take here now after this nice advance of last month but investors should be picking, you know, their points here, have their list out on stocks they want to own.  We look for a good 2019 for stock investors.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is it good news, Jon Hilsenrath, that the Fed gave us a pivot that we know that the Fed is on pause right now and that we know that they're even ready to consider slowing down the unwind of the bond portfolio?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  I don't think it's good news.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I think it shows that the Fed is becoming less confident about how strong and sustainable the economy is.  I mean it is a sign that inflation isn't picking up and that's good news.  But you see some real trepidation coming out of the Fed right now with the global economy slowing, with markets being unstable and volatile.</p><p>I think the Fed is a little worried about the outlook and that shouldn't really give us a lot of encouragement.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about that, David?  I mean the economy's slowing.</p><p>KUDLA:  But Jon this -- yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLA:  But John -- the important thing here is what happened in the fourth quarter is we had mixed messages out of fed chair Jerome Powell.  We had on October 3rd we were far away from neutral.  Then by November we were close to neutral rates.  Then on the 16th in the Fed meeting they were going to do what's right no matter what.</p><p>Then he came in on January 4th and finally said we're going to be considerate of market and economic conditions and now we're seeing a more consistent and accommodative message out of the Fed.  And that's very important for the markets.</p><p>That's music to the market's ears and that's why we've now seen a sustained advance.  So the markets and investors are now looking at a Fed that seems as though they are going to be considerate of or accommodative or take into account what's happening with the markets, with the economy, and not just normalize rates for the sake of normalizing rates.</p><p>They won't have $50 billion rolling off the balance sheet on auto pilot and they won't raise rates just to raise rates to get to a normalized rate structure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that was the worry in the fourth quarter.</p><p>KUDLA:  -- in pause like in 2016 if the market and economy warrants it.  That's important.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That was they worry in the fourth quarter -- that they were on auto pilot-- Jon.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  Yes, I make two points.</p><p>KUDLA:  That drove volatility in the fourth quarter, the Fed.  .</p><p>HILSENRATH:  David makes a really important point, you know.  So this has been Jerome Powell's first year at the Fed.  He's had a bit of a honeymoon with the market.  And then what the market has discovered in the last month or two is that Mr. Powell, you know, he kind of prides himself on being a plain-spoken communicator but his communication has confused a lot of people in the market.  And he's really had to do a lot of corrections over the last few weeks --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- so that raised some questions about him.</p><p>But the other thing about -- you know, the market wants to see the Fed on an easier path.  Ok.  But the underlying message there is that this economy can't sustain very high rates.</p><p>So it doesn't send a really encouraging message about economic growth and the economic outlook when we see that the Fed is starting to recognize it just can't sustain a tighter monetary policy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But look, we're getting the news from the companies themselves with the fourth quarter numbers coming out.  Verizon just reported mixed earnings.  They beat on earnings, but they missed on revenue.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Caterpillar.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Technology reporting late today, Apple.  And we heard from Apple already.  Facebook, Amazon -- all reporting this week, Microsoft.  It's going to be a big week for technology.  And of course you mentioned Caterpillar.  That was the big kahuna yesterday that really set the tone for the markets because Caterpillar is a great indicator of economic activity across the world, in particular China.</p><p>So stay on earnings for a second, David.  Give me your take on technology.  Because you've got Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft coming out this week.</p><p>KUDLA:  Well, you know, tech stocks got beat up very bad in the fourth quarter.  They've come back in this rally and we think that tech stocks have further to go.</p><p>Look, we think that investors should stay with tech stocks.  We have an opportunity here to add value stocks to the portfolio.  Cyclicals came into 2019 at their lowest valuation relative to the S&amp;P 500 ever.</p><p>So investors now can diversify their portfolio in an opportunistic way, holding both growth stocks.  Those tech stocks that we think still have some rebound and some further runway ahead of them, and by adding value stocks that are very opportunistic.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  David -- it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>KUDLA:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Still bullish on this market.  David Kudla joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, the State of the Union is back on, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi extended officially the invitation to President Trump to do the State of the Union in the House Chamber.  He accepted the offer.</p><p>Plus we're taking a look at the enormous cost of the shutdown, what exactly is the number?  A lot of people say it wasn't very much at all.</p><p>Then, Snapchat's unthinkable change, how the photo sharing app is attempting to compete with Instagram by changing a key feature.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>New revelations in the sexual misconduct claims against the former CEO of Wynn Resorts.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with headlines now in New York -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Maria.  The \"Wall Street Journal\" is reporting that executives at Wynn Resort ignored allegations of sexual misconduct by Steve Wynn over more than a decade.  According to a regulator's report Wynn was accused of sexually assaulting or harassing salon workers, cocktail servers and flight attendants who worked for his company.</p><p>Under a proposed settlement, the Nevada Gaming Control Board won't try to revoke Wynn's regulatory licenses but Wynn is going to pay a fine.  Steve Wynn has denied any claims of misconduct.  There's a one year chart of Wynn's in front of you right there.</p><p>Well, Snapchat has named Lara Sweet as its interim CFO.  This is another shift in leadership at Snap as the company has lost several high profile employees over the last year.  Meanwhile Snap is reportedly considering allowing longer lasting or even permanent videos on Snapchat.  It will apply the Snap shared publicly on this story's features.  Snap is down 52 percent from one year ago.  There's that chart for you.</p><p>Well, Porsche is speeding past Tesla in a fast charging race.  The car maker says it new Porsche Taycan is going to be able to add more than 60 miles of charge in just four minutes.  That will be the fastest available today, exceeding Tesla's super charging stations which needs about 30 minutes to charge a vehicle's battery to at least 80 percent.  Charging times are a key selling point obviously for these car makers and now Porsche is giving Taycan owners three years of free charging.</p><p>And obviously we're going to be hearing from Tesla this week, Maria.  Earnings are coming out from Elon Musk and company.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Cheryl -- thank you so much.</p><p>Coming up next, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi challenged over her words describing a border wall as immoral.  We will break it down when we come back.</p><p>Then support on the links, fans rallying around a pro golfer whose two shot penalty was deemed unfair.  More on that.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Keeping America safe, the government is back open but the focus now is whether President Trump can make a deal with Democratic leadership on funding for the border wall.</p><p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has called it immoral, any wall is immoral.  But her home state of California protects the southern border in some places with an actual wall -- the wall separating Tijuana and San Diego.</p><p>Joining me right now is Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell.  And the last time you were on you said you wanted to look at this again.  Congresswoman -- it's good to see you.</p><p>REP. DEBBIE DINGELL (D), MICHIGAN:  It's good to see you.  Welcome to Washington.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.</p><p>What's your take on this?  I mean can Nancy Pelosi really get away with calling a wall immoral when she has a wall in her own state, separating Tijuana from San Diego?</p><p>DINGELL:  Here is what I think is going to happen.  You've got strong countries (ph), both sides of the aisle, both houses.  They're going to go into that room and they want to cut a deal that's going to keep our nation safe.  I don't think anybody wants to see what we just went through for 35 days.</p><p>It hurt the economy.  It hurt -- and I do believe -- this is going to sound corny but I don't -- you know, why do we point -- why do we need to have a Trump win, a Pelosi win.  We need an American win.</p><p>So I'm hoping they're going to go in that room.  I've talked to my colleagues on both sides.  I've talked to Roy Blunt.  I've talked to all my Democratic colleagues in the House.  They want to win.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DINGELL:  They want to go in and put together a package that's going to keep --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So how do you win?  What's the position in terms of wall funding?  Because they may very well -- your colleagues may very well come back and say ok, here's $5 billion towards border security, not a dime toward a wall.</p><p>DINGELL:  I don't know -- if people are really working together, that may not happen.  You know, there may be money, if there are appropriate places for a wall or fence or --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is there a movement within your party, do you think, among your colleagues that they feel that, yes, some money should go for an actual barrier?</p><p>DINGELL:  I think what I hear among my colleagues is let's go into a room and do something that makes sense.  Let's come up with -- we need to -- I've said this to you a million times.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DINGELL:  We need to strengthen our borders at both sides.  Everybody talks about the southern border.  I've got this northern border too which just had a huge human trafficking problem again in the last few --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But there are areas of the southern border that are very dense.  In other words like when you just look at the wall in Nancy's state and that is three million people on one side in Tijuana, three million people on the other side in San Diego.  If you tear that wall down -- I mean isn't it obvious many of the people on the Tijuana side will assimilate into the United States?</p><p>DINGELL:  Then let me ask you this question.  Build a wall, tear down a wall -- are there structures that are working that are in place?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  .</p><p>DINGELL:  So that's -- what I do think we need drones.  We need to fill the 3,000 open patrol --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's common ground, both sides believe in that.</p><p>DINGELL:  Both agree --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Technology and drones -- definitely.</p><p>DINGELL:  We need technology.  We need to make these ports safer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Specifically in a dense area, like Tijuana/San Diego, drones wouldn't work.  I mean maybe you want that in addition to a wall.  When you have such a dense area, where there's three million people on one side of the wall and three m million on the other, don't you need an actual barrier?</p><p>DINGELL:  But they are going to go in this room.  There are people that know what they're doing.  They're people -- they're senior people that have been on homeland security, people from the areas that are impacted --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think they're going to deal?  We won't shut down the government again?</p><p>DINGELL:  I pray to God, we never shut down the government.  Not only do I pray to God that doesn't come out of conference but you're going to see Republicans and Democrats working together.  We'll get --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This whole wall issue, Congresswoman, sort of underscores what's going on I think in both parties.  Now you've got former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz seeing an opening as a result of the radicalness on both sides.</p><p>He's facing backlash on his first stop for his book tour last night.  It was his first public appearance after announcing a possible Independent presidential run.  It did not go smoothly.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire (EXPLETIVE DELETED).  Go back to (INAUDIBLE) on Twitter.  Go back to Davos with the other billionaire elites who think they know how to run the world.  That's not what the country needs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  You know, I give you a lot of credit just being in politics, by the way.</p><p>Schultz is also being criticized by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, billionaire.  He tweeted this, \"In 2020 the great likelihood is that an Independent would just split the anti-Trump vote and end up reelecting the President.  That's a risk.  I refused to run in 2016 and we can't afford it right now.</p><p>Congresswoman -- do you think an Independent run is viable?  Do you think an Independent run from Schultz would hurt the Democrats?</p><p>DINGELL:  I think it's viable.  He has the money to spend it.  But I think he would hurt the Democrats.  I'm fearful that I am -- I'm trying to step back.  I'm not getting any candidate I want to see who is going to emerge, who's got people skills.</p><p>But this is dangerous.  And as you know, told you two years ago, Donald Trump could become president.  Nobody believed me.  You all thought I was crazy.  You may not have but most people did.</p><p>And I still think he could get reelected.  And if we do not run a strong campaign and we don't have somebody like that that pulls votes off --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  One of the issues is the messaging of what the platform is.  So what do you think the Democratic candidate for 2020 should have as their platform?  What's most important?</p><p>DINGELL:  You know what we didn't do and one of the reasons I believe firmly that President Trump became President Trump.  One, people are tired of partisan bickering.  They're tired of seeing things not get done in Washington.</p><p>There are a lot of people that are hurting in this country, just working men and women who want to know that we actually care about them.  They're scared about healthcare.  They're scared about escalating drug costs.  There's -- look at our --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So healthcare should be the platform?</p><p>DINGELL:  it's one piece of it.  Infrastructure, let's create jobs.  What are we going to do about education?  Trade?</p><p>Now, the President -- you want to know why he won Michigan?  Trade.  They're tired of bad trade deals that ship jobs overseas.  We don't have a level playing field.  The President's trade policy is all over the place.</p><p>It's not consistent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you going to vote for the ratification of USMCA?</p><p>DINGELL:  I don't call it USMC.  I call it NAFTA 2.0.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you going to vote for ratification.</p><p>DINGELL:  I haven't decided yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is on your plate now in the next month.</p><p>DINGELL:  Very much on my plate.  And talk to Lighthizer about it all the time.  But I'm not voting for any bill that doesn't have and acting legislation that keeps more manufacturing from going to Mexico.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wasn't that one of the key things of this new law?</p><p>DINGELL:  But Blazer still went to --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Keeping jobs here.</p><p>DINGELL:  Blazers went to Mexico in July.  I'm not seeing any more American cars go to Mexico and get built for $1.50 to $3.50 and then gets shipped back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you want a change before you vote for it?</p><p>DINGELL:  He knows how I feel.  I'm not -- one of the more likely people to vote for it but I'm not voting for it in the form that it's in right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.   We'll leave it there.</p><p>Congresswoman -- it's good to see you.</p><p>DINGELL:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.  Congresswoman Debbie Dingell joining us here.</p><p>Coming up, the longest government shutdown in American history is over.  But another shutdown threat is on the horizon.  We will talk about the next three weeks, what it looks like with House Minority Leader, Kevin McCarthy.  He's up next.</p><p>Then you've got a friend again.  The new teaser trailer for \"Toy Story 4\" drops with a big surprise.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Tuesday, January 29th.  Your top stories right now at 7:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Earnings season in full swing this morning for the fourth quarter.  Several Dow components reporting their fourth quarter this morning.  Verizon reported a mixed quarter earlier this hour.  Pfizer and 3M also under pressure this morning as you can see.  3M up three percent, although Pfizer and Verizon down better than one percent.</p><p>Rising tensions with China continuing, the U.S. bringing charges against Chinese telecom company Huawei as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning between the two nations.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will be joining me as my special guest this morning at the top of the hour, 8:00 a.m. Eastern.  Join us for that talk on China and the economy as we break it all down with the Treasury secretary.</p><p>Markets this morning are hovering around the flat line.  Take a look.  Dow Industrials up 20 points right now, 26 higher.  The S&amp;P 500 is down by almost one point and the NASDAQ down about three points.</p><p>All this after the major indices finished lower yesterday across the board at 04:00 on Wall Street.  Dow industrials were down 208 points and then actually was off of the lows of the -- of the day, down almost one percent at the close.  S&amp;P 500 gave up 21 points, that was three-quarters of one percent.  And the NASDAQ was down 79 points, better than one percent lower.</p><p>In Europe this morning, a mixed story, actually mostly higher.  FT-100 at the high of the morning right here, up 1-1/4 percent, 83 points higher, ahead of the British vote on the U.K. leaving the E.U.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is up 42 points, almost one percent higher and the DAX Index in Germany higher by 25, quarter of a percent higher there.</p><p>Asian markets mostly quiet overnight.  Take a look, as you can see, it was pretty much across the board.</p><p>$100,000 penalty, how one misstep cost a professional golfer big time.  The outcry, coming up.</p><p>And Woody and Buzz Lightyear are back, the new teaser trailer for \"Toy Story 4\" is out and it marks the return of one character after 20 years.  We will bring it to you.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning.  But first, our top story this half an hour, shutdown showdown, the government open for business again after the last -- at least for the next three weeks, rather.  But the main issue, funding the wall has not been resolved and the White House is not letting it go.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  What I do know is that if they don't come back with a deal, that means Democrats get virtually nothing.  That will make the president and force him to have to take executive action that does not give Democrats the things that they want.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is the House Minority leader, Congressman Kevin McCarthy.  Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you.</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  Thanks for having me back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So, what do the next three weeks look like?  Take us through these negotiating.  Do you expect any money for the wall?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  I expect us to solve this problem in the end.  What's interesting here is the whole time speaker Pelosi said I couldn't negotiate anything until you open up government.  The president put the public first and said OK, let's go through, I'll give you three weeks.</p><p>Now Wednesday, we'll have the conference committee, the senators and the congressional members' appropriation sit down and we'll see if they're serious about it, if they're willing to do something.  Because I believe Nancy Pelosi is out of step with her own party.  If you look at her number two, Steny Hoyer.  He said of course, that walls are not immoral, and that he believes some fencing involved.  From her Agricultural secretary to her Agricultural chair to our Armed Services chair, they both believe in a wall too.  Her Agriculture chairman said give Trump the money.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and she continues to say that it's immoral which I find incredible given the fact she has a wall in her own state.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  As my state too.  You know what I find --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And your state too, exactly.  California.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  You know what I find immoral?  When you really talk about this, this is about stopping human trafficking.  In 2016, they stopped more than 2,000 individuals involved in that.  I think it's immoral that you would allow that to continue.  I don't believe anybody in America that says they support border security believes that there is no such thing as some barrier.</p><p>And the president said, he does not a -- he does not want a wall from sea to shining sea.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  He just believes in the area you need some form of barrier and he's correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, where do you think are the most important areas that you would need the wall?  I mean, we talked earlier about this wall in your state, Tijuana, San Diego where it's very dense, three million people on one side, three million people on the other.  Can you make the case that that dense area is elsewhere where that's why the president is so stuck on having this wall there?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  And it's not the president saying, it's the experts.  The president sat down with the experts and they said this is what we need to be able to secure our border.</p><p>So in certain areas, like in San Diego, we stopped illegal movement by more than 95 percent.  You look at Yuma, Arizons, El Paso another -- El Paso became one of the safest cities in the nation after being able to put it through.  That's what we need, in certain parts of the country along the border, you need a barrier.  In other parts you could put the drones in this part area.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what are you expecting to give on?  And what -- do you think they're going to offer the $5.7 billion that the president wants for border security?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  But we're arguing over one-tenth of one percent of the budget.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a great point.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  The Democrats have voted for a wall before.  But now that the president brings forward what the experts want, they say no.  That is what's so confusing to me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, what -- why is this so important for the president right now?  Going into 2020, I mean, is she seeing this as a campaign promise and that's why he doesn't -- she won't agree to it.  Because I don't know how she can call it immoral, given the wall in her own state, your own state.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Again, it's such a little price to pay for so much more security when you look at the human trafficking.  Think of the number of lives that we will save from this process if we have a secure border.</p><p>But what's more importantly, it's the president that sat down and tried to be reasonable, find common ground.  He's the one who brought DACA into it.</p><p>And let's not forget, speaker Pelosi just a year ago holds the record for the longest speech on the floor, eight hours, over one issue, DACA, which she shut the government down over.  And now she thinks that's not important?  I think those people are important as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think that this -- a negotiation, an agreement will include a DACA deal?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  It could.  It doesn't have to.  But because the Democrats and speaker Pelosi have been saying no.  The president said he was willing to go there, three more years of DACA for a portion of the border security that the experts are asking for.  I just find her out of step with her own party.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, there seems to be a movement within the party, even some of the newer congress people coming in, fresher faces saying you know what, yes, we do need border security and we do need the money.  So, are they going head to head?  I mean, are they -- do they even have a voice?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  They don't even have a voice.  Because remember, she has so much power.  She will not allow the vote to come up.  I believe inside the conference we could come up with an agreement.  The question is, will speaker Pelosi even allow that to be voted on the floor?  If we had a vote on the floor, I believe it would pass.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think that the president will allow the government to shut down again?  I mean, is the president really prepared to have another government shutdown if he doesn't get the money?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Look, I think the president's going to try to find a way to solve this one way or another.  I don't know that shutting the government down solves it.  I there's other ways to do that the president can.  I know he firmly believes in a legislative process.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Should he call for a national emergency?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  He has the power to do that.  I think the best road forward right now is a legislative agreement.  And what's so interesting to me, I'd listened to these Democrats celebrate Nancy Pelosi.  You celebrated someone that got you status quo.  They're still a DACA problem, they're still a border security problem.</p><p>And government is designed to find common ground and compromise.  The president was the one person looking reasonable in all these discussions.  I know the president's committed to this.  He will get the border secure one way or another.  He's giving the Democrats an opportunity.  He gave them an opportunity all along this discussion.  They said then open up the government, they'll discuss it.  So he did that and gave them a three week time.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean, I think this whole thing, the government shutdown and the constant resist upsets people.  I mean, you have to wonder if in fact -- you know, she keeps resisting everything that the president wants, if the people will turn on her.  Because people want to see you guys get something done.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Yes, she is celebrating status quo.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  That's not where we need to be --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me move on and ask you about 2010, congressman.  Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz thinking about running for office.  He was at a book signing last night in New York and he was heckled over his bid.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump.  You egotistical billionaire (INAUDIBLE).  Go back to getting ratioed on Twitter.  Go back to Davos with the other billionaire elites who think they know how to run the world.  That's not what the country needs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This heckler not the only one weighing in.  Michael Bloomberg former mayor of New York City also told Schultz not to run as an independent.  He said this, given the strong pull of partisanship and the realities of the electoral college system, there's no way an independent can win.  That is truer today than ever before.  Is that where we are, an independent can't win, congressman?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  No, I think it's Bloomberg upset.  Because remember, he went from a Republican to an independent to a Democrat and he just spent $120 million giving to the Democrats so they can win the majority in the House and he doesn't want his money to be wasted, so he doesn't want competition.</p><p>Look, I think there's ample opportunity for an independent to get in this race, only because the Democrats are now become social Democrats.  They're talking about a 70 percent tax rate.  They're talking about these green deals.  They're talking about socialism.  If you listen to what some of these new Democrats say, they think Venezuela's problem is not because they're a socialist country, it's because of sanctions.  They're so out of step.  They are putting letters in to help those who want to go sign up for ISIS, to be easy on them to the judge.  I mean, I have -- this is not the America we live in, and that's the difference.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  This party is so out of step and I think you'll find a lot of moderate Democrats who say I want somebody else who could talk about this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, that's why a number of moderate Democrats can't really get the OK from the party leadership because they're not left enough.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  This new socialist Democrat Party has left the Democratic Party.  They are in to -- remember, Bernie Sanders is not registered as a Democrat.  He's registered as a socialist.  AOC does not call herself a Democrat, she calls herself a Democrat socialist.  This party is moving to a whole different place.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Real quick before you go, when the election happened back in November.  You said one of your priorities going to be to get the majority back.  How are you going to do it?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Well, first of all, you've got to make sure you can recruit.  I think, you put the ideas up there.  Ideas should win at the end of the day.  You look at where we are financially in this country.  A lot of that happens to do with the policies that we're able to create, from the tax policy, the battle we had with you human trafficking and other that we were able to do.  I think you're going to find as going directly to, we've got to find a suburban areas to be able to win again in and I think we're going to be very successful.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, it's good to see you.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Congressman Kevin McCarthy, joining us there.</p><p>Still ahead, Richard Trumka AFL-CIO president on the impact of the shutdown on American workers, what he'd like to see, back in a moment with that.</p><p>And then, support on the links, a pro golfer given a big fine and a two-shot penalty which many are calling grossly unfair.  What went wrong, right here.</p><p>Plus, you've got a friend and a big surprise, the trailer for \"Toy Story 4\" drops with a character we haven't seen in 20 years.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Prosecutors resting their case against Joaquin El Chapo Guzman.  Cheryl Casone in New York with details and headlines, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It; must something else, Maria.  The federal government has now rested its case.  They called 56 witnesses.  The trial of the notorious Mexican drug kingpin started back in mid-November.  El Chapo told the trial judge yesterday he will not take the stand in his own defense.  One witness is scheduled to appear for the defense today.  Closing arguments expected to take place tomorrow and Thursday.  Big story, a lot of New Yorkers have been following very closely.</p><p>Well, professional golfer Haotong Li is getting a huge outpouring of support from fellow golfers after losing out on nearly $100,000 Saturday for a minor infraction.  It happened at the Omega Dubai Desert Classic.  Li was on the 18th green when judges accuses caddie of standing too close behind him as he got ready to putt.  Well, the ensuing penalty dropped Li's score from 71 to 73.  And he went from third to 12th.  Tour officials say the correct call was made but acknowledge it was grossly unfair.  They're looking at the giving referees more discretion in cases like this going forward.</p><p>And then, get ready for \"Toy Story 4\".  Pixar is putting out this teaser video, shows the revival of Woody's love interest, Bo Peep.  And she is back with a new, more modern look.  She was last seen in \"Toy Story 2\", back in 1999.  It is now 20 years later, \"Toy Story 4\" is going to be released, Maria, this June .  Those are your headlines from New York, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like it.  Bo Peep.  All right, thank you Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, the lingering effects of the shutdown showdown.  AFL-CIO Richard Trumka will join us to talk about the impact on American workers.  He's up next.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We are focused on the American worker this morning.  White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney saying that the 800,000 federal workers who were not paid twice during the partial government shutdown should receive those checks by the end of this week.</p><p>Joining us right now is American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organization's president, AFL-CIO, Richard Trumka.  It's great to see you, Richard.  Thank you so much for being here.</p><p>RICHARD TRUMKA, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR AND CONGRESS OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION:  Maria, thanks for having me on today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Give us your take on what the impact of the shutdown was.</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, I think there's several impacts.  There's impact on the people and you not only have government workers who get back pay but you have the government contractors who won't get back pay unless something is done.  That was a devastating effect on them.  It had a devastating effect on the economy itself.  $11 billion, although we'll pick some of that back up later in the year.</p><p>But you had a devastating effect on the airline industry where you had people, airline controllers, traffic controllers that were in school that actually just up and left.  They said we're not going to do this anymore (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What could -- what could have been done about it then, Rich?  Because you as the leader that you are and representing so many workers across the country have to be unnerved when you see open borders and illegals coming in and taking your jobs.</p><p>TRUMKA:  Look, that's just not how it works anymore.  I mean, you have people that got laid off from the president's place that have been here 20 years.  They're not taking anybody's job.  What we want to do is make sure every worker in this country has the same rights so that they can't be exploited.</p><p>Because what happens right now with undocumented workers is, they're great when no one's around.  When they try to organize and get a voice, then they start squeezing them.  They start ex -- you know, doing, calling in ICE and different things.</p><p>The idea is if everybody has the same rights, then they can't exploit those people and everybody can actually have a fair playing field.  What happens to American workers -- employers right now, is you have an employer that hires people, makes them work in unfair condition, misclassifies them, underpays them, and they're competing against our employer.  That employer needs to pay everybody the same rate, live by the same working conditions, so that we can all compete.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you're OK with illegals coming in and as long as everybody's treated the same?</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, Maria, it's a -- it's a nice cliche, illegals coming in.  But you know yourself that most people that are here undocumented or illegally came in legally.  So the whole system needs to be addressed.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, but there are apprehensions that we could look at, just in the month of December, just in the month of November, where apprehensions were of illegal immigrants coming in and wanting asylum in the United States.</p><p>TRUMKA:  There's no question that the system is broken.  We need to fix the system and have a path towards citizenship so that those workers that have been here for years and are actually making the economy run, even the president's golf courses and things like that, they have a chance to get citizenship and they work their work there.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Just a question on the golf courses.  As you know, that's the H2B program, people who come here as foreign workers, come under a specified amount of time for DOL.  I think the real question is is that, what happens to all the people, not who have been here who came legally and overstayed the visa, but what about all the people who come every day at the southern border and can cross into our country?  That's really the pernicious problem.  And even on wall, built with American workers, you'd be for that.</p><p>TRUMKA:  But listen, the people that come back and forth, you have Americans that go to Mexico and Mexicans that come to America to work.  I think Mexico --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you don't think there's a problem at the border at all?</p><p>TRUMKA:  I didn't say that.  There is -- there is a problem.  We do need border security.  And no, I don't think that a wall's the answer to it.  Every time someone's tried to build a wall it's not been very successful.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, the one in Tijuana is successful.</p><p>TRUMKA:  Ask the Chinese, ask the French.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The wall -- the wall in Tijuana --</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Ask Tijuana (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tijuana and San Diego, what abut that Richard?</p><p>TRUMKA:  I'm sorry?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The wall, between Tijuana -- separating Tijuana from San Diego, is that successful?</p><p>TRUMKA:  There are places -- there are places probably where it works.  Is that the answer to everything?  No.  Should that have been the reason for a shutdown?  Absolutely not.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  I want -- I want to ask a broader political question.  We've seen in the last two elections that increasingly voters, blue collar voters, voters in manufacturing towns all over America, the kind of rank and file people that you represent are voting for Republicans, they're going for Trump.  Does the AFL-CIO need to realign its own approach to politics in this town, given that more and more of its people are going with people like Donald Trump and his trade policies and the Republican Party?</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, that's a -- that's a question we could talk about two or three hours for.  First of all, we have realigned our politics.  We are issuing -- we're issue oriented right now.  We put an issue out and if a politician supports that issue, then we support them.</p><p>In fact, in this last election we elected two union members to the Senate, three to governorship, 18 to the House of Representative, and 925 to state legislatures, because those workers will go and support our issues.  That's what we try to do.  We find it more and more difficult to find Republicans that actually support us.  Now, the American worker believes that neither the political system --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got to jump.</p><p>TRUMKA:  -- or the economic system works for them.  They want somebody to change the rules.  That's why they voted for Trump.  If he changes the rules to their advantage, some of them will vote for him again.  If he doesn't, he stands a chance of losing those workers and right now he's losing those workers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Richard, thank you so much for joining us.  We appreciate it.  Richard Trumka there.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Show: MORNINGS WITH MARIA][Date: January 29, 2019][Time: 08:00:00][Tran: 012903cb.231][Type: SHOW][Head: Apple Disables Group FaceTime Function That Was Allowing Callers To Listen And View Without Your Consent; British Parliament To Vote On Brexit Amendments; Kudlow on the Economy; Craft Brewers Impacts from the Government Shutdown; Kudlow on China Trade][Sect: News; Domestic][Byline: Maria Bartiromo, Gerri Willis, Ashley Webster, Hillary Vaughn, Dagen McDowell][Guest: Steven Mnuchin, Larry Kudlow, Matt Schlapp, Jon Hilsenrath][Spec: FaceTime; Huawei; Apple; Brexit; Federal Reserve; 3M; Harley-Davidson; Verizon; Oath Media; Channel Inventory; World War II; CBO; Trade Talks; Deregulations; Tax Plan; China Trade; Slowdown; Government Shutdown]</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good Tuesday morning.  Welcome back, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  Live from Washington this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is January 29th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  Earnings in focus.  Investors watching results from several Dow components this morning ahead of the opening bell.  One to watch after the bell tonight -- after the close is Apple.</p><p>Meanwhile, Apple under fire FaceTime hit with a new bug that allows people to eavesdrop on you without your knowledge and even if you don't take the call.  Rising tensions with China, the U.S. brings charges against Chinese telecom company, Huawei as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  The very latest on the state of negotiations with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin coming up.</p><p>Markets are searching for direction this morning.  Take a look at the futures ahead of the open this morning.  Dow industrials picking up speed up 55 points right now, a quarter of a percent higher.  S&amp;P 500 is up two and the NASDAQ right now right now showing a gain of 11 points at the open in about an hour and a half.  This after declines across the board yesterday.  Stocks finished off of the lows, but nonetheless the Dow Industrials gave up 209 points yesterday 4:00, almost one percent lower.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 gave up 21 points, three quarters of a percent lower.  And the NASDAQ was down 79 points.  That was better than one percent lower yesterday.  Global markets this morning are mostly higher.  Take a look at European indices with the FT-100-is at the high of the morning, up 86 points, 1-1/4 percent ahead of the vote on Brexit.  CAC quarante in Paris us up 44 points and the DAX index up 21, fractional gain there.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets were little changed.  Take a look, it was pretty much across the board.  Now, our top story this morning, concerns of a global slowdown.  Last week in Davos I spoke with Bridgewater Associates founder, Ray Dalio, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, and Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey.  Here's what they said about the possibility of an economic slowdown on the horizon.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RAY DALIO, FOUNDER, BRIDGEWATER ASSOCIATES:  Europe has a negative growth and the United States is going to have a negative growth environment.  I don't mean absolute negative, I mean slowing of growth in a material way that could be close to between zero and two percent over the next 18 months.</p><p>BRIAN MOYNIHAN, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, BANK OF AMERICA:  We have the top research firm in the world, and they have done a great job.  And they have the U.S. growing at 2-1/2 percent this year.  The world growing 3-1/2 percent GDP growth.  But that's down from last year.  And so the confusion in the environment right now is a slowdown or is it going in to a recession?</p><p>Nothing we see says it's close to a recession.</p><p>JAMES QUINCEY, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, COCA-COLA:  I think we are in danger of talking ourselves into a problem.  It's just a little bit slower growth.  It's not a recession or a decline.  So we see -- we see a little -- a little softer 2019, maybe a little less tail wind than 2018.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now in a Fox Business exclusive is the treasury secretary of the United States, Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  Great to see you, Secretary.</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, UNITED STATES TREASURY SECRETARY:  Great to see you as well, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.  Your reaction to really what seems like now a unanimous feeling that a slowdown is on the horizon.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, Maria, from everything we see, the U.S. economy is still quite strong.  The companies are doing quite well.  And we see still tremendous investment in capital and human investments.  There's no question that as it relates to Europe and China, there is a slowdown.  We're monitoring that carefully.  But we still see a tremendous opportunity and a lot of capital coming into the U.S.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Federal Reserve basically told us they are on pause.  They may even pause the balance sheet unwind which is also telling us that the Fed is also expecting a slowdown, but do you believe a recession is on the horizon in 2020 even though you're seeing strength and stability so far?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  We see no indications whatsoever of a recession on the horizon.  And from everything we see from speaking to a large across the board businesses, the combination of tax reform, regulatory relief and trade is still has a very strong impact on the U.S. economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And some people are saying that the impact of certainly of trade and tariffs is causing some uncertainty.  So how much of this slowdown that we're expecting later on even if it's not right now is due to what you say you're watching China and Europe and how much of it is uncertainty around the President's tariffs program?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, Maria, as you said, there are people who expect a slowdown but I would just comment a year ago with the projections were 2-1/2 percent.  And we were at three.  We feel very comfortable we're going to hit three for last year.  And we think there's still a very good case for three percent this year.  Now, as it relates to trade, we couldn't be more pleased with the USMCA.  We are looking forward to Congress passing that quickly.</p><p>That's a very important trade deal.  We have two days of talks with China starting tomorrow.  The President is going to be involved in those talks at the conclusion.  We've been updating him.  We have another 30 days after this.  So I think we're making significant progress, and I think on the trade front, these are all very positive impacts for the U.S. economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about the trade talks because this story of China, first off, thank you to the President and to the administration for pushing back on China because that's another unanimous feeling out there, that the President did the right thing in terms of stopping China from some of its practices.  What are you expecting out of these talks?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, the President wants fair trade with China.  It's got to be reciprocal.  Right now China has free access into our markets, and we have limited access to there.  So the critical issue that we've talked about is market access, making sure there aren't forced joint ventures, not forced transfer of technology and that we have a mechanism that when we reach an agreement that we can monitor that agreement and that they'll live up to it.</p><p>And that's how I expect we will make significant progress this week on those issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How much of a priority is espionage?  Obviously the administration unveiling a sweeping set of criminal charges against Huawei Technologies.  We have had on a number of CEOs that have said yes, they have stolen trade secrets from us.  Has this come into the conversation with your Chinese leadership?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  No, let me be clear.  Those are separate issues.  And that's a separate dialogue.  So as it relates to the Huawei issues that's being run by the Justice Department.  I have no involvement in that.  I found out about that yesterday when it was announced.  So those are not part of trade discussions.  Forced technology issues are part of trade discussions but any issues as it relates to violation of U.S. law or U.S. sanctions are going through a separate track, which is the Justice Department.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, I guess the broader issue is, is this a cultural thing in China?  I mean this weekend on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" over on Fox News I spoke with the ranking member of the Intel Committee, House Intel Committee Devin Nunes and he went through some of the practices that China does every day.  Listen to this.  I've got to get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  China might have accessed allied intelligence shared with Poland and passed it on to Moscow.</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R), CALIFORNIA:  What the Chinese are doing is that they have these companies that are essentially owned by the party, the Communist Party and essentially this is a dictatorship.  There's very few people that own these companies.  They weaponize the.  So when all over the -- all over the world you have Chinese technology specifically as it relates to infrastructure on -- communications infrastructure, they will go in and they beat every other company around the world.</p><p>And in fact, they've driven a lot of companies out of business because they come in undercut.  They want to have control over all the com systems or communication systems all over the globe.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's pretty incredible.  We will handle your infrastructure of telecom and then they have a way in of spying.  How can you separate that from the conversation on trade and on forced transfer of technology?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Maria, I think you can easily separate these issues.  So there are two different issues.  One is an issue of state subsidies where they do subsidize state enterprises and they compete unfairly.  Those are trade issues, those are violations of the WTO and that's something from an economic standpoint.  We are going to enforce very seriously.  I think you know among the National Security Council, so I'm going to be careful what I say on national security issues.</p><p>But I assure you whether it's China or anywhere else in the world, our security services, DHS and others will make sure that we protect the U.S. infrastructure, we protect from cyberattacks.  That's something we're very well aware of.  But these are separate issues and shouldn't be confused.  We are focused on what are unfair economic practices.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So the best case that you can get from China is what?  Opening up their markets?  Already we are seeing some likelihood of that, UBS I guess was the first bank that was allowed to operate in China and own 51 percent of that bank.  They say they're going to go to 100 percent in three years.  Are you seeing a significant opening in terms of the Chinese willingness to open their markets to foreigners?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I do, but I think that's a good start.  But why should we have to wait three years for a U.S. company to own 100 percent in the financial services?  China can operate and own 100 percent of companies here.  So that's an example where, you know, they're moving in the right direction.  We want to speed that up.  But the issue is really we want to make sure that U.S. companies can compete fairly in China.</p><p>And if we can do that, China has a very large growing middle class.  It's an enormous market.  As I have said before, this is one of the biggest opportunities for U.S. companies in U.S. business if we can get this right.  And President Trump is determined.  This is the first administration that has aggressively said to China, you need to play fair.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is the President willing to drop all tariffs, should he get a good deal that's acceptable?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I think everything is on the table.  So the President is -- will look at, again, the objective is to have a very fair deal.  Hopefully we'll make progress this week.  The President will be involved in these negotiations and discussions.  And we've still got a lot of work to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the President said look, I'm a tariff guy.  I like tariffs.  So does that mean these tariffs are for, you know, no end in sight or would he be willing to drop the tariffs all together?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  The President hasn't made any decisions on that.  There have been no recommendations from the economic team on that yet.  The first step is to make sure we get a good agreement.  And when we get a good agreement, we'll make a recommendation to the President and he will consider that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have seen the Chinese economy get impacted.  You're still talking about 6.4 percent growth, we think, but that is lower than some people think.  What's your worry or how concerning is it that the Chinese slowdown will impact the United States?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, there's no question that China is slowing down.  They still have significant growth rates.  We're beginning to see the impact on that on world growth.  Our objective is not to slow down China.  Our objective is to make sure that U.S. companies can do business in China and can do business fairly.  So we're monitoring these issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary, stay with us.  We want to get into the shutdown and get your impact on how much the shutdown cost the economy and what you're expecting there.  Stay with us.  More of my exclusive interview with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin when we come right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are life live this morning in Washington, D.C.  And I'm sitting right now with -- in a Fox Business exclusive with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  And Treasury Mnuchin, we were talking about the broad economy.  I want to ask your thoughts on the shutdown.  The CBO says that the shutdown caused $11 billion impact to the economy, $3 billion which is completely lost because of the 35-day shutdown.  Your reaction?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Maria, Kevin Hassett, the CEA is working on final numbers for us.  I think his view is that there's no question that there was some cost but those costs will be recovered as money comes back into the system.  I think it's -- he views that it will almost all be recovered.  Now as it relates to the exact numbers, I haven't seen the final numbers yet.  But the good news is we got the government open.</p><p>People are back to work and we have not seen any significant impact on the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Has -- is the President prepared to shut down the government again in three weeks if he doesn't get the money for the border wall?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Maria, I had dinner last night with the President, the Vice President, Senator Lindsey Graham.  We had a very good discussion on this issue.  There's no question in my mind that the President, the Vice President want to do a fair deal.  Lindsey has been terrific in helping to negotiate this.  I hope the Democrats are sincere.  If they are, there's a sincere deal that will include a lot of different issues that need to be resolved.</p><p>But if they're not sincere, the President has all his options on the table.  And he's determined that he's going to make sure we have border security.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's the impact on the IRS?  There's a lot of worry out there that people are not going to get their checks after April 15th as a result of this shutdown.  What can we expect?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, let me just comment on both the treasury, our bureaus, the IRS in particular, I want to thank the enormous number of government employees who came in and worked during the shutdown.  I think as you know, we had the ability to bring in critical employees.  We never would have been able to do the sanctions that we've been doing over the last month without the hardworking people.</p><p>And the IRS had a large number of critical employees to make sure that we were ready to open for business as usual.  So we're ready to open for tax season.  We're taking tax returns.  We'll be ready for tax refunds.  We will have the phones restaffed.  Now, let me just say that there's no question, this time of the year, there's very, very heavy call volume.  That's something we have to manage.  I encourage taxpayers who have questions to try to go to the web first.</p><p>But we are ready for tax season, and I can assure you that tax refunds will be paid as normal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  So, tax refunds will be paid as normal.  That's the bottom line.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  People were worried about that.  Let me move to the sanctions and in particular Venezuela because you've applied sanctions on the Venezuelan oil industry.  Tell us specifically what the impact here is.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, sanctions are a very important tool in our national security portfolio.  And when we look at national security issues, we look at economic tools.  We look at diplomacy.  We look at national security tools, military options.  So there's no question that what we're trying to do is to cut off the money to the regime that should not be in power and make sure that the President Guaido has access to funds and has access to the assets of the country.</p><p>And to make sure we protect these assets for the people of Venezuela.  It's really quite sad.  This is a country that is very, very rich in oil resources that has had extraordinary poverty and extraordinary humanitarian issues over the last issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And have you spoken with the opposition leader party about this?  What has been the response so far?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I haven't personally, but I know the Vice President has been in communication.  I think the response has been very positive.  We've been very careful in balancing this.  We've -- I've spoken to many of the refineries over the last week.  I want to make sure that there was significant capacity.  There's a lot of oil on the water already in transit to the U.S. refineries.  So I think on the one hand, we've been able to cut off Venezuelan oil going forward.</p><p>But we're managing this with the U.S. refineries.  We've issued licenses for the U.S. refineries to continue to operate.  And if Venezuela wants to continue to sell us oil, which we would like to buy that money would go into blocked accounts and will be protected for the people of Venezuela.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what about other industries in Venezuela?  I mean, the sanctions are on the oil industry.  What about other money, other imports that they still get that?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  We will always look at additional sanctions.  We want to make sure that things like medicine and other humanitarian issues continue to go to the people.  We will always look at additional sanctions to make sure we protect the assets of the country for the people of Venezuela.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why was it important for the President to back the opposition leader?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I think he is the rightful leader of the country, the national assembly, the constitution.  I think, you know, democracy is very important to the people of the United States.  And we want to make sure that there are free and fair elections and that there is a proper democracy that's very important to the national security of the United States.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary, it's good to have you on the program.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you very much.  Secretary Steven Mnuchin joining us.  Coming up, earnings in focus.  Major companies reporting this week including Apple after the bell tonight.  What you need to know ahead of those numbers.  Then the U.K. facing a crucial test.  British lawmakers voting later today on measures surrounding the U.K.'s potential exit from the European Union.  Back in a moment with that.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Earnings driving markets this morning.  3M, Harley-Davidson, Verizon out with mixed reports this morning.  Gerri Willis is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange watching markets.  Gerri?</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  That's right.  3M, Dow component, a split decision here missing on estimates beating on revenue.  The EPS line $2.27 a share.  Revenue 7.95 billion.  They lowered their 2019 guidance.  But they say they're positioned for success in 2019 despite the global slowdown.  Stock trading higher.  Harley-Davidson, let's get to that, a big miss on both the top and the bottom line.</p><p>EPS of 17 cents a share.  Revenue of 955 million.  The stock is down and down hard this morning nearly 10 percent.  They're citing restructuring charges, incremental tariffs and recall costs.  Big troubles for the hog.  Verizon beating on EPs but missing on revenue.  We're seeing yet another split decision here.  EPS of a $1.12 a share.  Revenue of 34.3 billion.  The stock trading down nearly four percent here.</p><p>Profit hurt by the restructuring of Oath Media business as we have discussed.  Apple coming after the bell, this is critical earnings release for the markets here.  EPS estimate of $4.17 a share.  Revenue of 84 billion.  We will be focused like a laser on iPhone.  iPhone sales in China, is there an iPhone recession going on in China right now?  Watch Channel Inventory for some of the details about that.</p><p>Meanwhile, Apple having trouble with FaceTime.  A bug where callers can eavesdrop on FaceTime calls has cropped up.  The company says they are checking it.  But you should know that Tim Cook on Monday, well, he was saying big things about International Data Privacy Day asking users to insist on reforms.  Oops, I guess they got a problem.  Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Gerri.  Thanks very much.  Gerri Willis on Wall Street.  British lawmakers will debate several amendments to the U.K.'s planned exit from the European Union today and let Prime Minister Theresa May know what parliament is prepared to vote for.  Ashley Webster is live in London right now with that.  Ashley?</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.  Good morning, Maria.  This is if Parliament knows exactly what it will vote for.  There will be at least 15 amendments to choose from -- will be debated.  That will be up to the Common Speaker John Bercow.  He will decide which ones will be debated.  And it could indeed shape the future of what Brexit will look like moving forward.</p><p>Now, among the most popular amendments that we are expecting to be the debated will be what's called the Cooper amendment, that's Yvette Cooper, the Labour M.P.  It basically says if no deal is reached by February the 26th, it would postpone Brexit for nine months essentially to end of the year from march 29th, that's the date that exists now.  Then there's the Brady amendment, the Graham Brady (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>He basically is putting forward an amendment that would replace the Irish backstop with what is called alternative arrangements, such pretty vague, basically anything elsewhere and what we have now and there is no time limit on that backstop.  We have heard that Prime Minister Theresa May has already told European leaders that she wants to reopen Brexit negotiations.  Let's not forget, just last month, in December, the Prime Minister said it wasn't going to be reopened that the E.U had given her their best deal.</p><p>Now she wants to turn around and say look, you need to reopen negotiations.  I'm going to find out from Parliament what they are prepared to vote for and let's go from there.  And it calls today is January 29th.  The Brexit deadline, March 29th.  We have exactly two months left to go, Maria.  And let's be honest, there is no sign yet of a -- of a deal in place that a majority of people in Parliament can get behind.</p><p>Yesterday we had a whole series of warnings about what would happen if there was a no deal scenario.  Just crashing out retail consortiums saying, look, there's going to be empty shelves, prices are going to go up, a break in the supply chain.  It will be very, very detrimental to the British economy.  So that is the background.  Later on today, we'll find out what Parliament can get behind.  Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Ashley.  Thanks so much.  We'll check back with you.  Ashley Webster in London this morning.  Coming up.  The shutdown impact on your wallet.  I will be speaking with National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow on the economic effects of the shutdown.  Plus Federal debt reportedly headed to the highest level since World War II.</p><p>That is next.  One brewery feeling the impact.  The shutdown hitting one San Diego beer company.  We've got that story.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thank so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo coming to you live this morning from Washington, D.C.  It is Tuesday, January 29th.  Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Earnings season in full swing.  We have heard from Harley-Davidson, hit in the pre-markets after disappointing numbers.  Xerox as well headed higher after beating expectations.  Look at Harley-Davidson's shares down almost 10 percent right now.  China, one of the issues, once again.  Meanwhile rising tensions with China on the U.S. level.  The U.S. bringing charges against Chinese telecom company, Huawei, as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  Moments ago, I spoke with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin who talked about what the U.S. is looking for in the coming talks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MNUCHIN:  The President wants fair trade with China.  It's got to be reciprocal.  Right now, China has free access into our markets and we have limited access to there.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Futures this morning are higher.  Take a look, we have the highs of the morning right here with the Dow Jones Industrial average up 73 points, a third of a percent.  The S&amp;P 500 up 4-1/2, and the NASDAQ higher by 18 points, one-quarter of one percent.  European indices this morning are also higher.  Take a look.  FT-100 in London is up almost 100 points, 1-1/2 percent.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is up 55, better than one percent.  And the DAX Index in Germany up 37 points, that's one-third of one percent.  Asian markets mostly flat overnight as you'll see that was pretty much across the board with Japan and Korea squeaking out a fractional gain.</p><p>Our top story this half an hour, the cost of the government shutdown.  The CBO says about $3 billion out of 2019's projected GDP was completely lost due to the shutdown.  Joining me right now in a FOX Business exclusive is National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow.  Larry, it's great to see you this morning.</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for being here.  So obviously 35 days, government shutdown, CBO says $3 billion is lost.  Never coming back.  Your reaction.</p><p>KUDLOW:  With respect, once again, we disagree with the CBO.  I don't think we're going to lose anything.  This is completely temporary.  None of the incentives in the economy have been changed by this.  You know, that's the key point.  President Trump lowered marginal tax rates on individuals and most especially businesses.  And then he had this massive sweeping rollback of costly and burden regulations, which freed up the whole economy, including the energy sector, which has turned out to be a boom.  Why would we lose something just because of a temporary issue regarding the government?  Now, I'm always interested in sort of counting angels on the head of a pin.  We have about a $20 trillion economy, fair?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  There -- what was their number, three billion out of 20 trillion?  Do you know what the --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Three billion.  Yes, no, you're right.  You're right.</p><p>KUDLOW:  - percentage that is?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I totally understand.</p><p>KUDLOW:  I don't understand why we even mess with it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Actually, they're saying the total impact was $8-11 billion.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But that will come back, except for the $3 billion they say that is completely lost.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, again, with all due respect to the professionals at the CBO, I disagree.  Again, because the incentives in the economy -- here's the big difference between I guess the administration and the Congressional Budget Office and a lot of other forecasters.  We believe the economy is growing at three percent plus.  By the way, the Commerce Department for 2018 has scored I believe 3.1 percent.  We'll get the rest of those numbers in a week or two.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KUDLOW:  The CBO does not.  They never have.  They've never given us credit for the incentive effect of lowering taxes and regulations.  Supply side incentives are kicking in.  If you look at the whole panoply all of the economic data, whether it's very strong Christmas retail sales, whether it's industrial production, manufacturing, the best since the '80s, whether it's business equipment, which means the capex boom is happening that we always hoped for.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KUDLOW:  You'll see in my judgment, at least, the three percent trend line will continue.  CBO and many others have us at two.  But this goes back before the President.  This goes back way before.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  They don't believe the economy can grow.  They don't give any credit --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, even somebody like a Steve Schwarzman will say 4.2 percent growth in the second quarter is very hard to sustain on a $20 trillion economy.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, I'll keep working on Steve Schwarzman.  He's a good guy.  But in a $20 trillion economy, which again will grow rapidly, I see no reason why we can't continue three percent plus.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That's the whole point.  The idea that was sold to everybody I guess going back several years, maybe going back 10 or 15 years, that we're in some secular stagnation is just plain wrong.  With the right set of policies, to unleash --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- American animal spirit --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we saw that with the tax plan and the deregulation.  I totally get that.</p><p>KUDLOW:  And you look at the --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But what about tariffs and trade, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  The -- just one --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because the CBO'S report also brings that up.</p><p>KUDLOW:  One last one on this, the face of the new Trump economy -- I just want to put this in here, it's the thought I've had for quite a while.  These are men and women running small businesses.  These are blue-collar workers.  You look at the evidence, the employment for blue-collar workers, the best increase since the mid to late '80s, when I was a Reagan Cub Scout here in Washington, D.C.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  The wage rates of blue-collar manufacturing autos, they're rising faster than white-collar workers.  This is a direct result --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- of the incentives we've put into the economy.  CBO, again, it's not personal to my friends at the CBO, they don't give us any credit for these incentives.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No, I understand that.  But the --</p><p>KUDLOW:  And I want to stay with that story.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- the report on the trade policies estimated that new tariffs on imports and exports will cut an average of one-tenth of a percent from economic growth through 2029.  What's your take on that, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because we know that these tariffs are in place.  They still are impacting business and uncertainties.  So, is the President prepared to do away with all tariffs if he gets that agreement from the other side?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, I don't want to go there.  I mean, that's going to be his decision as you know.  Vice Premier Liu He is coming and we will have high level discussions Wednesday and Thursday and we're all looking forward to that, as is the President.  The President, as I read him, moderately optimistic about this trade story.  So, that's good.  What was it, one-tenth of one percent by 2029?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  So then here we are in 2019, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, no.  One-tenth of a percent from economic growth through 2029.</p><p>KUDLOW:  See, this is too hard, Maria.  It's way too hard --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- to figure that stuff out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you don't think there's going to be any -- there's --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Could it be possible that there's no impact from the shutdown?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Yes, quite possible.  I never -- it's utterly totally temporary.  So, that's -- let me --- look, let me go back -- the growth potential from China trade, people tend to look at this as a negative.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Look, I don't know the outcome of these talks.  Here's what I know, the scope of the discussion will be the broadest and deepest in the history of U.S.-China trade.  Literally everything's on the table.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Point number one.  Point number two, if China opens its markets --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is a big deal.</p><p>KUDLOW:  OK?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it looks like there's (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>KUDLOW:  Which is huge.  You know, I don't want to predict, and as Ambassador Lighthizer said a million times, and I agree, the enforcement mechanisms are going to be crucial.  But if they were to open their markets as we have requested regarding tariffs and non-tariffs, if they would let American companies own the subsidiary in China, so there's no forced transfer of the family jewels of technology, if we have --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But it --</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- some rule of law regarding I.P. theft, here's my point, open markets will allow the United States to export like crazy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But I understand that, Larry.</p><p>KUDLOW:  And that has been hand -- we've been handcuffed.  If we do that, if we do that, not only will the United States grow faster --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- because of that, China will grow faster.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That all sounds great, but can you actually do that, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Competition is the solution.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's the point, because if you're saying, \"OK, China, we are agreeing that you are opening your markets, and as a result, we will meet your demands, but then they say okay, but you have to have a communist, a government leader on the board of any company that has 100 percent.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Which is -- which is extraordinary, you're absolutely right.  It's extraordinary.  And it's --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So I mean -- so you could say it's great --</p><p>KUDLOW:  And unacceptable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- that you're going to open markets.</p><p>KUDLOW:  It's unacceptable.  It's unacceptable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But they -- aren't they saying that a communist has to be on the board of any company that has 100 percent?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I think that's been the past and I think that's going to be a very hot topic in these trade talks because that is completely unacceptable to us.  No question about it.  We will see how this turns out.  China, unfortunately, you know, they're in a slump.  China's economy is slumping very bad.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  I think part of that slump is a function of the President's tough negotiating with tariffs, when necessary, OK, part of that slump is in the last five to ten years.  China has moved in the wrong direction, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  The market-based reforms have been moving in their own direction.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But they're not market-based.  They are communists and they want communists on the board of -- So I'm just wondering, all of this sounds great, if you can actually get it done.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Oh, I know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Larry, stay with us.  We want to talk to you about other things because the tax plan and the deregulations have worked.  But there are some other ideas coming into play ahead of 2020.</p><p>KUDLOW:  China should not use the Venezuelan form of the economic policy.  We need to go back to who is it that said free market capitalism is the best path to prosperity?  It was the (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, that would -- that would be you and Ronald Reagan.  Stay with us.  We will be right back.  More with Larry Kudlow.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Thank you.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We come to you live this morning from Washington, D.C. and I am sitting with National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow, in an exclusive interview this morning.  And we were talking about China and what you can get done.  How important is tomorrow and Thursday in terms of meeting a deadline, that March 1st, in terms of a deal on the table?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I think's very important.  Look, I --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think you'll get a deal by March 1?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I don't want to predict.  It's just too hard to predict.  And, of course, these are decisions that will be made by the President, who is his own best negotiator.  Best I can is, as I said, the scope of this thing's going to as wide and broad as anything we have ever seen.  That does not ensure positive negotiator.  Best I can is, as I said, the scope of this thing is going to be as wide and broad as anything we've ever seen.  That does not ensure positive outcomes --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- right?  I think everybody, including the President, is basically moderately optimistic about this, OK?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Wait, let me ask you, your tax plan --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Ultimately -- one other thought which the President believes that he and President Xi will probably be the ultimate negotiators.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  OK?  And the work being done tomorrow and Thursday is vitally important to lay out options, OK?  But --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So the President will be involved in these talks tomorrow and Thursday?</p><p>KUDLOW:  That is what he has been saying in our meetings.  And I hope so because he's a great negotiator.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me move on to the tax plan.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because we're hearing a lot of ideas in terms of taxes now, now with a lot of 2020 hopefuls.  The Tax and Jobs Act obviously did move the needle on economic growth along with the deregulation out of this administration.  Now you've got Elizabeth Warren talking about two to three percent tax on the very high wealth people.  So if you have $50 million in wealth, you'll get two percent tax.  If you've got a billion dollars in assets, you'll get taxed three percent.  And you've got Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez talking about tax of 70 percent tax --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- on the highest earners.  What is your take on this?  Give us your reaction and what kind of an impact those policies might have.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Right.  These are prosperity killers, these are growth killers, these are job killers, these are incentive killers.  This is a return to some heavy government planning essentially direct to the economy.  You know, I hate to dwell on this because it's a crisis right now, but take a look at Venezuela, just for the heck of it.  What (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There was a time when that was vibrant -- it was a vibrate country.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That is correct.  That is correct.  And investment was flocking to it.  Then they took, down through the years, really exact measures you're describing that are coming from some of these Democratic candidates --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- and the economy was destroyed.  I mean I hear this notion we have to have equality, equality of income, equality of results, which I think runs counter to all human nature.  You know what?  A place like Venezuela has equality.  Everybody's poor.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think they'll be able to reverse the tax cuts then?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Everybody's poor in Venezuela, except for a hand -- Maduro and a handful of this top military people.  Is that what we want in America?  We are growing right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So will the Dems be able to reverse your tax cut plans?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Never.  Never, not until the President's configuration.  I -- look, first of all, if they want to try to raise taxes, it will be defeated in the Senate, Republican.  I personally believe even if it went beyond that --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- the President would veto any efforts to turn back his program.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How important --</p><p>KUDLOW:  We're doing what people said we couldn't do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But how important is debt?</p><p>KUDLOW:  They said we couldn't grow at three, four percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But how important is debt, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  We're growing at three, four percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Let's not mess with it.  If it ain't broke, don't fix it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Congressional Budget --</p><p>KUDLOW:  There's a tremendous surge in prosperity here shared by the middle and lower middle income people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Congressional Budget Office is saying that the deficit is hit -- set to hit $897 billion this year.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That would be the highest level since World War II.  When does debt become a priority?  Do you think the President, let's say he does have another term, will try to attack the entitlements?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, look, I think right now the two issues are maintaining economic growth.  You know, growth is the single biggest factor in these budget calculations.  Growth brings income and revenues.  And in fact I haven't gone through it with a fine-toothed comb yet, but I will.  I think I see that the CBO is acknowledging that our faster growth, which they did not predict, is now paying for over 80 percent of the tax cuts.  OK?  And I think you'll see more about that as we get through.  The reports just came out yesterday.</p><p>Second point I want to make is we will have a tough spending budget coming up in a few weeks, a very tough spending budget with reductions of at least five percent across the board, in non-defense accounts.  So I think that's going to be very important.  Let's minimize government where possible.  Let's grow the economy to its max.  And you will see the debt burden, which I thought debt, as a share of GDP, will be coming down, and by the way, it already is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  OK.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That's what happened during the Reagan years.  That's what happened during the John F. Kennedy years.  So, I wrote about it in my book.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That -- that's the best way to measure that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But, Larry, you know what I don't understand?  I mean you're all about growth, you have been for all your entire career.  Why are so many people worried about the slowdown?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why are we hearing some people say a recession is on the horizon?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, there's just -- it's funny in this town and I guess a little bit in New York, this is a lot of pessimism.  I don't --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you expect a recession this year or 2020?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I do not.  I don't see it right now.  If I look at financial indicators, credit spreads, the actual numbers, you know, it's just -- we -- GDP will come out a week late because the Commerce Department has reopened.  We've seen stuff like falling unemployment claims, rising manufacturing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But what are the markets telling us, Larry?  In the month of December, there was no high-yield debt issuance at all.  Credit markets are still tight.</p><p>KUDLOW:  They've come back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They've come back a bit.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Come back.  I like that.  Profits, the mother's milk of stocks, I don't know who first that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You did.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Profits, the mother's milk of stocks are rising.  The early indications are they won't to 25 percent but they're going to rise 10, to 15 percent.  I like that a lot.  Interest rates, the level of rates, are historically low.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you're not worried about market volatility?</p><p>KUDLOW:  There's a million things to worry about when I get up in the morning, you know, mainly getting here on time so I could do this great interview.  But I just want to say, if you look at the sum total of all the evidence right now, there's no recession out there.  I am the happy warrior.  I am an optimist.  President Trump is an optimist.  I think America, right now, we are the hottest economy in the world and we should remain so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll end it there.  Larry Kudlow.  Good to see you, sir.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow.  Back in a moment.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The government shutdown may be over, but the effects are still being felt.  Hillary Vaughn is live this morning at a craft brewery in Escondido, California where the shutdown effects are actually still lingering.  Hillary.</p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Hi, Maria.  Good morning.  Craft beer is a $76.2 billion industry, and for many craft breweries, like Stone Brewery, where we are today, the effects of the government shutdown are not over.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOMINIC ENGELS, CEO, STONE BREWING:  When the industry craft is built on seasonal beers, it's built on new beers, it's the new sexy thing, and if we can't get the new sexy thing to market, then we're not going to connect with our fans.  They're going to be disappointed.  We're going to make the sales numbers we planned to make in our financial plans, and these things will have repercussions.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUGHN:  As Federal workers at the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau are finally back in the office, a mountain of paperwork is waiting, about 11,000 applications for alcohol labels have been backlogged leaving craft breweries waiting to ship and sell all their new beer across state line, which means they're in limbo until these approvals go through.  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Hillary.  Thanks very much.  We've be watching that.  Hillary Vaughn.  Stay with us.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  President Trump is tweeting this morning.  He's talking about a former staffer.  Here's what he just said.  \"A low level staffer that I hardly knew named Cliff Sims wrote yet another boring book based on made up stories in fiction.  He pretended to be an insider when, in fact, he was nothing more than a gofer.  He signed a non-disclosure agreement.  He is a mess.  Dagen McDowell, great to see you this morning thank you so much.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  John Hilsenrath, Matt Schlapp.  I don't know why the President tweets this.  He's got how many million view, you know, users and followers.  He just let everybody know who this guy is like --</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, THE AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Well, he literally sat in a -- he sat in a cubicle outside my wife's office in the West Wing, and so it is kind of amazing like this insider whole kind of mythology is something the President knows is not true.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  But he's got some extra sales thanks to that tweet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  That's what I'm saying.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think, Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  Again, everybody's got a book to write.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jim Comey, this guy.  Hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Oh, that was a good answer.  Hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, Jim Comey's book, yes, well, there's -- I think that will be a story that we're going to continue following, Jim Comey and the FBI.  You know what.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Everybody wants to be Norma Desmond, Maria.  I'm ready for my close up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  Thanks, everybody.  Great panel today.  Great to see you Dagen McDowell, Matt Schlapp, Jon Hilsenrath.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FINWRE-2172770077</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FINWRE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WFD-9FB1-DY0W-435D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">316089</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"24032\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good morning, everyone, I'm Maria Bartiromo, thanks for joining us live this morning from Washington.  It is Tuesday, January 29th, your top stories right now 6:00 a.m. on the east coast.  Earnings in focus this morning, investors are watching results from several Dow components ahead of the open this morning.  The one to watch after the close is Apple.  We've got everything you need to know this morning previewing the report.  Apple under fire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile, FaceTime hit with a new bug that lets people eavesdrop on you without your knowledge.  How you can fix it, coming up -- big story.  Rising tensions with China meanwhile, the U.S. bringing charges against Huawei as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  The very latest on state of negotiations with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin this morning.  That interview at 8:00 a.m. Eastern, join us for that.  PG&amp;E makes it official, California's largest utility filed to bankruptcy protection, following the massive wild fires.  We've got all the details, coming up.</p><p>Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz roasted.  The billionaire hackled at an event last night as he gears up toward a possible independent run for the White House.  We've got a big show this morning coming from D.C., U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is here, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow is here along with House Minority, California Congressman Kevin McCarthy.  Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell will join me, along with AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka.  Don't miss a moment of it.  We've got a big three hours, coming up.</p><p>And we turn now -- right now, we kick it off with Wall Street markets.  We're looking to see a rebound this morning.  Take a look at Futures actually have just turned negative once again.  Futures down just fractionally, about 6 points on the Dow Industrials; 1-1/2 points lower on the S&amp;P; and the NASDAQ down 13 points.  This, after stocks finished lower yesterday on China growth fears along with weak guidance from Nvidia and Caterpillar.  We told you -- the Caterpillar numbers right here.  And of course, it did worsen throughout the day as investors react to a weaker-than-expected earnings and guidance.</p><p>Joining me right now is Federated Investors Chief Equity Market Strategist, Phil Orlando.  And Phil, it's good to see you this morning.</p><p>PHIL ORLANDO, CHIEF EQUITY MARKET STRATEGIST, FEDERATED INVESTORS:  Thanks for having me back, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All indications that we are seeing a slowdown and worries around China, among other issues, how do you see the markets here as more earnings have come into play?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, you had this 20 percent waterfall decline in stock prices in the fourth quarter of last year, we thought the market was attempting to price in the prospect of recession this year.  Multiples contracted from 18 times earnings down to 14 times earnings.  In our view, there's no risk of recession this year.  So, the rally that we've seen over the last month, 14 percent rally, the market is starting to price in the fact that maybe we're not going to have a recession.  But we've had a 14 percent rally in a month.  That's very, very powerful.  We would absolutely expect some consolidation here over the next month or two particularly as we've got these critical sign posts coming up in the month of March, but as we look out over the balance of the year, we do think that multiples will return to that 18 level, and we're going to end up with a pretty good year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  To what do you attribute the slowdown?  We've got earnings in focus and we're looking at a number of companies out that give weaker-than-expected guidance or miss on the top line.  Lockheed Martin, Pfizer, and Verizon are reporting this morning.  Apple is, of course, out after the bell, so when you look at the earnings picture, where in terms of industry are you seeing the most slowdown?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, I think in a word, uncertainty is what's impacting earnings and guidance to some degree.  You've got the Fed flip-flops that we saw in the fourth quarter last year, the uncertainty about whether or not the United States and China are going to be able to consummate this trade deal.  You've got Brexit overhanging on the global market and certainly the government shutdown, which was up there for 35 days, and it was just temporarily resolved last Friday.  You've got a number of issues there, all of which are impacting companies in some way, shape or form.  So, with earnings up 25 percent year-over-year in the first three quarters of last year, this fourth quarter is a little softer, I think we're up about 13 percent.  So far, we're about a quarter of the way through the earnings season.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>ORLANDO:  And I think what companies are pointing to are some combination of those four issues that I just mentioned.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you mentioned the shutdown.  The shutdown apparently costing the economy $11 billion according to new analysis from the Congressional Budget Office, although Larry Kudlow is disputing that number, and he's going to join us this morning live to talk about it.  The report says that it hit $3 billion, that's one-tenth of a percent of economic activity in the fourth quarter alone.  So, are there sectors that were -- that were hit hardest in that regard, or do you want to look at those companies that are largely tied to the China trade as one area of the real weakness?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the council of economic advisers under Trump had advised us that the shutdown was going to take about one-tenth of one percent out of GDP per week.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, remember, the shutdown started right around Christmas, so that makes sense that we lost, you know, a tenth of a percent in the fourth quarter, you know, maybe a half a percent here in the first quarter.  We're at 1.7 percent GDP growth in the first quarter, consensus blue chip is around 22, 23.  So, we think this pretext a little high and there will be, you know, sort of a downward revision as we get later in the quarter.  But in terms of industries, I think it's really across the board.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Across the board.</p><p>ORLANDO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about technology because it's big week for tech, Apple, of course, the big story today, reporting after the close tonight -- the only big tech reporting.  Microsoft, Facebook out tomorrow, Amazon is out on Thursday.  This is the week that we'll focus on technology and that's where really the growth stories have been.  Would you want to put new money to work in any of these names ahead of their earnings?</p><p>ORLANDO:  Short answer is probably no.  Again, you've had this 14 percent rally here in the last month, you've got concerns about slowing economic growth both in the U.S. and China.  We think that those issues will be resolved as we get into the back half of the year, but right now, you know, why run the risk of putting new money to work after you've had a big rally in some of these names ahead of what could be a disappointing earnings number or perhaps conservative guidance.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, the stock has come down because people were worried about it.  So, we'll see what the numbers are.  Would you, at some point, go back in to tech?  What's your favorite group right now, Phil?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, the areas that we like best in the U.S. markets are energy, financial services, industrials, and health care.  In terms of looking overseas, emerging markets look very attractive to us.  So, the areas that have really gotten hit the most are the ones that we've been attracted to.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there.  So, the valuations are better, I guess, is what you're saying.</p><p>ORLANDO:  The valuations are much more attractive.  We think the fundamentals are still very strong.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Phil, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>ORLANDO:  Great to see you.  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Phil Orlando joining us there.  Meanwhile, a bug in Apple's FaceTime app lets users listen in someone's phone without even the person knowing.  Dagen McDowell, what's happening this morning?  Good morning to you, Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well, Apple has some explaining to do, but particularly on this earnings call this afternoon.  So, there's a bug in the Apple iPhone that would allow people to eavesdrop on FaceTime users' calls.  A FaceTime user calling another person could listen in while the recipients phone is still ringing even if the person never accepts the call.  This was -- it involves several steps in the Group FaceTime feature on the iPhone.</p><p>Apple has disabled that Group FaceTime while it tries to come up with a fix for this, but you can eavesdrop in on somebody, essentially listening through the microphone, even if a person never takes that call, you could eavesdrop on rooms with unattended devices and even receive unauthorized video from the phone.  And again, it would take several steps to do this, but this is coming from a company, Maria, that loves to brag about its privacy protections and even throws shade at the likes of Facebook and other technology companies.</p><p>And adding embarrassment to embarrassment, yesterday was International Data Privacy Day and Tim Cook was tweeting about that.  Here's what he said on Twitter yesterday before this bug, this eavesdropping bug was disclosed.  We must keep fighting for the kind of world we want to live in.  On this Data Privacy Day, let us all insist on action and reform for vital privacy protections.  The dangers are real and the consequences are too important.  Big whoops for Apple, and of course, everything that happens in the business world is a political opportunity.  The Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo had to weigh in on this as well, putting out a statement late yesterday, say, \"Urging FaceTime users to temporarily disable the app.  So, Apple beat him to it, they're trying to fix it.  Embarrassment nonetheless.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible because you don't even know -- I mean, the phone could be ringing and you don't even know that they're listening.  I mean, that's the worst part of it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  I can explain later as the show goes on how this work, but you'd have to place a FaceTime call, go to the group, add yourself to the call and then the recipient of the call would have to hit maybe one like the on-button on the phone in order to activate it, but it was possible, and it was all over the internet yesterday how to do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, if -- so, if it's -- if it's not on and you say -- and you do -- and you decline the phone call, they can't listen in?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Unless you -- but you can't touch the phone at all.  Like, it's not even declining the phone.  Like, if you hit the up -- the up volume button on the phone, and so if I was playing this trick on you, it would activate it, and they could essentially hear what was going on in the room.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Unbelievable.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  I want to hear more about that, for sure.  Meanwhile, there's this, as expected, PG&amp;E filed for bankruptcy protection following those devastating wildfires in California.  Cheryl Casone on that in headlines right now.  Cheryl, good morning to you.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  Well, PG&amp;E is facing roughly about 30 billion in potential liabilities, as investigators are looking into whether the company's equipment played a role in starting California's deadliest fire.  More than 100 people died following a series of wildfires that burned hundreds of thousands of acres over a two-year period.  The utility providing energy service to 60 million people, we should add.  Taking a look at shares of PG&amp;E, look at that, in the premarket down nearly nine percent.  And those loses have actually paired back in the last hour or so, folks.</p><p>Well, China's Vice Premier has arrived in Washington for high-level trade talks that are going to start tomorrow.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and trade representative Robert Lighthizer will attend the two-day meeting.  Yesterday, the Trump administration announced a pair of indictments against Chinese telecom giant, Huawei.  The U.S. is accusing the company of trying to steal trade secrets from T-Mobile.  The Justice Department also charging Huawei with conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran.</p><p>And the China story continues, folks, shares of Nvidia are lower this morning.  The chipmaker is warning investors, and expects much weaker sales thanks in part, yes, to China's slowing economy.  It also previously cautioned the sales of its graphics processors that are used in video games PCs would be disappointing.  The China effect continues.  Chips for video gaming account for more than half of their business, they lost half their market value since hitting their peak back on October 1st, Maria.  So, Goldman Sachs had to come out last Friday, Maria, warning that a lot of these chip companies that have massive exposure to China are going to have really rough reports.  Micron Technology, even Wynn Resorts, the casino company, has got big China exposure, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, for sure.  All right, Cheryl, thanks so much.  Coming up next, five police officers are injured this morning, four of them shot while serving a search warrant.  The very latest coming up.  And then a venti-size disaster for Howard Schultz last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire (BLEEP).</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Former Starbucks CEO having a rough time exploring a 2020 Presidential run as he gets heckled.  We break it down right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Live from Washington, we are eyeing 2020, former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz facing backlash last night on his first stop of his book tour.  It was his first public appearance after announcing a possible Independent Presidential run.  It did not begin smoothly.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire (BLEEP).  Go back to getting ratio'd on Twitter.  Go back to Davos with the other billionaire elite who think they know how to run the world.  That's not what democracy needs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, my goodness.  Schultz is also facing backlash from former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.  Here's what he tweeted: \"In 2020, the great likelihood is that an Independent would just split the anti-Trump vote and end up re-electing the President.  That's a risk I refused to run in 2016, and we can't afford to run it now.\"</p><p>Here with me this morning to talk more about all of that is Dagen McDowell back in New York, Wall Street Journal Global Economics Editor Jon Hilsenrath here in D.C. with me, along with the American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp.  Gentlemen, it's good to see you.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Welcome to Washington.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, thank you so much.  And welcome to presidential politics, Howard Schultz.  What do you think about that?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Well, I'm going to get some popcorn.  This could be a real interesting Democratic primary, and whatever this Independent thing is, don't you love Michael Bloomberg who has probably spent a million dollars on polling, trying to figure out every way to become the President.  Publicly chastising Schultz for running as an Independent when that's exactly what Bloomberg would just love to do if he could.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  You know, on the one hand, Dagen, I feel like there is an opening for an Independent because there's such extremes and radical conversation going on certainly on the left.  And on the other hand, I don't know, how much is a cup of coffee at Starbucks?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Again, that $18.00 cup of Joe, I'm joking, I'm exaggerating.  It's helping --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think it's like $6.00.  I mean, seriously.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, we love cart coffee around this place.  But again, that's helping fund this run.  But Michael Bloomberg -- you know what, Michael Bloomberg should run for the Democratic nomination if he thinks he can win, it's just hilarious to have this multibillionaire lecturing Howard Schultz about an Independent run when actually a cup of Starbucks coffee has more charisma than Michael Bloomberg, number one.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Number two, it's going to be really interesting to see the narrative in the spring of 1992 with Ross Perot was -- Ross Perot was going to divide the Democratic vote, that it wouldn't hurt the Republican.  This could very well -- I mean, it depends on who -- what Howard Schultz says on the campaign trail and how far-left the Democrats go when they're running for the nomination.  But I'll say this, what he said so far about pay -- how to pay for Medicare For All and how that's impossible, I would be really interested to hear him talk about how to fix the health care system, because he might come to the table with some really interesting ideas and force the Democrats to answer the hard questions about paying for this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that is the thing, I mean, this party unfortunately, it's very hard for someone who's a centrist to actually have a shot.  You had Tim Ryan from Ohio, he wanted to do it, he's an economic thinker, he doesn't have a shot because of the same thing, you've got the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's 70 percent tax rate, the loudest voice in the room.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I mean, there's no question that these primaries are starting out very much from the left, you know, you have talk about a wealth tax, and 70 percent high-income tax threshold.  You have Elizabeth Warren who is going around beating up on the banks.  This is definitely a left-leaning primary season that we're going to be going into.  What I find so fascinating is the journeys that these different billionaires are traveling.  You know, you had President Trump who supported a lot of Democrats as a businessman in New York City traveling over to Republican Party, now you have Michael Bloomberg who started out as a Republican Mayor --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- traveling over to the Democratic Party, and Howard Schultz doesn't know where to go.  He doesn't know where he fits in.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He doesn't know where -- and what about Senator Kamala Harris?  Let's listen to her, because she held a CNN Townhall meeting in Iowa last night.  Harris is vowing to eliminate private health insurance with Medicare For All if elected president.  What's your take, Matt?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Making insurance companies illegal.  Look, the Democratic Party has become quite radicalized.  Think about this, less choices for the patient is the solution to our problems.  That seems insane.  Also, do we really think the government, when you get your tags to drive your car, or when you pay your taxes at the IRS, do you really think all the solutions to our problems are there?  I don't.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Let me ask you this, who does President Trump want to see come out of this whole --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think he wants Howard Schultz to run.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think -- he was taunting him yesterday.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH:  No, besides Howard Schultz, among the Democrats, who does he -- who does he want to (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>SCHLAPP:  I think most Republicans -- I'm not going to speak for the President -- but I think most Republicans believe that Elizabeth Warren is so far out there on the loony left, basically Marxism, socialism that I think they find that a delicious opportunity.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Can I --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- call the confiscation, Dagen.  He called it (INAUDIBLE) I mean, this two or three percent tax on assets, confiscation.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It is wealth confiscation.  It's totally communist and then to try and find people when they hand in their U.S. citizenship when other countries come calling, wanting you move there because they won't come and take your hard-earned money.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  One thing I want to point out that Jon Hilsenrath said that Howard Schultz doesn't know where to go.  President Trump should be worried about a Howard Schultz, because what if he comes to the table, like I said, with ideas that appeal to voters in this country who feel left out.  Who left out from the Republican Party and certainly left out by the left-leaning Democrats in this environment.  So, be very, very careful.  And one other thing I'll add with Howard Schultz at that -- at that bookstore, that's just the New York City welcome wagon.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's the way they treat all tourists in this city.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, I think you make a good point because there is that path.  That path of centrism.  I mean, that path of the center, because people do feel like it's gone wacky all the way on the left, for sure.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  It's a centrist country, but don't forget Hillary.  She's making noises.  Maybe that's the President's favorite opponent.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH:  We haven't seen any --</p><p>SCHLAPP:  She's making noises.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  We haven't seen anyone travel that centrist path as an Independent to presidency.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  So, it was a smart move on Howard Schultz's part.  We'll see.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Or a risky one for all those billions --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, certainly risky.  Take a quick break.  Extreme weather warning meanwhile on the other side of this break, millions of people across the country are gearing up for an Arctic blast as temperatures are plummeting, that's next.</p><p>Then showing their cards, British Prime Minister Theresa May asking Parliament to put up its plans from Britain's exit from the E.U.  Details on the historic debate.  And the vote happening later today, back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  It is cold out, and the deep freeze is setting in, hitting millions of Americans with subzero and dangerous temperatures.  Fox News Senior Meteorologist Janice Dean in the Fox Weather Center right now with the very latest.  Janice, tell us about it.</p><p>JANICE DEAN, FOX NEWS SENIOR METEOROLOGIST:  Hi, Maria, yes, we could be dealing with historic lows.  These are current windchills, what it feels like when you go outside and you are not protected.  Dangerous, potentially life-threatening windchills of -41 in International Falls, -18 in Chicago, but we still have another blast behind this.  So, these are morning lows, these are not windchill temperatures: Chicago -25 on Thursday, -31 in Minneapolis, -16 in Detroit.  Again, those are not windchill values.  Those are actual air temperatures.  But with the windchill, in some cases, we could get windchill values of -40 to -50.  If you go outside, your skin is going to freeze in minutes.</p><p>So, here's Chicago, Illinois.  Your all-time record low is -28.  So, we're going to flirt with historic lows, Maria.  This is a big deal.  The good news is it won't be long lasting.  By the weekend, we'll start to rebound, but I also want to make mention with this arctic cold front as we have snow across the deep south.  Snow that could cripple travel across portions of Atlanta, Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, and towards the southeast, so that's another dangerous part of the storm is the -- not only extreme cold but the snow as far as south as the gulf coast.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Janice.  Wow, what a story, thank you so much.</p><p>DEAN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will be watching.  Janice Dean.  Coming up next, the State of the Union is back on, it is February 5th.  Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi extending an invitation to the President, he accepted the offer.  Then, we're taking a look at the enormous cost of the shutdown.  What is the real number?  Plus, place your bets, Super Bowl fans getting ready to throw down an enormous amount of cash.  So, bet on the big game Sunday.  We break down all the numbers.  Stay with us.  Live from Washington this morning.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us.  We are coming to you live from Washington this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, January 29th, your top stories right now 6:31 on the east coast right now.  Earnings season is in full swing, a lot of big names reporting their fourth quarter today.  Xerox and Pfizer set to report in just a few moments, we'll bring you the numbers as soon as they hit the tape, and tell you how they are impacting markets.  Rising tensions with China, the U.S. is bringing charges against Huawei, as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will be my special guest, in about 90 minutes time.  We will break it all down with the Treasury Secretary, coming up.  So, stay with us.</p><p>Meanwhile, Futures relatively flat this morning, take a look at markets, down 20 points on the Dow Industrials, down 4 points on the S&amp;P, down 18 points on the NASDAQ.  We are expecting some pressure at the start of trading this morning, after all the major indices finished lower, yesterday, on Wall Street.</p><p>In fact, at 4:00, the Dow Industrials gave up 208 points, that was almost 1 percent lower, the S&amp;P 500 down 21, that was three quarters of a percent lower, and the NASDAQ with a 79-point decline yesterday, at the close, down better than 1 percent.</p><p>Investors are watching some big news this week, J.P. Morgan, calling this week the most important week of the first quarter, and here is why, you've got earnings, you've got the British vote, you've got U.S.-China trade talks, you've got a Federal Reserve decision, we're not expecting a Fed hike.</p><p>We've got fourth quarter GDP coming out.  And, of course, at the end of the week, the job's report for the month of January, a big week, investors want to watch it and will be covering it all.</p><p>European indices this morning look like this, in terms of trading.  We are looking at gains in Europe.  The FT-100 up one and a quarter percent, 86 points higher, the CAC Quarante in Paris is up a half a percent, 26 points higher, and the DAX Index in Germany, higher by a fraction, as you can see there.</p><p>Asian markets overnight, flat, take a look.  No real moves there, because mover was the KOSPI Index in Korea, up a quarter of a percent.</p><p>Well, there is tragedy in Houston to report, five police officers injured.  Four of them shot, while serving a search warrant.  We have the very latest, coming up.</p><p>And a debate in parliament, British lawmakers set to vote on the latest plan for the U.K. to leave the European Union.  We are previewing that and we will take a look at the impact across the world.</p><p>We've got a big program this morning from D.C., U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is coming up this morning, along National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow, they will take a look at all of these expectations that the economy is slowing.</p><p>Plus, House Minority Leader and California Congressman, Kevin McCarthy, is with us, along with Michigan Congresswoman, Debbie Dingell.  Plus, AFL CIO, President Richard Trumpa, here as well, big show, don't miss a moment of it, big three hours, coming up. And we are kicking off this half an hour right now, with this top story, feeling the effects of the shutdown, Washington, D.C. back in business for now, President Trump will give his State of the Union of Address on February 5th, Tuesday.  The address was originally supposed to be today.</p><p>Even though the shutdown is over, the U.S. is still feeling effects, new numbers from the Congressional Budget Office to report.  The U.S. GDP will be $3 billion lower during the fourth quarter of 2018, because of this shutdown.  On the immigration front, backlogs of immigration courts grew by at least 10 percent, according to Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about all of that is Americans for Tax Reform President, Grover Norquist, Grover, good to see you.</p><p>GROVER NORQUIST, PRESIDENT, AMERICANS FOR TAX REFORM:  Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So, the CBO is talking about a $3 billion-dollar hit, in fact, as a result of the shutdown, Larry Kudlow is having an issue with this.  He says, frequently disagrees with the CBO anyway.  What's your take in terms of what the shutdown cost the economy?</p><p>NORQUIST:  Look, the key thing is that the economy continues to grow and we're looking at a three percent rate of growth for the year, so $3 billion is a big number, unless you compare it to the GDP of the United States in the fourth quarter.</p><p>So, actually, we're doing fairly well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You don't think it had much of an impact then, Grover?</p><p>NORQUIST:  No, it's a small impact and we have a tremendous growth for the year, which is way beyond what the CBO said was possible, when they scored this.  The CBO needs to spend a little more time going back to explain why they were so wrong on all of their recent predictions, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  Go ahead.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Grover, the Federal Reserve and most of the economist that we surveyed at the Wall Street Journal are saying that the economy is slowing down in 2019.  We had a nice burst in 2018 in part, because of tax cuts and in part, because there's more spending, $300 billion of additional spending.</p><p>But now, they say the economy is slowing along with the global economy, what does that say about the impact of these tax cuts, are the tax cuts really created the long-run growth that Republicans said was going to happen?</p><p>NORQUIST:  The tax cuts do two things.  We were at 35 percent rate, which is the highest in the world.  It made sense for an American company like Burger King to be bought by Canadian company, because even though they're selling the same hamburgers, the same number of employees, it was worth more, because we had a worldwide tax system at 35 percent.</p><p>By taking 35 down to 21, we became competitive with Europe.  I mean, our friends, the Germans were at 25, the Japanese were at 25.  I'm sorry, the Japanese were at 30.  The Chinese were at 25.  And we were at 35.  We weren't even close to being competitive.  It's a huge change in the direction for the country.</p><p>And if the CBO tells you they're pessimistic, they didn't think you could do three percent, they laughed at three percent growth, said you could never do more than --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  The question is, is that three percent growth.  I think a lot of people understand that the corporate tax rate was uncompetitive, even some Democrats wanted to lower their corporate tax rate, but the question is, this new tax code that we've got, is that sufficient to sustain the three percent growth in 2019?</p><p>NORQUIST:  It's a good first start.  We also need to do something about the workforce.  We need more workers and frankly, there's more tax reduction that needs to be done and spending restraint is very important at the end of the day.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  I want to go back to this question about a shutdown, Grover, which is, people are saying, they're almost using the reason why you couldn't cut government, because somehow, that would have a negative impact on our economic growth.  That seems like a very dangerous road to go down.</p><p>Isn't it true that all of this money that they are saying didn't get put into the economy, are you worried that the government actually won't spend all of that by the time that the authority over the money, expires?</p><p>NORQUIST:  For the government to -- I was taught this (INAUDIBLE) economics in college also.  The government takes your money, and then spends it.  It's much better for the economy than if it lets you spend it.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Right.</p><p>NORQUIST:  Because you would waste some of it by investing it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because they can spend money better than you, of course.</p><p>NORQUIST:  And that's the oddest thing because, of course, that's nonsense.  East Germany should have done very well, under this theory, but it doesn't, so --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  What the government is doing is borrowing other people's money and spending it, right?  I mean, we're talking about deficits that are nearing a trillion dollars.</p><p>NORQUIST:  The (INAUDIBLE) cost the government is how much the government spends, whether they borrowed or take it, it's still gone from the -- from the real economy.  The cost of government is total government spending.  We should have taxes low, and then the least destructive way possible, all taxes are somewhat destructive.  And you have less borrowing if you have less spending.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what about all of these new plans?  And by the way, we are getting earnings right now, as we're talking 3M and Xerox, both beat expectations, although 3M is cutting its forecast for the year.  What about all of these ideas about taxing the wealthy?  New York Congressman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez claims for a 70 percent marginal tax rate on the tippy top, as she calls it.</p><p>Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts senator, hopeful, for 2020, two percent tax on Americans whose assets exceed 50 million.  If you're a billionaire, three percent, what's the impact?</p><p>NORQUIST:  OK, magicians like to do this, so you're not looking at, you know -- watch my right hand, don't look at the left hand.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NORQUIST:  The reason they talk about high tax rates on rich people, is that they want to gouge the middle class.  The difference between the United States and Sweden, Finland, Denmark, the countries that Cortez talked about is, they don't have the 70 percent rate, just back up for sec -- there isn't a country in the world with a 70 percent income tax rate.</p><p>Many countries used to, the Beatle song, 19 for me, one for you, 95 percent tax rate, and then the Beatles moved to United States, and everybody who could pay tennis, left Sweden.  And all the countries of the world realize that tax rates that high were stupid and destructive and didn't help equality or growth or anything like that.</p><p>So, they got rid of them.  The whole world got rid of them.  We did it, it was stupid.  We back offed it and had strong economic growth as a result, so 70 percent stupid and destructive.  It's not America saying, the world says that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You probably showed the op-ed today, in the Journal, in California, and taxes as well.  The Journal, this week, by Cypress founder, T.J. Rodgers, which was very good, Another California Tax Grab, he writes.  In it, the politicians have fueled an affordability crisis that drives away businesses and exacerbates homelessness.</p><p>California Governor, Gavin Newsom, called for even higher taxes in his inauguration speech earlier this month.</p><p>NORQUIST:  California is a good example of 70 percent play.  They have a 13 percent rate on people making a million dollars, but they have 8 percent rate on people making $42,000.  So, they want the middle class people in California to think you're OK, because we're really screwing the other guy.</p><p>And point of fact, Florida has a zero percent first income tax, Texas has a zero percent first income tax, 8 percent looks good compared to 13.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NORQUIST:  Looks lousy compared to zero percent.  They want the middle class to think somebody else is paying the freight.  That's why they have those phoney high tax rates that don't raise much money.  It's to fool the middle class.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it is talking point, and it works for the populist.  Let me bring in Dagen McDowell on this, because we hear this every time we go into the tax discussion and we have a Democrat on which takes out another one of those talking points on taxes, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And I want to say that Senator Kamala Harris said that the first thing -- she said it last night, in the town hall, he first thing she do is to cut taxes for the middle class.  Well, roughly half this country pays no net federal income tax, number one, and the Republicans just did that particularly, doubling the standard deduction.</p><p>So, I don't know who she's going to cut taxes for.  But this is the ruse and this is the big liberal lie that all of these big new welfare state initiatives, whether it's green energy, even single payer, it's all going to be paid for by the super rich.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And that it's not going to be -- that the paying won't be spread across every person in this country to fund this welfare state.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And by the way, the numbers don't add up even if you tax all the rich, you're not going to get the amount of money you need for this green deal, Grover.</p><p>NORQUIST:  You don't even balance the budget if you do that, never mind half money for new things.  Look, the big difference between United States and Denmark, United States and Sweden, it's not how much money higher income people pay, it's what happens to middle-income people.</p><p>Denmark, Finland, Sweden, the tax rate on middle income people is 10, 15, 20 points higher than an American middle class person.  And, you add to that the value added tax.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NORQUIST:  The difference between United States and Europe is how heavily taxed middle income people are, and they have those (INAUDIBLE) high rates that very few people pay, to make people in the middle class think that they are getting a deal.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Speaking of middle income tax -- a lot of Democrats want a carbon tax, gasoline tax and even some big American business.  That's the way to address the issue of climate change.  Do you see any path towards a carbon tax that would be acceptable to your point --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I guess, but real quick, Grover.</p><p>NORQUIST:  No.  No, absolutely not.  And the reason is, you can look at Washington State, very deep blue Washington State.  They have twice had it on the ballot and twice defeated a carbon dioxide tax, gasoline taxes lose overwhelmingly.  This is too obvious tax on middle-income people.  It's a loser up.  They are having this fight in -- our dear friends in France or loggerhead down the subject.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We know how that played out.</p><p>NORQUIST:  We had the Ontario government and the Alberta government collapsed as a result of this, and three times, in Australia.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Grover, thank you.  Yes.</p><p>NORQUIST:  Bad politics and lousy economics.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Grover, thank you for the facts, we appreciate it, Grover Norquist, joining us there.</p><p>Five officers injured in a shooting in Texas, meanwhile, Cheryl Casone in New York, with the details, there.  Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  That's right, Maria.  Four officers were shot and another officer suffered a knee injury in Houston.  They were serving a search warrant at a suspected drug house.  Police say two of them were hit in the neck.  Those officers are in critical but stable condition.  Two suspects were killed at the scene.</p><p>Well, a key E.U. negotiator, warning the risk of Britain leaving the European Union without a deal, is very high, as parliament votes on amendments in Theresa May's exit plan today.  Lawmakers set to consider more than 10 different amendments before taking votes.  That's going to be at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>And those votes come after May's plan to leave the European Union was overwhelmingly rejected earlier this month, a lot of those votes against her from her own party.</p><p>Well, Americans will be betting an estimated $6 billion on the Super Bowl, that's according to the survey by the American Gaming Association.  About 22.7 million U.S. adults plan to place a bet on the upcoming Atlanta game, of those bets, 94.47 percent, reportedly illegal, but let the games begin, Maria, and those are your headlines.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Be there to watch it all, front-row seat.</p><p>CASONE:  I'm there for you, Maria.  I've got surprises for you, coming up.  You're going to love them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK, looking forward to it.  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, crisis in Venezuela to take a look at, new sanctions have been placed on the country's oil.  Plus, National Security Advisor, John Bolton, may have inadvertently revealed the administration's next move.  Why his notes are raising eyebrows this morning.</p><p>Then, farming in America, why farmers are being forced to rent water.  That's up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A look at some of the big headlines across America this morning.  The Chicago Tribune reporting on the Pension Agency criticizing Sears Chairman Eddie Lampert's plan to acquire the bankrupt retailer.  The article explaining that the agency sets to takeover Sears.  Pensions objects to the bid, calling it the final fulfillment of a year-long's scheme to deprive Sears and its creditors of assets and its employees of jobs while lining Lampert's on owns pockets.</p><p>The Daily Camera in Colorado, reporting on how Boulder County farmers are increasingly renting water.  The report explains how ownership from agricultural interests has dropped from 85 percent in the late 1950s to just 30 percent.  The water increasingly moving to municipal control.</p><p>And the Mercury News writing that how in one California city you can text 911 for emergency help.  According to the paper, the police department there announced that the service is now available in the city.  It is meant to help people who are hearing or voice impaired.  The police are also recommending that you not send emojis.  Well, yes, I would think not.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  What are we coming to?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  My God, but it is good that you can text 911.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  That's a good step, just don't text person emoji.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, crisis in Venezuela new sanctions placed on the country's oil, plus National Security Advisor John Bolton may have inadvertently revealed the administration's next move, why his notes on his legal pad are raising eyebrows this morning?  We're breaking that down when we come right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A framework for peace.  The U.S. and Taliban negotiators making a preliminary on key issues to end the war in Afghanistan -- the longest war in American history.  The two top points American troop withdrawal and insurgence vowing to end terrorist attacks abroad, that's according to the Wall Street Journal.  Many hurdles remain to ensure the peace is in place.  Joining me right now is Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst, General Jack Keane.  General, it's always a pleasure to see you.</p><p>GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST:  Good to see you, Maria, and welcome to Washington again.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  And what do you think about this?  I mean, are we supposed to be trusting the Taliban?</p><p>KEANE:  No, we can never ever trust the Taliban, that doesn't mean that we can't have a treaty with them.  But here's what I think is going on, a couple of things have changed: one is the Taliban in the last couple of years have gone all out as we have so dramatically reduced our forces, thinking that they will going to be able to overthrow the regime, because the only thing the United States is really doing is training and assisting the ground forces -- no longer doing the fighting, however provide an air power.  That didn't work.  They retook some territory but never took capitals or provinces and they never took -- they never able to secure a province.  So, what has happened?  The war stalemated.  The Taliban cannot take over the government and the government cannot defeat Taliban, even with our assistance.</p><p>Second thing, and this is crucial, Pakistan has gotten involved in this in a way they've never have before.  They forced the Taliban to go to the peace negotiation table, why?  Pakistan knows it's no longer in national interest to keep this thing stalemated.  There's growing al-Qaeda and growing ISIS presence in Afghanistan which gives the Pakistanis some concern.  So, those are the new things that are happening.  That's why the negotiations have some momentum.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's the thing, though.  I mean, so many people were worried when the president said: we were withdrawing the troops.  And where do you stand on that now?  I mean, do you feel better about it given this peace deal?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, let me answer it this way -- I mean, it is an essential question: the Taliban themselves, we are trying to get an agreement with them that, one, they'll stop trying to overthrow the government and number two, they'll power share with them and also, they will assist in taking down the al-Qaeda and the ISIS.  I don't think we can trust them to do that, based on the fact that they provided safe haven for Osama bin Laden for almost 10 years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  So, what do we do?</p><p>KEANE:  So, we leave in place, after we bring out the troops that are providing the training and assistance.  We leave in place a counterterrorism force and an intelligence capability indefinitely.  We're doing that in Yemen, we're doing it in Libya and we're doing it in Africa.  The one in Africa is off the coast.  It's a Maritime Joint Task Force.  That is what we need to do, that is the guaranty against the Taliban because the issue in Afghanistan has always been, we would never intervene in the civil war in Afghanistan between the northern alliance and Taliban for one reason only, we didn't evade, because they attacked the United States.  That's the reason we're there.  We don't want that to happen again and we cannot trust the Taliban to provide that guarantee for us.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, let me move on and ask you about sanctions on the Venezuelan oil industry.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin who will be here shortly this morning along with Security Adviser John Bolton, explain the decision in a briefing yesterday and issued warning for disputed President Nicolas Maduro.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN BOLTON, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR:  The president has made it very clear on this -- on this matter that all options are on the table.</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY:  There's no reason why these resources shouldn't be used for the economic benefit of the people there.  There's no reason for the poverty and the starvation and the humanitarian crisis.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to this announcement yesterday?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, increased pressure on Maduro regime is certainly a welcome thing.  I mean, this really comes down to the loyalty of the military to Maduro.  As long as that loyalty is there, it's unlikely that Maduro is going the leave.  If that loyalty starts to fall apart, I hope we're working a 'plan b', which is engineering right now some kind of exit path for Maduro, where he can go into exile with recriminations in Venezuela.  The Reagan administration did this very successfully on Ferdinand Marcos, back in 1986, overwhelming popular opposition to him, hundreds of thousands of people.  We engineered his exit.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me squeeze in this question before you go general.  This image from the briefing going viral and it shows John Bolton's notepad with the notation: \"5,000 troops to Colombia.\"  Whoa, do you think we should be sending troops to the region?  What do you think about this?  Caught on camera.</p><p>KEANE:  Look, when we deposed Noriega in 1989 operation just cost Panama, 26,000 troops, is what it took.  When we deposed a dictator in Haiti, 28,000.  The ease of troops that would only be in there, move into Venezuela, if there's a problem at the embassy to our diplomat.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How significance is revealing such a secret?</p><p>KEANE:  I think he'd probably wanted to reveal it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  General Jack Keane, good to see you sir.  Thank you so much.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Show: MORNINGS WITH MARIA][Date: January 29, 2019][Time: 07:00:00][Tran: 012902cb.231][Type: SHOW][Head: Interview with Rep.

Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo coming to you live this morning from Washington, D.C.  It is Tuesday, January 29th.</p><p>Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>It is a busy day on the earnings calendar this morning.  3M among the Dow components reporting their fourth quarter.  The company cut its forecast for 2019.  Pfizer also cut this morning.  The stock under pressure this morning after the guidance came in below expectations.

Join us live as the Treasury Secretary will join the program, coming up.</p><p>Markets are under pressure this morning.  Futures pointing to a lower opening for the broader averages although right now it is more like a flat showing than lower.</p><p>The Dow Industrials are up 3 points right now.  S&amp;P 500 pretty much flat, up a quarter point.  And the Nasdaq is down 4 points.  It's been back and forth on futures this after declines across the board yesterday, of course.</p><p>Stocks finished off of the lows of the day but nonetheless, the Dow Industrials were down 209 points, almost 1 percent.  S&amp;P was down 20.  The Nasdaq was down 79, better than 1 percent lower.</p><p>Global markets this morning.  Take a look at European indices, higher across the board.  This right here, this is the high of the morning.  FT 100 up 1.5 percent, 97 points higher.  CAC 40 in Paris up 39 points, almost 1 percent.  And the DAX index in Germany up about 20 points right now.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets were little changed, pretty much across the board as you can see.</p><p>Well, the date is official now with the government back open, President Trump will give his State of the Union address one week from today.

Take a look, the social media service eyeing a major change to better compete with Instagram.  We'll tell you all about it coming up.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning.  And joining me to break it all down -- Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell in New York; the \"Wall Street Journal's\" global economics editor Jon Hilsenrath here in D.C. with me; and the American Conservative Union chairman, Matt Schlapp.  Great to see you -- guys.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Great to be here.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen -- good morning to you.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning.  We were talking about the shutdown.  So it's over for the time being.</p><p>The Democrats have actually been hurt by it as well.  Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows that positive feelings about the Democratic Party have fallen to 35 percent this month.  That's down 4 percentage points since December.  And that is essentially in line with the positive feelings that people have about Republicans.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean that's a really good point because the President really did not get hurt certainly on his base, from his base, by the shutdown.  What do you guys think?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Two things.  First is that the President's base was actually energized that he would make a spending fight.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Remember, immigration is a spending fight because if he can stop illegal immigration or reduce it, you don't have all these social services costs.</p><p>But the second thing is, the President's brand is that he will fight, he will fight harder than any politician on the field and he reiterated that brand.  So if he can increase that reputation, I think it appeals to Independents.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They said dig in.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  But isn't his brand also -- it's about fighting and continuing to fight and winning.  And he didn't win the wall in this case.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  I don't agree with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We don't know if he won the wall yet.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  There's three steps to this - -</p><p>HILSENRATH:  In this case, right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  In this case.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  -- there's three really important things.  Number one, the bill he signed has $1.3 billion in barrier funding annualized.</p><p>Number two, he's got to exhaust all legislative efforts if he's going to go the emergency route in order to have a good case in court.</p><p>And number three, the American people when it comes to immigration, he is on the right side of this policy argument.  And Democrats who are against border security, they're going to be sorry for this eventually.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  But you know what.  You better be --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, go ahead -- Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- but you better be careful about what you do and this goes to all politicians because I was flying on Friday and that was an utter nightmare.  If you want to anger everybody in the electorate, you pull another fast one like that where people are grounded and you've got an hour and-a-half plane flight where you're at 8,000 feet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But who are you blaming?</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They were blaming (INAUDIBLE) and blaming the Democrats because --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They were blaming everybody.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- Nancy Pelosi dug in.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They were blaming everybody.  But TSA agents down in Raleigh, Durham were going to food banks because they were spending what little money they had on gas trying to get to and from work.  So again, I don't care who is responsible for it.  They're all responsible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, businesses did start, you know, putting the uncertainty out there, sitting on cash, making decisions later.  We know.  I mean the SEC closed, can't get any IPOs through.  FDA closed, got to worry about obvious food shortages or food issues.</p><p>So we were beginning to see some real impact.  And Dagen saw it firsthand at the airport.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  That's true.  But if you're a federal employee in this town, let's face it, you make a little bit of a bargain.  Yes, every year you might have to go through a shutdown with your salary.</p><p>But you know, the other thing, Maria, that we don't talk about, it's almost impossible to fire a federal employee.  There's some pretty cushy gigs --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good point.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  -- in THIS town where you basically have an insurance policy against ever getting fired unless you do something just awful.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  And you can read all the GAO reports that's backed that up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're talking about all of that this morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But there are people barely making ends meet who are trying to drive to work, and spending all their money on gasoline and going to food banks who were working for the TSA and not getting paid.</p><p>And when the Republicans stop thinking about them and start talking about the workers who aren't needed, the ones who are furloughed you have really missed the boat.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, maybe.  But how about the fact that we've got a border wall in Nancy Pelosi's state?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that immoral, the wall that separates Tijuana from San Diego --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  But --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- is that immoral?  I don't think so.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They need to start asking all of these Democrats who think that the wall is immoral or don't want to fund it, ok, let's take down the walls that are there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's how you put --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will the three million people in Tijuana assimilate with the three million people in San Diego if that wall is torn down?  I think so.  And we're going to talk about that this morning.</p><p>We've got a big show this morning from D.C., live.  Coming up Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is here, live.  National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow has a thing or two to say about the CBO protections about what exactly the impact is on the economy from that shutdown.</p><p>House Minority Leader and California Congressman Kevin McCarthy will walk us through what these next three weeks look like with his colleagues in terms of this negotiating on border wall funding.</p><p>Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell is here.</p><p>Along with AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka.</p><p>Don't miss a moment of it.  A big two hours coming up.</p><p>And we kick it off this hour right now with markets.  Futures are pointing to a flat opening this morning amid all of this uncertainty over China trade, earnings.  It's an enormous week this week.</p><p>This after stocks finished to the downside yesterday on the China growth fears, the weak guidance from Nvidia and Caterpillar as well, and of course these worries about what happens with China and the U.S.  There's conversations happening tomorrow.</p><p>Joining us right now is the founder, CEO and chief investment strategist at Mainstay Capital Management David Kudla.  David -- good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>DAVID KUDLA, FOUNDER/CEO/CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, MAINSTAY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So we've been talking about what a week this is with the fourth quarter earnings coming out.  That's been pretty much driving the story.  We have a jobs report coming out at the end of the week on Friday.  Brexit discussions, the vote today.  U.S./China discussions tomorrow.  A fourth quarter GDP number.  How do you want to invest with all of this?</p><p>KUDLA:  I think investors should be looking at stocks right now that they want to own.  We've been invested through -- the past month has been very good for stock investors.  13 percent rise through Friday from the lows of December 24th.  And that's in both growth stocks and value stocks, so a broad market advance.</p><p>We're going to see some give and take here now after this nice advance of last month but investors should be picking, you know, their points here, have their list out on stocks they want to own.  We look for a good 2019 for stock investors.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is it good news, Jon Hilsenrath, that the Fed gave us a pivot that we know that the Fed is on pause right now and that we know that they're even ready to consider slowing down the unwind of the bond portfolio?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  I don't think it's good news.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I think it shows that the Fed is becoming less confident about how strong and sustainable the economy is.  I mean it is a sign that inflation isn't picking up and that's good news.  But you see some real trepidation coming out of the Fed right now with the global economy slowing, with markets being unstable and volatile.</p><p>I think the Fed is a little worried about the outlook and that shouldn't really give us a lot of encouragement.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about that, David?  I mean the economy's slowing.</p><p>KUDLA:  But Jon this -- yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLA:  But John -- the important thing here is what happened in the fourth quarter is we had mixed messages out of fed chair Jerome Powell.  We had on October 3rd we were far away from neutral.  Then by November we were close to neutral rates.  Then on the 16th in the Fed meeting they were going to do what's right no matter what.</p><p>Then he came in on January 4th and finally said we're going to be considerate of market and economic conditions and now we're seeing a more consistent and accommodative message out of the Fed.  And that's very important for the markets.</p><p>That's music to the market's ears and that's why we've now seen a sustained advance.  So the markets and investors are now looking at a Fed that seems as though they are going to be considerate of or accommodative or take into account what's happening with the markets, with the economy, and not just normalize rates for the sake of normalizing rates.</p><p>They won't have $50 billion rolling off the balance sheet on auto pilot and they won't raise rates just to raise rates to get to a normalized rate structure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that was the worry in the fourth quarter.</p><p>KUDLA:  -- in pause like in 2016 if the market and economy warrants it.  That's important.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That was they worry in the fourth quarter -- that they were on auto pilot-- Jon.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  Yes, I make two points.</p><p>KUDLA:  That drove volatility in the fourth quarter, the Fed.  .</p><p>HILSENRATH:  David makes a really important point, you know.  So this has been Jerome Powell's first year at the Fed.  He's had a bit of a honeymoon with the market.  And then what the market has discovered in the last month or two is that Mr. Powell, you know, he kind of prides himself on being a plain-spoken communicator but his communication has confused a lot of people in the market.  And he's really had to do a lot of corrections over the last few weeks --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- so that raised some questions about him.</p><p>But the other thing about -- you know, the market wants to see the Fed on an easier path.  Ok.  But the underlying message there is that this economy can't sustain very high rates.</p><p>So it doesn't send a really encouraging message about economic growth and the economic outlook when we see that the Fed is starting to recognize it just can't sustain a tighter monetary policy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But look, we're getting the news from the companies themselves with the fourth quarter numbers coming out.  Verizon just reported mixed earnings.  They beat on earnings, but they missed on revenue.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Caterpillar.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Technology reporting late today, Apple.  And we heard from Apple already.  Facebook, Amazon -- all reporting this week, Microsoft.  It's going to be a big week for technology.  And of course you mentioned Caterpillar.  That was the big kahuna yesterday that really set the tone for the markets because Caterpillar is a great indicator of economic activity across the world, in particular China.</p><p>So stay on earnings for a second, David.  Give me your take on technology.  Because you've got Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft coming out this week.</p><p>KUDLA:  Well, you know, tech stocks got beat up very bad in the fourth quarter.  They've come back in this rally and we think that tech stocks have further to go.</p><p>Look, we think that investors should stay with tech stocks.  We have an opportunity here to add value stocks to the portfolio.  Cyclicals came into 2019 at their lowest valuation relative to the S&amp;P 500 ever.</p><p>So investors now can diversify their portfolio in an opportunistic way, holding both growth stocks.  Those tech stocks that we think still have some rebound and some further runway ahead of them, and by adding value stocks that are very opportunistic.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  David -- it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>KUDLA:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Still bullish on this market.  David Kudla joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, the State of the Union is back on, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi extended officially the invitation to President Trump to do the State of the Union in the House Chamber.  He accepted the offer.</p><p>Plus we're taking a look at the enormous cost of the shutdown, what exactly is the number?  A lot of people say it wasn't very much at all.</p><p>Then, Snapchat's unthinkable change, how the photo sharing app is attempting to compete with Instagram by changing a key feature.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>New revelations in the sexual misconduct claims against the former CEO of Wynn Resorts.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with headlines now in New York -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Maria.  The \"Wall Street Journal\" is reporting that executives at Wynn Resort ignored allegations of sexual misconduct by Steve Wynn over more than a decade.  According to a regulator's report Wynn was accused of sexually assaulting or harassing salon workers, cocktail servers and flight attendants who worked for his company.</p><p>Under a proposed settlement, the Nevada Gaming Control Board won't try to revoke Wynn's regulatory licenses but Wynn is going to pay a fine.  Steve Wynn has denied any claims of misconduct.  There's a one year chart of Wynn's in front of you right there.</p><p>Well, Snapchat has named Lara Sweet as its interim CFO.  This is another shift in leadership at Snap as the company has lost several high profile employees over the last year.  Meanwhile Snap is reportedly considering allowing longer lasting or even permanent videos on Snapchat.  It will apply the Snap shared publicly on this story's features.  Snap is down 52 percent from one year ago.  There's that chart for you.</p><p>Well, Porsche is speeding past Tesla in a fast charging race.  The car maker says it new Porsche Taycan is going to be able to add more than 60 miles of charge in just four minutes.  That will be the fastest available today, exceeding Tesla's super charging stations which needs about 30 minutes to charge a vehicle's battery to at least 80 percent.  Charging times are a key selling point obviously for these car makers and now Porsche is giving Taycan owners three years of free charging.</p><p>And obviously we're going to be hearing from Tesla this week, Maria.  Earnings are coming out from Elon Musk and company.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Cheryl -- thank you so much.</p><p>Coming up next, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi challenged over her words describing a border wall as immoral.  We will break it down when we come back.</p><p>Then support on the links, fans rallying around a pro golfer whose two shot penalty was deemed unfair.  More on that.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Keeping America safe, the government is back open but the focus now is whether President Trump can make a deal with Democratic leadership on funding for the border wall.</p><p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has called it immoral, any wall is immoral.  But her home state of California protects the southern border in some places with an actual wall -- the wall separating Tijuana and San Diego.</p><p>Joining me right now is Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell.  And the last time you were on you said you wanted to look at this again.  Congresswoman -- it's good to see you.</p><p>REP. DEBBIE DINGELL (D), MICHIGAN:  It's good to see you.  Welcome to Washington.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.</p><p>What's your take on this?  I mean can Nancy Pelosi really get away with calling a wall immoral when she has a wall in her own state, separating Tijuana from San Diego?</p><p>DINGELL:  Here is what I think is going to happen.  You've got strong countries (ph), both sides of the aisle, both houses.  They're going to go into that room and they want to cut a deal that's going to keep our nation safe.  I don't think anybody wants to see what we just went through for 35 days.</p><p>It hurt the economy.  It hurt -- and I do believe -- this is going to sound corny but I don't -- you know, why do we point -- why do we need to have a Trump win, a Pelosi win.  We need an American win.</p><p>So I'm hoping they're going to go in that room.  I've talked to my colleagues on both sides.  I've talked to Roy Blunt.  I've talked to all my Democratic colleagues in the House.  They want to win.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DINGELL:  They want to go in and put together a package that's going to keep --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So how do you win?  What's the position in terms of wall funding?  Because they may very well -- your colleagues may very well come back and say ok, here's $5 billion towards border security, not a dime toward a wall.</p><p>DINGELL:  I don't know -- if people are really working together, that may not happen.  You know, there may be money, if there are appropriate places for a wall or fence or --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is there a movement within your party, do you think, among your colleagues that they feel that, yes, some money should go for an actual barrier?</p><p>DINGELL:  I think what I hear among my colleagues is let's go into a room and do something that makes sense.  Let's come up with -- we need to -- I've said this to you a million times.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DINGELL:  We need to strengthen our borders at both sides.  Everybody talks about the southern border.  I've got this northern border too which just had a huge human trafficking problem again in the last few --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But there are areas of the southern border that are very dense.  In other words like when you just look at the wall in Nancy's state and that is three million people on one side in Tijuana, three million people on the other side in San Diego.  If you tear that wall down -- I mean isn't it obvious many of the people on the Tijuana side will assimilate into the United States?</p><p>DINGELL:  Then let me ask you this question.  Build a wall, tear down a wall -- are there structures that are working that are in place?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  .</p><p>DINGELL:  So that's -- what I do think we need drones.  We need to fill the 3,000 open patrol --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's common ground, both sides believe in that.</p><p>DINGELL:  Both agree --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Technology and drones -- definitely.</p><p>DINGELL:  We need technology.  We need to make these ports safer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Specifically in a dense area, like Tijuana/San Diego, drones wouldn't work.  I mean maybe you want that in addition to a wall.  When you have such a dense area, where there's three million people on one side of the wall and three m million on the other, don't you need an actual barrier?</p><p>DINGELL:  But they are going to go in this room.  There are people that know what they're doing.  They're people -- they're senior people that have been on homeland security, people from the areas that are impacted --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think they're going to deal?  We won't shut down the government again?</p><p>DINGELL:  I pray to God, we never shut down the government.  Not only do I pray to God that doesn't come out of conference but you're going to see Republicans and Democrats working together.  We'll get --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This whole wall issue, Congresswoman, sort of underscores what's going on I think in both parties.  Now you've got former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz seeing an opening as a result of the radicalness on both sides.</p><p>He's facing backlash on his first stop for his book tour last night.  It was his first public appearance after announcing a possible Independent presidential run.  It did not go smoothly.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire (EXPLETIVE DELETED).  Go back to (INAUDIBLE) on Twitter.  Go back to Davos with the other billionaire elites who think they know how to run the world.  That's not what the country needs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  You know, I give you a lot of credit just being in politics, by the way.</p><p>Schultz is also being criticized by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, billionaire.  He tweeted this, \"In 2020 the great likelihood is that an Independent would just split the anti-Trump vote and end up reelecting the President.  That's a risk.  I refused to run in 2016 and we can't afford it right now.</p><p>Congresswoman -- do you think an Independent run is viable?  Do you think an Independent run from Schultz would hurt the Democrats?</p><p>DINGELL:  I think it's viable.  He has the money to spend it.  But I think he would hurt the Democrats.  I'm fearful that I am -- I'm trying to step back.  I'm not getting any candidate I want to see who is going to emerge, who's got people skills.</p><p>But this is dangerous.  And as you know, told you two years ago, Donald Trump could become president.  Nobody believed me.  You all thought I was crazy.  You may not have but most people did.</p><p>And I still think he could get reelected.  And if we do not run a strong campaign and we don't have somebody like that that pulls votes off --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  One of the issues is the messaging of what the platform is.  So what do you think the Democratic candidate for 2020 should have as their platform?  What's most important?</p><p>DINGELL:  You know what we didn't do and one of the reasons I believe firmly that President Trump became President Trump.  One, people are tired of partisan bickering.  They're tired of seeing things not get done in Washington.</p><p>There are a lot of people that are hurting in this country, just working men and women who want to know that we actually care about them.  They're scared about healthcare.  They're scared about escalating drug costs.  There's -- look at our --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So healthcare should be the platform?</p><p>DINGELL:  it's one piece of it.  Infrastructure, let's create jobs.  What are we going to do about education?  Trade?</p><p>Now, the President -- you want to know why he won Michigan?  Trade.  They're tired of bad trade deals that ship jobs overseas.  We don't have a level playing field.  The President's trade policy is all over the place.</p><p>It's not consistent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you going to vote for the ratification of USMCA?</p><p>DINGELL:  I don't call it USMC.  I call it NAFTA 2.0.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you going to vote for ratification.</p><p>DINGELL:  I haven't decided yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is on your plate now in the next month.</p><p>DINGELL:  Very much on my plate.  And talk to Lighthizer about it all the time.  But I'm not voting for any bill that doesn't have and acting legislation that keeps more manufacturing from going to Mexico.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wasn't that one of the key things of this new law?</p><p>DINGELL:  But Blazer still went to --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Keeping jobs here.</p><p>DINGELL:  Blazers went to Mexico in July.  I'm not seeing any more American cars go to Mexico and get built for $1.50 to $3.50 and then gets shipped back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you want a change before you vote for it?</p><p>DINGELL:  He knows how I feel.  I'm not -- one of the more likely people to vote for it but I'm not voting for it in the form that it's in right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.   We'll leave it there.</p><p>Congresswoman -- it's good to see you.</p><p>DINGELL:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.  Congresswoman Debbie Dingell joining us here.</p><p>Coming up, the longest government shutdown in American history is over.  But another shutdown threat is on the horizon.  We will talk about the next three weeks, what it looks like with House Minority Leader, Kevin McCarthy.  He's up next.</p><p>Then you've got a friend again.  The new teaser trailer for \"Toy Story 4\" drops with a big surprise.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Tuesday, January 29th.  Your top stories right now at 7:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Earnings season in full swing this morning for the fourth quarter.  Several Dow components reporting their fourth quarter this morning.  Verizon reported a mixed quarter earlier this hour.  Pfizer and 3M also under pressure this morning as you can see.  3M up three percent, although Pfizer and Verizon down better than one percent.</p><p>Rising tensions with China continuing, the U.S. bringing charges against Chinese telecom company Huawei as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning between the two nations.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will be joining me as my special guest this morning at the top of the hour, 8:00 a.m. Eastern.  Join us for that talk on China and the economy as we break it all down with the Treasury secretary.</p><p>Markets this morning are hovering around the flat line.  Take a look.  Dow Industrials up 20 points right now, 26 higher.  The S&amp;P 500 is down by almost one point and the NASDAQ down about three points.</p><p>All this after the major indices finished lower yesterday across the board at 04:00 on Wall Street.  Dow industrials were down 208 points and then actually was off of the lows of the -- of the day, down almost one percent at the close.  S&amp;P 500 gave up 21 points, that was three-quarters of one percent.  And the NASDAQ was down 79 points, better than one percent lower.</p><p>In Europe this morning, a mixed story, actually mostly higher.  FT-100 at the high of the morning right here, up 1-1/4 percent, 83 points higher, ahead of the British vote on the U.K. leaving the E.U.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is up 42 points, almost one percent higher and the DAX Index in Germany higher by 25, quarter of a percent higher there.</p><p>Asian markets mostly quiet overnight.  Take a look, as you can see, it was pretty much across the board.</p><p>$100,000 penalty, how one misstep cost a professional golfer big time.  The outcry, coming up.</p><p>And Woody and Buzz Lightyear are back, the new teaser trailer for \"Toy Story 4\" is out and it marks the return of one character after 20 years.  We will bring it to you.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning.  But first, our top story this half an hour, shutdown showdown, the government open for business again after the last -- at least for the next three weeks, rather.  But the main issue, funding the wall has not been resolved and the White House is not letting it go.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  What I do know is that if they don't come back with a deal, that means Democrats get virtually nothing.  That will make the president and force him to have to take executive action that does not give Democrats the things that they want.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is the House Minority leader, Congressman Kevin McCarthy.  Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you.</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  Thanks for having me back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So, what do the next three weeks look like?  Take us through these negotiating.  Do you expect any money for the wall?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  I expect us to solve this problem in the end.  What's interesting here is the whole time speaker Pelosi said I couldn't negotiate anything until you open up government.  The president put the public first and said OK, let's go through, I'll give you three weeks.</p><p>Now Wednesday, we'll have the conference committee, the senators and the congressional members' appropriation sit down and we'll see if they're serious about it, if they're willing to do something.  Because I believe Nancy Pelosi is out of step with her own party.  If you look at her number two, Steny Hoyer.  He said of course, that walls are not immoral, and that he believes some fencing involved.  From her Agricultural secretary to her Agricultural chair to our Armed Services chair, they both believe in a wall too.  Her Agriculture chairman said give Trump the money.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and she continues to say that it's immoral which I find incredible given the fact she has a wall in her own state.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  As my state too.  You know what I find --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And your state too, exactly.  California.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  You know what I find immoral?  When you really talk about this, this is about stopping human trafficking.  In 2016, they stopped more than 2,000 individuals involved in that.  I think it's immoral that you would allow that to continue.  I don't believe anybody in America that says they support border security believes that there is no such thing as some barrier.</p><p>And the president said, he does not a -- he does not want a wall from sea to shining sea.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  He just believes in the area you need some form of barrier and he's correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, where do you think are the most important areas that you would need the wall?  I mean, we talked earlier about this wall in your state, Tijuana, San Diego where it's very dense, three million people on one side, three million people on the other.  Can you make the case that that dense area is elsewhere where that's why the president is so stuck on having this wall there?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  And it's not the president saying, it's the experts.  The president sat down with the experts and they said this is what we need to be able to secure our border.</p><p>So in certain areas, like in San Diego, we stopped illegal movement by more than 95 percent.  You look at Yuma, Arizons, El Paso another -- El Paso became one of the safest cities in the nation after being able to put it through.  That's what we need, in certain parts of the country along the border, you need a barrier.  In other parts you could put the drones in this part area.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what are you expecting to give on?  And what -- do you think they're going to offer the $5.7 billion that the president wants for border security?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  But we're arguing over one-tenth of one percent of the budget.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a great point.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  The Democrats have voted for a wall before.  But now that the president brings forward what the experts want, they say no.  That is what's so confusing to me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, what -- why is this so important for the president right now?  Going into 2020, I mean, is she seeing this as a campaign promise and that's why he doesn't -- she won't agree to it.  Because I don't know how she can call it immoral, given the wall in her own state, your own state.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Again, it's such a little price to pay for so much more security when you look at the human trafficking.  Think of the number of lives that we will save from this process if we have a secure border.</p><p>But what's more importantly, it's the president that sat down and tried to be reasonable, find common ground.  He's the one who brought DACA into it.</p><p>And let's not forget, speaker Pelosi just a year ago holds the record for the longest speech on the floor, eight hours, over one issue, DACA, which she shut the government down over.  And now she thinks that's not important?  I think those people are important as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think that this -- a negotiation, an agreement will include a DACA deal?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  It could.  It doesn't have to.  But because the Democrats and speaker Pelosi have been saying no.  The president said he was willing to go there, three more years of DACA for a portion of the border security that the experts are asking for.  I just find her out of step with her own party.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, there seems to be a movement within the party, even some of the newer congress people coming in, fresher faces saying you know what, yes, we do need border security and we do need the money.  So, are they going head to head?  I mean, are they -- do they even have a voice?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  They don't even have a voice.  Because remember, she has so much power.  She will not allow the vote to come up.  I believe inside the conference we could come up with an agreement.  The question is, will speaker Pelosi even allow that to be voted on the floor?  If we had a vote on the floor, I believe it would pass.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think that the president will allow the government to shut down again?  I mean, is the president really prepared to have another government shutdown if he doesn't get the money?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Look, I think the president's going to try to find a way to solve this one way or another.  I don't know that shutting the government down solves it.  I there's other ways to do that the president can.  I know he firmly believes in a legislative process.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Should he call for a national emergency?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  He has the power to do that.  I think the best road forward right now is a legislative agreement.  And what's so interesting to me, I'd listened to these Democrats celebrate Nancy Pelosi.  You celebrated someone that got you status quo.  They're still a DACA problem, they're still a border security problem.</p><p>And government is designed to find common ground and compromise.  The president was the one person looking reasonable in all these discussions.  I know the president's committed to this.  He will get the border secure one way or another.  He's giving the Democrats an opportunity.  He gave them an opportunity all along this discussion.  They said then open up the government, they'll discuss it.  So he did that and gave them a three week time.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean, I think this whole thing, the government shutdown and the constant resist upsets people.  I mean, you have to wonder if in fact -- you know, she keeps resisting everything that the president wants, if the people will turn on her.  Because people want to see you guys get something done.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Yes, she is celebrating status quo.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  That's not where we need to be --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me move on and ask you about 2010, congressman.  Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz thinking about running for office.  He was at a book signing last night in New York and he was heckled over his bid.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump.  You egotistical billionaire (INAUDIBLE).  Go back to getting ratioed on Twitter.  Go back to Davos with the other billionaire elites who think they know how to run the world.  That's not what the country needs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This heckler not the only one weighing in.  Michael Bloomberg former mayor of New York City also told Schultz not to run as an independent.  He said this, given the strong pull of partisanship and the realities of the electoral college system, there's no way an independent can win.  That is truer today than ever before.  Is that where we are, an independent can't win, congressman?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  No, I think it's Bloomberg upset.  Because remember, he went from a Republican to an independent to a Democrat and he just spent $120 million giving to the Democrats so they can win the majority in the House and he doesn't want his money to be wasted, so he doesn't want competition.</p><p>Look, I think there's ample opportunity for an independent to get in this race, only because the Democrats are now become social Democrats.  They're talking about a 70 percent tax rate.  They're talking about these green deals.  They're talking about socialism.  If you listen to what some of these new Democrats say, they think Venezuela's problem is not because they're a socialist country, it's because of sanctions.  They're so out of step.  They are putting letters in to help those who want to go sign up for ISIS, to be easy on them to the judge.  I mean, I have -- this is not the America we live in, and that's the difference.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  This party is so out of step and I think you'll find a lot of moderate Democrats who say I want somebody else who could talk about this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, that's why a number of moderate Democrats can't really get the OK from the party leadership because they're not left enough.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  This new socialist Democrat Party has left the Democratic Party.  They are in to -- remember, Bernie Sanders is not registered as a Democrat.  He's registered as a socialist.  AOC does not call herself a Democrat, she calls herself a Democrat socialist.  This party is moving to a whole different place.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Real quick before you go, when the election happened back in November.  You said one of your priorities going to be to get the majority back.  How are you going to do it?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Well, first of all, you've got to make sure you can recruit.  I think, you put the ideas up there.  Ideas should win at the end of the day.  You look at where we are financially in this country.  A lot of that happens to do with the policies that we're able to create, from the tax policy, the battle we had with you human trafficking and other that we were able to do.  I think you're going to find as going directly to, we've got to find a suburban areas to be able to win again in and I think we're going to be very successful.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, it's good to see you.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Congressman Kevin McCarthy, joining us there.</p><p>Still ahead, Richard Trumka AFL-CIO president on the impact of the shutdown on American workers, what he'd like to see, back in a moment with that.</p><p>And then, support on the links, a pro golfer given a big fine and a two-shot penalty which many are calling grossly unfair.  What went wrong, right here.</p><p>Plus, you've got a friend and a big surprise, the trailer for \"Toy Story 4\" drops with a character we haven't seen in 20 years.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Prosecutors resting their case against Joaquin El Chapo Guzman.  Cheryl Casone in New York with details and headlines, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It; must something else, Maria.  The federal government has now rested its case.  They called 56 witnesses.  The trial of the notorious Mexican drug kingpin started back in mid-November.  El Chapo told the trial judge yesterday he will not take the stand in his own defense.  One witness is scheduled to appear for the defense today.  Closing arguments expected to take place tomorrow and Thursday.  Big story, a lot of New Yorkers have been following very closely.</p><p>Well, professional golfer Haotong Li is getting a huge outpouring of support from fellow golfers after losing out on nearly $100,000 Saturday for a minor infraction.  It happened at the Omega Dubai Desert Classic.  Li was on the 18th green when judges accuses caddie of standing too close behind him as he got ready to putt.  Well, the ensuing penalty dropped Li's score from 71 to 73.  And he went from third to 12th.  Tour officials say the correct call was made but acknowledge it was grossly unfair.  They're looking at the giving referees more discretion in cases like this going forward.</p><p>And then, get ready for \"Toy Story 4\".  Pixar is putting out this teaser video, shows the revival of Woody's love interest, Bo Peep.  And she is back with a new, more modern look.  She was last seen in \"Toy Story 2\", back in 1999.  It is now 20 years later, \"Toy Story 4\" is going to be released, Maria, this June .  Those are your headlines from New York, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like it.  Bo Peep.

AFL-CIO Richard Trumka will join us to talk about the impact on American workers.  He's up next.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We are focused on the American worker this morning.  White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney saying that the 800,000 federal workers who were not paid twice during the partial government shutdown should receive those checks by the end of this week.</p><p>Joining us right now is American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organization's president, AFL-CIO, Richard Trumka.  It's great to see you, Richard.  Thank you so much for being here.</p><p>RICHARD TRUMKA, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR AND CONGRESS OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION:  Maria, thanks for having me on today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Give us your take on what the impact of the shutdown was.</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, I think there's several impacts.  There's impact on the people and you not only have government workers who get back pay but you have the government contractors who won't get back pay unless something is done.  That was a devastating effect on them.  It had a devastating effect on the economy itself.  $11 billion, although we'll pick some of that back up later in the year.</p><p>But you had a devastating effect on the airline industry where you had people, airline controllers, traffic controllers that were in school that actually just up and left.  They said we're not going to do this anymore (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What could -- what could have been done about it then, Rich?  Because you as the leader that you are and representing so many workers across the country have to be unnerved when you see open borders and illegals coming in and taking your jobs.</p><p>TRUMKA:  Look, that's just not how it works anymore.  I mean, you have people that got laid off from the president's place that have been here 20 years.  They're not taking anybody's job.  What we want to do is make sure every worker in this country has the same rights so that they can't be exploited.</p><p>Because what happens right now with undocumented workers is, they're great when no one's around.  When they try to organize and get a voice, then they start squeezing them.  They start ex -- you know, doing, calling in ICE and different things.</p><p>The idea is if everybody has the same rights, then they can't exploit those people and everybody can actually have a fair playing field.  What happens to American workers -- employers right now, is you have an employer that hires people, makes them work in unfair condition, misclassifies them, underpays them, and they're competing against our employer.  That employer needs to pay everybody the same rate, live by the same working conditions, so that we can all compete.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you're OK with illegals coming in and as long as everybody's treated the same?</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, Maria, it's a -- it's a nice cliche, illegals coming in.  But you know yourself that most people that are here undocumented or illegally came in legally.  So the whole system needs to be addressed.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, but there are apprehensions that we could look at, just in the month of December, just in the month of November, where apprehensions were of illegal immigrants coming in and wanting asylum in the United States.</p><p>TRUMKA:  There's no question that the system is broken.  We need to fix the system and have a path towards citizenship so that those workers that have been here for years and are actually making the economy run, even the president's golf courses and things like that, they have a chance to get citizenship and they work their work there.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Just a question on the golf courses.  As you know, that's the H2B program, people who come here as foreign workers, come under a specified amount of time for DOL.  I think the real question is is that, what happens to all the people, not who have been here who came legally and overstayed the visa, but what about all the people who come every day at the southern border and can cross into our country?  That's really the pernicious problem.  And even on wall, built with American workers, you'd be for that.</p><p>TRUMKA:  But listen, the people that come back and forth, you have Americans that go to Mexico and Mexicans that come to America to work.  I think Mexico --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you don't think there's a problem at the border at all?</p><p>TRUMKA:  I didn't say that.  There is -- there is a problem.  We do need border security.  And no, I don't think that a wall's the answer to it.  Every time someone's tried to build a wall it's not been very successful.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, the one in Tijuana is successful.</p><p>TRUMKA:  Ask the Chinese, ask the French.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The wall -- the wall in Tijuana --</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Ask Tijuana (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tijuana and San Diego, what abut that Richard?</p><p>TRUMKA:  I'm sorry?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The wall, between Tijuana -- separating Tijuana from San Diego, is that successful?</p><p>TRUMKA:  There are places -- there are places probably where it works.  Is that the answer to everything?  No.  Should that have been the reason for a shutdown?  Absolutely not.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  I want -- I want to ask a broader political question.  We've seen in the last two elections that increasingly voters, blue collar voters, voters in manufacturing towns all over America, the kind of rank and file people that you represent are voting for Republicans, they're going for Trump.  Does the AFL-CIO need to realign its own approach to politics in this town, given that more and more of its people are going with people like Donald Trump and his trade policies and the Republican Party?</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, that's a -- that's a question we could talk about two or three hours for.  First of all, we have realigned our politics.  We are issuing -- we're issue oriented right now.  We put an issue out and if a politician supports that issue, then we support them.</p><p>In fact, in this last election we elected two union members to the Senate, three to governorship, 18 to the House of Representative, and 925 to state legislatures, because those workers will go and support our issues.  That's what we try to do.  We find it more and more difficult to find Republicans that actually support us.  Now, the American worker believes that neither the political system --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got to jump.</p><p>TRUMKA:  -- or the economic system works for them.  They want somebody to change the rules.  That's why they voted for Trump.  If he changes the rules to their advantage, some of them will vote for him again.  If he doesn't, he stands a chance of losing those workers and right now he's losing those workers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Richard, thank you so much for joining us.  We appreciate it.  Richard Trumka there.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Show: MORNINGS WITH MARIA][Date: January 29, 2019][Time: 08:00:00][Tran: 012903cb.231][Type: SHOW][Head: Apple Disables Group FaceTime Function That Was Allowing Callers To Listen And View Without Your Consent; British Parliament To Vote On Brexit Amendments; Kudlow on the Economy; Craft Brewers Impacts from the Government Shutdown; Kudlow on China Trade][Sect: News; Domestic][Byline: Maria Bartiromo, Gerri Willis, Ashley Webster, Hillary Vaughn, Dagen McDowell][Guest: Steven Mnuchin, Larry Kudlow, Matt Schlapp, Jon Hilsenrath][Spec: FaceTime; Huawei; Apple; Brexit; Federal Reserve; 3M; Harley-Davidson; Verizon; Oath Media; Channel Inventory; World War II; CBO; Trade Talks; Deregulations; Tax Plan; China Trade; Slowdown; Government Shutdown]</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good Tuesday morning.  Welcome back, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  Live from Washington this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is January 29th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  Earnings in focus.  Investors watching results from several Dow components this morning ahead of the opening bell.  One to watch after the bell tonight -- after the close is Apple.</p><p>Meanwhile, Apple under fire FaceTime hit with a new bug that allows people to eavesdrop on you without your knowledge and even if you don't take the call.  Rising tensions with China, the U.S. brings charges against Chinese telecom company, Huawei as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  The very latest on the state of negotiations with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin coming up.</p><p>Markets are searching for direction this morning.  Take a look at the futures ahead of the open this morning.  Dow industrials picking up speed up 55 points right now, a quarter of a percent higher.  S&amp;P 500 is up two and the NASDAQ right now right now showing a gain of 11 points at the open in about an hour and a half.  This after declines across the board yesterday.  Stocks finished off of the lows, but nonetheless the Dow Industrials gave up 209 points yesterday 4:00, almost one percent lower.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 gave up 21 points, three quarters of a percent lower.  And the NASDAQ was down 79 points.  That was better than one percent lower yesterday.  Global markets this morning are mostly higher.  Take a look at European indices with the FT-100-is at the high of the morning, up 86 points, 1-1/4 percent ahead of the vote on Brexit.  CAC quarante in Paris us up 44 points and the DAX index up 21, fractional gain there.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets were little changed.  Take a look, it was pretty much across the board.  Now, our top story this morning, concerns of a global slowdown.  Last week in Davos I spoke with Bridgewater Associates founder, Ray Dalio, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, and Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey.  Here's what they said about the possibility of an economic slowdown on the horizon.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RAY DALIO, FOUNDER, BRIDGEWATER ASSOCIATES:  Europe has a negative growth and the United States is going to have a negative growth environment.  I don't mean absolute negative, I mean slowing of growth in a material way that could be close to between zero and two percent over the next 18 months.</p><p>BRIAN MOYNIHAN, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, BANK OF AMERICA:  We have the top research firm in the world, and they have done a great job.  And they have the U.S. growing at 2-1/2 percent this year.  The world growing 3-1/2 percent GDP growth.  But that's down from last year.  And so the confusion in the environment right now is a slowdown or is it going in to a recession?</p><p>Nothing we see says it's close to a recession.</p><p>JAMES QUINCEY, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, COCA-COLA:  I think we are in danger of talking ourselves into a problem.  It's just a little bit slower growth.  It's not a recession or a decline.  So we see -- we see a little -- a little softer 2019, maybe a little less tail wind than 2018.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now in a Fox Business exclusive is the treasury secretary of the United States, Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  Great to see you, Secretary.</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, UNITED STATES TREASURY SECRETARY:  Great to see you as well, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.  Your reaction to really what seems like now a unanimous feeling that a slowdown is on the horizon.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, Maria, from everything we see, the U.S. economy is still quite strong.  The companies are doing quite well.  And we see still tremendous investment in capital and human investments.  There's no question that as it relates to Europe and China, there is a slowdown.  We're monitoring that carefully.  But we still see a tremendous opportunity and a lot of capital coming into the U.S.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Federal Reserve basically told us they are on pause.  They may even pause the balance sheet unwind which is also telling us that the Fed is also expecting a slowdown, but do you believe a recession is on the horizon in 2020 even though you're seeing strength and stability so far?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  We see no indications whatsoever of a recession on the horizon.  And from everything we see from speaking to a large across the board businesses, the combination of tax reform, regulatory relief and trade is still has a very strong impact on the U.S. economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And some people are saying that the impact of certainly of trade and tariffs is causing some uncertainty.  So how much of this slowdown that we're expecting later on even if it's not right now is due to what you say you're watching China and Europe and how much of it is uncertainty around the President's tariffs program?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, Maria, as you said, there are people who expect a slowdown but I would just comment a year ago with the projections were 2-1/2 percent.  And we were at three.  We feel very comfortable we're going to hit three for last year.  And we think there's still a very good case for three percent this year.  Now, as it relates to trade, we couldn't be more pleased with the USMCA.  We are looking forward to Congress passing that quickly.</p><p>That's a very important trade deal.  We have two days of talks with China starting tomorrow.  The President is going to be involved in those talks at the conclusion.  We've been updating him.  We have another 30 days after this.  So I think we're making significant progress, and I think on the trade front, these are all very positive impacts for the U.S. economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about the trade talks because this story of China, first off, thank you to the President and to the administration for pushing back on China because that's another unanimous feeling out there, that the President did the right thing in terms of stopping China from some of its practices.  What are you expecting out of these talks?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, the President wants fair trade with China.  It's got to be reciprocal.  Right now China has free access into our markets, and we have limited access to there.  So the critical issue that we've talked about is market access, making sure there aren't forced joint ventures, not forced transfer of technology and that we have a mechanism that when we reach an agreement that we can monitor that agreement and that they'll live up to it.</p><p>And that's how I expect we will make significant progress this week on those issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How much of a priority is espionage?  Obviously the administration unveiling a sweeping set of criminal charges against Huawei Technologies.  We have had on a number of CEOs that have said yes, they have stolen trade secrets from us.  Has this come into the conversation with your Chinese leadership?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  No, let me be clear.  Those are separate issues.  And that's a separate dialogue.  So as it relates to the Huawei issues that's being run by the Justice Department.  I have no involvement in that.  I found out about that yesterday when it was announced.  So those are not part of trade discussions.  Forced technology issues are part of trade discussions but any issues as it relates to violation of U.S. law or U.S. sanctions are going through a separate track, which is the Justice Department.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, I guess the broader issue is, is this a cultural thing in China?  I mean this weekend on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" over on Fox News I spoke with the ranking member of the Intel Committee, House Intel Committee Devin Nunes and he went through some of the practices that China does every day.  Listen to this.  I've got to get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  China might have accessed allied intelligence shared with Poland and passed it on to Moscow.</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R), CALIFORNIA:  What the Chinese are doing is that they have these companies that are essentially owned by the party, the Communist Party and essentially this is a dictatorship.  There's very few people that own these companies.  They weaponize the.  So when all over the -- all over the world you have Chinese technology specifically as it relates to infrastructure on -- communications infrastructure, they will go in and they beat every other company around the world.</p><p>And in fact, they've driven a lot of companies out of business because they come in undercut.  They want to have control over all the com systems or communication systems all over the globe.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's pretty incredible.  We will handle your infrastructure of telecom and then they have a way in of spying.  How can you separate that from the conversation on trade and on forced transfer of technology?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Maria, I think you can easily separate these issues.  So there are two different issues.  One is an issue of state subsidies where they do subsidize state enterprises and they compete unfairly.  Those are trade issues, those are violations of the WTO and that's something from an economic standpoint.  We are going to enforce very seriously.  I think you know among the National Security Council, so I'm going to be careful what I say on national security issues.</p><p>But I assure you whether it's China or anywhere else in the world, our security services, DHS and others will make sure that we protect the U.S. infrastructure, we protect from cyberattacks.  That's something we're very well aware of.  But these are separate issues and shouldn't be confused.  We are focused on what are unfair economic practices.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So the best case that you can get from China is what?  Opening up their markets?  Already we are seeing some likelihood of that, UBS I guess was the first bank that was allowed to operate in China and own 51 percent of that bank.  They say they're going to go to 100 percent in three years.  Are you seeing a significant opening in terms of the Chinese willingness to open their markets to foreigners?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I do, but I think that's a good start.  But why should we have to wait three years for a U.S. company to own 100 percent in the financial services?  China can operate and own 100 percent of companies here.  So that's an example where, you know, they're moving in the right direction.  We want to speed that up.  But the issue is really we want to make sure that U.S. companies can compete fairly in China.</p><p>And if we can do that, China has a very large growing middle class.  It's an enormous market.  As I have said before, this is one of the biggest opportunities for U.S. companies in U.S. business if we can get this right.  And President Trump is determined.  This is the first administration that has aggressively said to China, you need to play fair.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is the President willing to drop all tariffs, should he get a good deal that's acceptable?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I think everything is on the table.  So the President is -- will look at, again, the objective is to have a very fair deal.  Hopefully we'll make progress this week.  The President will be involved in these negotiations and discussions.  And we've still got a lot of work to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the President said look, I'm a tariff guy.  I like tariffs.  So does that mean these tariffs are for, you know, no end in sight or would he be willing to drop the tariffs all together?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  The President hasn't made any decisions on that.  There have been no recommendations from the economic team on that yet.  The first step is to make sure we get a good agreement.  And when we get a good agreement, we'll make a recommendation to the President and he will consider that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have seen the Chinese economy get impacted.  You're still talking about 6.4 percent growth, we think, but that is lower than some people think.  What's your worry or how concerning is it that the Chinese slowdown will impact the United States?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, there's no question that China is slowing down.  They still have significant growth rates.  We're beginning to see the impact on that on world growth.  Our objective is not to slow down China.  Our objective is to make sure that U.S. companies can do business in China and can do business fairly.  So we're monitoring these issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary, stay with us.  We want to get into the shutdown and get your impact on how much the shutdown cost the economy and what you're expecting there.  Stay with us.  More of my exclusive interview with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin when we come right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are life live this morning in Washington, D.C.  And I'm sitting right now with -- in a Fox Business exclusive with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  And Treasury Mnuchin, we were talking about the broad economy.  I want to ask your thoughts on the shutdown.  The CBO says that the shutdown caused $11 billion impact to the economy, $3 billion which is completely lost because of the 35-day shutdown.  Your reaction?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Maria, Kevin Hassett, the CEA is working on final numbers for us.  I think his view is that there's no question that there was some cost but those costs will be recovered as money comes back into the system.  I think it's -- he views that it will almost all be recovered.  Now as it relates to the exact numbers, I haven't seen the final numbers yet.  But the good news is we got the government open.</p><p>People are back to work and we have not seen any significant impact on the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Has -- is the President prepared to shut down the government again in three weeks if he doesn't get the money for the border wall?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Maria, I had dinner last night with the President, the Vice President, Senator Lindsey Graham.  We had a very good discussion on this issue.  There's no question in my mind that the President, the Vice President want to do a fair deal.  Lindsey has been terrific in helping to negotiate this.  I hope the Democrats are sincere.  If they are, there's a sincere deal that will include a lot of different issues that need to be resolved.</p><p>But if they're not sincere, the President has all his options on the table.  And he's determined that he's going to make sure we have border security.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's the impact on the IRS?  There's a lot of worry out there that people are not going to get their checks after April 15th as a result of this shutdown.  What can we expect?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, let me just comment on both the treasury, our bureaus, the IRS in particular, I want to thank the enormous number of government employees who came in and worked during the shutdown.  I think as you know, we had the ability to bring in critical employees.  We never would have been able to do the sanctions that we've been doing over the last month without the hardworking people.</p><p>And the IRS had a large number of critical employees to make sure that we were ready to open for business as usual.  So we're ready to open for tax season.  We're taking tax returns.  We'll be ready for tax refunds.  We will have the phones restaffed.  Now, let me just say that there's no question, this time of the year, there's very, very heavy call volume.  That's something we have to manage.  I encourage taxpayers who have questions to try to go to the web first.</p><p>But we are ready for tax season, and I can assure you that tax refunds will be paid as normal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  So, tax refunds will be paid as normal.  That's the bottom line.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  People were worried about that.  Let me move to the sanctions and in particular Venezuela because you've applied sanctions on the Venezuelan oil industry.  Tell us specifically what the impact here is.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, sanctions are a very important tool in our national security portfolio.  And when we look at national security issues, we look at economic tools.  We look at diplomacy.  We look at national security tools, military options.  So there's no question that what we're trying to do is to cut off the money to the regime that should not be in power and make sure that the President Guaido has access to funds and has access to the assets of the country.</p><p>And to make sure we protect these assets for the people of Venezuela.  It's really quite sad.  This is a country that is very, very rich in oil resources that has had extraordinary poverty and extraordinary humanitarian issues over the last issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And have you spoken with the opposition leader party about this?  What has been the response so far?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I haven't personally, but I know the Vice President has been in communication.  I think the response has been very positive.  We've been very careful in balancing this.  We've -- I've spoken to many of the refineries over the last week.  I want to make sure that there was significant capacity.  There's a lot of oil on the water already in transit to the U.S. refineries.  So I think on the one hand, we've been able to cut off Venezuelan oil going forward.</p><p>But we're managing this with the U.S. refineries.  We've issued licenses for the U.S. refineries to continue to operate.  And if Venezuela wants to continue to sell us oil, which we would like to buy that money would go into blocked accounts and will be protected for the people of Venezuela.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what about other industries in Venezuela?  I mean, the sanctions are on the oil industry.  What about other money, other imports that they still get that?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  We will always look at additional sanctions.  We want to make sure that things like medicine and other humanitarian issues continue to go to the people.  We will always look at additional sanctions to make sure we protect the assets of the country for the people of Venezuela.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why was it important for the President to back the opposition leader?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I think he is the rightful leader of the country, the national assembly, the constitution.  I think, you know, democracy is very important to the people of the United States.  And we want to make sure that there are free and fair elections and that there is a proper democracy that's very important to the national security of the United States.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary, it's good to have you on the program.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you very much.  Secretary Steven Mnuchin joining us.  Coming up, earnings in focus.  Major companies reporting this week including Apple after the bell tonight.  What you need to know ahead of those numbers.  Then the U.K. facing a crucial test.  British lawmakers voting later today on measures surrounding the U.K.'s potential exit from the European Union.  Back in a moment with that.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Earnings driving markets this morning.  3M, Harley-Davidson, Verizon out with mixed reports this morning.  Gerri Willis is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange watching markets.  Gerri?</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  That's right.  3M, Dow component, a split decision here missing on estimates beating on revenue.  The EPS line $2.27 a share.  Revenue 7.95 billion.  They lowered their 2019 guidance.  But they say they're positioned for success in 2019 despite the global slowdown.  Stock trading higher.  Harley-Davidson, let's get to that, a big miss on both the top and the bottom line.</p><p>EPS of 17 cents a share.  Revenue of 955 million.  The stock is down and down hard this morning nearly 10 percent.  They're citing restructuring charges, incremental tariffs and recall costs.  Big troubles for the hog.  Verizon beating on EPs but missing on revenue.  We're seeing yet another split decision here.  EPS of a $1.12 a share.  Revenue of 34.3 billion.  The stock trading down nearly four percent here.</p><p>Profit hurt by the restructuring of Oath Media business as we have discussed.  Apple coming after the bell, this is critical earnings release for the markets here.  EPS estimate of $4.17 a share.  Revenue of 84 billion.  We will be focused like a laser on iPhone.  iPhone sales in China, is there an iPhone recession going on in China right now?  Watch Channel Inventory for some of the details about that.</p><p>Meanwhile, Apple having trouble with FaceTime.  A bug where callers can eavesdrop on FaceTime calls has cropped up.  The company says they are checking it.  But you should know that Tim Cook on Monday, well, he was saying big things about International Data Privacy Day asking users to insist on reforms.  Oops, I guess they got a problem.  Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Gerri.  Thanks very much.  Gerri Willis on Wall Street.  British lawmakers will debate several amendments to the U.K.'s planned exit from the European Union today and let Prime Minister Theresa May know what parliament is prepared to vote for.  Ashley Webster is live in London right now with that.  Ashley?</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.  Good morning, Maria.  This is if Parliament knows exactly what it will vote for.  There will be at least 15 amendments to choose from -- will be debated.  That will be up to the Common Speaker John Bercow.  He will decide which ones will be debated.  And it could indeed shape the future of what Brexit will look like moving forward.</p><p>Now, among the most popular amendments that we are expecting to be the debated will be what's called the Cooper amendment, that's Yvette Cooper, the Labour M.P.  It basically says if no deal is reached by February the 26th, it would postpone Brexit for nine months essentially to end of the year from march 29th, that's the date that exists now.  Then there's the Brady amendment, the Graham Brady (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>He basically is putting forward an amendment that would replace the Irish backstop with what is called alternative arrangements, such pretty vague, basically anything elsewhere and what we have now and there is no time limit on that backstop.  We have heard that Prime Minister Theresa May has already told European leaders that she wants to reopen Brexit negotiations.  Let's not forget, just last month, in December, the Prime Minister said it wasn't going to be reopened that the E.U had given her their best deal.</p><p>Now she wants to turn around and say look, you need to reopen negotiations.  I'm going to find out from Parliament what they are prepared to vote for and let's go from there.  And it calls today is January 29th.  The Brexit deadline, March 29th.  We have exactly two months left to go, Maria.  And let's be honest, there is no sign yet of a -- of a deal in place that a majority of people in Parliament can get behind.</p><p>Yesterday we had a whole series of warnings about what would happen if there was a no deal scenario.  Just crashing out retail consortiums saying, look, there's going to be empty shelves, prices are going to go up, a break in the supply chain.  It will be very, very detrimental to the British economy.  So that is the background.  Later on today, we'll find out what Parliament can get behind.  Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Ashley.  Thanks so much.  We'll check back with you.  Ashley Webster in London this morning.  Coming up.  The shutdown impact on your wallet.  I will be speaking with National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow on the economic effects of the shutdown.  Plus Federal debt reportedly headed to the highest level since World War II.</p><p>That is next.  One brewery feeling the impact.  The shutdown hitting one San Diego beer company.  We've got that story.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thank so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo coming to you live this morning from Washington, D.C.  It is Tuesday, January 29th.  Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Earnings season in full swing.  We have heard from Harley-Davidson, hit in the pre-markets after disappointing numbers.  Xerox as well headed higher after beating expectations.  Look at Harley-Davidson's shares down almost 10 percent right now.  China, one of the issues, once again.  Meanwhile rising tensions with China on the U.S. level.  The U.S. bringing charges against Chinese telecom company, Huawei, as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  Moments ago, I spoke with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin who talked about what the U.S. is looking for in the coming talks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MNUCHIN:  The President wants fair trade with China.  It's got to be reciprocal.  Right now, China has free access into our markets and we have limited access to there.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Futures this morning are higher.  Take a look, we have the highs of the morning right here with the Dow Jones Industrial average up 73 points, a third of a percent.  The S&amp;P 500 up 4-1/2, and the NASDAQ higher by 18 points, one-quarter of one percent.  European indices this morning are also higher.  Take a look.  FT-100 in London is up almost 100 points, 1-1/2 percent.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is up 55, better than one percent.  And the DAX Index in Germany up 37 points, that's one-third of one percent.  Asian markets mostly flat overnight as you'll see that was pretty much across the board with Japan and Korea squeaking out a fractional gain.</p><p>Our top story this half an hour, the cost of the government shutdown.  The CBO says about $3 billion out of 2019's projected GDP was completely lost due to the shutdown.  Joining me right now in a FOX Business exclusive is National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow.  Larry, it's great to see you this morning.</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for being here.  So obviously 35 days, government shutdown, CBO says $3 billion is lost.  Never coming back.  Your reaction.</p><p>KUDLOW:  With respect, once again, we disagree with the CBO.  I don't think we're going to lose anything.  This is completely temporary.  None of the incentives in the economy have been changed by this.  You know, that's the key point.  President Trump lowered marginal tax rates on individuals and most especially businesses.  And then he had this massive sweeping rollback of costly and burden regulations, which freed up the whole economy, including the energy sector, which has turned out to be a boom.  Why would we lose something just because of a temporary issue regarding the government?  Now, I'm always interested in sort of counting angels on the head of a pin.  We have about a $20 trillion economy, fair?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  There -- what was their number, three billion out of 20 trillion?  Do you know what the --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Three billion.  Yes, no, you're right.  You're right.</p><p>KUDLOW:  - percentage that is?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I totally understand.</p><p>KUDLOW:  I don't understand why we even mess with it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Actually, they're saying the total impact was $8-11 billion.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But that will come back, except for the $3 billion they say that is completely lost.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, again, with all due respect to the professionals at the CBO, I disagree.  Again, because the incentives in the economy -- here's the big difference between I guess the administration and the Congressional Budget Office and a lot of other forecasters.  We believe the economy is growing at three percent plus.  By the way, the Commerce Department for 2018 has scored I believe 3.1 percent.  We'll get the rest of those numbers in a week or two.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KUDLOW:  The CBO does not.  They never have.  They've never given us credit for the incentive effect of lowering taxes and regulations.  Supply side incentives are kicking in.  If you look at the whole panoply all of the economic data, whether it's very strong Christmas retail sales, whether it's industrial production, manufacturing, the best since the '80s, whether it's business equipment, which means the capex boom is happening that we always hoped for.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KUDLOW:  You'll see in my judgment, at least, the three percent trend line will continue.  CBO and many others have us at two.  But this goes back before the President.  This goes back way before.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  They don't believe the economy can grow.  They don't give any credit --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, even somebody like a Steve Schwarzman will say 4.2 percent growth in the second quarter is very hard to sustain on a $20 trillion economy.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, I'll keep working on Steve Schwarzman.  He's a good guy.  But in a $20 trillion economy, which again will grow rapidly, I see no reason why we can't continue three percent plus.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That's the whole point.  The idea that was sold to everybody I guess going back several years, maybe going back 10 or 15 years, that we're in some secular stagnation is just plain wrong.  With the right set of policies, to unleash --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- American animal spirit --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we saw that with the tax plan and the deregulation.  I totally get that.</p><p>KUDLOW:  And you look at the --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But what about tariffs and trade, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  The -- just one --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because the CBO'S report also brings that up.</p><p>KUDLOW:  One last one on this, the face of the new Trump economy -- I just want to put this in here, it's the thought I've had for quite a while.  These are men and women running small businesses.  These are blue-collar workers.  You look at the evidence, the employment for blue-collar workers, the best increase since the mid to late '80s, when I was a Reagan Cub Scout here in Washington, D.C.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  The wage rates of blue-collar manufacturing autos, they're rising faster than white-collar workers.  This is a direct result --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- of the incentives we've put into the economy.  CBO, again, it's not personal to my friends at the CBO, they don't give us any credit for these incentives.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No, I understand that.  But the --</p><p>KUDLOW:  And I want to stay with that story.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- the report on the trade policies estimated that new tariffs on imports and exports will cut an average of one-tenth of a percent from economic growth through 2029.  What's your take on that, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because we know that these tariffs are in place.  They still are impacting business and uncertainties.  So, is the President prepared to do away with all tariffs if he gets that agreement from the other side?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, I don't want to go there.  I mean, that's going to be his decision as you know.  Vice Premier Liu He is coming and we will have high level discussions Wednesday and Thursday and we're all looking forward to that, as is the President.  The President, as I read him, moderately optimistic about this trade story.  So, that's good.  What was it, one-tenth of one percent by 2029?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  So then here we are in 2019, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, no.  One-tenth of a percent from economic growth through 2029.</p><p>KUDLOW:  See, this is too hard, Maria.  It's way too hard --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- to figure that stuff out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you don't think there's going to be any -- there's --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Could it be possible that there's no impact from the shutdown?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Yes, quite possible.  I never -- it's utterly totally temporary.  So, that's -- let me --- look, let me go back -- the growth potential from China trade, people tend to look at this as a negative.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Look, I don't know the outcome of these talks.  Here's what I know, the scope of the discussion will be the broadest and deepest in the history of U.S.-China trade.  Literally everything's on the table.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Point number one.  Point number two, if China opens its markets --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is a big deal.</p><p>KUDLOW:  OK?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it looks like there's (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>KUDLOW:  Which is huge.  You know, I don't want to predict, and as Ambassador Lighthizer said a million times, and I agree, the enforcement mechanisms are going to be crucial.  But if they were to open their markets as we have requested regarding tariffs and non-tariffs, if they would let American companies own the subsidiary in China, so there's no forced transfer of the family jewels of technology, if we have --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But it --</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- some rule of law regarding I.P. theft, here's my point, open markets will allow the United States to export like crazy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But I understand that, Larry.</p><p>KUDLOW:  And that has been hand -- we've been handcuffed.  If we do that, if we do that, not only will the United States grow faster --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- because of that, China will grow faster.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That all sounds great, but can you actually do that, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Competition is the solution.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's the point, because if you're saying, \"OK, China, we are agreeing that you are opening your markets, and as a result, we will meet your demands, but then they say okay, but you have to have a communist, a government leader on the board of any company that has 100 percent.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Which is -- which is extraordinary, you're absolutely right.  It's extraordinary.  And it's --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So I mean -- so you could say it's great --</p><p>KUDLOW:  And unacceptable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- that you're going to open markets.</p><p>KUDLOW:  It's unacceptable.  It's unacceptable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But they -- aren't they saying that a communist has to be on the board of any company that has 100 percent?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I think that's been the past and I think that's going to be a very hot topic in these trade talks because that is completely unacceptable to us.  No question about it.  We will see how this turns out.  China, unfortunately, you know, they're in a slump.  China's economy is slumping very bad.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  I think part of that slump is a function of the President's tough negotiating with tariffs, when necessary, OK, part of that slump is in the last five to ten years.  China has moved in the wrong direction, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  The market-based reforms have been moving in their own direction.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But they're not market-based.  They are communists and they want communists on the board of -- So I'm just wondering, all of this sounds great, if you can actually get it done.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Oh, I know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Larry, stay with us.  We want to talk to you about other things because the tax plan and the deregulations have worked.  But there are some other ideas coming into play ahead of 2020.</p><p>KUDLOW:  China should not use the Venezuelan form of the economic policy.  We need to go back to who is it that said free market capitalism is the best path to prosperity?  It was the (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, that would -- that would be you and Ronald Reagan.  Stay with us.  We will be right back.  More with Larry Kudlow.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Thank you.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We come to you live this morning from Washington, D.C. and I am sitting with National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow, in an exclusive interview this morning.  And we were talking about China and what you can get done.  How important is tomorrow and Thursday in terms of meeting a deadline, that March 1st, in terms of a deal on the table?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I think's very important.  Look, I --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think you'll get a deal by March 1?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I don't want to predict.  It's just too hard to predict.  And, of course, these are decisions that will be made by the President, who is his own best negotiator.  Best I can is, as I said, the scope of this thing's going to as wide and broad as anything we have ever seen.  That does not ensure positive negotiator.  Best I can is, as I said, the scope of this thing is going to be as wide and broad as anything we've ever seen.  That does not ensure positive outcomes --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- right?  I think everybody, including the President, is basically moderately optimistic about this, OK?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Wait, let me ask you, your tax plan --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Ultimately -- one other thought which the President believes that he and President Xi will probably be the ultimate negotiators.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  OK?  And the work being done tomorrow and Thursday is vitally important to lay out options, OK?  But --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So the President will be involved in these talks tomorrow and Thursday?</p><p>KUDLOW:  That is what he has been saying in our meetings.  And I hope so because he's a great negotiator.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me move on to the tax plan.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because we're hearing a lot of ideas in terms of taxes now, now with a lot of 2020 hopefuls.  The Tax and Jobs Act obviously did move the needle on economic growth along with the deregulation out of this administration.  Now you've got Elizabeth Warren talking about two to three percent tax on the very high wealth people.  So if you have $50 million in wealth, you'll get two percent tax.  If you've got a billion dollars in assets, you'll get taxed three percent.  And you've got Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez talking about tax of 70 percent tax --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- on the highest earners.  What is your take on this?  Give us your reaction and what kind of an impact those policies might have.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Right.  These are prosperity killers, these are growth killers, these are job killers, these are incentive killers.  This is a return to some heavy government planning essentially direct to the economy.  You know, I hate to dwell on this because it's a crisis right now, but take a look at Venezuela, just for the heck of it.  What (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There was a time when that was vibrant -- it was a vibrate country.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That is correct.  That is correct.  And investment was flocking to it.  Then they took, down through the years, really exact measures you're describing that are coming from some of these Democratic candidates --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- and the economy was destroyed.  I mean I hear this notion we have to have equality, equality of income, equality of results, which I think runs counter to all human nature.  You know what?  A place like Venezuela has equality.  Everybody's poor.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think they'll be able to reverse the tax cuts then?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Everybody's poor in Venezuela, except for a hand -- Maduro and a handful of this top military people.  Is that what we want in America?  We are growing right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So will the Dems be able to reverse your tax cut plans?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Never.  Never, not until the President's configuration.  I -- look, first of all, if they want to try to raise taxes, it will be defeated in the Senate, Republican.  I personally believe even if it went beyond that --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- the President would veto any efforts to turn back his program.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How important --</p><p>KUDLOW:  We're doing what people said we couldn't do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But how important is debt?</p><p>KUDLOW:  They said we couldn't grow at three, four percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But how important is debt, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  We're growing at three, four percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Let's not mess with it.  If it ain't broke, don't fix it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Congressional Budget --</p><p>KUDLOW:  There's a tremendous surge in prosperity here shared by the middle and lower middle income people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Congressional Budget Office is saying that the deficit is hit -- set to hit $897 billion this year.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That would be the highest level since World War II.  When does debt become a priority?  Do you think the President, let's say he does have another term, will try to attack the entitlements?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, look, I think right now the two issues are maintaining economic growth.  You know, growth is the single biggest factor in these budget calculations.  Growth brings income and revenues.  And in fact I haven't gone through it with a fine-toothed comb yet, but I will.  I think I see that the CBO is acknowledging that our faster growth, which they did not predict, is now paying for over 80 percent of the tax cuts.  OK?  And I think you'll see more about that as we get through.  The reports just came out yesterday.</p><p>Second point I want to make is we will have a tough spending budget coming up in a few weeks, a very tough spending budget with reductions of at least five percent across the board, in non-defense accounts.  So I think that's going to be very important.  Let's minimize government where possible.  Let's grow the economy to its max.  And you will see the debt burden, which I thought debt, as a share of GDP, will be coming down, and by the way, it already is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  OK.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That's what happened during the Reagan years.  That's what happened during the John F. Kennedy years.  So, I wrote about it in my book.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That -- that's the best way to measure that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But, Larry, you know what I don't understand?  I mean you're all about growth, you have been for all your entire career.  Why are so many people worried about the slowdown?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why are we hearing some people say a recession is on the horizon?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, there's just -- it's funny in this town and I guess a little bit in New York, this is a lot of pessimism.  I don't --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you expect a recession this year or 2020?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I do not.  I don't see it right now.  If I look at financial indicators, credit spreads, the actual numbers, you know, it's just -- we -- GDP will come out a week late because the Commerce Department has reopened.  We've seen stuff like falling unemployment claims, rising manufacturing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But what are the markets telling us, Larry?  In the month of December, there was no high-yield debt issuance at all.  Credit markets are still tight.</p><p>KUDLOW:  They've come back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They've come back a bit.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Come back.  I like that.  Profits, the mother's milk of stocks, I don't know who first that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You did.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Profits, the mother's milk of stocks are rising.  The early indications are they won't to 25 percent but they're going to rise 10, to 15 percent.  I like that a lot.  Interest rates, the level of rates, are historically low.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you're not worried about market volatility?</p><p>KUDLOW:  There's a million things to worry about when I get up in the morning, you know, mainly getting here on time so I could do this great interview.  But I just want to say, if you look at the sum total of all the evidence right now, there's no recession out there.  I am the happy warrior.  I am an optimist.  President Trump is an optimist.  I think America, right now, we are the hottest economy in the world and we should remain so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll end it there.  Larry Kudlow.  Good to see you, sir.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow.  Back in a moment.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The government shutdown may be over, but the effects are still being felt.  Hillary Vaughn is live this morning at a craft brewery in Escondido, California where the shutdown effects are actually still lingering.  Hillary.</p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Hi, Maria.  Good morning.  Craft beer is a $76.2 billion industry, and for many craft breweries, like Stone Brewery, where we are today, the effects of the government shutdown are not over.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOMINIC ENGELS, CEO, STONE BREWING:  When the industry craft is built on seasonal beers, it's built on new beers, it's the new sexy thing, and if we can't get the new sexy thing to market, then we're not going to connect with our fans.  They're going to be disappointed.  We're going to make the sales numbers we planned to make in our financial plans, and these things will have repercussions.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUGHN:  As Federal workers at the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau are finally back in the office, a mountain of paperwork is waiting, about 11,000 applications for alcohol labels have been backlogged leaving craft breweries waiting to ship and sell all their new beer across state line, which means they're in limbo until these approvals go through.  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Hillary.  Thanks very much.  We've be watching that.  Hillary Vaughn.  Stay with us.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  President Trump is tweeting this morning.  He's talking about a former staffer.  Here's what he just said.  \"A low level staffer that I hardly knew named Cliff Sims wrote yet another boring book based on made up stories in fiction.  He pretended to be an insider when, in fact, he was nothing more than a gofer.  He signed a non-disclosure agreement.  He is a mess.  Dagen McDowell, great to see you this morning thank you so much.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  John Hilsenrath, Matt Schlapp.  I don't know why the President tweets this.  He's got how many million view, you know, users and followers.  He just let everybody know who this guy is like --</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, THE AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Well, he literally sat in a -- he sat in a cubicle outside my wife's office in the West Wing, and so it is kind of amazing like this insider whole kind of mythology is something the President knows is not true.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  But he's got some extra sales thanks to that tweet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  That's what I'm saying.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think, Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  Again, everybody's got a book to write.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jim Comey, this guy.  Hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Oh, that was a good answer.  Hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, Jim Comey's book, yes, well, there's -- I think that will be a story that we're going to continue following, Jim Comey and the FBI.  You know what.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Everybody wants to be Norma Desmond, Maria.  I'm ready for my close up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  Thanks, everybody.  Great panel today.

Good morning, everyone, I'm Maria Bartiromo, thanks for joining us live this morning from Washington.  It is Tuesday, January 29th, your top stories right now 6:00 a.m. on the east coast.  Earnings in focus this morning, investors are watching results from several Dow components ahead of the open this morning.  The one to watch after the close is Apple.  We've got everything you need to know this morning previewing the report.  Apple under fire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile, FaceTime hit with a new bug that lets people eavesdrop on you without your knowledge.  How you can fix it, coming up -- big story.  Rising tensions with China meanwhile, the U.S. bringing charges against Huawei as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  The very latest on state of negotiations with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin this morning.  That interview at 8:00 a.m. Eastern, join us for that.  PG&amp;E makes it official, California's largest utility filed to bankruptcy protection, following the massive wild fires.  We've got all the details, coming up.</p><p>Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz roasted.  The billionaire hackled at an event last night as he gears up toward a possible independent run for the White House.  We've got a big show this morning coming from D.C., U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is here, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow is here along with House Minority, California Congressman Kevin McCarthy.  Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell will join me, along with AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka.  Don't miss a moment of it.  We've got a big three hours, coming up.</p><p>And we turn now -- right now, we kick it off with Wall Street markets.  We're looking to see a rebound this morning.  Take a look at Futures actually have just turned negative once again.  Futures down just fractionally, about 6 points on the Dow Industrials; 1-1/2 points lower on the S&amp;P; and the NASDAQ down 13 points.  This, after stocks finished lower yesterday on China growth fears along with weak guidance from Nvidia and Caterpillar.  We told you -- the Caterpillar numbers right here.  And of course, it did worsen throughout the day as investors react to a weaker-than-expected earnings and guidance.</p><p>Joining me right now is Federated Investors Chief Equity Market Strategist, Phil Orlando.  And Phil, it's good to see you this morning.</p><p>PHIL ORLANDO, CHIEF EQUITY MARKET STRATEGIST, FEDERATED INVESTORS:  Thanks for having me back, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All indications that we are seeing a slowdown and worries around China, among other issues, how do you see the markets here as more earnings have come into play?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, you had this 20 percent waterfall decline in stock prices in the fourth quarter of last year, we thought the market was attempting to price in the prospect of recession this year.  Multiples contracted from 18 times earnings down to 14 times earnings.  In our view, there's no risk of recession this year.  So, the rally that we've seen over the last month, 14 percent rally, the market is starting to price in the fact that maybe we're not going to have a recession.  But we've had a 14 percent rally in a month.  That's very, very powerful.  We would absolutely expect some consolidation here over the next month or two particularly as we've got these critical sign posts coming up in the month of March, but as we look out over the balance of the year, we do think that multiples will return to that 18 level, and we're going to end up with a pretty good year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  To what do you attribute the slowdown?  We've got earnings in focus and we're looking at a number of companies out that give weaker-than-expected guidance or miss on the top line.  Lockheed Martin, Pfizer, and Verizon are reporting this morning.  Apple is, of course, out after the bell, so when you look at the earnings picture, where in terms of industry are you seeing the most slowdown?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, I think in a word, uncertainty is what's impacting earnings and guidance to some degree.  You've got the Fed flip-flops that we saw in the fourth quarter last year, the uncertainty about whether or not the United States and China are going to be able to consummate this trade deal.  You've got Brexit overhanging on the global market and certainly the government shutdown, which was up there for 35 days, and it was just temporarily resolved last Friday.  You've got a number of issues there, all of which are impacting companies in some way, shape or form.  So, with earnings up 25 percent year-over-year in the first three quarters of last year, this fourth quarter is a little softer, I think we're up about 13 percent.  So far, we're about a quarter of the way through the earnings season.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>ORLANDO:  And I think what companies are pointing to are some combination of those four issues that I just mentioned.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you mentioned the shutdown.  The shutdown apparently costing the economy $11 billion according to new analysis from the Congressional Budget Office, although Larry Kudlow is disputing that number, and he's going to join us this morning live to talk about it.  The report says that it hit $3 billion, that's one-tenth of a percent of economic activity in the fourth quarter alone.  So, are there sectors that were -- that were hit hardest in that regard, or do you want to look at those companies that are largely tied to the China trade as one area of the real weakness?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the council of economic advisers under Trump had advised us that the shutdown was going to take about one-tenth of one percent out of GDP per week.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, remember, the shutdown started right around Christmas, so that makes sense that we lost, you know, a tenth of a percent in the fourth quarter, you know, maybe a half a percent here in the first quarter.  We're at 1.7 percent GDP growth in the first quarter, consensus blue chip is around 22, 23.  So, we think this pretext a little high and there will be, you know, sort of a downward revision as we get later in the quarter.  But in terms of industries, I think it's really across the board.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Across the board.</p><p>ORLANDO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about technology because it's big week for tech, Apple, of course, the big story today, reporting after the close tonight -- the only big tech reporting.  Microsoft, Facebook out tomorrow, Amazon is out on Thursday.  This is the week that we'll focus on technology and that's where really the growth stories have been.  Would you want to put new money to work in any of these names ahead of their earnings?</p><p>ORLANDO:  Short answer is probably no.  Again, you've had this 14 percent rally here in the last month, you've got concerns about slowing economic growth both in the U.S. and China.  We think that those issues will be resolved as we get into the back half of the year, but right now, you know, why run the risk of putting new money to work after you've had a big rally in some of these names ahead of what could be a disappointing earnings number or perhaps conservative guidance.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, the stock has come down because people were worried about it.  So, we'll see what the numbers are.  Would you, at some point, go back in to tech?  What's your favorite group right now, Phil?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, the areas that we like best in the U.S. markets are energy, financial services, industrials, and health care.  In terms of looking overseas, emerging markets look very attractive to us.  So, the areas that have really gotten hit the most are the ones that we've been attracted to.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there.  So, the valuations are better, I guess, is what you're saying.</p><p>ORLANDO:  The valuations are much more attractive.  We think the fundamentals are still very strong.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Phil, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>ORLANDO:  Great to see you.  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Phil Orlando joining us there.  Meanwhile, a bug in Apple's FaceTime app lets users listen in someone's phone without even the person knowing.  Dagen McDowell, what's happening this morning?  Good morning to you, Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well, Apple has some explaining to do, but particularly on this earnings call this afternoon.  So, there's a bug in the Apple iPhone that would allow people to eavesdrop on FaceTime users' calls.  A FaceTime user calling another person could listen in while the recipients phone is still ringing even if the person never accepts the call.  This was -- it involves several steps in the Group FaceTime feature on the iPhone.</p><p>Apple has disabled that Group FaceTime while it tries to come up with a fix for this, but you can eavesdrop in on somebody, essentially listening through the microphone, even if a person never takes that call, you could eavesdrop on rooms with unattended devices and even receive unauthorized video from the phone.  And again, it would take several steps to do this, but this is coming from a company, Maria, that loves to brag about its privacy protections and even throws shade at the likes of Facebook and other technology companies.</p><p>And adding embarrassment to embarrassment, yesterday was International Data Privacy Day and Tim Cook was tweeting about that.  Here's what he said on Twitter yesterday before this bug, this eavesdropping bug was disclosed.  We must keep fighting for the kind of world we want to live in.  On this Data Privacy Day, let us all insist on action and reform for vital privacy protections.  The dangers are real and the consequences are too important.  Big whoops for Apple, and of course, everything that happens in the business world is a political opportunity.  The Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo had to weigh in on this as well, putting out a statement late yesterday, say, \"Urging FaceTime users to temporarily disable the app.  So, Apple beat him to it, they're trying to fix it.  Embarrassment nonetheless.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible because you don't even know -- I mean, the phone could be ringing and you don't even know that they're listening.  I mean, that's the worst part of it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  I can explain later as the show goes on how this work, but you'd have to place a FaceTime call, go to the group, add yourself to the call and then the recipient of the call would have to hit maybe one like the on-button on the phone in order to activate it, but it was possible, and it was all over the internet yesterday how to do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, if -- so, if it's -- if it's not on and you say -- and you do -- and you decline the phone call, they can't listen in?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Unless you -- but you can't touch the phone at all.  Like, it's not even declining the phone.  Like, if you hit the up -- the up volume button on the phone, and so if I was playing this trick on you, it would activate it, and they could essentially hear what was going on in the room.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Unbelievable.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  I want to hear more about that, for sure.  Meanwhile, there's this, as expected, PG&amp;E filed for bankruptcy protection following those devastating wildfires in California.  Cheryl Casone on that in headlines right now.  Cheryl, good morning to you.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  Well, PG&amp;E is facing roughly about 30 billion in potential liabilities, as investigators are looking into whether the company's equipment played a role in starting California's deadliest fire.  More than 100 people died following a series of wildfires that burned hundreds of thousands of acres over a two-year period.  The utility providing energy service to 60 million people, we should add.  Taking a look at shares of PG&amp;E, look at that, in the premarket down nearly nine percent.  And those loses have actually paired back in the last hour or so, folks.</p><p>Well, China's Vice Premier has arrived in Washington for high-level trade talks that are going to start tomorrow.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and trade representative Robert Lighthizer will attend the two-day meeting.  Yesterday, the Trump administration announced a pair of indictments against Chinese telecom giant, Huawei.  The U.S. is accusing the company of trying to steal trade secrets from T-Mobile.  The Justice Department also charging Huawei with conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran.</p><p>And the China story continues, folks, shares of Nvidia are lower this morning.  The chipmaker is warning investors, and expects much weaker sales thanks in part, yes, to China's slowing economy.  It also previously cautioned the sales of its graphics processors that are used in video games PCs would be disappointing.  The China effect continues.  Chips for video gaming account for more than half of their business, they lost half their market value since hitting their peak back on October 1st, Maria.  So, Goldman Sachs had to come out last Friday, Maria, warning that a lot of these chip companies that have massive exposure to China are going to have really rough reports.  Micron Technology, even Wynn Resorts, the casino company, has got big China exposure, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, for sure.  All right, Cheryl, thanks so much.  Coming up next, five police officers are injured this morning, four of them shot while serving a search warrant.  The very latest coming up.  And then a venti-size disaster for Howard Schultz last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire (BLEEP).</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Former Starbucks CEO having a rough time exploring a 2020 Presidential run as he gets heckled.  We break it down right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Live from Washington, we are eyeing 2020, former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz facing backlash last night on his first stop of his book tour.  It was his first public appearance after announcing a possible Independent Presidential run.  It did not begin smoothly.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire (BLEEP).  Go back to getting ratio'd on Twitter.  Go back to Davos with the other billionaire elite who think they know how to run the world.  That's not what democracy needs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, my goodness.  Schultz is also facing backlash from former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.  Here's what he tweeted: \"In 2020, the great likelihood is that an Independent would just split the anti-Trump vote and end up re-electing the President.  That's a risk I refused to run in 2016, and we can't afford to run it now.\"</p><p>Here with me this morning to talk more about all of that is Dagen McDowell back in New York, Wall Street Journal Global Economics Editor Jon Hilsenrath here in D.C. with me, along with the American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp.  Gentlemen, it's good to see you.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Welcome to Washington.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, thank you so much.  And welcome to presidential politics, Howard Schultz.  What do you think about that?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Well, I'm going to get some popcorn.  This could be a real interesting Democratic primary, and whatever this Independent thing is, don't you love Michael Bloomberg who has probably spent a million dollars on polling, trying to figure out every way to become the President.  Publicly chastising Schultz for running as an Independent when that's exactly what Bloomberg would just love to do if he could.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  You know, on the one hand, Dagen, I feel like there is an opening for an Independent because there's such extremes and radical conversation going on certainly on the left.  And on the other hand, I don't know, how much is a cup of coffee at Starbucks?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Again, that $18.00 cup of Joe, I'm joking, I'm exaggerating.  It's helping --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think it's like $6.00.  I mean, seriously.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, we love cart coffee around this place.  But again, that's helping fund this run.  But Michael Bloomberg -- you know what, Michael Bloomberg should run for the Democratic nomination if he thinks he can win, it's just hilarious to have this multibillionaire lecturing Howard Schultz about an Independent run when actually a cup of Starbucks coffee has more charisma than Michael Bloomberg, number one.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Number two, it's going to be really interesting to see the narrative in the spring of 1992 with Ross Perot was -- Ross Perot was going to divide the Democratic vote, that it wouldn't hurt the Republican.  This could very well -- I mean, it depends on who -- what Howard Schultz says on the campaign trail and how far-left the Democrats go when they're running for the nomination.  But I'll say this, what he said so far about pay -- how to pay for Medicare For All and how that's impossible, I would be really interested to hear him talk about how to fix the health care system, because he might come to the table with some really interesting ideas and force the Democrats to answer the hard questions about paying for this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that is the thing, I mean, this party unfortunately, it's very hard for someone who's a centrist to actually have a shot.  You had Tim Ryan from Ohio, he wanted to do it, he's an economic thinker, he doesn't have a shot because of the same thing, you've got the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's 70 percent tax rate, the loudest voice in the room.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I mean, there's no question that these primaries are starting out very much from the left, you know, you have talk about a wealth tax, and 70 percent high-income tax threshold.  You have Elizabeth Warren who is going around beating up on the banks.  This is definitely a left-leaning primary season that we're going to be going into.  What I find so fascinating is the journeys that these different billionaires are traveling.  You know, you had President Trump who supported a lot of Democrats as a businessman in New York City traveling over to Republican Party, now you have Michael Bloomberg who started out as a Republican Mayor --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- traveling over to the Democratic Party, and Howard Schultz doesn't know where to go.  He doesn't know where he fits in.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He doesn't know where -- and what about Senator Kamala Harris?  Let's listen to her, because she held a CNN Townhall meeting in Iowa last night.  Harris is vowing to eliminate private health insurance with Medicare For All if elected president.  What's your take, Matt?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Making insurance companies illegal.  Look, the Democratic Party has become quite radicalized.  Think about this, less choices for the patient is the solution to our problems.  That seems insane.  Also, do we really think the government, when you get your tags to drive your car, or when you pay your taxes at the IRS, do you really think all the solutions to our problems are there?  I don't.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Let me ask you this, who does President Trump want to see come out of this whole --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think he wants Howard Schultz to run.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think -- he was taunting him yesterday.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH:  No, besides Howard Schultz, among the Democrats, who does he -- who does he want to (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>SCHLAPP:  I think most Republicans -- I'm not going to speak for the President -- but I think most Republicans believe that Elizabeth Warren is so far out there on the loony left, basically Marxism, socialism that I think they find that a delicious opportunity.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Can I --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- call the confiscation, Dagen.  He called it (INAUDIBLE) I mean, this two or three percent tax on assets, confiscation.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It is wealth confiscation.  It's totally communist and then to try and find people when they hand in their U.S. citizenship when other countries come calling, wanting you move there because they won't come and take your hard-earned money.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  One thing I want to point out that Jon Hilsenrath said that Howard Schultz doesn't know where to go.  President Trump should be worried about a Howard Schultz, because what if he comes to the table, like I said, with ideas that appeal to voters in this country who feel left out.  Who left out from the Republican Party and certainly left out by the left-leaning Democrats in this environment.  So, be very, very careful.  And one other thing I'll add with Howard Schultz at that -- at that bookstore, that's just the New York City welcome wagon.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's the way they treat all tourists in this city.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, I think you make a good point because there is that path.  That path of centrism.  I mean, that path of the center, because people do feel like it's gone wacky all the way on the left, for sure.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  It's a centrist country, but don't forget Hillary.  She's making noises.  Maybe that's the President's favorite opponent.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH:  We haven't seen any --</p><p>SCHLAPP:  She's making noises.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  We haven't seen anyone travel that centrist path as an Independent to presidency.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  So, it was a smart move on Howard Schultz's part.  We'll see.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Or a risky one for all those billions --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, certainly risky.  Take a quick break.  Extreme weather warning meanwhile on the other side of this break, millions of people across the country are gearing up for an Arctic blast as temperatures are plummeting, that's next.</p><p>Then showing their cards, British Prime Minister Theresa May asking Parliament to put up its plans from Britain's exit from the E.U.  Details on the historic debate.  And the vote happening later today, back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  It is cold out, and the deep freeze is setting in, hitting millions of Americans with subzero and dangerous temperatures.  Fox News Senior Meteorologist Janice Dean in the Fox Weather Center right now with the very latest.  Janice, tell us about it.</p><p>JANICE DEAN, FOX NEWS SENIOR METEOROLOGIST:  Hi, Maria, yes, we could be dealing with historic lows.  These are current windchills, what it feels like when you go outside and you are not protected.  Dangerous, potentially life-threatening windchills of -41 in International Falls, -18 in Chicago, but we still have another blast behind this.  So, these are morning lows, these are not windchill temperatures: Chicago -25 on Thursday, -31 in Minneapolis, -16 in Detroit.  Again, those are not windchill values.  Those are actual air temperatures.  But with the windchill, in some cases, we could get windchill values of -40 to -50.  If you go outside, your skin is going to freeze in minutes.</p><p>So, here's Chicago, Illinois.  Your all-time record low is -28.  So, we're going to flirt with historic lows, Maria.  This is a big deal.  The good news is it won't be long lasting.  By the weekend, we'll start to rebound, but I also want to make mention with this arctic cold front as we have snow across the deep south.  Snow that could cripple travel across portions of Atlanta, Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, and towards the southeast, so that's another dangerous part of the storm is the -- not only extreme cold but the snow as far as south as the gulf coast.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Janice.  Wow, what a story, thank you so much.</p><p>DEAN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will be watching.  Janice Dean.  Coming up next, the State of the Union is back on, it is February 5th.  Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi extending an invitation to the President, he accepted the offer.  Then, we're taking a look at the enormous cost of the shutdown.  What is the real number?  Plus, place your bets, Super Bowl fans getting ready to throw down an enormous amount of cash.  So, bet on the big game Sunday.  We break down all the numbers.  Stay with us.  Live from Washington this morning.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us.  We are coming to you live from Washington this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, January 29th, your top stories right now 6:31 on the east coast right now.  Earnings season is in full swing, a lot of big names reporting their fourth quarter today.  Xerox and Pfizer set to report in just a few moments, we'll bring you the numbers as soon as they hit the tape, and tell you how they are impacting markets.  Rising tensions with China, the U.S. is bringing charges against Huawei, as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will be my special guest, in about 90 minutes time.  We will break it all down with the Treasury Secretary, coming up.  So, stay with us.</p><p>Meanwhile, Futures relatively flat this morning, take a look at markets, down 20 points on the Dow Industrials, down 4 points on the S&amp;P, down 18 points on the NASDAQ.  We are expecting some pressure at the start of trading this morning, after all the major indices finished lower, yesterday, on Wall Street.</p><p>In fact, at 4:00, the Dow Industrials gave up 208 points, that was almost 1 percent lower, the S&amp;P 500 down 21, that was three quarters of a percent lower, and the NASDAQ with a 79-point decline yesterday, at the close, down better than 1 percent.</p><p>Investors are watching some big news this week, J.P. Morgan, calling this week the most important week of the first quarter, and here is why, you've got earnings, you've got the British vote, you've got U.S.-China trade talks, you've got a Federal Reserve decision, we're not expecting a Fed hike.</p><p>We've got fourth quarter GDP coming out.  And, of course, at the end of the week, the job's report for the month of January, a big week, investors want to watch it and will be covering it all.</p><p>European indices this morning look like this, in terms of trading.  We are looking at gains in Europe.  The FT-100 up one and a quarter percent, 86 points higher, the CAC Quarante in Paris is up a half a percent, 26 points higher, and the DAX Index in Germany, higher by a fraction, as you can see there.</p><p>Asian markets overnight, flat, take a look.  No real moves there, because mover was the KOSPI Index in Korea, up a quarter of a percent.</p><p>Well, there is tragedy in Houston to report, five police officers injured.  Four of them shot, while serving a search warrant.  We have the very latest, coming up.</p><p>And a debate in parliament, British lawmakers set to vote on the latest plan for the U.K. to leave the European Union.  We are previewing that and we will take a look at the impact across the world.</p><p>We've got a big program this morning from D.C., U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is coming up this morning, along National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow, they will take a look at all of these expectations that the economy is slowing.</p><p>Plus, House Minority Leader and California Congressman, Kevin McCarthy, is with us, along with Michigan Congresswoman, Debbie Dingell.  Plus, AFL CIO, President Richard Trumpa, here as well, big show, don't miss a moment of it, big three hours, coming up. And we are kicking off this half an hour right now, with this top story, feeling the effects of the shutdown, Washington, D.C. back in business for now, President Trump will give his State of the Union of Address on February 5th, Tuesday.  The address was originally supposed to be today.</p><p>Even though the shutdown is over, the U.S. is still feeling effects, new numbers from the Congressional Budget Office to report.  The U.S. GDP will be $3 billion lower during the fourth quarter of 2018, because of this shutdown.  On the immigration front, backlogs of immigration courts grew by at least 10 percent, according to Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about all of that is Americans for Tax Reform President, Grover Norquist, Grover, good to see you.</p><p>GROVER NORQUIST, PRESIDENT, AMERICANS FOR TAX REFORM:  Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So, the CBO is talking about a $3 billion-dollar hit, in fact, as a result of the shutdown, Larry Kudlow is having an issue with this.  He says, frequently disagrees with the CBO anyway.  What's your take in terms of what the shutdown cost the economy?</p><p>NORQUIST:  Look, the key thing is that the economy continues to grow and we're looking at a three percent rate of growth for the year, so $3 billion is a big number, unless you compare it to the GDP of the United States in the fourth quarter.</p><p>So, actually, we're doing fairly well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You don't think it had much of an impact then, Grover?</p><p>NORQUIST:  No, it's a small impact and we have a tremendous growth for the year, which is way beyond what the CBO said was possible, when they scored this.  The CBO needs to spend a little more time going back to explain why they were so wrong on all of their recent predictions, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  Go ahead.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Grover, the Federal Reserve and most of the economist that we surveyed at the Wall Street Journal are saying that the economy is slowing down in 2019.  We had a nice burst in 2018 in part, because of tax cuts and in part, because there's more spending, $300 billion of additional spending.</p><p>But now, they say the economy is slowing along with the global economy, what does that say about the impact of these tax cuts, are the tax cuts really created the long-run growth that Republicans said was going to happen?</p><p>NORQUIST:  The tax cuts do two things.  We were at 35 percent rate, which is the highest in the world.  It made sense for an American company like Burger King to be bought by Canadian company, because even though they're selling the same hamburgers, the same number of employees, it was worth more, because we had a worldwide tax system at 35 percent.</p><p>By taking 35 down to 21, we became competitive with Europe.  I mean, our friends, the Germans were at 25, the Japanese were at 25.  I'm sorry, the Japanese were at 30.  The Chinese were at 25.  And we were at 35.  We weren't even close to being competitive.  It's a huge change in the direction for the country.</p><p>And if the CBO tells you they're pessimistic, they didn't think you could do three percent, they laughed at three percent growth, said you could never do more than --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  The question is, is that three percent growth.  I think a lot of people understand that the corporate tax rate was uncompetitive, even some Democrats wanted to lower their corporate tax rate, but the question is, this new tax code that we've got, is that sufficient to sustain the three percent growth in 2019?</p><p>NORQUIST:  It's a good first start.  We also need to do something about the workforce.  We need more workers and frankly, there's more tax reduction that needs to be done and spending restraint is very important at the end of the day.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  I want to go back to this question about a shutdown, Grover, which is, people are saying, they're almost using the reason why you couldn't cut government, because somehow, that would have a negative impact on our economic growth.  That seems like a very dangerous road to go down.</p><p>Isn't it true that all of this money that they are saying didn't get put into the economy, are you worried that the government actually won't spend all of that by the time that the authority over the money, expires?</p><p>NORQUIST:  For the government to -- I was taught this (INAUDIBLE) economics in college also.  The government takes your money, and then spends it.  It's much better for the economy than if it lets you spend it.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Right.</p><p>NORQUIST:  Because you would waste some of it by investing it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because they can spend money better than you, of course.</p><p>NORQUIST:  And that's the oddest thing because, of course, that's nonsense.  East Germany should have done very well, under this theory, but it doesn't, so --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  What the government is doing is borrowing other people's money and spending it, right?  I mean, we're talking about deficits that are nearing a trillion dollars.</p><p>NORQUIST:  The (INAUDIBLE) cost the government is how much the government spends, whether they borrowed or take it, it's still gone from the -- from the real economy.  The cost of government is total government spending.  We should have taxes low, and then the least destructive way possible, all taxes are somewhat destructive.  And you have less borrowing if you have less spending.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what about all of these new plans?  And by the way, we are getting earnings right now, as we're talking 3M and Xerox, both beat expectations, although 3M is cutting its forecast for the year.  What about all of these ideas about taxing the wealthy?  New York Congressman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez claims for a 70 percent marginal tax rate on the tippy top, as she calls it.</p><p>Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts senator, hopeful, for 2020, two percent tax on Americans whose assets exceed 50 million.  If you're a billionaire, three percent, what's the impact?</p><p>NORQUIST:  OK, magicians like to do this, so you're not looking at, you know -- watch my right hand, don't look at the left hand.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NORQUIST:  The reason they talk about high tax rates on rich people, is that they want to gouge the middle class.  The difference between the United States and Sweden, Finland, Denmark, the countries that Cortez talked about is, they don't have the 70 percent rate, just back up for sec -- there isn't a country in the world with a 70 percent income tax rate.</p><p>Many countries used to, the Beatle song, 19 for me, one for you, 95 percent tax rate, and then the Beatles moved to United States, and everybody who could pay tennis, left Sweden.  And all the countries of the world realize that tax rates that high were stupid and destructive and didn't help equality or growth or anything like that.</p><p>So, they got rid of them.  The whole world got rid of them.  We did it, it was stupid.  We back offed it and had strong economic growth as a result, so 70 percent stupid and destructive.  It's not America saying, the world says that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You probably showed the op-ed today, in the Journal, in California, and taxes as well.  The Journal, this week, by Cypress founder, T.J. Rodgers, which was very good, Another California Tax Grab, he writes.  In it, the politicians have fueled an affordability crisis that drives away businesses and exacerbates homelessness.</p><p>California Governor, Gavin Newsom, called for even higher taxes in his inauguration speech earlier this month.</p><p>NORQUIST:  California is a good example of 70 percent play.  They have a 13 percent rate on people making a million dollars, but they have 8 percent rate on people making $42,000.  So, they want the middle class people in California to think you're OK, because we're really screwing the other guy.</p><p>And point of fact, Florida has a zero percent first income tax, Texas has a zero percent first income tax, 8 percent looks good compared to 13.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NORQUIST:  Looks lousy compared to zero percent.  They want the middle class to think somebody else is paying the freight.  That's why they have those phoney high tax rates that don't raise much money.  It's to fool the middle class.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it is talking point, and it works for the populist.  Let me bring in Dagen McDowell on this, because we hear this every time we go into the tax discussion and we have a Democrat on which takes out another one of those talking points on taxes, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And I want to say that Senator Kamala Harris said that the first thing -- she said it last night, in the town hall, he first thing she do is to cut taxes for the middle class.  Well, roughly half this country pays no net federal income tax, number one, and the Republicans just did that particularly, doubling the standard deduction.</p><p>So, I don't know who she's going to cut taxes for.  But this is the ruse and this is the big liberal lie that all of these big new welfare state initiatives, whether it's green energy, even single payer, it's all going to be paid for by the super rich.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And that it's not going to be -- that the paying won't be spread across every person in this country to fund this welfare state.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And by the way, the numbers don't add up even if you tax all the rich, you're not going to get the amount of money you need for this green deal, Grover.</p><p>NORQUIST:  You don't even balance the budget if you do that, never mind half money for new things.  Look, the big difference between United States and Denmark, United States and Sweden, it's not how much money higher income people pay, it's what happens to middle-income people.</p><p>Denmark, Finland, Sweden, the tax rate on middle income people is 10, 15, 20 points higher than an American middle class person.  And, you add to that the value added tax.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NORQUIST:  The difference between United States and Europe is how heavily taxed middle income people are, and they have those (INAUDIBLE) high rates that very few people pay, to make people in the middle class think that they are getting a deal.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Speaking of middle income tax -- a lot of Democrats want a carbon tax, gasoline tax and even some big American business.  That's the way to address the issue of climate change.  Do you see any path towards a carbon tax that would be acceptable to your point --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I guess, but real quick, Grover.</p><p>NORQUIST:  No.  No, absolutely not.  And the reason is, you can look at Washington State, very deep blue Washington State.  They have twice had it on the ballot and twice defeated a carbon dioxide tax, gasoline taxes lose overwhelmingly.  This is too obvious tax on middle-income people.  It's a loser up.  They are having this fight in -- our dear friends in France or loggerhead down the subject.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We know how that played out.</p><p>NORQUIST:  We had the Ontario government and the Alberta government collapsed as a result of this, and three times, in Australia.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Grover, thank you.  Yes.</p><p>NORQUIST:  Bad politics and lousy economics.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Grover, thank you for the facts, we appreciate it, Grover Norquist, joining us there.</p><p>Five officers injured in a shooting in Texas, meanwhile, Cheryl Casone in New York, with the details, there.  Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  That's right, Maria.  Four officers were shot and another officer suffered a knee injury in Houston.  They were serving a search warrant at a suspected drug house.  Police say two of them were hit in the neck.  Those officers are in critical but stable condition.  Two suspects were killed at the scene.</p><p>Well, a key E.U. negotiator, warning the risk of Britain leaving the European Union without a deal, is very high, as parliament votes on amendments in Theresa May's exit plan today.  Lawmakers set to consider more than 10 different amendments before taking votes.  That's going to be at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>And those votes come after May's plan to leave the European Union was overwhelmingly rejected earlier this month, a lot of those votes against her from her own party.</p><p>Well, Americans will be betting an estimated $6 billion on the Super Bowl, that's according to the survey by the American Gaming Association.  About 22.7 million U.S. adults plan to place a bet on the upcoming Atlanta game, of those bets, 94.47 percent, reportedly illegal, but let the games begin, Maria, and those are your headlines.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Be there to watch it all, front-row seat.</p><p>CASONE:  I'm there for you, Maria.  I've got surprises for you, coming up.  You're going to love them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK, looking forward to it.  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, crisis in Venezuela to take a look at, new sanctions have been placed on the country's oil.  Plus, National Security Advisor, John Bolton, may have inadvertently revealed the administration's next move.  Why his notes are raising eyebrows this morning.</p><p>Then, farming in America, why farmers are being forced to rent water.  That's up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A look at some of the big headlines across America this morning.  The Chicago Tribune reporting on the Pension Agency criticizing Sears Chairman Eddie Lampert's plan to acquire the bankrupt retailer.  The article explaining that the agency sets to takeover Sears.  Pensions objects to the bid, calling it the final fulfillment of a year-long's scheme to deprive Sears and its creditors of assets and its employees of jobs while lining Lampert's on owns pockets.</p><p>The Daily Camera in Colorado, reporting on how Boulder County farmers are increasingly renting water.  The report explains how ownership from agricultural interests has dropped from 85 percent in the late 1950s to just 30 percent.  The water increasingly moving to municipal control.</p><p>And the Mercury News writing that how in one California city you can text 911 for emergency help.  According to the paper, the police department there announced that the service is now available in the city.  It is meant to help people who are hearing or voice impaired.  The police are also recommending that you not send emojis.  Well, yes, I would think not.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  What are we coming to?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  My God, but it is good that you can text 911.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  That's a good step, just don't text person emoji.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, crisis in Venezuela new sanctions placed on the country's oil, plus National Security Advisor John Bolton may have inadvertently revealed the administration's next move, why his notes on his legal pad are raising eyebrows this morning?  We're breaking that down when we come right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A framework for peace.  The U.S. and Taliban negotiators making a preliminary on key issues to end the war in Afghanistan -- the longest war in American history.  The two top points American troop withdrawal and insurgence vowing to end terrorist attacks abroad, that's according to the Wall Street Journal.  Many hurdles remain to ensure the peace is in place.  Joining me right now is Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst, General Jack Keane.  General, it's always a pleasure to see you.</p><p>GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST:  Good to see you, Maria, and welcome to Washington again.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  And what do you think about this?  I mean, are we supposed to be trusting the Taliban?</p><p>KEANE:  No, we can never ever trust the Taliban, that doesn't mean that we can't have a treaty with them.  But here's what I think is going on, a couple of things have changed: one is the Taliban in the last couple of years have gone all out as we have so dramatically reduced our forces, thinking that they will going to be able to overthrow the regime, because the only thing the United States is really doing is training and assisting the ground forces -- no longer doing the fighting, however provide an air power.  That didn't work.  They retook some territory but never took capitals or provinces and they never took -- they never able to secure a province.  So, what has happened?  The war stalemated.  The Taliban cannot take over the government and the government cannot defeat Taliban, even with our assistance.</p><p>Second thing, and this is crucial, Pakistan has gotten involved in this in a way they've never have before.  They forced the Taliban to go to the peace negotiation table, why?  Pakistan knows it's no longer in national interest to keep this thing stalemated.  There's growing al-Qaeda and growing ISIS presence in Afghanistan which gives the Pakistanis some concern.  So, those are the new things that are happening.  That's why the negotiations have some momentum.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's the thing, though.  I mean, so many people were worried when the president said: we were withdrawing the troops.  And where do you stand on that now?  I mean, do you feel better about it given this peace deal?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, let me answer it this way -- I mean, it is an essential question: the Taliban themselves, we are trying to get an agreement with them that, one, they'll stop trying to overthrow the government and number two, they'll power share with them and also, they will assist in taking down the al-Qaeda and the ISIS.  I don't think we can trust them to do that, based on the fact that they provided safe haven for Osama bin Laden for almost 10 years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  So, what do we do?</p><p>KEANE:  So, we leave in place, after we bring out the troops that are providing the training and assistance.  We leave in place a counterterrorism force and an intelligence capability indefinitely.  We're doing that in Yemen, we're doing it in Libya and we're doing it in Africa.  The one in Africa is off the coast.  It's a Maritime Joint Task Force.  That is what we need to do, that is the guaranty against the Taliban because the issue in Afghanistan has always been, we would never intervene in the civil war in Afghanistan between the northern alliance and Taliban for one reason only, we didn't evade, because they attacked the United States.  That's the reason we're there.  We don't want that to happen again and we cannot trust the Taliban to provide that guarantee for us.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, let me move on and ask you about sanctions on the Venezuelan oil industry.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin who will be here shortly this morning along with Security Adviser John Bolton, explain the decision in a briefing yesterday and issued warning for disputed President Nicolas Maduro.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN BOLTON, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR:  The president has made it very clear on this -- on this matter that all options are on the table.</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY:  There's no reason why these resources shouldn't be used for the economic benefit of the people there.  There's no reason for the poverty and the starvation and the humanitarian crisis.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to this announcement yesterday?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, increased pressure on Maduro regime is certainly a welcome thing.  I mean, this really comes down to the loyalty of the military to Maduro.  As long as that loyalty is there, it's unlikely that Maduro is going the leave.  If that loyalty starts to fall apart, I hope we're working a 'plan b', which is engineering right now some kind of exit path for Maduro, where he can go into exile with recriminations in Venezuela.  The Reagan administration did this very successfully on Ferdinand Marcos, back in 1986, overwhelming popular opposition to him, hundreds of thousands of people.  We engineered his exit.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me squeeze in this question before you go general.  This image from the briefing going viral and it shows John Bolton's notepad with the notation: \"5,000 troops to Colombia.\"  Whoa, do you think we should be sending troops to the region?  What do you think about this?  Caught on camera.</p><p>KEANE:  Look, when we deposed Noriega in 1989 operation just cost Panama, 26,000 troops, is what it took.  When we deposed a dictator in Haiti, 28,000.  The ease of troops that would only be in there, move into Venezuela, if there's a problem at the embassy to our diplomat.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How significance is revealing such a secret?</p><p>KEANE:  I think he'd probably wanted to reveal it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  General Jack Keane, good to see you sir.  Thank you so much.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Show: MORNINGS WITH MARIA][Date: January 29, 2019][Time: 07:00:00][Tran: 012902cb.231][Type: SHOW][Head: Interview with Rep.

Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo coming to you live this morning from Washington, D.C.  It is Tuesday, January 29th.</p><p>Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>It is a busy day on the earnings calendar this morning.  3M among the Dow components reporting their fourth quarter.  The company cut its forecast for 2019.  Pfizer also cut this morning.  The stock under pressure this morning after the guidance came in below expectations.

Join us live as the Treasury Secretary will join the program, coming up.</p><p>Markets are under pressure this morning.  Futures pointing to a lower opening for the broader averages although right now it is more like a flat showing than lower.</p><p>The Dow Industrials are up 3 points right now.  S&amp;P 500 pretty much flat, up a quarter point.  And the Nasdaq is down 4 points.  It's been back and forth on futures this after declines across the board yesterday, of course.</p><p>Stocks finished off of the lows of the day but nonetheless, the Dow Industrials were down 209 points, almost 1 percent.  S&amp;P was down 20.  The Nasdaq was down 79, better than 1 percent lower.</p><p>Global markets this morning.  Take a look at European indices, higher across the board.  This right here, this is the high of the morning.  FT 100 up 1.5 percent, 97 points higher.  CAC 40 in Paris up 39 points, almost 1 percent.

Take a look, the social media service eyeing a major change to better compete with Instagram.  We'll tell you all about it coming up.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning.  And joining me to break it all down -- Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell in New York; the \"Wall Street Journal's\" global economics editor Jon Hilsenrath here in D.C. with me; and the American Conservative Union chairman, Matt Schlapp.  Great to see you -- guys.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Great to be here.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen -- good morning to you.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning.  We were talking about the shutdown.  So it's over for the time being.</p><p>The Democrats have actually been hurt by it as well.  Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows that positive feelings about the Democratic Party have fallen to 35 percent this month.  That's down 4 percentage points since December.  And that is essentially in line with the positive feelings that people have about Republicans.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean that's a really good point because the President really did not get hurt certainly on his base, from his base, by the shutdown.  What do you guys think?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Two things.  First is that the President's base was actually energized that he would make a spending fight.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Remember, immigration is a spending fight because if he can stop illegal immigration or reduce it, you don't have all these social services costs.</p><p>But the second thing is, the President's brand is that he will fight, he will fight harder than any politician on the field and he reiterated that brand.  So if he can increase that reputation, I think it appeals to Independents.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They said dig in.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  But isn't his brand also -- it's about fighting and continuing to fight and winning.  And he didn't win the wall in this case.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  I don't agree with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We don't know if he won the wall yet.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  There's three steps to this - -</p><p>HILSENRATH:  In this case, right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  In this case.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  -- there's three really important things.  Number one, the bill he signed has $1.3 billion in barrier funding annualized.</p><p>Number two, he's got to exhaust all legislative efforts if he's going to go the emergency route in order to have a good case in court.</p><p>And number three, the American people when it comes to immigration, he is on the right side of this policy argument.  And Democrats who are against border security, they're going to be sorry for this eventually.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  But you know what.  You better be --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, go ahead -- Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- but you better be careful about what you do and this goes to all politicians because I was flying on Friday and that was an utter nightmare.  If you want to anger everybody in the electorate, you pull another fast one like that where people are grounded and you've got an hour and-a-half plane flight where you're at 8,000 feet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But who are you blaming?</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They were blaming (INAUDIBLE) and blaming the Democrats because --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They were blaming everybody.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- Nancy Pelosi dug in.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They were blaming everybody.  But TSA agents down in Raleigh, Durham were going to food banks because they were spending what little money they had on gas trying to get to and from work.  So again, I don't care who is responsible for it.  They're all responsible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, businesses did start, you know, putting the uncertainty out there, sitting on cash, making decisions later.  We know.  I mean the SEC closed, can't get any IPOs through.  FDA closed, got to worry about obvious food shortages or food issues.</p><p>So we were beginning to see some real impact.  And Dagen saw it firsthand at the airport.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  That's true.  But if you're a federal employee in this town, let's face it, you make a little bit of a bargain.  Yes, every year you might have to go through a shutdown with your salary.</p><p>But you know, the other thing, Maria, that we don't talk about, it's almost impossible to fire a federal employee.  There's some pretty cushy gigs --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good point.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  -- in THIS town where you basically have an insurance policy against ever getting fired unless you do something just awful.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  And you can read all the GAO reports that's backed that up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're talking about all of that this morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But there are people barely making ends meet who are trying to drive to work, and spending all their money on gasoline and going to food banks who were working for the TSA and not getting paid.</p><p>And when the Republicans stop thinking about them and start talking about the workers who aren't needed, the ones who are furloughed you have really missed the boat.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, maybe.  But how about the fact that we've got a border wall in Nancy Pelosi's state?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that immoral, the wall that separates Tijuana from San Diego --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  But --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- is that immoral?  I don't think so.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They need to start asking all of these Democrats who think that the wall is immoral or don't want to fund it, ok, let's take down the walls that are there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's how you put --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will the three million people in Tijuana assimilate with the three million people in San Diego if that wall is torn down?  I think so.  And we're going to talk about that this morning.</p><p>We've got a big show this morning from D.C., live.  Coming up Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is here, live.  National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow has a thing or two to say about the CBO protections about what exactly the impact is on the economy from that shutdown.</p><p>House Minority Leader and California Congressman Kevin McCarthy will walk us through what these next three weeks look like with his colleagues in terms of this negotiating on border wall funding.</p><p>Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell is here.</p><p>Along with AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka.</p><p>Don't miss a moment of it.  A big two hours coming up.</p><p>And we kick it off this hour right now with markets.  Futures are pointing to a flat opening this morning amid all of this uncertainty over China trade, earnings.  It's an enormous week this week.</p><p>This after stocks finished to the downside yesterday on the China growth fears, the weak guidance from Nvidia and Caterpillar as well, and of course these worries about what happens with China and the U.S.  There's conversations happening tomorrow.</p><p>Joining us right now is the founder, CEO and chief investment strategist at Mainstay Capital Management David Kudla.  David -- good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>DAVID KUDLA, FOUNDER/CEO/CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, MAINSTAY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So we've been talking about what a week this is with the fourth quarter earnings coming out.  That's been pretty much driving the story.  We have a jobs report coming out at the end of the week on Friday.  Brexit discussions, the vote today.  U.S./China discussions tomorrow.  A fourth quarter GDP number.  How do you want to invest with all of this?</p><p>KUDLA:  I think investors should be looking at stocks right now that they want to own.  We've been invested through -- the past month has been very good for stock investors.  13 percent rise through Friday from the lows of December 24th.  And that's in both growth stocks and value stocks, so a broad market advance.</p><p>We're going to see some give and take here now after this nice advance of last month but investors should be picking, you know, their points here, have their list out on stocks they want to own.  We look for a good 2019 for stock investors.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is it good news, Jon Hilsenrath, that the Fed gave us a pivot that we know that the Fed is on pause right now and that we know that they're even ready to consider slowing down the unwind of the bond portfolio?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  I don't think it's good news.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I think it shows that the Fed is becoming less confident about how strong and sustainable the economy is.  I mean it is a sign that inflation isn't picking up and that's good news.  But you see some real trepidation coming out of the Fed right now with the global economy slowing, with markets being unstable and volatile.</p><p>I think the Fed is a little worried about the outlook and that shouldn't really give us a lot of encouragement.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about that, David?  I mean the economy's slowing.</p><p>KUDLA:  But Jon this -- yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLA:  But John -- the important thing here is what happened in the fourth quarter is we had mixed messages out of fed chair Jerome Powell.  We had on October 3rd we were far away from neutral.  Then by November we were close to neutral rates.  Then on the 16th in the Fed meeting they were going to do what's right no matter what.</p><p>Then he came in on January 4th and finally said we're going to be considerate of market and economic conditions and now we're seeing a more consistent and accommodative message out of the Fed.  And that's very important for the markets.</p><p>That's music to the market's ears and that's why we've now seen a sustained advance.  So the markets and investors are now looking at a Fed that seems as though they are going to be considerate of or accommodative or take into account what's happening with the markets, with the economy, and not just normalize rates for the sake of normalizing rates.</p><p>They won't have $50 billion rolling off the balance sheet on auto pilot and they won't raise rates just to raise rates to get to a normalized rate structure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that was the worry in the fourth quarter.</p><p>KUDLA:  -- in pause like in 2016 if the market and economy warrants it.  That's important.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That was they worry in the fourth quarter -- that they were on auto pilot-- Jon.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  Yes, I make two points.</p><p>KUDLA:  That drove volatility in the fourth quarter, the Fed.  .</p><p>HILSENRATH:  David makes a really important point, you know.  So this has been Jerome Powell's first year at the Fed.  He's had a bit of a honeymoon with the market.  And then what the market has discovered in the last month or two is that Mr. Powell, you know, he kind of prides himself on being a plain-spoken communicator but his communication has confused a lot of people in the market.  And he's really had to do a lot of corrections over the last few weeks --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- so that raised some questions about him.</p><p>But the other thing about -- you know, the market wants to see the Fed on an easier path.  Ok.  But the underlying message there is that this economy can't sustain very high rates.</p><p>So it doesn't send a really encouraging message about economic growth and the economic outlook when we see that the Fed is starting to recognize it just can't sustain a tighter monetary policy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But look, we're getting the news from the companies themselves with the fourth quarter numbers coming out.  Verizon just reported mixed earnings.  They beat on earnings, but they missed on revenue.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Caterpillar.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Technology reporting late today, Apple.  And we heard from Apple already.  Facebook, Amazon -- all reporting this week, Microsoft.  It's going to be a big week for technology.  And of course you mentioned Caterpillar.  That was the big kahuna yesterday that really set the tone for the markets because Caterpillar is a great indicator of economic activity across the world, in particular China.</p><p>So stay on earnings for a second, David.  Give me your take on technology.  Because you've got Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft coming out this week.</p><p>KUDLA:  Well, you know, tech stocks got beat up very bad in the fourth quarter.  They've come back in this rally and we think that tech stocks have further to go.</p><p>Look, we think that investors should stay with tech stocks.  We have an opportunity here to add value stocks to the portfolio.  Cyclicals came into 2019 at their lowest valuation relative to the S&amp;P 500 ever.</p><p>So investors now can diversify their portfolio in an opportunistic way, holding both growth stocks.  Those tech stocks that we think still have some rebound and some further runway ahead of them, and by adding value stocks that are very opportunistic.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  David -- it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>KUDLA:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Still bullish on this market.  David Kudla joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, the State of the Union is back on, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi extended officially the invitation to President Trump to do the State of the Union in the House Chamber.  He accepted the offer.</p><p>Plus we're taking a look at the enormous cost of the shutdown, what exactly is the number?  A lot of people say it wasn't very much at all.</p><p>Then, Snapchat's unthinkable change, how the photo sharing app is attempting to compete with Instagram by changing a key feature.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>New revelations in the sexual misconduct claims against the former CEO of Wynn Resorts.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with headlines now in New York -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Maria.  The \"Wall Street Journal\" is reporting that executives at Wynn Resort ignored allegations of sexual misconduct by Steve Wynn over more than a decade.  According to a regulator's report Wynn was accused of sexually assaulting or harassing salon workers, cocktail servers and flight attendants who worked for his company.</p><p>Under a proposed settlement, the Nevada Gaming Control Board won't try to revoke Wynn's regulatory licenses but Wynn is going to pay a fine.  Steve Wynn has denied any claims of misconduct.  There's a one year chart of Wynn's in front of you right there.</p><p>Well, Snapchat has named Lara Sweet as its interim CFO.  This is another shift in leadership at Snap as the company has lost several high profile employees over the last year.  Meanwhile Snap is reportedly considering allowing longer lasting or even permanent videos on Snapchat.  It will apply the Snap shared publicly on this story's features.  Snap is down 52 percent from one year ago.  There's that chart for you.</p><p>Well, Porsche is speeding past Tesla in a fast charging race.  The car maker says it new Porsche Taycan is going to be able to add more than 60 miles of charge in just four minutes.  That will be the fastest available today, exceeding Tesla's super charging stations which needs about 30 minutes to charge a vehicle's battery to at least 80 percent.  Charging times are a key selling point obviously for these car makers and now Porsche is giving Taycan owners three years of free charging.</p><p>And obviously we're going to be hearing from Tesla this week, Maria.  Earnings are coming out from Elon Musk and company.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Cheryl -- thank you so much.</p><p>Coming up next, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi challenged over her words describing a border wall as immoral.  We will break it down when we come back.</p><p>Then support on the links, fans rallying around a pro golfer whose two shot penalty was deemed unfair.  More on that.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Keeping America safe, the government is back open but the focus now is whether President Trump can make a deal with Democratic leadership on funding for the border wall.</p><p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has called it immoral, any wall is immoral.  But her home state of California protects the southern border in some places with an actual wall -- the wall separating Tijuana and San Diego.</p><p>Joining me right now is Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell.  And the last time you were on you said you wanted to look at this again.  Congresswoman -- it's good to see you.</p><p>REP. DEBBIE DINGELL (D), MICHIGAN:  It's good to see you.  Welcome to Washington.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.</p><p>What's your take on this?  I mean can Nancy Pelosi really get away with calling a wall immoral when she has a wall in her own state, separating Tijuana from San Diego?</p><p>DINGELL:  Here is what I think is going to happen.  You've got strong countries (ph), both sides of the aisle, both houses.  They're going to go into that room and they want to cut a deal that's going to keep our nation safe.  I don't think anybody wants to see what we just went through for 35 days.</p><p>It hurt the economy.  It hurt -- and I do believe -- this is going to sound corny but I don't -- you know, why do we point -- why do we need to have a Trump win, a Pelosi win.  We need an American win.</p><p>So I'm hoping they're going to go in that room.  I've talked to my colleagues on both sides.  I've talked to Roy Blunt.  I've talked to all my Democratic colleagues in the House.  They want to win.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DINGELL:  They want to go in and put together a package that's going to keep --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So how do you win?  What's the position in terms of wall funding?  Because they may very well -- your colleagues may very well come back and say ok, here's $5 billion towards border security, not a dime toward a wall.</p><p>DINGELL:  I don't know -- if people are really working together, that may not happen.  You know, there may be money, if there are appropriate places for a wall or fence or --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is there a movement within your party, do you think, among your colleagues that they feel that, yes, some money should go for an actual barrier?</p><p>DINGELL:  I think what I hear among my colleagues is let's go into a room and do something that makes sense.  Let's come up with -- we need to -- I've said this to you a million times.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DINGELL:  We need to strengthen our borders at both sides.  Everybody talks about the southern border.  I've got this northern border too which just had a huge human trafficking problem again in the last few --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But there are areas of the southern border that are very dense.  In other words like when you just look at the wall in Nancy's state and that is three million people on one side in Tijuana, three million people on the other side in San Diego.  If you tear that wall down -- I mean isn't it obvious many of the people on the Tijuana side will assimilate into the United States?</p><p>DINGELL:  Then let me ask you this question.  Build a wall, tear down a wall -- are there structures that are working that are in place?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  .</p><p>DINGELL:  So that's -- what I do think we need drones.  We need to fill the 3,000 open patrol --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's common ground, both sides believe in that.</p><p>DINGELL:  Both agree --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Technology and drones -- definitely.</p><p>DINGELL:  We need technology.  We need to make these ports safer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Specifically in a dense area, like Tijuana/San Diego, drones wouldn't work.  I mean maybe you want that in addition to a wall.  When you have such a dense area, where there's three million people on one side of the wall and three m million on the other, don't you need an actual barrier?</p><p>DINGELL:  But they are going to go in this room.  There are people that know what they're doing.  They're people -- they're senior people that have been on homeland security, people from the areas that are impacted --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think they're going to deal?  We won't shut down the government again?</p><p>DINGELL:  I pray to God, we never shut down the government.  Not only do I pray to God that doesn't come out of conference but you're going to see Republicans and Democrats working together.  We'll get --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This whole wall issue, Congresswoman, sort of underscores what's going on I think in both parties.  Now you've got former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz seeing an opening as a result of the radicalness on both sides.</p><p>He's facing backlash on his first stop for his book tour last night.  It was his first public appearance after announcing a possible Independent presidential run.  It did not go smoothly.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire (EXPLETIVE DELETED).  Go back to (INAUDIBLE) on Twitter.  Go back to Davos with the other billionaire elites who think they know how to run the world.  That's not what the country needs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  You know, I give you a lot of credit just being in politics, by the way.</p><p>Schultz is also being criticized by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, billionaire.  He tweeted this, \"In 2020 the great likelihood is that an Independent would just split the anti-Trump vote and end up reelecting the President.  That's a risk.  I refused to run in 2016 and we can't afford it right now.</p><p>Congresswoman -- do you think an Independent run is viable?  Do you think an Independent run from Schultz would hurt the Democrats?</p><p>DINGELL:  I think it's viable.  He has the money to spend it.  But I think he would hurt the Democrats.  I'm fearful that I am -- I'm trying to step back.  I'm not getting any candidate I want to see who is going to emerge, who's got people skills.</p><p>But this is dangerous.  And as you know, told you two years ago, Donald Trump could become president.  Nobody believed me.  You all thought I was crazy.  You may not have but most people did.</p><p>And I still think he could get reelected.  And if we do not run a strong campaign and we don't have somebody like that that pulls votes off --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  One of the issues is the messaging of what the platform is.  So what do you think the Democratic candidate for 2020 should have as their platform?  What's most important?</p><p>DINGELL:  You know what we didn't do and one of the reasons I believe firmly that President Trump became President Trump.  One, people are tired of partisan bickering.  They're tired of seeing things not get done in Washington.</p><p>There are a lot of people that are hurting in this country, just working men and women who want to know that we actually care about them.  They're scared about healthcare.  They're scared about escalating drug costs.  There's -- look at our --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So healthcare should be the platform?</p><p>DINGELL:  it's one piece of it.  Infrastructure, let's create jobs.  What are we going to do about education?  Trade?</p><p>Now, the President -- you want to know why he won Michigan?  Trade.  They're tired of bad trade deals that ship jobs overseas.  We don't have a level playing field.  The President's trade policy is all over the place.</p><p>It's not consistent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you going to vote for the ratification of USMCA?</p><p>DINGELL:  I don't call it USMC.  I call it NAFTA 2.0.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you going to vote for ratification.</p><p>DINGELL:  I haven't decided yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is on your plate now in the next month.</p><p>DINGELL:  Very much on my plate.  And talk to Lighthizer about it all the time.  But I'm not voting for any bill that doesn't have and acting legislation that keeps more manufacturing from going to Mexico.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wasn't that one of the key things of this new law?</p><p>DINGELL:  But Blazer still went to --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Keeping jobs here.</p><p>DINGELL:  Blazers went to Mexico in July.  I'm not seeing any more American cars go to Mexico and get built for $1.50 to $3.50 and then gets shipped back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you want a change before you vote for it?</p><p>DINGELL:  He knows how I feel.  I'm not -- one of the more likely people to vote for it but I'm not voting for it in the form that it's in right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.   We'll leave it there.</p><p>Congresswoman -- it's good to see you.</p><p>DINGELL:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.  Congresswoman Debbie Dingell joining us here.</p><p>Coming up, the longest government shutdown in American history is over.  But another shutdown threat is on the horizon.  We will talk about the next three weeks, what it looks like with House Minority Leader, Kevin McCarthy.  He's up next.</p><p>Then you've got a friend again.  The new teaser trailer for \"Toy Story 4\" drops with a big surprise.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Tuesday, January 29th.  Your top stories right now at 7:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Earnings season in full swing this morning for the fourth quarter.  Several Dow components reporting their fourth quarter this morning.  Verizon reported a mixed quarter earlier this hour.  Pfizer and 3M also under pressure this morning as you can see.  3M up three percent, although Pfizer and Verizon down better than one percent.</p><p>Rising tensions with China continuing, the U.S. bringing charges against Chinese telecom company Huawei as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning between the two nations.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will be joining me as my special guest this morning at the top of the hour, 8:00 a.m. Eastern.  Join us for that talk on China and the economy as we break it all down with the Treasury secretary.</p><p>Markets this morning are hovering around the flat line.  Take a look.  Dow Industrials up 20 points right now, 26 higher.  The S&amp;P 500 is down by almost one point and the NASDAQ down about three points.</p><p>All this after the major indices finished lower yesterday across the board at 04:00 on Wall Street.  Dow industrials were down 208 points and then actually was off of the lows of the -- of the day, down almost one percent at the close.  S&amp;P 500 gave up 21 points, that was three-quarters of one percent.  And the NASDAQ was down 79 points, better than one percent lower.</p><p>In Europe this morning, a mixed story, actually mostly higher.  FT-100 at the high of the morning right here, up 1-1/4 percent, 83 points higher, ahead of the British vote on the U.K. leaving the E.U.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is up 42 points, almost one percent higher and the DAX Index in Germany higher by 25, quarter of a percent higher there.</p><p>Asian markets mostly quiet overnight.  Take a look, as you can see, it was pretty much across the board.</p><p>$100,000 penalty, how one misstep cost a professional golfer big time.  The outcry, coming up.</p><p>And Woody and Buzz Lightyear are back, the new teaser trailer for \"Toy Story 4\" is out and it marks the return of one character after 20 years.  We will bring it to you.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning.  But first, our top story this half an hour, shutdown showdown, the government open for business again after the last -- at least for the next three weeks, rather.  But the main issue, funding the wall has not been resolved and the White House is not letting it go.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  What I do know is that if they don't come back with a deal, that means Democrats get virtually nothing.  That will make the president and force him to have to take executive action that does not give Democrats the things that they want.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is the House Minority leader, Congressman Kevin McCarthy.  Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you.</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  Thanks for having me back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So, what do the next three weeks look like?  Take us through these negotiating.  Do you expect any money for the wall?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  I expect us to solve this problem in the end.  What's interesting here is the whole time speaker Pelosi said I couldn't negotiate anything until you open up government.  The president put the public first and said OK, let's go through, I'll give you three weeks.</p><p>Now Wednesday, we'll have the conference committee, the senators and the congressional members' appropriation sit down and we'll see if they're serious about it, if they're willing to do something.  Because I believe Nancy Pelosi is out of step with her own party.  If you look at her number two, Steny Hoyer.  He said of course, that walls are not immoral, and that he believes some fencing involved.  From her Agricultural secretary to her Agricultural chair to our Armed Services chair, they both believe in a wall too.  Her Agriculture chairman said give Trump the money.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and she continues to say that it's immoral which I find incredible given the fact she has a wall in her own state.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  As my state too.  You know what I find --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And your state too, exactly.  California.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  You know what I find immoral?  When you really talk about this, this is about stopping human trafficking.  In 2016, they stopped more than 2,000 individuals involved in that.  I think it's immoral that you would allow that to continue.  I don't believe anybody in America that says they support border security believes that there is no such thing as some barrier.</p><p>And the president said, he does not a -- he does not want a wall from sea to shining sea.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  He just believes in the area you need some form of barrier and he's correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, where do you think are the most important areas that you would need the wall?  I mean, we talked earlier about this wall in your state, Tijuana, San Diego where it's very dense, three million people on one side, three million people on the other.  Can you make the case that that dense area is elsewhere where that's why the president is so stuck on having this wall there?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  And it's not the president saying, it's the experts.  The president sat down with the experts and they said this is what we need to be able to secure our border.</p><p>So in certain areas, like in San Diego, we stopped illegal movement by more than 95 percent.  You look at Yuma, Arizons, El Paso another -- El Paso became one of the safest cities in the nation after being able to put it through.  That's what we need, in certain parts of the country along the border, you need a barrier.  In other parts you could put the drones in this part area.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what are you expecting to give on?  And what -- do you think they're going to offer the $5.7 billion that the president wants for border security?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  But we're arguing over one-tenth of one percent of the budget.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a great point.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  The Democrats have voted for a wall before.  But now that the president brings forward what the experts want, they say no.  That is what's so confusing to me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, what -- why is this so important for the president right now?  Going into 2020, I mean, is she seeing this as a campaign promise and that's why he doesn't -- she won't agree to it.  Because I don't know how she can call it immoral, given the wall in her own state, your own state.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Again, it's such a little price to pay for so much more security when you look at the human trafficking.  Think of the number of lives that we will save from this process if we have a secure border.</p><p>But what's more importantly, it's the president that sat down and tried to be reasonable, find common ground.  He's the one who brought DACA into it.</p><p>And let's not forget, speaker Pelosi just a year ago holds the record for the longest speech on the floor, eight hours, over one issue, DACA, which she shut the government down over.  And now she thinks that's not important?  I think those people are important as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think that this -- a negotiation, an agreement will include a DACA deal?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  It could.  It doesn't have to.  But because the Democrats and speaker Pelosi have been saying no.  The president said he was willing to go there, three more years of DACA for a portion of the border security that the experts are asking for.  I just find her out of step with her own party.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, there seems to be a movement within the party, even some of the newer congress people coming in, fresher faces saying you know what, yes, we do need border security and we do need the money.  So, are they going head to head?  I mean, are they -- do they even have a voice?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  They don't even have a voice.  Because remember, she has so much power.  She will not allow the vote to come up.  I believe inside the conference we could come up with an agreement.  The question is, will speaker Pelosi even allow that to be voted on the floor?  If we had a vote on the floor, I believe it would pass.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think that the president will allow the government to shut down again?  I mean, is the president really prepared to have another government shutdown if he doesn't get the money?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Look, I think the president's going to try to find a way to solve this one way or another.  I don't know that shutting the government down solves it.  I there's other ways to do that the president can.  I know he firmly believes in a legislative process.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Should he call for a national emergency?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  He has the power to do that.  I think the best road forward right now is a legislative agreement.  And what's so interesting to me, I'd listened to these Democrats celebrate Nancy Pelosi.  You celebrated someone that got you status quo.  They're still a DACA problem, they're still a border security problem.</p><p>And government is designed to find common ground and compromise.  The president was the one person looking reasonable in all these discussions.  I know the president's committed to this.  He will get the border secure one way or another.  He's giving the Democrats an opportunity.  He gave them an opportunity all along this discussion.  They said then open up the government, they'll discuss it.  So he did that and gave them a three week time.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean, I think this whole thing, the government shutdown and the constant resist upsets people.  I mean, you have to wonder if in fact -- you know, she keeps resisting everything that the president wants, if the people will turn on her.  Because people want to see you guys get something done.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Yes, she is celebrating status quo.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  That's not where we need to be --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me move on and ask you about 2010, congressman.  Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz thinking about running for office.  He was at a book signing last night in New York and he was heckled over his bid.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump.  You egotistical billionaire (INAUDIBLE).  Go back to getting ratioed on Twitter.  Go back to Davos with the other billionaire elites who think they know how to run the world.  That's not what the country needs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This heckler not the only one weighing in.  Michael Bloomberg former mayor of New York City also told Schultz not to run as an independent.  He said this, given the strong pull of partisanship and the realities of the electoral college system, there's no way an independent can win.  That is truer today than ever before.  Is that where we are, an independent can't win, congressman?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  No, I think it's Bloomberg upset.  Because remember, he went from a Republican to an independent to a Democrat and he just spent $120 million giving to the Democrats so they can win the majority in the House and he doesn't want his money to be wasted, so he doesn't want competition.</p><p>Look, I think there's ample opportunity for an independent to get in this race, only because the Democrats are now become social Democrats.  They're talking about a 70 percent tax rate.  They're talking about these green deals.  They're talking about socialism.  If you listen to what some of these new Democrats say, they think Venezuela's problem is not because they're a socialist country, it's because of sanctions.  They're so out of step.  They are putting letters in to help those who want to go sign up for ISIS, to be easy on them to the judge.  I mean, I have -- this is not the America we live in, and that's the difference.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  This party is so out of step and I think you'll find a lot of moderate Democrats who say I want somebody else who could talk about this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, that's why a number of moderate Democrats can't really get the OK from the party leadership because they're not left enough.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  This new socialist Democrat Party has left the Democratic Party.  They are in to -- remember, Bernie Sanders is not registered as a Democrat.  He's registered as a socialist.  AOC does not call herself a Democrat, she calls herself a Democrat socialist.  This party is moving to a whole different place.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Real quick before you go, when the election happened back in November.  You said one of your priorities going to be to get the majority back.  How are you going to do it?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Well, first of all, you've got to make sure you can recruit.  I think, you put the ideas up there.  Ideas should win at the end of the day.  You look at where we are financially in this country.  A lot of that happens to do with the policies that we're able to create, from the tax policy, the battle we had with you human trafficking and other that we were able to do.  I think you're going to find as going directly to, we've got to find a suburban areas to be able to win again in and I think we're going to be very successful.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, it's good to see you.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Congressman Kevin McCarthy, joining us there.</p><p>Still ahead, Richard Trumka AFL-CIO president on the impact of the shutdown on American workers, what he'd like to see, back in a moment with that.</p><p>And then, support on the links, a pro golfer given a big fine and a two-shot penalty which many are calling grossly unfair.

Cheryl Casone in New York with details and headlines, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It; must something else, Maria.  The federal government has now rested its case.  They called 56 witnesses.  The trial of the notorious Mexican drug kingpin started back in mid-November.  El Chapo told the trial judge yesterday he will not take the stand in his own defense.  One witness is scheduled to appear for the defense today.  Closing arguments expected to take place tomorrow and Thursday.  Big story, a lot of New Yorkers have been following very closely.</p><p>Well, professional golfer Haotong Li is getting a huge outpouring of support from fellow golfers after losing out on nearly $100,000 Saturday for a minor infraction.  It happened at the Omega Dubai Desert Classic.  Li was on the 18th green when judges accuses caddie of standing too close behind him as he got ready to putt.  Well, the ensuing penalty dropped Li's score from 71 to 73.  And he went from third to 12th.  Tour officials say the correct call was made but acknowledge it was grossly unfair.  They're looking at the giving referees more discretion in cases like this going forward.</p><p>And then, get ready for \"Toy Story 4\".  Pixar is putting out this teaser video, shows the revival of Woody's love interest, Bo Peep.  And she is back with a new, more modern look.  She was last seen in \"Toy Story 2\", back in 1999.

White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney saying that the 800,000 federal workers who were not paid twice during the partial government shutdown should receive those checks by the end of this week.</p><p>Joining us right now is American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organization's president, AFL-CIO, Richard Trumka.  It's great to see you, Richard.  Thank you so much for being here.</p><p>RICHARD TRUMKA, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR AND CONGRESS OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION:  Maria, thanks for having me on today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Give us your take on what the impact of the shutdown was.</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, I think there's several impacts.  There's impact on the people and you not only have government workers who get back pay but you have the government contractors who won't get back pay unless something is done.  That was a devastating effect on them.  It had a devastating effect on the economy itself.  $11 billion, although we'll pick some of that back up later in the year.</p><p>But you had a devastating effect on the airline industry where you had people, airline controllers, traffic controllers that were in school that actually just up and left.  They said we're not going to do this anymore (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What could -- what could have been done about it then, Rich?  Because you as the leader that you are and representing so many workers across the country have to be unnerved when you see open borders and illegals coming in and taking your jobs.</p><p>TRUMKA:  Look, that's just not how it works anymore.  I mean, you have people that got laid off from the president's place that have been here 20 years.  They're not taking anybody's job.  What we want to do is make sure every worker in this country has the same rights so that they can't be exploited.</p><p>Because what happens right now with undocumented workers is, they're great when no one's around.  When they try to organize and get a voice, then they start squeezing them.  They start ex -- you know, doing, calling in ICE and different things.</p><p>The idea is if everybody has the same rights, then they can't exploit those people and everybody can actually have a fair playing field.  What happens to American workers -- employers right now, is you have an employer that hires people, makes them work in unfair condition, misclassifies them, underpays them, and they're competing against our employer.  That employer needs to pay everybody the same rate, live by the same working conditions, so that we can all compete.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you're OK with illegals coming in and as long as everybody's treated the same?</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, Maria, it's a -- it's a nice cliche, illegals coming in.  But you know yourself that most people that are here undocumented or illegally came in legally.  So the whole system needs to be addressed.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, but there are apprehensions that we could look at, just in the month of December, just in the month of November, where apprehensions were of illegal immigrants coming in and wanting asylum in the United States.</p><p>TRUMKA:  There's no question that the system is broken.  We need to fix the system and have a path towards citizenship so that those workers that have been here for years and are actually making the economy run, even the president's golf courses and things like that, they have a chance to get citizenship and they work their work there.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Just a question on the golf courses.  As you know, that's the H2B program, people who come here as foreign workers, come under a specified amount of time for DOL.  I think the real question is is that, what happens to all the people, not who have been here who came legally and overstayed the visa, but what about all the people who come every day at the southern border and can cross into our country?  That's really the pernicious problem.  And even on wall, built with American workers, you'd be for that.</p><p>TRUMKA:  But listen, the people that come back and forth, you have Americans that go to Mexico and Mexicans that come to America to work.  I think Mexico --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you don't think there's a problem at the border at all?</p><p>TRUMKA:  I didn't say that.  There is -- there is a problem.  We do need border security.  And no, I don't think that a wall's the answer to it.  Every time someone's tried to build a wall it's not been very successful.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, the one in Tijuana is successful.</p><p>TRUMKA:  Ask the Chinese, ask the French.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The wall -- the wall in Tijuana --</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Ask Tijuana (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tijuana and San Diego, what abut that Richard?</p><p>TRUMKA:  I'm sorry?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The wall, between Tijuana -- separating Tijuana from San Diego, is that successful?</p><p>TRUMKA:  There are places -- there are places probably where it works.  Is that the answer to everything?  No.  Should that have been the reason for a shutdown?  Absolutely not.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  I want -- I want to ask a broader political question.  We've seen in the last two elections that increasingly voters, blue collar voters, voters in manufacturing towns all over America, the kind of rank and file people that you represent are voting for Republicans, they're going for Trump.  Does the AFL-CIO need to realign its own approach to politics in this town, given that more and more of its people are going with people like Donald Trump and his trade policies and the Republican Party?</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, that's a -- that's a question we could talk about two or three hours for.  First of all, we have realigned our politics.  We are issuing -- we're issue oriented right now.  We put an issue out and if a politician supports that issue, then we support them.</p><p>In fact, in this last election we elected two union members to the Senate, three to governorship, 18 to the House of Representative, and 925 to state legislatures, because those workers will go and support our issues.  That's what we try to do.  We find it more and more difficult to find Republicans that actually support us.  Now, the American worker believes that neither the political system --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got to jump.</p><p>TRUMKA:  -- or the economic system works for them.  They want somebody to change the rules.  That's why they voted for Trump.  If he changes the rules to their advantage, some of them will vote for him again.  If he doesn't, he stands a chance of losing those workers and right now he's losing those workers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Richard, thank you so much for joining us.  We appreciate it.  Richard Trumka there.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Show: MORNINGS WITH MARIA][Date: January 29, 2019][Time: 08:00:00][Tran: 012903cb.231][Type: SHOW][Head: Apple Disables Group FaceTime Function That Was Allowing Callers To Listen And View Without Your Consent; British Parliament To Vote On Brexit Amendments; Kudlow on the Economy; Craft Brewers Impacts from the Government Shutdown; Kudlow on China Trade][Sect: News; Domestic][Byline: Maria Bartiromo, Gerri Willis, Ashley Webster, Hillary Vaughn, Dagen McDowell][Guest: Steven Mnuchin, Larry Kudlow, Matt Schlapp, Jon Hilsenrath][Spec: FaceTime; Huawei; Apple; Brexit; Federal Reserve; 3M; Harley-Davidson; Verizon; Oath Media; Channel Inventory; World War II; CBO; Trade Talks; Deregulations; Tax Plan; China Trade; Slowdown; Government Shutdown]</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good Tuesday morning.  Welcome back, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  Live from Washington this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is January 29th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  Earnings in focus.  Investors watching results from several Dow components this morning ahead of the opening bell.  One to watch after the bell tonight -- after the close is Apple.</p><p>Meanwhile, Apple under fire FaceTime hit with a new bug that allows people to eavesdrop on you without your knowledge and even if you don't take the call.  Rising tensions with China, the U.S. brings charges against Chinese telecom company, Huawei as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  The very latest on the state of negotiations with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin coming up.</p><p>Markets are searching for direction this morning.  Take a look at the futures ahead of the open this morning.  Dow industrials picking up speed up 55 points right now, a quarter of a percent higher.  S&amp;P 500 is up two and the NASDAQ right now right now showing a gain of 11 points at the open in about an hour and a half.  This after declines across the board yesterday.  Stocks finished off of the lows, but nonetheless the Dow Industrials gave up 209 points yesterday 4:00, almost one percent lower.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 gave up 21 points, three quarters of a percent lower.  And the NASDAQ was down 79 points.  That was better than one percent lower yesterday.  Global markets this morning are mostly higher.  Take a look at European indices with the FT-100-is at the high of the morning, up 86 points, 1-1/4 percent ahead of the vote on Brexit.  CAC quarante in Paris us up 44 points and the DAX index up 21, fractional gain there.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets were little changed.  Take a look, it was pretty much across the board.  Now, our top story this morning, concerns of a global slowdown.  Last week in Davos I spoke with Bridgewater Associates founder, Ray Dalio, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, and Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey.  Here's what they said about the possibility of an economic slowdown on the horizon.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RAY DALIO, FOUNDER, BRIDGEWATER ASSOCIATES:  Europe has a negative growth and the United States is going to have a negative growth environment.  I don't mean absolute negative, I mean slowing of growth in a material way that could be close to between zero and two percent over the next 18 months.</p><p>BRIAN MOYNIHAN, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, BANK OF AMERICA:  We have the top research firm in the world, and they have done a great job.  And they have the U.S. growing at 2-1/2 percent this year.  The world growing 3-1/2 percent GDP growth.  But that's down from last year.  And so the confusion in the environment right now is a slowdown or is it going in to a recession?</p><p>Nothing we see says it's close to a recession.</p><p>JAMES QUINCEY, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, COCA-COLA:  I think we are in danger of talking ourselves into a problem.  It's just a little bit slower growth.  It's not a recession or a decline.  So we see -- we see a little -- a little softer 2019, maybe a little less tail wind than 2018.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now in a Fox Business exclusive is the treasury secretary of the United States, Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  Great to see you, Secretary.</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, UNITED STATES TREASURY SECRETARY:  Great to see you as well, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.  Your reaction to really what seems like now a unanimous feeling that a slowdown is on the horizon.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, Maria, from everything we see, the U.S. economy is still quite strong.  The companies are doing quite well.  And we see still tremendous investment in capital and human investments.  There's no question that as it relates to Europe and China, there is a slowdown.  We're monitoring that carefully.  But we still see a tremendous opportunity and a lot of capital coming into the U.S.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Federal Reserve basically told us they are on pause.  They may even pause the balance sheet unwind which is also telling us that the Fed is also expecting a slowdown, but do you believe a recession is on the horizon in 2020 even though you're seeing strength and stability so far?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  We see no indications whatsoever of a recession on the horizon.  And from everything we see from speaking to a large across the board businesses, the combination of tax reform, regulatory relief and trade is still has a very strong impact on the U.S. economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And some people are saying that the impact of certainly of trade and tariffs is causing some uncertainty.  So how much of this slowdown that we're expecting later on even if it's not right now is due to what you say you're watching China and Europe and how much of it is uncertainty around the President's tariffs program?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, Maria, as you said, there are people who expect a slowdown but I would just comment a year ago with the projections were 2-1/2 percent.  And we were at three.  We feel very comfortable we're going to hit three for last year.  And we think there's still a very good case for three percent this year.  Now, as it relates to trade, we couldn't be more pleased with the USMCA.  We are looking forward to Congress passing that quickly.</p><p>That's a very important trade deal.  We have two days of talks with China starting tomorrow.  The President is going to be involved in those talks at the conclusion.  We've been updating him.  We have another 30 days after this.  So I think we're making significant progress, and I think on the trade front, these are all very positive impacts for the U.S. economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about the trade talks because this story of China, first off, thank you to the President and to the administration for pushing back on China because that's another unanimous feeling out there, that the President did the right thing in terms of stopping China from some of its practices.  What are you expecting out of these talks?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, the President wants fair trade with China.  It's got to be reciprocal.  Right now China has free access into our markets, and we have limited access to there.  So the critical issue that we've talked about is market access, making sure there aren't forced joint ventures, not forced transfer of technology and that we have a mechanism that when we reach an agreement that we can monitor that agreement and that they'll live up to it.</p><p>And that's how I expect we will make significant progress this week on those issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How much of a priority is espionage?  Obviously the administration unveiling a sweeping set of criminal charges against Huawei Technologies.  We have had on a number of CEOs that have said yes, they have stolen trade secrets from us.  Has this come into the conversation with your Chinese leadership?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  No, let me be clear.  Those are separate issues.  And that's a separate dialogue.  So as it relates to the Huawei issues that's being run by the Justice Department.  I have no involvement in that.  I found out about that yesterday when it was announced.  So those are not part of trade discussions.  Forced technology issues are part of trade discussions but any issues as it relates to violation of U.S. law or U.S. sanctions are going through a separate track, which is the Justice Department.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, I guess the broader issue is, is this a cultural thing in China?  I mean this weekend on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" over on Fox News I spoke with the ranking member of the Intel Committee, House Intel Committee Devin Nunes and he went through some of the practices that China does every day.  Listen to this.  I've got to get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  China might have accessed allied intelligence shared with Poland and passed it on to Moscow.</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R), CALIFORNIA:  What the Chinese are doing is that they have these companies that are essentially owned by the party, the Communist Party and essentially this is a dictatorship.  There's very few people that own these companies.  They weaponize the.  So when all over the -- all over the world you have Chinese technology specifically as it relates to infrastructure on -- communications infrastructure, they will go in and they beat every other company around the world.</p><p>And in fact, they've driven a lot of companies out of business because they come in undercut.  They want to have control over all the com systems or communication systems all over the globe.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's pretty incredible.  We will handle your infrastructure of telecom and then they have a way in of spying.  How can you separate that from the conversation on trade and on forced transfer of technology?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Maria, I think you can easily separate these issues.  So there are two different issues.  One is an issue of state subsidies where they do subsidize state enterprises and they compete unfairly.  Those are trade issues, those are violations of the WTO and that's something from an economic standpoint.  We are going to enforce very seriously.  I think you know among the National Security Council, so I'm going to be careful what I say on national security issues.</p><p>But I assure you whether it's China or anywhere else in the world, our security services, DHS and others will make sure that we protect the U.S. infrastructure, we protect from cyberattacks.  That's something we're very well aware of.  But these are separate issues and shouldn't be confused.  We are focused on what are unfair economic practices.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So the best case that you can get from China is what?  Opening up their markets?  Already we are seeing some likelihood of that, UBS I guess was the first bank that was allowed to operate in China and own 51 percent of that bank.  They say they're going to go to 100 percent in three years.  Are you seeing a significant opening in terms of the Chinese willingness to open their markets to foreigners?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I do, but I think that's a good start.  But why should we have to wait three years for a U.S. company to own 100 percent in the financial services?  China can operate and own 100 percent of companies here.  So that's an example where, you know, they're moving in the right direction.  We want to speed that up.  But the issue is really we want to make sure that U.S. companies can compete fairly in China.</p><p>And if we can do that, China has a very large growing middle class.  It's an enormous market.  As I have said before, this is one of the biggest opportunities for U.S. companies in U.S. business if we can get this right.  And President Trump is determined.  This is the first administration that has aggressively said to China, you need to play fair.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is the President willing to drop all tariffs, should he get a good deal that's acceptable?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I think everything is on the table.  So the President is -- will look at, again, the objective is to have a very fair deal.  Hopefully we'll make progress this week.  The President will be involved in these negotiations and discussions.  And we've still got a lot of work to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the President said look, I'm a tariff guy.  I like tariffs.  So does that mean these tariffs are for, you know, no end in sight or would he be willing to drop the tariffs all together?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  The President hasn't made any decisions on that.  There have been no recommendations from the economic team on that yet.  The first step is to make sure we get a good agreement.  And when we get a good agreement, we'll make a recommendation to the President and he will consider that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have seen the Chinese economy get impacted.  You're still talking about 6.4 percent growth, we think, but that is lower than some people think.  What's your worry or how concerning is it that the Chinese slowdown will impact the United States?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, there's no question that China is slowing down.  They still have significant growth rates.  We're beginning to see the impact on that on world growth.  Our objective is not to slow down China.  Our objective is to make sure that U.S. companies can do business in China and can do business fairly.  So we're monitoring these issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary, stay with us.  We want to get into the shutdown and get your impact on how much the shutdown cost the economy and what you're expecting there.  Stay with us.  More of my exclusive interview with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin when we come right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are life live this morning in Washington, D.C.  And I'm sitting right now with -- in a Fox Business exclusive with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  And Treasury Mnuchin, we were talking about the broad economy.  I want to ask your thoughts on the shutdown.  The CBO says that the shutdown caused $11 billion impact to the economy, $3 billion which is completely lost because of the 35-day shutdown.  Your reaction?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Maria, Kevin Hassett, the CEA is working on final numbers for us.  I think his view is that there's no question that there was some cost but those costs will be recovered as money comes back into the system.  I think it's -- he views that it will almost all be recovered.  Now as it relates to the exact numbers, I haven't seen the final numbers yet.  But the good news is we got the government open.</p><p>People are back to work and we have not seen any significant impact on the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Has -- is the President prepared to shut down the government again in three weeks if he doesn't get the money for the border wall?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Maria, I had dinner last night with the President, the Vice President, Senator Lindsey Graham.  We had a very good discussion on this issue.  There's no question in my mind that the President, the Vice President want to do a fair deal.  Lindsey has been terrific in helping to negotiate this.  I hope the Democrats are sincere.  If they are, there's a sincere deal that will include a lot of different issues that need to be resolved.</p><p>But if they're not sincere, the President has all his options on the table.  And he's determined that he's going to make sure we have border security.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's the impact on the IRS?  There's a lot of worry out there that people are not going to get their checks after April 15th as a result of this shutdown.  What can we expect?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, let me just comment on both the treasury, our bureaus, the IRS in particular, I want to thank the enormous number of government employees who came in and worked during the shutdown.  I think as you know, we had the ability to bring in critical employees.  We never would have been able to do the sanctions that we've been doing over the last month without the hardworking people.</p><p>And the IRS had a large number of critical employees to make sure that we were ready to open for business as usual.  So we're ready to open for tax season.  We're taking tax returns.  We'll be ready for tax refunds.  We will have the phones restaffed.  Now, let me just say that there's no question, this time of the year, there's very, very heavy call volume.  That's something we have to manage.  I encourage taxpayers who have questions to try to go to the web first.</p><p>But we are ready for tax season, and I can assure you that tax refunds will be paid as normal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  So, tax refunds will be paid as normal.  That's the bottom line.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  People were worried about that.  Let me move to the sanctions and in particular Venezuela because you've applied sanctions on the Venezuelan oil industry.  Tell us specifically what the impact here is.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, sanctions are a very important tool in our national security portfolio.  And when we look at national security issues, we look at economic tools.  We look at diplomacy.  We look at national security tools, military options.  So there's no question that what we're trying to do is to cut off the money to the regime that should not be in power and make sure that the President Guaido has access to funds and has access to the assets of the country.</p><p>And to make sure we protect these assets for the people of Venezuela.  It's really quite sad.  This is a country that is very, very rich in oil resources that has had extraordinary poverty and extraordinary humanitarian issues over the last issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And have you spoken with the opposition leader party about this?  What has been the response so far?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I haven't personally, but I know the Vice President has been in communication.  I think the response has been very positive.  We've been very careful in balancing this.  We've -- I've spoken to many of the refineries over the last week.  I want to make sure that there was significant capacity.  There's a lot of oil on the water already in transit to the U.S. refineries.  So I think on the one hand, we've been able to cut off Venezuelan oil going forward.</p><p>But we're managing this with the U.S. refineries.  We've issued licenses for the U.S. refineries to continue to operate.  And if Venezuela wants to continue to sell us oil, which we would like to buy that money would go into blocked accounts and will be protected for the people of Venezuela.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what about other industries in Venezuela?  I mean, the sanctions are on the oil industry.  What about other money, other imports that they still get that?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  We will always look at additional sanctions.  We want to make sure that things like medicine and other humanitarian issues continue to go to the people.  We will always look at additional sanctions to make sure we protect the assets of the country for the people of Venezuela.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why was it important for the President to back the opposition leader?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I think he is the rightful leader of the country, the national assembly, the constitution.  I think, you know, democracy is very important to the people of the United States.  And we want to make sure that there are free and fair elections and that there is a proper democracy that's very important to the national security of the United States.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary, it's good to have you on the program.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you very much.  Secretary Steven Mnuchin joining us.  Coming up, earnings in focus.  Major companies reporting this week including Apple after the bell tonight.  What you need to know ahead of those numbers.  Then the U.K. facing a crucial test.  British lawmakers voting later today on measures surrounding the U.K.'s potential exit from the European Union.  Back in a moment with that.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Earnings driving markets this morning.  3M, Harley-Davidson, Verizon out with mixed reports this morning.  Gerri Willis is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange watching markets.  Gerri?</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  That's right.  3M, Dow component, a split decision here missing on estimates beating on revenue.  The EPS line $2.27 a share.  Revenue 7.95 billion.  They lowered their 2019 guidance.  But they say they're positioned for success in 2019 despite the global slowdown.  Stock trading higher.  Harley-Davidson, let's get to that, a big miss on both the top and the bottom line.</p><p>EPS of 17 cents a share.  Revenue of 955 million.  The stock is down and down hard this morning nearly 10 percent.  They're citing restructuring charges, incremental tariffs and recall costs.  Big troubles for the hog.  Verizon beating on EPs but missing on revenue.  We're seeing yet another split decision here.  EPS of a $1.12 a share.  Revenue of 34.3 billion.  The stock trading down nearly four percent here.</p><p>Profit hurt by the restructuring of Oath Media business as we have discussed.  Apple coming after the bell, this is critical earnings release for the markets here.  EPS estimate of $4.17 a share.  Revenue of 84 billion.  We will be focused like a laser on iPhone.  iPhone sales in China, is there an iPhone recession going on in China right now?  Watch Channel Inventory for some of the details about that.</p><p>Meanwhile, Apple having trouble with FaceTime.  A bug where callers can eavesdrop on FaceTime calls has cropped up.  The company says they are checking it.  But you should know that Tim Cook on Monday, well, he was saying big things about International Data Privacy Day asking users to insist on reforms.  Oops, I guess they got a problem.  Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Gerri.  Thanks very much.  Gerri Willis on Wall Street.  British lawmakers will debate several amendments to the U.K.'s planned exit from the European Union today and let Prime Minister Theresa May know what parliament is prepared to vote for.  Ashley Webster is live in London right now with that.  Ashley?</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.  Good morning, Maria.  This is if Parliament knows exactly what it will vote for.  There will be at least 15 amendments to choose from -- will be debated.  That will be up to the Common Speaker John Bercow.  He will decide which ones will be debated.  And it could indeed shape the future of what Brexit will look like moving forward.</p><p>Now, among the most popular amendments that we are expecting to be the debated will be what's called the Cooper amendment, that's Yvette Cooper, the Labour M.P.  It basically says if no deal is reached by February the 26th, it would postpone Brexit for nine months essentially to end of the year from march 29th, that's the date that exists now.  Then there's the Brady amendment, the Graham Brady (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>He basically is putting forward an amendment that would replace the Irish backstop with what is called alternative arrangements, such pretty vague, basically anything elsewhere and what we have now and there is no time limit on that backstop.  We have heard that Prime Minister Theresa May has already told European leaders that she wants to reopen Brexit negotiations.  Let's not forget, just last month, in December, the Prime Minister said it wasn't going to be reopened that the E.U had given her their best deal.</p><p>Now she wants to turn around and say look, you need to reopen negotiations.  I'm going to find out from Parliament what they are prepared to vote for and let's go from there.  And it calls today is January 29th.  The Brexit deadline, March 29th.  We have exactly two months left to go, Maria.  And let's be honest, there is no sign yet of a -- of a deal in place that a majority of people in Parliament can get behind.</p><p>Yesterday we had a whole series of warnings about what would happen if there was a no deal scenario.  Just crashing out retail consortiums saying, look, there's going to be empty shelves, prices are going to go up, a break in the supply chain.  It will be very, very detrimental to the British economy.  So that is the background.  Later on today, we'll find out what Parliament can get behind.  Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Ashley.  Thanks so much.  We'll check back with you.  Ashley Webster in London this morning.  Coming up.  The shutdown impact on your wallet.  I will be speaking with National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow on the economic effects of the shutdown.  Plus Federal debt reportedly headed to the highest level since World War II.</p><p>That is next.  One brewery feeling the impact.  The shutdown hitting one San Diego beer company.  We've got that story.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thank so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo coming to you live this morning from Washington, D.C.  It is Tuesday, January 29th.  Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Earnings season in full swing.  We have heard from Harley-Davidson, hit in the pre-markets after disappointing numbers.  Xerox as well headed higher after beating expectations.  Look at Harley-Davidson's shares down almost 10 percent right now.  China, one of the issues, once again.  Meanwhile rising tensions with China on the U.S. level.  The U.S. bringing charges against Chinese telecom company, Huawei, as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  Moments ago, I spoke with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin who talked about what the U.S. is looking for in the coming talks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MNUCHIN:  The President wants fair trade with China.  It's got to be reciprocal.  Right now, China has free access into our markets and we have limited access to there.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Futures this morning are higher.  Take a look, we have the highs of the morning right here with the Dow Jones Industrial average up 73 points, a third of a percent.  The S&amp;P 500 up 4-1/2, and the NASDAQ higher by 18 points, one-quarter of one percent.  European indices this morning are also higher.  Take a look.  FT-100 in London is up almost 100 points, 1-1/2 percent.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is up 55, better than one percent.  And the DAX Index in Germany up 37 points, that's one-third of one percent.  Asian markets mostly flat overnight as you'll see that was pretty much across the board with Japan and Korea squeaking out a fractional gain.</p><p>Our top story this half an hour, the cost of the government shutdown.  The CBO says about $3 billion out of 2019's projected GDP was completely lost due to the shutdown.  Joining me right now in a FOX Business exclusive is National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow.  Larry, it's great to see you this morning.</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for being here.  So obviously 35 days, government shutdown, CBO says $3 billion is lost.  Never coming back.  Your reaction.</p><p>KUDLOW:  With respect, once again, we disagree with the CBO.  I don't think we're going to lose anything.  This is completely temporary.  None of the incentives in the economy have been changed by this.  You know, that's the key point.  President Trump lowered marginal tax rates on individuals and most especially businesses.  And then he had this massive sweeping rollback of costly and burden regulations, which freed up the whole economy, including the energy sector, which has turned out to be a boom.  Why would we lose something just because of a temporary issue regarding the government?  Now, I'm always interested in sort of counting angels on the head of a pin.  We have about a $20 trillion economy, fair?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  There -- what was their number, three billion out of 20 trillion?  Do you know what the --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Three billion.  Yes, no, you're right.  You're right.</p><p>KUDLOW:  - percentage that is?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I totally understand.</p><p>KUDLOW:  I don't understand why we even mess with it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Actually, they're saying the total impact was $8-11 billion.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But that will come back, except for the $3 billion they say that is completely lost.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, again, with all due respect to the professionals at the CBO, I disagree.  Again, because the incentives in the economy -- here's the big difference between I guess the administration and the Congressional Budget Office and a lot of other forecasters.  We believe the economy is growing at three percent plus.  By the way, the Commerce Department for 2018 has scored I believe 3.1 percent.  We'll get the rest of those numbers in a week or two.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KUDLOW:  The CBO does not.  They never have.  They've never given us credit for the incentive effect of lowering taxes and regulations.  Supply side incentives are kicking in.  If you look at the whole panoply all of the economic data, whether it's very strong Christmas retail sales, whether it's industrial production, manufacturing, the best since the '80s, whether it's business equipment, which means the capex boom is happening that we always hoped for.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KUDLOW:  You'll see in my judgment, at least, the three percent trend line will continue.  CBO and many others have us at two.  But this goes back before the President.  This goes back way before.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  They don't believe the economy can grow.  They don't give any credit --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, even somebody like a Steve Schwarzman will say 4.2 percent growth in the second quarter is very hard to sustain on a $20 trillion economy.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, I'll keep working on Steve Schwarzman.  He's a good guy.  But in a $20 trillion economy, which again will grow rapidly, I see no reason why we can't continue three percent plus.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That's the whole point.  The idea that was sold to everybody I guess going back several years, maybe going back 10 or 15 years, that we're in some secular stagnation is just plain wrong.  With the right set of policies, to unleash --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- American animal spirit --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we saw that with the tax plan and the deregulation.  I totally get that.</p><p>KUDLOW:  And you look at the --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But what about tariffs and trade, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  The -- just one --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because the CBO'S report also brings that up.</p><p>KUDLOW:  One last one on this, the face of the new Trump economy -- I just want to put this in here, it's the thought I've had for quite a while.  These are men and women running small businesses.  These are blue-collar workers.  You look at the evidence, the employment for blue-collar workers, the best increase since the mid to late '80s, when I was a Reagan Cub Scout here in Washington, D.C.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  The wage rates of blue-collar manufacturing autos, they're rising faster than white-collar workers.  This is a direct result --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- of the incentives we've put into the economy.  CBO, again, it's not personal to my friends at the CBO, they don't give us any credit for these incentives.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No, I understand that.  But the --</p><p>KUDLOW:  And I want to stay with that story.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- the report on the trade policies estimated that new tariffs on imports and exports will cut an average of one-tenth of a percent from economic growth through 2029.  What's your take on that, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because we know that these tariffs are in place.  They still are impacting business and uncertainties.  So, is the President prepared to do away with all tariffs if he gets that agreement from the other side?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, I don't want to go there.  I mean, that's going to be his decision as you know.  Vice Premier Liu He is coming and we will have high level discussions Wednesday and Thursday and we're all looking forward to that, as is the President.  The President, as I read him, moderately optimistic about this trade story.  So, that's good.  What was it, one-tenth of one percent by 2029?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  So then here we are in 2019, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, no.  One-tenth of a percent from economic growth through 2029.</p><p>KUDLOW:  See, this is too hard, Maria.  It's way too hard --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- to figure that stuff out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you don't think there's going to be any -- there's --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Could it be possible that there's no impact from the shutdown?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Yes, quite possible.  I never -- it's utterly totally temporary.  So, that's -- let me --- look, let me go back -- the growth potential from China trade, people tend to look at this as a negative.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Look, I don't know the outcome of these talks.  Here's what I know, the scope of the discussion will be the broadest and deepest in the history of U.S.-China trade.  Literally everything's on the table.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Point number one.  Point number two, if China opens its markets --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is a big deal.</p><p>KUDLOW:  OK?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it looks like there's (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>KUDLOW:  Which is huge.  You know, I don't want to predict, and as Ambassador Lighthizer said a million times, and I agree, the enforcement mechanisms are going to be crucial.  But if they were to open their markets as we have requested regarding tariffs and non-tariffs, if they would let American companies own the subsidiary in China, so there's no forced transfer of the family jewels of technology, if we have --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But it --</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- some rule of law regarding I.P. theft, here's my point, open markets will allow the United States to export like crazy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But I understand that, Larry.</p><p>KUDLOW:  And that has been hand -- we've been handcuffed.  If we do that, if we do that, not only will the United States grow faster --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- because of that, China will grow faster.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That all sounds great, but can you actually do that, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Competition is the solution.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's the point, because if you're saying, \"OK, China, we are agreeing that you are opening your markets, and as a result, we will meet your demands, but then they say okay, but you have to have a communist, a government leader on the board of any company that has 100 percent.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Which is -- which is extraordinary, you're absolutely right.  It's extraordinary.  And it's --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So I mean -- so you could say it's great --</p><p>KUDLOW:  And unacceptable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- that you're going to open markets.</p><p>KUDLOW:  It's unacceptable.  It's unacceptable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But they -- aren't they saying that a communist has to be on the board of any company that has 100 percent?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I think that's been the past and I think that's going to be a very hot topic in these trade talks because that is completely unacceptable to us.  No question about it.  We will see how this turns out.  China, unfortunately, you know, they're in a slump.  China's economy is slumping very bad.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  I think part of that slump is a function of the President's tough negotiating with tariffs, when necessary, OK, part of that slump is in the last five to ten years.  China has moved in the wrong direction, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  The market-based reforms have been moving in their own direction.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But they're not market-based.  They are communists and they want communists on the board of -- So I'm just wondering, all of this sounds great, if you can actually get it done.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Oh, I know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Larry, stay with us.  We want to talk to you about other things because the tax plan and the deregulations have worked.  But there are some other ideas coming into play ahead of 2020.</p><p>KUDLOW:  China should not use the Venezuelan form of the economic policy.  We need to go back to who is it that said free market capitalism is the best path to prosperity?  It was the (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, that would -- that would be you and Ronald Reagan.  Stay with us.  We will be right back.  More with Larry Kudlow.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Thank you.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We come to you live this morning from Washington, D.C. and I am sitting with National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow, in an exclusive interview this morning.  And we were talking about China and what you can get done.  How important is tomorrow and Thursday in terms of meeting a deadline, that March 1st, in terms of a deal on the table?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I think's very important.  Look, I --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think you'll get a deal by March 1?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I don't want to predict.  It's just too hard to predict.  And, of course, these are decisions that will be made by the President, who is his own best negotiator.  Best I can is, as I said, the scope of this thing's going to as wide and broad as anything we have ever seen.  That does not ensure positive negotiator.  Best I can is, as I said, the scope of this thing is going to be as wide and broad as anything we've ever seen.  That does not ensure positive outcomes --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- right?  I think everybody, including the President, is basically moderately optimistic about this, OK?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Wait, let me ask you, your tax plan --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Ultimately -- one other thought which the President believes that he and President Xi will probably be the ultimate negotiators.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  OK?  And the work being done tomorrow and Thursday is vitally important to lay out options, OK?  But --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So the President will be involved in these talks tomorrow and Thursday?</p><p>KUDLOW:  That is what he has been saying in our meetings.  And I hope so because he's a great negotiator.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me move on to the tax plan.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because we're hearing a lot of ideas in terms of taxes now, now with a lot of 2020 hopefuls.  The Tax and Jobs Act obviously did move the needle on economic growth along with the deregulation out of this administration.  Now you've got Elizabeth Warren talking about two to three percent tax on the very high wealth people.  So if you have $50 million in wealth, you'll get two percent tax.  If you've got a billion dollars in assets, you'll get taxed three percent.  And you've got Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez talking about tax of 70 percent tax --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- on the highest earners.  What is your take on this?  Give us your reaction and what kind of an impact those policies might have.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Right.  These are prosperity killers, these are growth killers, these are job killers, these are incentive killers.  This is a return to some heavy government planning essentially direct to the economy.  You know, I hate to dwell on this because it's a crisis right now, but take a look at Venezuela, just for the heck of it.  What (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There was a time when that was vibrant -- it was a vibrate country.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That is correct.  That is correct.  And investment was flocking to it.  Then they took, down through the years, really exact measures you're describing that are coming from some of these Democratic candidates --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- and the economy was destroyed.  I mean I hear this notion we have to have equality, equality of income, equality of results, which I think runs counter to all human nature.  You know what?  A place like Venezuela has equality.  Everybody's poor.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think they'll be able to reverse the tax cuts then?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Everybody's poor in Venezuela, except for a hand -- Maduro and a handful of this top military people.  Is that what we want in America?  We are growing right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So will the Dems be able to reverse your tax cut plans?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Never.  Never, not until the President's configuration.  I -- look, first of all, if they want to try to raise taxes, it will be defeated in the Senate, Republican.  I personally believe even if it went beyond that --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- the President would veto any efforts to turn back his program.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How important --</p><p>KUDLOW:  We're doing what people said we couldn't do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But how important is debt?</p><p>KUDLOW:  They said we couldn't grow at three, four percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But how important is debt, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  We're growing at three, four percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Let's not mess with it.  If it ain't broke, don't fix it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Congressional Budget --</p><p>KUDLOW:  There's a tremendous surge in prosperity here shared by the middle and lower middle income people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Congressional Budget Office is saying that the deficit is hit -- set to hit $897 billion this year.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That would be the highest level since World War II.  When does debt become a priority?  Do you think the President, let's say he does have another term, will try to attack the entitlements?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, look, I think right now the two issues are maintaining economic growth.  You know, growth is the single biggest factor in these budget calculations.  Growth brings income and revenues.  And in fact I haven't gone through it with a fine-toothed comb yet, but I will.  I think I see that the CBO is acknowledging that our faster growth, which they did not predict, is now paying for over 80 percent of the tax cuts.  OK?  And I think you'll see more about that as we get through.  The reports just came out yesterday.</p><p>Second point I want to make is we will have a tough spending budget coming up in a few weeks, a very tough spending budget with reductions of at least five percent across the board, in non-defense accounts.  So I think that's going to be very important.  Let's minimize government where possible.  Let's grow the economy to its max.  And you will see the debt burden, which I thought debt, as a share of GDP, will be coming down, and by the way, it already is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  OK.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That's what happened during the Reagan years.  That's what happened during the John F. Kennedy years.  So, I wrote about it in my book.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That -- that's the best way to measure that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But, Larry, you know what I don't understand?  I mean you're all about growth, you have been for all your entire career.  Why are so many people worried about the slowdown?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why are we hearing some people say a recession is on the horizon?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, there's just -- it's funny in this town and I guess a little bit in New York, this is a lot of pessimism.  I don't --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you expect a recession this year or 2020?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I do not.  I don't see it right now.  If I look at financial indicators, credit spreads, the actual numbers, you know, it's just -- we -- GDP will come out a week late because the Commerce Department has reopened.  We've seen stuff like falling unemployment claims, rising manufacturing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But what are the markets telling us, Larry?  In the month of December, there was no high-yield debt issuance at all.  Credit markets are still tight.</p><p>KUDLOW:  They've come back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They've come back a bit.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Come back.  I like that.  Profits, the mother's milk of stocks, I don't know who first that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You did.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Profits, the mother's milk of stocks are rising.  The early indications are they won't to 25 percent but they're going to rise 10, to 15 percent.  I like that a lot.  Interest rates, the level of rates, are historically low.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you're not worried about market volatility?</p><p>KUDLOW:  There's a million things to worry about when I get up in the morning, you know, mainly getting here on time so I could do this great interview.  But I just want to say, if you look at the sum total of all the evidence right now, there's no recession out there.  I am the happy warrior.  I am an optimist.  President Trump is an optimist.  I think America, right now, we are the hottest economy in the world and we should remain so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll end it there.  Larry Kudlow.  Good to see you, sir.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow.  Back in a moment.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The government shutdown may be over, but the effects are still being felt.  Hillary Vaughn is live this morning at a craft brewery in Escondido, California where the shutdown effects are actually still lingering.  Hillary.</p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Hi, Maria.  Good morning.  Craft beer is a $76.2 billion industry, and for many craft breweries, like Stone Brewery, where we are today, the effects of the government shutdown are not over.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOMINIC ENGELS, CEO, STONE BREWING:  When the industry craft is built on seasonal beers, it's built on new beers, it's the new sexy thing, and if we can't get the new sexy thing to market, then we're not going to connect with our fans.  They're going to be disappointed.  We're going to make the sales numbers we planned to make in our financial plans, and these things will have repercussions.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUGHN:  As Federal workers at the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau are finally back in the office, a mountain of paperwork is waiting, about 11,000 applications for alcohol labels have been backlogged leaving craft breweries waiting to ship and sell all their new beer across state line, which means they're in limbo until these approvals go through.  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Hillary.  Thanks very much.  We've be watching that.  Hillary Vaughn.  Stay with us.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  President Trump is tweeting this morning.  He's talking about a former staffer.  Here's what he just said.  \"A low level staffer that I hardly knew named Cliff Sims wrote yet another boring book based on made up stories in fiction.  He pretended to be an insider when, in fact, he was nothing more than a gofer.  He signed a non-disclosure agreement.  He is a mess.  Dagen McDowell, great to see you this morning thank you so much.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  John Hilsenrath, Matt Schlapp.  I don't know why the President tweets this.  He's got how many million view, you know, users and followers.  He just let everybody know who this guy is like --</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, THE AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Well, he literally sat in a -- he sat in a cubicle outside my wife's office in the West Wing, and so it is kind of amazing like this insider whole kind of mythology is something the President knows is not true.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  But he's got some extra sales thanks to that tweet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  That's what I'm saying.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think, Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  Again, everybody's got a book to write.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jim Comey, this guy.  Hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Oh, that was a good answer.  Hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, Jim Comey's book, yes, well, there's -- I think that will be a story that we're going to continue following, Jim Comey and the FBI.  You know what.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Everybody wants to be Norma Desmond, Maria.  I'm ready for my close up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  Thanks, everybody.  Great panel today.

Good morning, everyone, I'm Maria Bartiromo, thanks for joining us live this morning from Washington.  It is Tuesday, January 29th, your top stories right now 6:00 a.m. on the east coast.  Earnings in focus this morning, investors are watching results from several Dow components ahead of the open this morning.  The one to watch after the close is Apple.  We've got everything you need to know this morning previewing the report.  Apple under fire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile, FaceTime hit with a new bug that lets people eavesdrop on you without your knowledge.  How you can fix it, coming up -- big story.  Rising tensions with China meanwhile, the U.S. bringing charges against Huawei as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  The very latest on state of negotiations with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin this morning.  That interview at 8:00 a.m. Eastern, join us for that.  PG&amp;E makes it official, California's largest utility filed to bankruptcy protection, following the massive wild fires.  We've got all the details, coming up.</p><p>Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz roasted.  The billionaire hackled at an event last night as he gears up toward a possible independent run for the White House.  We've got a big show this morning coming from D.C., U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is here, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow is here along with House Minority, California Congressman Kevin McCarthy.  Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell will join me, along with AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka.  Don't miss a moment of it.  We've got a big three hours, coming up.</p><p>And we turn now -- right now, we kick it off with Wall Street markets.  We're looking to see a rebound this morning.  Take a look at Futures actually have just turned negative once again.  Futures down just fractionally, about 6 points on the Dow Industrials; 1-1/2 points lower on the S&amp;P; and the NASDAQ down 13 points.  This, after stocks finished lower yesterday on China growth fears along with weak guidance from Nvidia and Caterpillar.  We told you -- the Caterpillar numbers right here.  And of course, it did worsen throughout the day as investors react to a weaker-than-expected earnings and guidance.</p><p>Joining me right now is Federated Investors Chief Equity Market Strategist, Phil Orlando.  And Phil, it's good to see you this morning.</p><p>PHIL ORLANDO, CHIEF EQUITY MARKET STRATEGIST, FEDERATED INVESTORS:  Thanks for having me back, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All indications that we are seeing a slowdown and worries around China, among other issues, how do you see the markets here as more earnings have come into play?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, you had this 20 percent waterfall decline in stock prices in the fourth quarter of last year, we thought the market was attempting to price in the prospect of recession this year.  Multiples contracted from 18 times earnings down to 14 times earnings.  In our view, there's no risk of recession this year.  So, the rally that we've seen over the last month, 14 percent rally, the market is starting to price in the fact that maybe we're not going to have a recession.  But we've had a 14 percent rally in a month.  That's very, very powerful.  We would absolutely expect some consolidation here over the next month or two particularly as we've got these critical sign posts coming up in the month of March, but as we look out over the balance of the year, we do think that multiples will return to that 18 level, and we're going to end up with a pretty good year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  To what do you attribute the slowdown?  We've got earnings in focus and we're looking at a number of companies out that give weaker-than-expected guidance or miss on the top line.  Lockheed Martin, Pfizer, and Verizon are reporting this morning.  Apple is, of course, out after the bell, so when you look at the earnings picture, where in terms of industry are you seeing the most slowdown?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, I think in a word, uncertainty is what's impacting earnings and guidance to some degree.  You've got the Fed flip-flops that we saw in the fourth quarter last year, the uncertainty about whether or not the United States and China are going to be able to consummate this trade deal.  You've got Brexit overhanging on the global market and certainly the government shutdown, which was up there for 35 days, and it was just temporarily resolved last Friday.  You've got a number of issues there, all of which are impacting companies in some way, shape or form.  So, with earnings up 25 percent year-over-year in the first three quarters of last year, this fourth quarter is a little softer, I think we're up about 13 percent.  So far, we're about a quarter of the way through the earnings season.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>ORLANDO:  And I think what companies are pointing to are some combination of those four issues that I just mentioned.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you mentioned the shutdown.  The shutdown apparently costing the economy $11 billion according to new analysis from the Congressional Budget Office, although Larry Kudlow is disputing that number, and he's going to join us this morning live to talk about it.  The report says that it hit $3 billion, that's one-tenth of a percent of economic activity in the fourth quarter alone.  So, are there sectors that were -- that were hit hardest in that regard, or do you want to look at those companies that are largely tied to the China trade as one area of the real weakness?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the council of economic advisers under Trump had advised us that the shutdown was going to take about one-tenth of one percent out of GDP per week.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, remember, the shutdown started right around Christmas, so that makes sense that we lost, you know, a tenth of a percent in the fourth quarter, you know, maybe a half a percent here in the first quarter.  We're at 1.7 percent GDP growth in the first quarter, consensus blue chip is around 22, 23.  So, we think this pretext a little high and there will be, you know, sort of a downward revision as we get later in the quarter.  But in terms of industries, I think it's really across the board.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Across the board.</p><p>ORLANDO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about technology because it's big week for tech, Apple, of course, the big story today, reporting after the close tonight -- the only big tech reporting.  Microsoft, Facebook out tomorrow, Amazon is out on Thursday.  This is the week that we'll focus on technology and that's where really the growth stories have been.  Would you want to put new money to work in any of these names ahead of their earnings?</p><p>ORLANDO:  Short answer is probably no.  Again, you've had this 14 percent rally here in the last month, you've got concerns about slowing economic growth both in the U.S. and China.  We think that those issues will be resolved as we get into the back half of the year, but right now, you know, why run the risk of putting new money to work after you've had a big rally in some of these names ahead of what could be a disappointing earnings number or perhaps conservative guidance.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, the stock has come down because people were worried about it.  So, we'll see what the numbers are.  Would you, at some point, go back in to tech?  What's your favorite group right now, Phil?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, the areas that we like best in the U.S. markets are energy, financial services, industrials, and health care.  In terms of looking overseas, emerging markets look very attractive to us.  So, the areas that have really gotten hit the most are the ones that we've been attracted to.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there.  So, the valuations are better, I guess, is what you're saying.</p><p>ORLANDO:  The valuations are much more attractive.  We think the fundamentals are still very strong.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Phil, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>ORLANDO:  Great to see you.  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Phil Orlando joining us there.  Meanwhile, a bug in Apple's FaceTime app lets users listen in someone's phone without even the person knowing.  Dagen McDowell, what's happening this morning?  Good morning to you, Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well, Apple has some explaining to do, but particularly on this earnings call this afternoon.  So, there's a bug in the Apple iPhone that would allow people to eavesdrop on FaceTime users' calls.  A FaceTime user calling another person could listen in while the recipients phone is still ringing even if the person never accepts the call.  This was -- it involves several steps in the Group FaceTime feature on the iPhone.</p><p>Apple has disabled that Group FaceTime while it tries to come up with a fix for this, but you can eavesdrop in on somebody, essentially listening through the microphone, even if a person never takes that call, you could eavesdrop on rooms with unattended devices and even receive unauthorized video from the phone.  And again, it would take several steps to do this, but this is coming from a company, Maria, that loves to brag about its privacy protections and even throws shade at the likes of Facebook and other technology companies.</p><p>And adding embarrassment to embarrassment, yesterday was International Data Privacy Day and Tim Cook was tweeting about that.  Here's what he said on Twitter yesterday before this bug, this eavesdropping bug was disclosed.  We must keep fighting for the kind of world we want to live in.  On this Data Privacy Day, let us all insist on action and reform for vital privacy protections.  The dangers are real and the consequences are too important.  Big whoops for Apple, and of course, everything that happens in the business world is a political opportunity.  The Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo had to weigh in on this as well, putting out a statement late yesterday, say, \"Urging FaceTime users to temporarily disable the app.  So, Apple beat him to it, they're trying to fix it.  Embarrassment nonetheless.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible because you don't even know -- I mean, the phone could be ringing and you don't even know that they're listening.  I mean, that's the worst part of it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  I can explain later as the show goes on how this work, but you'd have to place a FaceTime call, go to the group, add yourself to the call and then the recipient of the call would have to hit maybe one like the on-button on the phone in order to activate it, but it was possible, and it was all over the internet yesterday how to do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, if -- so, if it's -- if it's not on and you say -- and you do -- and you decline the phone call, they can't listen in?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Unless you -- but you can't touch the phone at all.  Like, it's not even declining the phone.  Like, if you hit the up -- the up volume button on the phone, and so if I was playing this trick on you, it would activate it, and they could essentially hear what was going on in the room.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Unbelievable.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  I want to hear more about that, for sure.  Meanwhile, there's this, as expected, PG&amp;E filed for bankruptcy protection following those devastating wildfires in California.  Cheryl Casone on that in headlines right now.  Cheryl, good morning to you.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  Well, PG&amp;E is facing roughly about 30 billion in potential liabilities, as investigators are looking into whether the company's equipment played a role in starting California's deadliest fire.  More than 100 people died following a series of wildfires that burned hundreds of thousands of acres over a two-year period.  The utility providing energy service to 60 million people, we should add.  Taking a look at shares of PG&amp;E, look at that, in the premarket down nearly nine percent.  And those loses have actually paired back in the last hour or so, folks.</p><p>Well, China's Vice Premier has arrived in Washington for high-level trade talks that are going to start tomorrow.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and trade representative Robert Lighthizer will attend the two-day meeting.  Yesterday, the Trump administration announced a pair of indictments against Chinese telecom giant, Huawei.  The U.S. is accusing the company of trying to steal trade secrets from T-Mobile.  The Justice Department also charging Huawei with conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran.</p><p>And the China story continues, folks, shares of Nvidia are lower this morning.  The chipmaker is warning investors, and expects much weaker sales thanks in part, yes, to China's slowing economy.  It also previously cautioned the sales of its graphics processors that are used in video games PCs would be disappointing.  The China effect continues.  Chips for video gaming account for more than half of their business, they lost half their market value since hitting their peak back on October 1st, Maria.  So, Goldman Sachs had to come out last Friday, Maria, warning that a lot of these chip companies that have massive exposure to China are going to have really rough reports.  Micron Technology, even Wynn Resorts, the casino company, has got big China exposure, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, for sure.  All right, Cheryl, thanks so much.  Coming up next, five police officers are injured this morning, four of them shot while serving a search warrant.  The very latest coming up.  And then a venti-size disaster for Howard Schultz last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire (BLEEP).</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Former Starbucks CEO having a rough time exploring a 2020 Presidential run as he gets heckled.  We break it down right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Live from Washington, we are eyeing 2020, former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz facing backlash last night on his first stop of his book tour.  It was his first public appearance after announcing a possible Independent Presidential run.  It did not begin smoothly.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire (BLEEP).  Go back to getting ratio'd on Twitter.  Go back to Davos with the other billionaire elite who think they know how to run the world.  That's not what democracy needs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, my goodness.  Schultz is also facing backlash from former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.  Here's what he tweeted: \"In 2020, the great likelihood is that an Independent would just split the anti-Trump vote and end up re-electing the President.  That's a risk I refused to run in 2016, and we can't afford to run it now.\"</p><p>Here with me this morning to talk more about all of that is Dagen McDowell back in New York, Wall Street Journal Global Economics Editor Jon Hilsenrath here in D.C. with me, along with the American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp.  Gentlemen, it's good to see you.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Welcome to Washington.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, thank you so much.  And welcome to presidential politics, Howard Schultz.  What do you think about that?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Well, I'm going to get some popcorn.  This could be a real interesting Democratic primary, and whatever this Independent thing is, don't you love Michael Bloomberg who has probably spent a million dollars on polling, trying to figure out every way to become the President.  Publicly chastising Schultz for running as an Independent when that's exactly what Bloomberg would just love to do if he could.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  You know, on the one hand, Dagen, I feel like there is an opening for an Independent because there's such extremes and radical conversation going on certainly on the left.  And on the other hand, I don't know, how much is a cup of coffee at Starbucks?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Again, that $18.00 cup of Joe, I'm joking, I'm exaggerating.  It's helping --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think it's like $6.00.  I mean, seriously.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, we love cart coffee around this place.  But again, that's helping fund this run.  But Michael Bloomberg -- you know what, Michael Bloomberg should run for the Democratic nomination if he thinks he can win, it's just hilarious to have this multibillionaire lecturing Howard Schultz about an Independent run when actually a cup of Starbucks coffee has more charisma than Michael Bloomberg, number one.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Number two, it's going to be really interesting to see the narrative in the spring of 1992 with Ross Perot was -- Ross Perot was going to divide the Democratic vote, that it wouldn't hurt the Republican.  This could very well -- I mean, it depends on who -- what Howard Schultz says on the campaign trail and how far-left the Democrats go when they're running for the nomination.  But I'll say this, what he said so far about pay -- how to pay for Medicare For All and how that's impossible, I would be really interested to hear him talk about how to fix the health care system, because he might come to the table with some really interesting ideas and force the Democrats to answer the hard questions about paying for this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that is the thing, I mean, this party unfortunately, it's very hard for someone who's a centrist to actually have a shot.  You had Tim Ryan from Ohio, he wanted to do it, he's an economic thinker, he doesn't have a shot because of the same thing, you've got the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's 70 percent tax rate, the loudest voice in the room.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I mean, there's no question that these primaries are starting out very much from the left, you know, you have talk about a wealth tax, and 70 percent high-income tax threshold.  You have Elizabeth Warren who is going around beating up on the banks.  This is definitely a left-leaning primary season that we're going to be going into.  What I find so fascinating is the journeys that these different billionaires are traveling.  You know, you had President Trump who supported a lot of Democrats as a businessman in New York City traveling over to Republican Party, now you have Michael Bloomberg who started out as a Republican Mayor --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- traveling over to the Democratic Party, and Howard Schultz doesn't know where to go.  He doesn't know where he fits in.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He doesn't know where -- and what about Senator Kamala Harris?  Let's listen to her, because she held a CNN Townhall meeting in Iowa last night.  Harris is vowing to eliminate private health insurance with Medicare For All if elected president.  What's your take, Matt?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Making insurance companies illegal.  Look, the Democratic Party has become quite radicalized.  Think about this, less choices for the patient is the solution to our problems.  That seems insane.  Also, do we really think the government, when you get your tags to drive your car, or when you pay your taxes at the IRS, do you really think all the solutions to our problems are there?  I don't.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Let me ask you this, who does President Trump want to see come out of this whole --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think he wants Howard Schultz to run.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think -- he was taunting him yesterday.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH:  No, besides Howard Schultz, among the Democrats, who does he -- who does he want to (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>SCHLAPP:  I think most Republicans -- I'm not going to speak for the President -- but I think most Republicans believe that Elizabeth Warren is so far out there on the loony left, basically Marxism, socialism that I think they find that a delicious opportunity.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Can I --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- call the confiscation, Dagen.  He called it (INAUDIBLE) I mean, this two or three percent tax on assets, confiscation.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It is wealth confiscation.  It's totally communist and then to try and find people when they hand in their U.S. citizenship when other countries come calling, wanting you move there because they won't come and take your hard-earned money.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  One thing I want to point out that Jon Hilsenrath said that Howard Schultz doesn't know where to go.  President Trump should be worried about a Howard Schultz, because what if he comes to the table, like I said, with ideas that appeal to voters in this country who feel left out.  Who left out from the Republican Party and certainly left out by the left-leaning Democrats in this environment.  So, be very, very careful.  And one other thing I'll add with Howard Schultz at that -- at that bookstore, that's just the New York City welcome wagon.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's the way they treat all tourists in this city.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, I think you make a good point because there is that path.  That path of centrism.  I mean, that path of the center, because people do feel like it's gone wacky all the way on the left, for sure.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  It's a centrist country, but don't forget Hillary.  She's making noises.  Maybe that's the President's favorite opponent.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH:  We haven't seen any --</p><p>SCHLAPP:  She's making noises.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  We haven't seen anyone travel that centrist path as an Independent to presidency.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  So, it was a smart move on Howard Schultz's part.  We'll see.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Or a risky one for all those billions --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, certainly risky.  Take a quick break.  Extreme weather warning meanwhile on the other side of this break, millions of people across the country are gearing up for an Arctic blast as temperatures are plummeting, that's next.</p><p>Then showing their cards, British Prime Minister Theresa May asking Parliament to put up its plans from Britain's exit from the E.U.  Details on the historic debate.  And the vote happening later today, back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  It is cold out, and the deep freeze is setting in, hitting millions of Americans with subzero and dangerous temperatures.  Fox News Senior Meteorologist Janice Dean in the Fox Weather Center right now with the very latest.  Janice, tell us about it.</p><p>JANICE DEAN, FOX NEWS SENIOR METEOROLOGIST:  Hi, Maria, yes, we could be dealing with historic lows.  These are current windchills, what it feels like when you go outside and you are not protected.  Dangerous, potentially life-threatening windchills of -41 in International Falls, -18 in Chicago, but we still have another blast behind this.  So, these are morning lows, these are not windchill temperatures: Chicago -25 on Thursday, -31 in Minneapolis, -16 in Detroit.  Again, those are not windchill values.  Those are actual air temperatures.  But with the windchill, in some cases, we could get windchill values of -40 to -50.  If you go outside, your skin is going to freeze in minutes.</p><p>So, here's Chicago, Illinois.  Your all-time record low is -28.  So, we're going to flirt with historic lows, Maria.  This is a big deal.  The good news is it won't be long lasting.  By the weekend, we'll start to rebound, but I also want to make mention with this arctic cold front as we have snow across the deep south.  Snow that could cripple travel across portions of Atlanta, Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, and towards the southeast, so that's another dangerous part of the storm is the -- not only extreme cold but the snow as far as south as the gulf coast.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Janice.  Wow, what a story, thank you so much.</p><p>DEAN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will be watching.  Janice Dean.  Coming up next, the State of the Union is back on, it is February 5th.  Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi extending an invitation to the President, he accepted the offer.  Then, we're taking a look at the enormous cost of the shutdown.  What is the real number?  Plus, place your bets, Super Bowl fans getting ready to throw down an enormous amount of cash.  So, bet on the big game Sunday.  We break down all the numbers.  Stay with us.  Live from Washington this morning.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us.  We are coming to you live from Washington this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, January 29th, your top stories right now 6:31 on the east coast right now.  Earnings season is in full swing, a lot of big names reporting their fourth quarter today.  Xerox and Pfizer set to report in just a few moments, we'll bring you the numbers as soon as they hit the tape, and tell you how they are impacting markets.  Rising tensions with China, the U.S. is bringing charges against Huawei, as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will be my special guest, in about 90 minutes time.  We will break it all down with the Treasury Secretary, coming up.  So, stay with us.</p><p>Meanwhile, Futures relatively flat this morning, take a look at markets, down 20 points on the Dow Industrials, down 4 points on the S&amp;P, down 18 points on the NASDAQ.  We are expecting some pressure at the start of trading this morning, after all the major indices finished lower, yesterday, on Wall Street.</p><p>In fact, at 4:00, the Dow Industrials gave up 208 points, that was almost 1 percent lower, the S&amp;P 500 down 21, that was three quarters of a percent lower, and the NASDAQ with a 79-point decline yesterday, at the close, down better than 1 percent.</p><p>Investors are watching some big news this week, J.P. Morgan, calling this week the most important week of the first quarter, and here is why, you've got earnings, you've got the British vote, you've got U.S.-China trade talks, you've got a Federal Reserve decision, we're not expecting a Fed hike.</p><p>We've got fourth quarter GDP coming out.  And, of course, at the end of the week, the job's report for the month of January, a big week, investors want to watch it and will be covering it all.</p><p>European indices this morning look like this, in terms of trading.  We are looking at gains in Europe.  The FT-100 up one and a quarter percent, 86 points higher, the CAC Quarante in Paris is up a half a percent, 26 points higher, and the DAX Index in Germany, higher by a fraction, as you can see there.</p><p>Asian markets overnight, flat, take a look.  No real moves there, because mover was the KOSPI Index in Korea, up a quarter of a percent.</p><p>Well, there is tragedy in Houston to report, five police officers injured.  Four of them shot, while serving a search warrant.  We have the very latest, coming up.</p><p>And a debate in parliament, British lawmakers set to vote on the latest plan for the U.K. to leave the European Union.  We are previewing that and we will take a look at the impact across the world.</p><p>We've got a big program this morning from D.C., U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is coming up this morning, along National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow, they will take a look at all of these expectations that the economy is slowing.</p><p>Plus, House Minority Leader and California Congressman, Kevin McCarthy, is with us, along with Michigan Congresswoman, Debbie Dingell.  Plus, AFL CIO, President Richard Trumpa, here as well, big show, don't miss a moment of it, big three hours, coming up. And we are kicking off this half an hour right now, with this top story, feeling the effects of the shutdown, Washington, D.C. back in business for now, President Trump will give his State of the Union of Address on February 5th, Tuesday.  The address was originally supposed to be today.</p><p>Even though the shutdown is over, the U.S. is still feeling effects, new numbers from the Congressional Budget Office to report.  The U.S. GDP will be $3 billion lower during the fourth quarter of 2018, because of this shutdown.  On the immigration front, backlogs of immigration courts grew by at least 10 percent, according to Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about all of that is Americans for Tax Reform President, Grover Norquist, Grover, good to see you.</p><p>GROVER NORQUIST, PRESIDENT, AMERICANS FOR TAX REFORM:  Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So, the CBO is talking about a $3 billion-dollar hit, in fact, as a result of the shutdown, Larry Kudlow is having an issue with this.  He says, frequently disagrees with the CBO anyway.  What's your take in terms of what the shutdown cost the economy?</p><p>NORQUIST:  Look, the key thing is that the economy continues to grow and we're looking at a three percent rate of growth for the year, so $3 billion is a big number, unless you compare it to the GDP of the United States in the fourth quarter.</p><p>So, actually, we're doing fairly well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You don't think it had much of an impact then, Grover?</p><p>NORQUIST:  No, it's a small impact and we have a tremendous growth for the year, which is way beyond what the CBO said was possible, when they scored this.  The CBO needs to spend a little more time going back to explain why they were so wrong on all of their recent predictions, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  Go ahead.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Grover, the Federal Reserve and most of the economist that we surveyed at the Wall Street Journal are saying that the economy is slowing down in 2019.  We had a nice burst in 2018 in part, because of tax cuts and in part, because there's more spending, $300 billion of additional spending.</p><p>But now, they say the economy is slowing along with the global economy, what does that say about the impact of these tax cuts, are the tax cuts really created the long-run growth that Republicans said was going to happen?</p><p>NORQUIST:  The tax cuts do two things.  We were at 35 percent rate, which is the highest in the world.  It made sense for an American company like Burger King to be bought by Canadian company, because even though they're selling the same hamburgers, the same number of employees, it was worth more, because we had a worldwide tax system at 35 percent.</p><p>By taking 35 down to 21, we became competitive with Europe.  I mean, our friends, the Germans were at 25, the Japanese were at 25.  I'm sorry, the Japanese were at 30.  The Chinese were at 25.  And we were at 35.  We weren't even close to being competitive.  It's a huge change in the direction for the country.</p><p>And if the CBO tells you they're pessimistic, they didn't think you could do three percent, they laughed at three percent growth, said you could never do more than --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  The question is, is that three percent growth.  I think a lot of people understand that the corporate tax rate was uncompetitive, even some Democrats wanted to lower their corporate tax rate, but the question is, this new tax code that we've got, is that sufficient to sustain the three percent growth in 2019?</p><p>NORQUIST:  It's a good first start.  We also need to do something about the workforce.  We need more workers and frankly, there's more tax reduction that needs to be done and spending restraint is very important at the end of the day.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  I want to go back to this question about a shutdown, Grover, which is, people are saying, they're almost using the reason why you couldn't cut government, because somehow, that would have a negative impact on our economic growth.  That seems like a very dangerous road to go down.</p><p>Isn't it true that all of this money that they are saying didn't get put into the economy, are you worried that the government actually won't spend all of that by the time that the authority over the money, expires?</p><p>NORQUIST:  For the government to -- I was taught this (INAUDIBLE) economics in college also.  The government takes your money, and then spends it.  It's much better for the economy than if it lets you spend it.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Right.</p><p>NORQUIST:  Because you would waste some of it by investing it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because they can spend money better than you, of course.</p><p>NORQUIST:  And that's the oddest thing because, of course, that's nonsense.  East Germany should have done very well, under this theory, but it doesn't, so --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  What the government is doing is borrowing other people's money and spending it, right?  I mean, we're talking about deficits that are nearing a trillion dollars.</p><p>NORQUIST:  The (INAUDIBLE) cost the government is how much the government spends, whether they borrowed or take it, it's still gone from the -- from the real economy.  The cost of government is total government spending.  We should have taxes low, and then the least destructive way possible, all taxes are somewhat destructive.  And you have less borrowing if you have less spending.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what about all of these new plans?  And by the way, we are getting earnings right now, as we're talking 3M and Xerox, both beat expectations, although 3M is cutting its forecast for the year.  What about all of these ideas about taxing the wealthy?  New York Congressman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez claims for a 70 percent marginal tax rate on the tippy top, as she calls it.</p><p>Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts senator, hopeful, for 2020, two percent tax on Americans whose assets exceed 50 million.  If you're a billionaire, three percent, what's the impact?</p><p>NORQUIST:  OK, magicians like to do this, so you're not looking at, you know -- watch my right hand, don't look at the left hand.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NORQUIST:  The reason they talk about high tax rates on rich people, is that they want to gouge the middle class.  The difference between the United States and Sweden, Finland, Denmark, the countries that Cortez talked about is, they don't have the 70 percent rate, just back up for sec -- there isn't a country in the world with a 70 percent income tax rate.</p><p>Many countries used to, the Beatle song, 19 for me, one for you, 95 percent tax rate, and then the Beatles moved to United States, and everybody who could pay tennis, left Sweden.  And all the countries of the world realize that tax rates that high were stupid and destructive and didn't help equality or growth or anything like that.</p><p>So, they got rid of them.  The whole world got rid of them.  We did it, it was stupid.  We back offed it and had strong economic growth as a result, so 70 percent stupid and destructive.  It's not America saying, the world says that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You probably showed the op-ed today, in the Journal, in California, and taxes as well.  The Journal, this week, by Cypress founder, T.J. Rodgers, which was very good, Another California Tax Grab, he writes.  In it, the politicians have fueled an affordability crisis that drives away businesses and exacerbates homelessness.</p><p>California Governor, Gavin Newsom, called for even higher taxes in his inauguration speech earlier this month.</p><p>NORQUIST:  California is a good example of 70 percent play.  They have a 13 percent rate on people making a million dollars, but they have 8 percent rate on people making $42,000.  So, they want the middle class people in California to think you're OK, because we're really screwing the other guy.</p><p>And point of fact, Florida has a zero percent first income tax, Texas has a zero percent first income tax, 8 percent looks good compared to 13.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NORQUIST:  Looks lousy compared to zero percent.  They want the middle class to think somebody else is paying the freight.  That's why they have those phoney high tax rates that don't raise much money.  It's to fool the middle class.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it is talking point, and it works for the populist.  Let me bring in Dagen McDowell on this, because we hear this every time we go into the tax discussion and we have a Democrat on which takes out another one of those talking points on taxes, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And I want to say that Senator Kamala Harris said that the first thing -- she said it last night, in the town hall, he first thing she do is to cut taxes for the middle class.  Well, roughly half this country pays no net federal income tax, number one, and the Republicans just did that particularly, doubling the standard deduction.</p><p>So, I don't know who she's going to cut taxes for.  But this is the ruse and this is the big liberal lie that all of these big new welfare state initiatives, whether it's green energy, even single payer, it's all going to be paid for by the super rich.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And that it's not going to be -- that the paying won't be spread across every person in this country to fund this welfare state.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And by the way, the numbers don't add up even if you tax all the rich, you're not going to get the amount of money you need for this green deal, Grover.</p><p>NORQUIST:  You don't even balance the budget if you do that, never mind half money for new things.  Look, the big difference between United States and Denmark, United States and Sweden, it's not how much money higher income people pay, it's what happens to middle-income people.</p><p>Denmark, Finland, Sweden, the tax rate on middle income people is 10, 15, 20 points higher than an American middle class person.  And, you add to that the value added tax.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NORQUIST:  The difference between United States and Europe is how heavily taxed middle income people are, and they have those (INAUDIBLE) high rates that very few people pay, to make people in the middle class think that they are getting a deal.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Speaking of middle income tax -- a lot of Democrats want a carbon tax, gasoline tax and even some big American business.  That's the way to address the issue of climate change.  Do you see any path towards a carbon tax that would be acceptable to your point --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I guess, but real quick, Grover.</p><p>NORQUIST:  No.  No, absolutely not.  And the reason is, you can look at Washington State, very deep blue Washington State.  They have twice had it on the ballot and twice defeated a carbon dioxide tax, gasoline taxes lose overwhelmingly.  This is too obvious tax on middle-income people.  It's a loser up.  They are having this fight in -- our dear friends in France or loggerhead down the subject.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We know how that played out.</p><p>NORQUIST:  We had the Ontario government and the Alberta government collapsed as a result of this, and three times, in Australia.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Grover, thank you.  Yes.</p><p>NORQUIST:  Bad politics and lousy economics.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Grover, thank you for the facts, we appreciate it, Grover Norquist, joining us there.</p><p>Five officers injured in a shooting in Texas, meanwhile, Cheryl Casone in New York, with the details, there.  Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  That's right, Maria.  Four officers were shot and another officer suffered a knee injury in Houston.  They were serving a search warrant at a suspected drug house.  Police say two of them were hit in the neck.  Those officers are in critical but stable condition.  Two suspects were killed at the scene.</p><p>Well, a key E.U. negotiator, warning the risk of Britain leaving the European Union without a deal, is very high, as parliament votes on amendments in Theresa May's exit plan today.  Lawmakers set to consider more than 10 different amendments before taking votes.  That's going to be at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>And those votes come after May's plan to leave the European Union was overwhelmingly rejected earlier this month, a lot of those votes against her from her own party.</p><p>Well, Americans will be betting an estimated $6 billion on the Super Bowl, that's according to the survey by the American Gaming Association.  About 22.7 million U.S. adults plan to place a bet on the upcoming Atlanta game, of those bets, 94.47 percent, reportedly illegal, but let the games begin, Maria, and those are your headlines.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Be there to watch it all, front-row seat.</p><p>CASONE:  I'm there for you, Maria.  I've got surprises for you, coming up.  You're going to love them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK, looking forward to it.  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, crisis in Venezuela to take a look at, new sanctions have been placed on the country's oil.  Plus, National Security Advisor, John Bolton, may have inadvertently revealed the administration's next move.  Why his notes are raising eyebrows this morning.</p><p>Then, farming in America, why farmers are being forced to rent water.  That's up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A look at some of the big headlines across America this morning.  The Chicago Tribune reporting on the Pension Agency criticizing Sears Chairman Eddie Lampert's plan to acquire the bankrupt retailer.  The article explaining that the agency sets to takeover Sears.  Pensions objects to the bid, calling it the final fulfillment of a year-long's scheme to deprive Sears and its creditors of assets and its employees of jobs while lining Lampert's on owns pockets.</p><p>The Daily Camera in Colorado, reporting on how Boulder County farmers are increasingly renting water.  The report explains how ownership from agricultural interests has dropped from 85 percent in the late 1950s to just 30 percent.  The water increasingly moving to municipal control.</p><p>And the Mercury News writing that how in one California city you can text 911 for emergency help.  According to the paper, the police department there announced that the service is now available in the city.  It is meant to help people who are hearing or voice impaired.  The police are also recommending that you not send emojis.  Well, yes, I would think not.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  What are we coming to?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  My God, but it is good that you can text 911.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  That's a good step, just don't text person emoji.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, crisis in Venezuela new sanctions placed on the country's oil, plus National Security Advisor John Bolton may have inadvertently revealed the administration's next move, why his notes on his legal pad are raising eyebrows this morning?  We're breaking that down when we come right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A framework for peace.  The U.S. and Taliban negotiators making a preliminary on key issues to end the war in Afghanistan -- the longest war in American history.  The two top points American troop withdrawal and insurgence vowing to end terrorist attacks abroad, that's according to the Wall Street Journal.  Many hurdles remain to ensure the peace is in place.  Joining me right now is Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst, General Jack Keane.  General, it's always a pleasure to see you.</p><p>GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST:  Good to see you, Maria, and welcome to Washington again.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  And what do you think about this?  I mean, are we supposed to be trusting the Taliban?</p><p>KEANE:  No, we can never ever trust the Taliban, that doesn't mean that we can't have a treaty with them.  But here's what I think is going on, a couple of things have changed: one is the Taliban in the last couple of years have gone all out as we have so dramatically reduced our forces, thinking that they will going to be able to overthrow the regime, because the only thing the United States is really doing is training and assisting the ground forces -- no longer doing the fighting, however provide an air power.  That didn't work.  They retook some territory but never took capitals or provinces and they never took -- they never able to secure a province.  So, what has happened?  The war stalemated.  The Taliban cannot take over the government and the government cannot defeat Taliban, even with our assistance.</p><p>Second thing, and this is crucial, Pakistan has gotten involved in this in a way they've never have before.  They forced the Taliban to go to the peace negotiation table, why?  Pakistan knows it's no longer in national interest to keep this thing stalemated.  There's growing al-Qaeda and growing ISIS presence in Afghanistan which gives the Pakistanis some concern.  So, those are the new things that are happening.  That's why the negotiations have some momentum.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's the thing, though.  I mean, so many people were worried when the president said: we were withdrawing the troops.  And where do you stand on that now?  I mean, do you feel better about it given this peace deal?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, let me answer it this way -- I mean, it is an essential question: the Taliban themselves, we are trying to get an agreement with them that, one, they'll stop trying to overthrow the government and number two, they'll power share with them and also, they will assist in taking down the al-Qaeda and the ISIS.  I don't think we can trust them to do that, based on the fact that they provided safe haven for Osama bin Laden for almost 10 years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  So, what do we do?</p><p>KEANE:  So, we leave in place, after we bring out the troops that are providing the training and assistance.  We leave in place a counterterrorism force and an intelligence capability indefinitely.  We're doing that in Yemen, we're doing it in Libya and we're doing it in Africa.  The one in Africa is off the coast.  It's a Maritime Joint Task Force.  That is what we need to do, that is the guaranty against the Taliban because the issue in Afghanistan has always been, we would never intervene in the civil war in Afghanistan between the northern alliance and Taliban for one reason only, we didn't evade, because they attacked the United States.  That's the reason we're there.  We don't want that to happen again and we cannot trust the Taliban to provide that guarantee for us.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, let me move on and ask you about sanctions on the Venezuelan oil industry.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin who will be here shortly this morning along with Security Adviser John Bolton, explain the decision in a briefing yesterday and issued warning for disputed President Nicolas Maduro.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN BOLTON, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR:  The president has made it very clear on this -- on this matter that all options are on the table.</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY:  There's no reason why these resources shouldn't be used for the economic benefit of the people there.  There's no reason for the poverty and the starvation and the humanitarian crisis.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to this announcement yesterday?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, increased pressure on Maduro regime is certainly a welcome thing.  I mean, this really comes down to the loyalty of the military to Maduro.  As long as that loyalty is there, it's unlikely that Maduro is going the leave.  If that loyalty starts to fall apart, I hope we're working a 'plan b', which is engineering right now some kind of exit path for Maduro, where he can go into exile with recriminations in Venezuela.  The Reagan administration did this very successfully on Ferdinand Marcos, back in 1986, overwhelming popular opposition to him, hundreds of thousands of people.  We engineered his exit.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me squeeze in this question before you go general.  This image from the briefing going viral and it shows John Bolton's notepad with the notation: \"5,000 troops to Colombia.\"  Whoa, do you think we should be sending troops to the region?  What do you think about this?  Caught on camera.</p><p>KEANE:  Look, when we deposed Noriega in 1989 operation just cost Panama, 26,000 troops, is what it took.  When we deposed a dictator in Haiti, 28,000.  The ease of troops that would only be in there, move into Venezuela, if there's a problem at the embassy to our diplomat.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How significance is revealing such a secret?</p><p>KEANE:  I think he'd probably wanted to reveal it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  General Jack Keane, good to see you sir.  Thank you so much.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Show: MORNINGS WITH MARIA][Date: January 29, 2019][Time: 07:00:00][Tran: 012902cb.231][Type: SHOW][Head: Interview with Rep.

Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo coming to you live this morning from Washington, D.C.  It is Tuesday, January 29th.</p><p>Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>It is a busy day on the earnings calendar this morning.  3M among the Dow components reporting their fourth quarter.  The company cut its forecast for 2019.  Pfizer also cut this morning.  The stock under pressure this morning after the guidance came in below expectations.

Join us live as the Treasury Secretary will join the program, coming up.</p><p>Markets are under pressure this morning.  Futures pointing to a lower opening for the broader averages although right now it is more like a flat showing than lower.</p><p>The Dow Industrials are up 3 points right now.  S&amp;P 500 pretty much flat, up a quarter point.  And the Nasdaq is down 4 points.  It's been back and forth on futures this after declines across the board yesterday, of course.</p><p>Stocks finished off of the lows of the day but nonetheless, the Dow Industrials were down 209 points, almost 1 percent.  S&amp;P was down 20.  The Nasdaq was down 79, better than 1 percent lower.</p><p>Global markets this morning.  Take a look at European indices, higher across the board.  This right here, this is the high of the morning.  FT 100 up 1.5 percent, 97 points higher.  CAC 40 in Paris up 39 points, almost 1 percent.  And the DAX index in Germany up about 20 points right now.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets were little changed, pretty much across the board as you can see.</p><p>Well, the date is official now with the government back open, President Trump will give his State of the Union address one week from today.

Take a look, the social media service eyeing a major change to better compete with Instagram.  We'll tell you all about it coming up.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning.  And joining me to break it all down -- Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell in New York; the \"Wall Street Journal's\" global economics editor Jon Hilsenrath here in D.C. with me; and the American Conservative Union chairman, Matt Schlapp.  Great to see you -- guys.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Great to be here.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen -- good morning to you.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning.  We were talking about the shutdown.  So it's over for the time being.</p><p>The Democrats have actually been hurt by it as well.  Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows that positive feelings about the Democratic Party have fallen to 35 percent this month.  That's down 4 percentage points since December.  And that is essentially in line with the positive feelings that people have about Republicans.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean that's a really good point because the President really did not get hurt certainly on his base, from his base, by the shutdown.  What do you guys think?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Two things.  First is that the President's base was actually energized that he would make a spending fight.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Remember, immigration is a spending fight because if he can stop illegal immigration or reduce it, you don't have all these social services costs.</p><p>But the second thing is, the President's brand is that he will fight, he will fight harder than any politician on the field and he reiterated that brand.  So if he can increase that reputation, I think it appeals to Independents.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They said dig in.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  But isn't his brand also -- it's about fighting and continuing to fight and winning.  And he didn't win the wall in this case.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  I don't agree with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We don't know if he won the wall yet.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  There's three steps to this - -</p><p>HILSENRATH:  In this case, right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  In this case.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  -- there's three really important things.  Number one, the bill he signed has $1.3 billion in barrier funding annualized.</p><p>Number two, he's got to exhaust all legislative efforts if he's going to go the emergency route in order to have a good case in court.</p><p>And number three, the American people when it comes to immigration, he is on the right side of this policy argument.  And Democrats who are against border security, they're going to be sorry for this eventually.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  But you know what.  You better be --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, go ahead -- Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- but you better be careful about what you do and this goes to all politicians because I was flying on Friday and that was an utter nightmare.  If you want to anger everybody in the electorate, you pull another fast one like that where people are grounded and you've got an hour and-a-half plane flight where you're at 8,000 feet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But who are you blaming?</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They were blaming (INAUDIBLE) and blaming the Democrats because --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They were blaming everybody.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- Nancy Pelosi dug in.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They were blaming everybody.  But TSA agents down in Raleigh, Durham were going to food banks because they were spending what little money they had on gas trying to get to and from work.  So again, I don't care who is responsible for it.  They're all responsible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, businesses did start, you know, putting the uncertainty out there, sitting on cash, making decisions later.  We know.  I mean the SEC closed, can't get any IPOs through.  FDA closed, got to worry about obvious food shortages or food issues.</p><p>So we were beginning to see some real impact.  And Dagen saw it firsthand at the airport.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  That's true.  But if you're a federal employee in this town, let's face it, you make a little bit of a bargain.  Yes, every year you might have to go through a shutdown with your salary.</p><p>But you know, the other thing, Maria, that we don't talk about, it's almost impossible to fire a federal employee.  There's some pretty cushy gigs --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good point.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  -- in THIS town where you basically have an insurance policy against ever getting fired unless you do something just awful.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  And you can read all the GAO reports that's backed that up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're talking about all of that this morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But there are people barely making ends meet who are trying to drive to work, and spending all their money on gasoline and going to food banks who were working for the TSA and not getting paid.</p><p>And when the Republicans stop thinking about them and start talking about the workers who aren't needed, the ones who are furloughed you have really missed the boat.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, maybe.  But how about the fact that we've got a border wall in Nancy Pelosi's state?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that immoral, the wall that separates Tijuana from San Diego --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  But --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- is that immoral?  I don't think so.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They need to start asking all of these Democrats who think that the wall is immoral or don't want to fund it, ok, let's take down the walls that are there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's how you put --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will the three million people in Tijuana assimilate with the three million people in San Diego if that wall is torn down?  I think so.  And we're going to talk about that this morning.</p><p>We've got a big show this morning from D.C., live.  Coming up Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is here, live.  National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow has a thing or two to say about the CBO protections about what exactly the impact is on the economy from that shutdown.</p><p>House Minority Leader and California Congressman Kevin McCarthy will walk us through what these next three weeks look like with his colleagues in terms of this negotiating on border wall funding.</p><p>Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell is here.</p><p>Along with AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka.</p><p>Don't miss a moment of it.  A big two hours coming up.</p><p>And we kick it off this hour right now with markets.  Futures are pointing to a flat opening this morning amid all of this uncertainty over China trade, earnings.  It's an enormous week this week.</p><p>This after stocks finished to the downside yesterday on the China growth fears, the weak guidance from Nvidia and Caterpillar as well, and of course these worries about what happens with China and the U.S.  There's conversations happening tomorrow.</p><p>Joining us right now is the founder, CEO and chief investment strategist at Mainstay Capital Management David Kudla.  David -- good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>DAVID KUDLA, FOUNDER/CEO/CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, MAINSTAY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So we've been talking about what a week this is with the fourth quarter earnings coming out.  That's been pretty much driving the story.  We have a jobs report coming out at the end of the week on Friday.  Brexit discussions, the vote today.  U.S./China discussions tomorrow.  A fourth quarter GDP number.  How do you want to invest with all of this?</p><p>KUDLA:  I think investors should be looking at stocks right now that they want to own.  We've been invested through -- the past month has been very good for stock investors.  13 percent rise through Friday from the lows of December 24th.  And that's in both growth stocks and value stocks, so a broad market advance.</p><p>We're going to see some give and take here now after this nice advance of last month but investors should be picking, you know, their points here, have their list out on stocks they want to own.  We look for a good 2019 for stock investors.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is it good news, Jon Hilsenrath, that the Fed gave us a pivot that we know that the Fed is on pause right now and that we know that they're even ready to consider slowing down the unwind of the bond portfolio?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  I don't think it's good news.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I think it shows that the Fed is becoming less confident about how strong and sustainable the economy is.  I mean it is a sign that inflation isn't picking up and that's good news.  But you see some real trepidation coming out of the Fed right now with the global economy slowing, with markets being unstable and volatile.</p><p>I think the Fed is a little worried about the outlook and that shouldn't really give us a lot of encouragement.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about that, David?  I mean the economy's slowing.</p><p>KUDLA:  But Jon this -- yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLA:  But John -- the important thing here is what happened in the fourth quarter is we had mixed messages out of fed chair Jerome Powell.  We had on October 3rd we were far away from neutral.  Then by November we were close to neutral rates.  Then on the 16th in the Fed meeting they were going to do what's right no matter what.</p><p>Then he came in on January 4th and finally said we're going to be considerate of market and economic conditions and now we're seeing a more consistent and accommodative message out of the Fed.  And that's very important for the markets.</p><p>That's music to the market's ears and that's why we've now seen a sustained advance.  So the markets and investors are now looking at a Fed that seems as though they are going to be considerate of or accommodative or take into account what's happening with the markets, with the economy, and not just normalize rates for the sake of normalizing rates.</p><p>They won't have $50 billion rolling off the balance sheet on auto pilot and they won't raise rates just to raise rates to get to a normalized rate structure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that was the worry in the fourth quarter.</p><p>KUDLA:  -- in pause like in 2016 if the market and economy warrants it.  That's important.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That was they worry in the fourth quarter -- that they were on auto pilot-- Jon.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  Yes, I make two points.</p><p>KUDLA:  That drove volatility in the fourth quarter, the Fed.  .</p><p>HILSENRATH:  David makes a really important point, you know.  So this has been Jerome Powell's first year at the Fed.  He's had a bit of a honeymoon with the market.  And then what the market has discovered in the last month or two is that Mr. Powell, you know, he kind of prides himself on being a plain-spoken communicator but his communication has confused a lot of people in the market.  And he's really had to do a lot of corrections over the last few weeks --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- so that raised some questions about him.</p><p>But the other thing about -- you know, the market wants to see the Fed on an easier path.  Ok.  But the underlying message there is that this economy can't sustain very high rates.</p><p>So it doesn't send a really encouraging message about economic growth and the economic outlook when we see that the Fed is starting to recognize it just can't sustain a tighter monetary policy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But look, we're getting the news from the companies themselves with the fourth quarter numbers coming out.  Verizon just reported mixed earnings.  They beat on earnings, but they missed on revenue.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Caterpillar.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Technology reporting late today, Apple.  And we heard from Apple already.  Facebook, Amazon -- all reporting this week, Microsoft.  It's going to be a big week for technology.  And of course you mentioned Caterpillar.  That was the big kahuna yesterday that really set the tone for the markets because Caterpillar is a great indicator of economic activity across the world, in particular China.</p><p>So stay on earnings for a second, David.  Give me your take on technology.  Because you've got Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft coming out this week.</p><p>KUDLA:  Well, you know, tech stocks got beat up very bad in the fourth quarter.  They've come back in this rally and we think that tech stocks have further to go.</p><p>Look, we think that investors should stay with tech stocks.  We have an opportunity here to add value stocks to the portfolio.  Cyclicals came into 2019 at their lowest valuation relative to the S&amp;P 500 ever.</p><p>So investors now can diversify their portfolio in an opportunistic way, holding both growth stocks.  Those tech stocks that we think still have some rebound and some further runway ahead of them, and by adding value stocks that are very opportunistic.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  David -- it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>KUDLA:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Still bullish on this market.  David Kudla joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, the State of the Union is back on, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi extended officially the invitation to President Trump to do the State of the Union in the House Chamber.  He accepted the offer.</p><p>Plus we're taking a look at the enormous cost of the shutdown, what exactly is the number?  A lot of people say it wasn't very much at all.</p><p>Then, Snapchat's unthinkable change, how the photo sharing app is attempting to compete with Instagram by changing a key feature.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>New revelations in the sexual misconduct claims against the former CEO of Wynn Resorts.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with headlines now in New York -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Maria.  The \"Wall Street Journal\" is reporting that executives at Wynn Resort ignored allegations of sexual misconduct by Steve Wynn over more than a decade.  According to a regulator's report Wynn was accused of sexually assaulting or harassing salon workers, cocktail servers and flight attendants who worked for his company.</p><p>Under a proposed settlement, the Nevada Gaming Control Board won't try to revoke Wynn's regulatory licenses but Wynn is going to pay a fine.  Steve Wynn has denied any claims of misconduct.  There's a one year chart of Wynn's in front of you right there.</p><p>Well, Snapchat has named Lara Sweet as its interim CFO.  This is another shift in leadership at Snap as the company has lost several high profile employees over the last year.  Meanwhile Snap is reportedly considering allowing longer lasting or even permanent videos on Snapchat.  It will apply the Snap shared publicly on this story's features.  Snap is down 52 percent from one year ago.  There's that chart for you.</p><p>Well, Porsche is speeding past Tesla in a fast charging race.  The car maker says it new Porsche Taycan is going to be able to add more than 60 miles of charge in just four minutes.  That will be the fastest available today, exceeding Tesla's super charging stations which needs about 30 minutes to charge a vehicle's battery to at least 80 percent.  Charging times are a key selling point obviously for these car makers and now Porsche is giving Taycan owners three years of free charging.</p><p>And obviously we're going to be hearing from Tesla this week, Maria.  Earnings are coming out from Elon Musk and company.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Cheryl -- thank you so much.</p><p>Coming up next, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi challenged over her words describing a border wall as immoral.  We will break it down when we come back.</p><p>Then support on the links, fans rallying around a pro golfer whose two shot penalty was deemed unfair.  More on that.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Keeping America safe, the government is back open but the focus now is whether President Trump can make a deal with Democratic leadership on funding for the border wall.</p><p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has called it immoral, any wall is immoral.  But her home state of California protects the southern border in some places with an actual wall -- the wall separating Tijuana and San Diego.</p><p>Joining me right now is Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell.  And the last time you were on you said you wanted to look at this again.  Congresswoman -- it's good to see you.</p><p>REP. DEBBIE DINGELL (D), MICHIGAN:  It's good to see you.  Welcome to Washington.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.</p><p>What's your take on this?  I mean can Nancy Pelosi really get away with calling a wall immoral when she has a wall in her own state, separating Tijuana from San Diego?</p><p>DINGELL:  Here is what I think is going to happen.  You've got strong countries (ph), both sides of the aisle, both houses.  They're going to go into that room and they want to cut a deal that's going to keep our nation safe.  I don't think anybody wants to see what we just went through for 35 days.</p><p>It hurt the economy.  It hurt -- and I do believe -- this is going to sound corny but I don't -- you know, why do we point -- why do we need to have a Trump win, a Pelosi win.  We need an American win.</p><p>So I'm hoping they're going to go in that room.  I've talked to my colleagues on both sides.  I've talked to Roy Blunt.  I've talked to all my Democratic colleagues in the House.  They want to win.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DINGELL:  They want to go in and put together a package that's going to keep --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So how do you win?  What's the position in terms of wall funding?  Because they may very well -- your colleagues may very well come back and say ok, here's $5 billion towards border security, not a dime toward a wall.</p><p>DINGELL:  I don't know -- if people are really working together, that may not happen.  You know, there may be money, if there are appropriate places for a wall or fence or --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is there a movement within your party, do you think, among your colleagues that they feel that, yes, some money should go for an actual barrier?</p><p>DINGELL:  I think what I hear among my colleagues is let's go into a room and do something that makes sense.  Let's come up with -- we need to -- I've said this to you a million times.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DINGELL:  We need to strengthen our borders at both sides.  Everybody talks about the southern border.  I've got this northern border too which just had a huge human trafficking problem again in the last few --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But there are areas of the southern border that are very dense.  In other words like when you just look at the wall in Nancy's state and that is three million people on one side in Tijuana, three million people on the other side in San Diego.  If you tear that wall down -- I mean isn't it obvious many of the people on the Tijuana side will assimilate into the United States?</p><p>DINGELL:  Then let me ask you this question.  Build a wall, tear down a wall -- are there structures that are working that are in place?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  .</p><p>DINGELL:  So that's -- what I do think we need drones.  We need to fill the 3,000 open patrol --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's common ground, both sides believe in that.</p><p>DINGELL:  Both agree --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Technology and drones -- definitely.</p><p>DINGELL:  We need technology.  We need to make these ports safer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Specifically in a dense area, like Tijuana/San Diego, drones wouldn't work.  I mean maybe you want that in addition to a wall.  When you have such a dense area, where there's three million people on one side of the wall and three m million on the other, don't you need an actual barrier?</p><p>DINGELL:  But they are going to go in this room.  There are people that know what they're doing.  They're people -- they're senior people that have been on homeland security, people from the areas that are impacted --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think they're going to deal?  We won't shut down the government again?</p><p>DINGELL:  I pray to God, we never shut down the government.  Not only do I pray to God that doesn't come out of conference but you're going to see Republicans and Democrats working together.  We'll get --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This whole wall issue, Congresswoman, sort of underscores what's going on I think in both parties.  Now you've got former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz seeing an opening as a result of the radicalness on both sides.</p><p>He's facing backlash on his first stop for his book tour last night.  It was his first public appearance after announcing a possible Independent presidential run.  It did not go smoothly.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire (EXPLETIVE DELETED).  Go back to (INAUDIBLE) on Twitter.  Go back to Davos with the other billionaire elites who think they know how to run the world.  That's not what the country needs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  You know, I give you a lot of credit just being in politics, by the way.</p><p>Schultz is also being criticized by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, billionaire.  He tweeted this, \"In 2020 the great likelihood is that an Independent would just split the anti-Trump vote and end up reelecting the President.  That's a risk.  I refused to run in 2016 and we can't afford it right now.</p><p>Congresswoman -- do you think an Independent run is viable?  Do you think an Independent run from Schultz would hurt the Democrats?</p><p>DINGELL:  I think it's viable.  He has the money to spend it.  But I think he would hurt the Democrats.  I'm fearful that I am -- I'm trying to step back.  I'm not getting any candidate I want to see who is going to emerge, who's got people skills.</p><p>But this is dangerous.  And as you know, told you two years ago, Donald Trump could become president.  Nobody believed me.  You all thought I was crazy.  You may not have but most people did.</p><p>And I still think he could get reelected.  And if we do not run a strong campaign and we don't have somebody like that that pulls votes off --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  One of the issues is the messaging of what the platform is.  So what do you think the Democratic candidate for 2020 should have as their platform?  What's most important?</p><p>DINGELL:  You know what we didn't do and one of the reasons I believe firmly that President Trump became President Trump.  One, people are tired of partisan bickering.  They're tired of seeing things not get done in Washington.</p><p>There are a lot of people that are hurting in this country, just working men and women who want to know that we actually care about them.  They're scared about healthcare.  They're scared about escalating drug costs.  There's -- look at our --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So healthcare should be the platform?</p><p>DINGELL:  it's one piece of it.  Infrastructure, let's create jobs.  What are we going to do about education?  Trade?</p><p>Now, the President -- you want to know why he won Michigan?  Trade.  They're tired of bad trade deals that ship jobs overseas.  We don't have a level playing field.  The President's trade policy is all over the place.</p><p>It's not consistent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you going to vote for the ratification of USMCA?</p><p>DINGELL:  I don't call it USMC.  I call it NAFTA 2.0.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you going to vote for ratification.</p><p>DINGELL:  I haven't decided yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is on your plate now in the next month.</p><p>DINGELL:  Very much on my plate.  And talk to Lighthizer about it all the time.  But I'm not voting for any bill that doesn't have and acting legislation that keeps more manufacturing from going to Mexico.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wasn't that one of the key things of this new law?</p><p>DINGELL:  But Blazer still went to --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Keeping jobs here.</p><p>DINGELL:  Blazers went to Mexico in July.  I'm not seeing any more American cars go to Mexico and get built for $1.50 to $3.50 and then gets shipped back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you want a change before you vote for it?</p><p>DINGELL:  He knows how I feel.  I'm not -- one of the more likely people to vote for it but I'm not voting for it in the form that it's in right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.   We'll leave it there.</p><p>Congresswoman -- it's good to see you.</p><p>DINGELL:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.  Congresswoman Debbie Dingell joining us here.</p><p>Coming up, the longest government shutdown in American history is over.  But another shutdown threat is on the horizon.  We will talk about the next three weeks, what it looks like with House Minority Leader, Kevin McCarthy.  He's up next.</p><p>Then you've got a friend again.  The new teaser trailer for \"Toy Story 4\" drops with a big surprise.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Tuesday, January 29th.  Your top stories right now at 7:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Earnings season in full swing this morning for the fourth quarter.  Several Dow components reporting their fourth quarter this morning.  Verizon reported a mixed quarter earlier this hour.  Pfizer and 3M also under pressure this morning as you can see.  3M up three percent, although Pfizer and Verizon down better than one percent.</p><p>Rising tensions with China continuing, the U.S. bringing charges against Chinese telecom company Huawei as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning between the two nations.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will be joining me as my special guest this morning at the top of the hour, 8:00 a.m. Eastern.  Join us for that talk on China and the economy as we break it all down with the Treasury secretary.</p><p>Markets this morning are hovering around the flat line.  Take a look.  Dow Industrials up 20 points right now, 26 higher.  The S&amp;P 500 is down by almost one point and the NASDAQ down about three points.</p><p>All this after the major indices finished lower yesterday across the board at 04:00 on Wall Street.  Dow industrials were down 208 points and then actually was off of the lows of the -- of the day, down almost one percent at the close.  S&amp;P 500 gave up 21 points, that was three-quarters of one percent.  And the NASDAQ was down 79 points, better than one percent lower.</p><p>In Europe this morning, a mixed story, actually mostly higher.  FT-100 at the high of the morning right here, up 1-1/4 percent, 83 points higher, ahead of the British vote on the U.K. leaving the E.U.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is up 42 points, almost one percent higher and the DAX Index in Germany higher by 25, quarter of a percent higher there.</p><p>Asian markets mostly quiet overnight.  Take a look, as you can see, it was pretty much across the board.</p><p>$100,000 penalty, how one misstep cost a professional golfer big time.  The outcry, coming up.</p><p>And Woody and Buzz Lightyear are back, the new teaser trailer for \"Toy Story 4\" is out and it marks the return of one character after 20 years.  We will bring it to you.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning.  But first, our top story this half an hour, shutdown showdown, the government open for business again after the last -- at least for the next three weeks, rather.  But the main issue, funding the wall has not been resolved and the White House is not letting it go.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  What I do know is that if they don't come back with a deal, that means Democrats get virtually nothing.  That will make the president and force him to have to take executive action that does not give Democrats the things that they want.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is the House Minority leader, Congressman Kevin McCarthy.  Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you.</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  Thanks for having me back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So, what do the next three weeks look like?  Take us through these negotiating.  Do you expect any money for the wall?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  I expect us to solve this problem in the end.  What's interesting here is the whole time speaker Pelosi said I couldn't negotiate anything until you open up government.  The president put the public first and said OK, let's go through, I'll give you three weeks.</p><p>Now Wednesday, we'll have the conference committee, the senators and the congressional members' appropriation sit down and we'll see if they're serious about it, if they're willing to do something.  Because I believe Nancy Pelosi is out of step with her own party.  If you look at her number two, Steny Hoyer.  He said of course, that walls are not immoral, and that he believes some fencing involved.  From her Agricultural secretary to her Agricultural chair to our Armed Services chair, they both believe in a wall too.  Her Agriculture chairman said give Trump the money.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and she continues to say that it's immoral which I find incredible given the fact she has a wall in her own state.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  As my state too.  You know what I find --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And your state too, exactly.  California.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  You know what I find immoral?  When you really talk about this, this is about stopping human trafficking.  In 2016, they stopped more than 2,000 individuals involved in that.  I think it's immoral that you would allow that to continue.  I don't believe anybody in America that says they support border security believes that there is no such thing as some barrier.</p><p>And the president said, he does not a -- he does not want a wall from sea to shining sea.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  He just believes in the area you need some form of barrier and he's correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, where do you think are the most important areas that you would need the wall?  I mean, we talked earlier about this wall in your state, Tijuana, San Diego where it's very dense, three million people on one side, three million people on the other.  Can you make the case that that dense area is elsewhere where that's why the president is so stuck on having this wall there?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  And it's not the president saying, it's the experts.  The president sat down with the experts and they said this is what we need to be able to secure our border.</p><p>So in certain areas, like in San Diego, we stopped illegal movement by more than 95 percent.  You look at Yuma, Arizons, El Paso another -- El Paso became one of the safest cities in the nation after being able to put it through.  That's what we need, in certain parts of the country along the border, you need a barrier.  In other parts you could put the drones in this part area.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what are you expecting to give on?  And what -- do you think they're going to offer the $5.7 billion that the president wants for border security?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  But we're arguing over one-tenth of one percent of the budget.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a great point.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  The Democrats have voted for a wall before.  But now that the president brings forward what the experts want, they say no.  That is what's so confusing to me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, what -- why is this so important for the president right now?  Going into 2020, I mean, is she seeing this as a campaign promise and that's why he doesn't -- she won't agree to it.  Because I don't know how she can call it immoral, given the wall in her own state, your own state.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Again, it's such a little price to pay for so much more security when you look at the human trafficking.  Think of the number of lives that we will save from this process if we have a secure border.</p><p>But what's more importantly, it's the president that sat down and tried to be reasonable, find common ground.  He's the one who brought DACA into it.</p><p>And let's not forget, speaker Pelosi just a year ago holds the record for the longest speech on the floor, eight hours, over one issue, DACA, which she shut the government down over.  And now she thinks that's not important?  I think those people are important as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think that this -- a negotiation, an agreement will include a DACA deal?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  It could.  It doesn't have to.  But because the Democrats and speaker Pelosi have been saying no.  The president said he was willing to go there, three more years of DACA for a portion of the border security that the experts are asking for.  I just find her out of step with her own party.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, there seems to be a movement within the party, even some of the newer congress people coming in, fresher faces saying you know what, yes, we do need border security and we do need the money.  So, are they going head to head?  I mean, are they -- do they even have a voice?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  They don't even have a voice.  Because remember, she has so much power.  She will not allow the vote to come up.  I believe inside the conference we could come up with an agreement.  The question is, will speaker Pelosi even allow that to be voted on the floor?  If we had a vote on the floor, I believe it would pass.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think that the president will allow the government to shut down again?  I mean, is the president really prepared to have another government shutdown if he doesn't get the money?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Look, I think the president's going to try to find a way to solve this one way or another.  I don't know that shutting the government down solves it.  I there's other ways to do that the president can.  I know he firmly believes in a legislative process.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Should he call for a national emergency?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  He has the power to do that.  I think the best road forward right now is a legislative agreement.  And what's so interesting to me, I'd listened to these Democrats celebrate Nancy Pelosi.  You celebrated someone that got you status quo.  They're still a DACA problem, they're still a border security problem.</p><p>And government is designed to find common ground and compromise.  The president was the one person looking reasonable in all these discussions.  I know the president's committed to this.  He will get the border secure one way or another.  He's giving the Democrats an opportunity.  He gave them an opportunity all along this discussion.  They said then open up the government, they'll discuss it.  So he did that and gave them a three week time.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean, I think this whole thing, the government shutdown and the constant resist upsets people.  I mean, you have to wonder if in fact -- you know, she keeps resisting everything that the president wants, if the people will turn on her.  Because people want to see you guys get something done.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Yes, she is celebrating status quo.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  That's not where we need to be --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me move on and ask you about 2010, congressman.  Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz thinking about running for office.  He was at a book signing last night in New York and he was heckled over his bid.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump.  You egotistical billionaire (INAUDIBLE).  Go back to getting ratioed on Twitter.  Go back to Davos with the other billionaire elites who think they know how to run the world.  That's not what the country needs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This heckler not the only one weighing in.  Michael Bloomberg former mayor of New York City also told Schultz not to run as an independent.  He said this, given the strong pull of partisanship and the realities of the electoral college system, there's no way an independent can win.  That is truer today than ever before.  Is that where we are, an independent can't win, congressman?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  No, I think it's Bloomberg upset.  Because remember, he went from a Republican to an independent to a Democrat and he just spent $120 million giving to the Democrats so they can win the majority in the House and he doesn't want his money to be wasted, so he doesn't want competition.</p><p>Look, I think there's ample opportunity for an independent to get in this race, only because the Democrats are now become social Democrats.  They're talking about a 70 percent tax rate.  They're talking about these green deals.  They're talking about socialism.  If you listen to what some of these new Democrats say, they think Venezuela's problem is not because they're a socialist country, it's because of sanctions.  They're so out of step.  They are putting letters in to help those who want to go sign up for ISIS, to be easy on them to the judge.  I mean, I have -- this is not the America we live in, and that's the difference.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  This party is so out of step and I think you'll find a lot of moderate Democrats who say I want somebody else who could talk about this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, that's why a number of moderate Democrats can't really get the OK from the party leadership because they're not left enough.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  This new socialist Democrat Party has left the Democratic Party.  They are in to -- remember, Bernie Sanders is not registered as a Democrat.  He's registered as a socialist.  AOC does not call herself a Democrat, she calls herself a Democrat socialist.  This party is moving to a whole different place.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Real quick before you go, when the election happened back in November.  You said one of your priorities going to be to get the majority back.  How are you going to do it?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Well, first of all, you've got to make sure you can recruit.  I think, you put the ideas up there.  Ideas should win at the end of the day.  You look at where we are financially in this country.  A lot of that happens to do with the policies that we're able to create, from the tax policy, the battle we had with you human trafficking and other that we were able to do.  I think you're going to find as going directly to, we've got to find a suburban areas to be able to win again in and I think we're going to be very successful.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, it's good to see you.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Congressman Kevin McCarthy, joining us there.</p><p>Still ahead, Richard Trumka AFL-CIO president on the impact of the shutdown on American workers, what he'd like to see, back in a moment with that.</p><p>And then, support on the links, a pro golfer given a big fine and a two-shot penalty which many are calling grossly unfair.  What went wrong, right here.</p><p>Plus, you've got a friend and a big surprise, the trailer for \"Toy Story 4\" drops with a character we haven't seen in 20 years.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Prosecutors resting their case against Joaquin El Chapo Guzman.  Cheryl Casone in New York with details and headlines, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It; must something else, Maria.  The federal government has now rested its case.  They called 56 witnesses.  The trial of the notorious Mexican drug kingpin started back in mid-November.  El Chapo told the trial judge yesterday he will not take the stand in his own defense.  One witness is scheduled to appear for the defense today.  Closing arguments expected to take place tomorrow and Thursday.  Big story, a lot of New Yorkers have been following very closely.</p><p>Well, professional golfer Haotong Li is getting a huge outpouring of support from fellow golfers after losing out on nearly $100,000 Saturday for a minor infraction.  It happened at the Omega Dubai Desert Classic.  Li was on the 18th green when judges accuses caddie of standing too close behind him as he got ready to putt.  Well, the ensuing penalty dropped Li's score from 71 to 73.  And he went from third to 12th.  Tour officials say the correct call was made but acknowledge it was grossly unfair.  They're looking at the giving referees more discretion in cases like this going forward.</p><p>And then, get ready for \"Toy Story 4\".  Pixar is putting out this teaser video, shows the revival of Woody's love interest, Bo Peep.  And she is back with a new, more modern look.  She was last seen in \"Toy Story 2\", back in 1999.  It is now 20 years later, \"Toy Story 4\" is going to be released, Maria, this June .  Those are your headlines from New York, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like it.  Bo Peep.  All right, thank you Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, the lingering effects of the shutdown showdown.  AFL-CIO Richard Trumka will join us to talk about the impact on American workers.  He's up next.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We are focused on the American worker this morning.  White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney saying that the 800,000 federal workers who were not paid twice during the partial government shutdown should receive those checks by the end of this week.</p><p>Joining us right now is American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organization's president, AFL-CIO, Richard Trumka.  It's great to see you, Richard.  Thank you so much for being here.</p><p>RICHARD TRUMKA, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR AND CONGRESS OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION:  Maria, thanks for having me on today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Give us your take on what the impact of the shutdown was.</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, I think there's several impacts.  There's impact on the people and you not only have government workers who get back pay but you have the government contractors who won't get back pay unless something is done.  That was a devastating effect on them.  It had a devastating effect on the economy itself.  $11 billion, although we'll pick some of that back up later in the year.</p><p>But you had a devastating effect on the airline industry where you had people, airline controllers, traffic controllers that were in school that actually just up and left.  They said we're not going to do this anymore (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What could -- what could have been done about it then, Rich?  Because you as the leader that you are and representing so many workers across the country have to be unnerved when you see open borders and illegals coming in and taking your jobs.</p><p>TRUMKA:  Look, that's just not how it works anymore.  I mean, you have people that got laid off from the president's place that have been here 20 years.  They're not taking anybody's job.  What we want to do is make sure every worker in this country has the same rights so that they can't be exploited.</p><p>Because what happens right now with undocumented workers is, they're great when no one's around.  When they try to organize and get a voice, then they start squeezing them.  They start ex -- you know, doing, calling in ICE and different things.</p><p>The idea is if everybody has the same rights, then they can't exploit those people and everybody can actually have a fair playing field.  What happens to American workers -- employers right now, is you have an employer that hires people, makes them work in unfair condition, misclassifies them, underpays them, and they're competing against our employer.  That employer needs to pay everybody the same rate, live by the same working conditions, so that we can all compete.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you're OK with illegals coming in and as long as everybody's treated the same?</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, Maria, it's a -- it's a nice cliche, illegals coming in.  But you know yourself that most people that are here undocumented or illegally came in legally.  So the whole system needs to be addressed.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, but there are apprehensions that we could look at, just in the month of December, just in the month of November, where apprehensions were of illegal immigrants coming in and wanting asylum in the United States.</p><p>TRUMKA:  There's no question that the system is broken.  We need to fix the system and have a path towards citizenship so that those workers that have been here for years and are actually making the economy run, even the president's golf courses and things like that, they have a chance to get citizenship and they work their work there.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Just a question on the golf courses.  As you know, that's the H2B program, people who come here as foreign workers, come under a specified amount of time for DOL.  I think the real question is is that, what happens to all the people, not who have been here who came legally and overstayed the visa, but what about all the people who come every day at the southern border and can cross into our country?  That's really the pernicious problem.  And even on wall, built with American workers, you'd be for that.</p><p>TRUMKA:  But listen, the people that come back and forth, you have Americans that go to Mexico and Mexicans that come to America to work.  I think Mexico --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you don't think there's a problem at the border at all?</p><p>TRUMKA:  I didn't say that.  There is -- there is a problem.  We do need border security.  And no, I don't think that a wall's the answer to it.  Every time someone's tried to build a wall it's not been very successful.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, the one in Tijuana is successful.</p><p>TRUMKA:  Ask the Chinese, ask the French.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The wall -- the wall in Tijuana --</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Ask Tijuana (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tijuana and San Diego, what abut that Richard?</p><p>TRUMKA:  I'm sorry?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The wall, between Tijuana -- separating Tijuana from San Diego, is that successful?</p><p>TRUMKA:  There are places -- there are places probably where it works.  Is that the answer to everything?  No.  Should that have been the reason for a shutdown?  Absolutely not.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  I want -- I want to ask a broader political question.  We've seen in the last two elections that increasingly voters, blue collar voters, voters in manufacturing towns all over America, the kind of rank and file people that you represent are voting for Republicans, they're going for Trump.  Does the AFL-CIO need to realign its own approach to politics in this town, given that more and more of its people are going with people like Donald Trump and his trade policies and the Republican Party?</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, that's a -- that's a question we could talk about two or three hours for.  First of all, we have realigned our politics.  We are issuing -- we're issue oriented right now.  We put an issue out and if a politician supports that issue, then we support them.</p><p>In fact, in this last election we elected two union members to the Senate, three to governorship, 18 to the House of Representative, and 925 to state legislatures, because those workers will go and support our issues.  That's what we try to do.  We find it more and more difficult to find Republicans that actually support us.  Now, the American worker believes that neither the political system --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got to jump.</p><p>TRUMKA:  -- or the economic system works for them.  They want somebody to change the rules.  That's why they voted for Trump.  If he changes the rules to their advantage, some of them will vote for him again.  If he doesn't, he stands a chance of losing those workers and right now he's losing those workers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Richard, thank you so much for joining us.  We appreciate it.  Richard Trumka there.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Show: MORNINGS WITH MARIA][Date: January 29, 2019][Time: 08:00:00][Tran: 012903cb.231][Type: SHOW][Head: Apple Disables Group FaceTime Function That Was Allowing Callers To Listen And View Without Your Consent; British Parliament To Vote On Brexit Amendments; Kudlow on the Economy; Craft Brewers Impacts from the Government Shutdown; Kudlow on China Trade][Sect: News; Domestic][Byline: Maria Bartiromo, Gerri Willis, Ashley Webster, Hillary Vaughn, Dagen McDowell][Guest: Steven Mnuchin, Larry Kudlow, Matt Schlapp, Jon Hilsenrath][Spec: FaceTime; Huawei; Apple; Brexit; Federal Reserve; 3M; Harley-Davidson; Verizon; Oath Media; Channel Inventory; World War II; CBO; Trade Talks; Deregulations; Tax Plan; China Trade; Slowdown; Government Shutdown]</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good Tuesday morning.  Welcome back, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  Live from Washington this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is January 29th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  Earnings in focus.  Investors watching results from several Dow components this morning ahead of the opening bell.  One to watch after the bell tonight -- after the close is Apple.</p><p>Meanwhile, Apple under fire FaceTime hit with a new bug that allows people to eavesdrop on you without your knowledge and even if you don't take the call.  Rising tensions with China, the U.S. brings charges against Chinese telecom company, Huawei as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  The very latest on the state of negotiations with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin coming up.</p><p>Markets are searching for direction this morning.  Take a look at the futures ahead of the open this morning.  Dow industrials picking up speed up 55 points right now, a quarter of a percent higher.  S&amp;P 500 is up two and the NASDAQ right now right now showing a gain of 11 points at the open in about an hour and a half.  This after declines across the board yesterday.  Stocks finished off of the lows, but nonetheless the Dow Industrials gave up 209 points yesterday 4:00, almost one percent lower.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 gave up 21 points, three quarters of a percent lower.  And the NASDAQ was down 79 points.  That was better than one percent lower yesterday.  Global markets this morning are mostly higher.  Take a look at European indices with the FT-100-is at the high of the morning, up 86 points, 1-1/4 percent ahead of the vote on Brexit.  CAC quarante in Paris us up 44 points and the DAX index up 21, fractional gain there.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets were little changed.  Take a look, it was pretty much across the board.  Now, our top story this morning, concerns of a global slowdown.  Last week in Davos I spoke with Bridgewater Associates founder, Ray Dalio, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, and Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey.  Here's what they said about the possibility of an economic slowdown on the horizon.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RAY DALIO, FOUNDER, BRIDGEWATER ASSOCIATES:  Europe has a negative growth and the United States is going to have a negative growth environment.  I don't mean absolute negative, I mean slowing of growth in a material way that could be close to between zero and two percent over the next 18 months.</p><p>BRIAN MOYNIHAN, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, BANK OF AMERICA:  We have the top research firm in the world, and they have done a great job.  And they have the U.S. growing at 2-1/2 percent this year.  The world growing 3-1/2 percent GDP growth.  But that's down from last year.  And so the confusion in the environment right now is a slowdown or is it going in to a recession?</p><p>Nothing we see says it's close to a recession.</p><p>JAMES QUINCEY, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, COCA-COLA:  I think we are in danger of talking ourselves into a problem.  It's just a little bit slower growth.  It's not a recession or a decline.  So we see -- we see a little -- a little softer 2019, maybe a little less tail wind than 2018.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now in a Fox Business exclusive is the treasury secretary of the United States, Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  Great to see you, Secretary.</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, UNITED STATES TREASURY SECRETARY:  Great to see you as well, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.  Your reaction to really what seems like now a unanimous feeling that a slowdown is on the horizon.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, Maria, from everything we see, the U.S. economy is still quite strong.  The companies are doing quite well.  And we see still tremendous investment in capital and human investments.  There's no question that as it relates to Europe and China, there is a slowdown.  We're monitoring that carefully.  But we still see a tremendous opportunity and a lot of capital coming into the U.S.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Federal Reserve basically told us they are on pause.  They may even pause the balance sheet unwind which is also telling us that the Fed is also expecting a slowdown, but do you believe a recession is on the horizon in 2020 even though you're seeing strength and stability so far?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  We see no indications whatsoever of a recession on the horizon.  And from everything we see from speaking to a large across the board businesses, the combination of tax reform, regulatory relief and trade is still has a very strong impact on the U.S. economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And some people are saying that the impact of certainly of trade and tariffs is causing some uncertainty.  So how much of this slowdown that we're expecting later on even if it's not right now is due to what you say you're watching China and Europe and how much of it is uncertainty around the President's tariffs program?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, Maria, as you said, there are people who expect a slowdown but I would just comment a year ago with the projections were 2-1/2 percent.  And we were at three.  We feel very comfortable we're going to hit three for last year.  And we think there's still a very good case for three percent this year.  Now, as it relates to trade, we couldn't be more pleased with the USMCA.  We are looking forward to Congress passing that quickly.</p><p>That's a very important trade deal.  We have two days of talks with China starting tomorrow.  The President is going to be involved in those talks at the conclusion.  We've been updating him.  We have another 30 days after this.  So I think we're making significant progress, and I think on the trade front, these are all very positive impacts for the U.S. economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about the trade talks because this story of China, first off, thank you to the President and to the administration for pushing back on China because that's another unanimous feeling out there, that the President did the right thing in terms of stopping China from some of its practices.  What are you expecting out of these talks?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, the President wants fair trade with China.  It's got to be reciprocal.  Right now China has free access into our markets, and we have limited access to there.  So the critical issue that we've talked about is market access, making sure there aren't forced joint ventures, not forced transfer of technology and that we have a mechanism that when we reach an agreement that we can monitor that agreement and that they'll live up to it.</p><p>And that's how I expect we will make significant progress this week on those issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How much of a priority is espionage?  Obviously the administration unveiling a sweeping set of criminal charges against Huawei Technologies.  We have had on a number of CEOs that have said yes, they have stolen trade secrets from us.  Has this come into the conversation with your Chinese leadership?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  No, let me be clear.  Those are separate issues.  And that's a separate dialogue.  So as it relates to the Huawei issues that's being run by the Justice Department.  I have no involvement in that.  I found out about that yesterday when it was announced.  So those are not part of trade discussions.  Forced technology issues are part of trade discussions but any issues as it relates to violation of U.S. law or U.S. sanctions are going through a separate track, which is the Justice Department.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, I guess the broader issue is, is this a cultural thing in China?  I mean this weekend on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" over on Fox News I spoke with the ranking member of the Intel Committee, House Intel Committee Devin Nunes and he went through some of the practices that China does every day.  Listen to this.  I've got to get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  China might have accessed allied intelligence shared with Poland and passed it on to Moscow.</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R), CALIFORNIA:  What the Chinese are doing is that they have these companies that are essentially owned by the party, the Communist Party and essentially this is a dictatorship.  There's very few people that own these companies.  They weaponize the.  So when all over the -- all over the world you have Chinese technology specifically as it relates to infrastructure on -- communications infrastructure, they will go in and they beat every other company around the world.</p><p>And in fact, they've driven a lot of companies out of business because they come in undercut.  They want to have control over all the com systems or communication systems all over the globe.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's pretty incredible.  We will handle your infrastructure of telecom and then they have a way in of spying.  How can you separate that from the conversation on trade and on forced transfer of technology?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Maria, I think you can easily separate these issues.  So there are two different issues.  One is an issue of state subsidies where they do subsidize state enterprises and they compete unfairly.  Those are trade issues, those are violations of the WTO and that's something from an economic standpoint.  We are going to enforce very seriously.  I think you know among the National Security Council, so I'm going to be careful what I say on national security issues.</p><p>But I assure you whether it's China or anywhere else in the world, our security services, DHS and others will make sure that we protect the U.S. infrastructure, we protect from cyberattacks.  That's something we're very well aware of.  But these are separate issues and shouldn't be confused.  We are focused on what are unfair economic practices.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So the best case that you can get from China is what?  Opening up their markets?  Already we are seeing some likelihood of that, UBS I guess was the first bank that was allowed to operate in China and own 51 percent of that bank.  They say they're going to go to 100 percent in three years.  Are you seeing a significant opening in terms of the Chinese willingness to open their markets to foreigners?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I do, but I think that's a good start.  But why should we have to wait three years for a U.S. company to own 100 percent in the financial services?  China can operate and own 100 percent of companies here.  So that's an example where, you know, they're moving in the right direction.  We want to speed that up.  But the issue is really we want to make sure that U.S. companies can compete fairly in China.</p><p>And if we can do that, China has a very large growing middle class.  It's an enormous market.  As I have said before, this is one of the biggest opportunities for U.S. companies in U.S. business if we can get this right.  And President Trump is determined.  This is the first administration that has aggressively said to China, you need to play fair.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is the President willing to drop all tariffs, should he get a good deal that's acceptable?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I think everything is on the table.  So the President is -- will look at, again, the objective is to have a very fair deal.  Hopefully we'll make progress this week.  The President will be involved in these negotiations and discussions.  And we've still got a lot of work to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the President said look, I'm a tariff guy.  I like tariffs.  So does that mean these tariffs are for, you know, no end in sight or would he be willing to drop the tariffs all together?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  The President hasn't made any decisions on that.  There have been no recommendations from the economic team on that yet.  The first step is to make sure we get a good agreement.  And when we get a good agreement, we'll make a recommendation to the President and he will consider that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have seen the Chinese economy get impacted.  You're still talking about 6.4 percent growth, we think, but that is lower than some people think.  What's your worry or how concerning is it that the Chinese slowdown will impact the United States?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, there's no question that China is slowing down.  They still have significant growth rates.  We're beginning to see the impact on that on world growth.  Our objective is not to slow down China.  Our objective is to make sure that U.S. companies can do business in China and can do business fairly.  So we're monitoring these issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary, stay with us.  We want to get into the shutdown and get your impact on how much the shutdown cost the economy and what you're expecting there.  Stay with us.  More of my exclusive interview with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin when we come right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are life live this morning in Washington, D.C.  And I'm sitting right now with -- in a Fox Business exclusive with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  And Treasury Mnuchin, we were talking about the broad economy.  I want to ask your thoughts on the shutdown.  The CBO says that the shutdown caused $11 billion impact to the economy, $3 billion which is completely lost because of the 35-day shutdown.  Your reaction?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Maria, Kevin Hassett, the CEA is working on final numbers for us.  I think his view is that there's no question that there was some cost but those costs will be recovered as money comes back into the system.  I think it's -- he views that it will almost all be recovered.  Now as it relates to the exact numbers, I haven't seen the final numbers yet.  But the good news is we got the government open.</p><p>People are back to work and we have not seen any significant impact on the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Has -- is the President prepared to shut down the government again in three weeks if he doesn't get the money for the border wall?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Maria, I had dinner last night with the President, the Vice President, Senator Lindsey Graham.  We had a very good discussion on this issue.  There's no question in my mind that the President, the Vice President want to do a fair deal.  Lindsey has been terrific in helping to negotiate this.  I hope the Democrats are sincere.  If they are, there's a sincere deal that will include a lot of different issues that need to be resolved.</p><p>But if they're not sincere, the President has all his options on the table.  And he's determined that he's going to make sure we have border security.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's the impact on the IRS?  There's a lot of worry out there that people are not going to get their checks after April 15th as a result of this shutdown.  What can we expect?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, let me just comment on both the treasury, our bureaus, the IRS in particular, I want to thank the enormous number of government employees who came in and worked during the shutdown.  I think as you know, we had the ability to bring in critical employees.  We never would have been able to do the sanctions that we've been doing over the last month without the hardworking people.</p><p>And the IRS had a large number of critical employees to make sure that we were ready to open for business as usual.  So we're ready to open for tax season.  We're taking tax returns.  We'll be ready for tax refunds.  We will have the phones restaffed.  Now, let me just say that there's no question, this time of the year, there's very, very heavy call volume.  That's something we have to manage.  I encourage taxpayers who have questions to try to go to the web first.</p><p>But we are ready for tax season, and I can assure you that tax refunds will be paid as normal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  So, tax refunds will be paid as normal.  That's the bottom line.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  People were worried about that.  Let me move to the sanctions and in particular Venezuela because you've applied sanctions on the Venezuelan oil industry.  Tell us specifically what the impact here is.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, sanctions are a very important tool in our national security portfolio.  And when we look at national security issues, we look at economic tools.  We look at diplomacy.  We look at national security tools, military options.  So there's no question that what we're trying to do is to cut off the money to the regime that should not be in power and make sure that the President Guaido has access to funds and has access to the assets of the country.</p><p>And to make sure we protect these assets for the people of Venezuela.  It's really quite sad.  This is a country that is very, very rich in oil resources that has had extraordinary poverty and extraordinary humanitarian issues over the last issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And have you spoken with the opposition leader party about this?  What has been the response so far?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I haven't personally, but I know the Vice President has been in communication.  I think the response has been very positive.  We've been very careful in balancing this.  We've -- I've spoken to many of the refineries over the last week.  I want to make sure that there was significant capacity.  There's a lot of oil on the water already in transit to the U.S. refineries.  So I think on the one hand, we've been able to cut off Venezuelan oil going forward.</p><p>But we're managing this with the U.S. refineries.  We've issued licenses for the U.S. refineries to continue to operate.  And if Venezuela wants to continue to sell us oil, which we would like to buy that money would go into blocked accounts and will be protected for the people of Venezuela.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what about other industries in Venezuela?  I mean, the sanctions are on the oil industry.  What about other money, other imports that they still get that?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  We will always look at additional sanctions.  We want to make sure that things like medicine and other humanitarian issues continue to go to the people.  We will always look at additional sanctions to make sure we protect the assets of the country for the people of Venezuela.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why was it important for the President to back the opposition leader?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I think he is the rightful leader of the country, the national assembly, the constitution.  I think, you know, democracy is very important to the people of the United States.  And we want to make sure that there are free and fair elections and that there is a proper democracy that's very important to the national security of the United States.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary, it's good to have you on the program.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you very much.  Secretary Steven Mnuchin joining us.  Coming up, earnings in focus.  Major companies reporting this week including Apple after the bell tonight.  What you need to know ahead of those numbers.  Then the U.K. facing a crucial test.  British lawmakers voting later today on measures surrounding the U.K.'s potential exit from the European Union.  Back in a moment with that.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Earnings driving markets this morning.  3M, Harley-Davidson, Verizon out with mixed reports this morning.  Gerri Willis is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange watching markets.  Gerri?</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  That's right.  3M, Dow component, a split decision here missing on estimates beating on revenue.  The EPS line $2.27 a share.  Revenue 7.95 billion.  They lowered their 2019 guidance.  But they say they're positioned for success in 2019 despite the global slowdown.  Stock trading higher.  Harley-Davidson, let's get to that, a big miss on both the top and the bottom line.</p><p>EPS of 17 cents a share.  Revenue of 955 million.  The stock is down and down hard this morning nearly 10 percent.  They're citing restructuring charges, incremental tariffs and recall costs.  Big troubles for the hog.  Verizon beating on EPs but missing on revenue.  We're seeing yet another split decision here.  EPS of a $1.12 a share.  Revenue of 34.3 billion.  The stock trading down nearly four percent here.</p><p>Profit hurt by the restructuring of Oath Media business as we have discussed.  Apple coming after the bell, this is critical earnings release for the markets here.  EPS estimate of $4.17 a share.  Revenue of 84 billion.  We will be focused like a laser on iPhone.  iPhone sales in China, is there an iPhone recession going on in China right now?  Watch Channel Inventory for some of the details about that.</p><p>Meanwhile, Apple having trouble with FaceTime.  A bug where callers can eavesdrop on FaceTime calls has cropped up.  The company says they are checking it.  But you should know that Tim Cook on Monday, well, he was saying big things about International Data Privacy Day asking users to insist on reforms.  Oops, I guess they got a problem.  Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Gerri.  Thanks very much.  Gerri Willis on Wall Street.  British lawmakers will debate several amendments to the U.K.'s planned exit from the European Union today and let Prime Minister Theresa May know what parliament is prepared to vote for.  Ashley Webster is live in London right now with that.  Ashley?</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.  Good morning, Maria.  This is if Parliament knows exactly what it will vote for.  There will be at least 15 amendments to choose from -- will be debated.  That will be up to the Common Speaker John Bercow.  He will decide which ones will be debated.  And it could indeed shape the future of what Brexit will look like moving forward.</p><p>Now, among the most popular amendments that we are expecting to be the debated will be what's called the Cooper amendment, that's Yvette Cooper, the Labour M.P.  It basically says if no deal is reached by February the 26th, it would postpone Brexit for nine months essentially to end of the year from march 29th, that's the date that exists now.  Then there's the Brady amendment, the Graham Brady (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>He basically is putting forward an amendment that would replace the Irish backstop with what is called alternative arrangements, such pretty vague, basically anything elsewhere and what we have now and there is no time limit on that backstop.  We have heard that Prime Minister Theresa May has already told European leaders that she wants to reopen Brexit negotiations.  Let's not forget, just last month, in December, the Prime Minister said it wasn't going to be reopened that the E.U had given her their best deal.</p><p>Now she wants to turn around and say look, you need to reopen negotiations.  I'm going to find out from Parliament what they are prepared to vote for and let's go from there.  And it calls today is January 29th.  The Brexit deadline, March 29th.  We have exactly two months left to go, Maria.  And let's be honest, there is no sign yet of a -- of a deal in place that a majority of people in Parliament can get behind.</p><p>Yesterday we had a whole series of warnings about what would happen if there was a no deal scenario.  Just crashing out retail consortiums saying, look, there's going to be empty shelves, prices are going to go up, a break in the supply chain.  It will be very, very detrimental to the British economy.  So that is the background.  Later on today, we'll find out what Parliament can get behind.  Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Ashley.  Thanks so much.  We'll check back with you.  Ashley Webster in London this morning.  Coming up.  The shutdown impact on your wallet.  I will be speaking with National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow on the economic effects of the shutdown.  Plus Federal debt reportedly headed to the highest level since World War II.</p><p>That is next.  One brewery feeling the impact.  The shutdown hitting one San Diego beer company.  We've got that story.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thank so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo coming to you live this morning from Washington, D.C.  It is Tuesday, January 29th.  Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Earnings season in full swing.  We have heard from Harley-Davidson, hit in the pre-markets after disappointing numbers.  Xerox as well headed higher after beating expectations.  Look at Harley-Davidson's shares down almost 10 percent right now.  China, one of the issues, once again.  Meanwhile rising tensions with China on the U.S. level.  The U.S. bringing charges against Chinese telecom company, Huawei, as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  Moments ago, I spoke with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin who talked about what the U.S. is looking for in the coming talks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MNUCHIN:  The President wants fair trade with China.  It's got to be reciprocal.  Right now, China has free access into our markets and we have limited access to there.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Futures this morning are higher.  Take a look, we have the highs of the morning right here with the Dow Jones Industrial average up 73 points, a third of a percent.  The S&amp;P 500 up 4-1/2, and the NASDAQ higher by 18 points, one-quarter of one percent.  European indices this morning are also higher.  Take a look.  FT-100 in London is up almost 100 points, 1-1/2 percent.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is up 55, better than one percent.  And the DAX Index in Germany up 37 points, that's one-third of one percent.  Asian markets mostly flat overnight as you'll see that was pretty much across the board with Japan and Korea squeaking out a fractional gain.</p><p>Our top story this half an hour, the cost of the government shutdown.  The CBO says about $3 billion out of 2019's projected GDP was completely lost due to the shutdown.  Joining me right now in a FOX Business exclusive is National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow.  Larry, it's great to see you this morning.</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for being here.  So obviously 35 days, government shutdown, CBO says $3 billion is lost.  Never coming back.  Your reaction.</p><p>KUDLOW:  With respect, once again, we disagree with the CBO.  I don't think we're going to lose anything.  This is completely temporary.  None of the incentives in the economy have been changed by this.  You know, that's the key point.  President Trump lowered marginal tax rates on individuals and most especially businesses.  And then he had this massive sweeping rollback of costly and burden regulations, which freed up the whole economy, including the energy sector, which has turned out to be a boom.  Why would we lose something just because of a temporary issue regarding the government?  Now, I'm always interested in sort of counting angels on the head of a pin.  We have about a $20 trillion economy, fair?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  There -- what was their number, three billion out of 20 trillion?  Do you know what the --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Three billion.  Yes, no, you're right.  You're right.</p><p>KUDLOW:  - percentage that is?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I totally understand.</p><p>KUDLOW:  I don't understand why we even mess with it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Actually, they're saying the total impact was $8-11 billion.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But that will come back, except for the $3 billion they say that is completely lost.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, again, with all due respect to the professionals at the CBO, I disagree.  Again, because the incentives in the economy -- here's the big difference between I guess the administration and the Congressional Budget Office and a lot of other forecasters.  We believe the economy is growing at three percent plus.  By the way, the Commerce Department for 2018 has scored I believe 3.1 percent.  We'll get the rest of those numbers in a week or two.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KUDLOW:  The CBO does not.  They never have.  They've never given us credit for the incentive effect of lowering taxes and regulations.  Supply side incentives are kicking in.  If you look at the whole panoply all of the economic data, whether it's very strong Christmas retail sales, whether it's industrial production, manufacturing, the best since the '80s, whether it's business equipment, which means the capex boom is happening that we always hoped for.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KUDLOW:  You'll see in my judgment, at least, the three percent trend line will continue.  CBO and many others have us at two.  But this goes back before the President.  This goes back way before.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  They don't believe the economy can grow.  They don't give any credit --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, even somebody like a Steve Schwarzman will say 4.2 percent growth in the second quarter is very hard to sustain on a $20 trillion economy.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, I'll keep working on Steve Schwarzman.  He's a good guy.  But in a $20 trillion economy, which again will grow rapidly, I see no reason why we can't continue three percent plus.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That's the whole point.  The idea that was sold to everybody I guess going back several years, maybe going back 10 or 15 years, that we're in some secular stagnation is just plain wrong.  With the right set of policies, to unleash --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- American animal spirit --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we saw that with the tax plan and the deregulation.  I totally get that.</p><p>KUDLOW:  And you look at the --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But what about tariffs and trade, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  The -- just one --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because the CBO'S report also brings that up.</p><p>KUDLOW:  One last one on this, the face of the new Trump economy -- I just want to put this in here, it's the thought I've had for quite a while.  These are men and women running small businesses.  These are blue-collar workers.  You look at the evidence, the employment for blue-collar workers, the best increase since the mid to late '80s, when I was a Reagan Cub Scout here in Washington, D.C.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  The wage rates of blue-collar manufacturing autos, they're rising faster than white-collar workers.  This is a direct result --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- of the incentives we've put into the economy.  CBO, again, it's not personal to my friends at the CBO, they don't give us any credit for these incentives.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No, I understand that.  But the --</p><p>KUDLOW:  And I want to stay with that story.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- the report on the trade policies estimated that new tariffs on imports and exports will cut an average of one-tenth of a percent from economic growth through 2029.  What's your take on that, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because we know that these tariffs are in place.  They still are impacting business and uncertainties.  So, is the President prepared to do away with all tariffs if he gets that agreement from the other side?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, I don't want to go there.  I mean, that's going to be his decision as you know.  Vice Premier Liu He is coming and we will have high level discussions Wednesday and Thursday and we're all looking forward to that, as is the President.  The President, as I read him, moderately optimistic about this trade story.  So, that's good.  What was it, one-tenth of one percent by 2029?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  So then here we are in 2019, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, no.  One-tenth of a percent from economic growth through 2029.</p><p>KUDLOW:  See, this is too hard, Maria.  It's way too hard --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- to figure that stuff out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you don't think there's going to be any -- there's --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Could it be possible that there's no impact from the shutdown?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Yes, quite possible.  I never -- it's utterly totally temporary.  So, that's -- let me --- look, let me go back -- the growth potential from China trade, people tend to look at this as a negative.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Look, I don't know the outcome of these talks.  Here's what I know, the scope of the discussion will be the broadest and deepest in the history of U.S.-China trade.  Literally everything's on the table.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Point number one.  Point number two, if China opens its markets --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is a big deal.</p><p>KUDLOW:  OK?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it looks like there's (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>KUDLOW:  Which is huge.  You know, I don't want to predict, and as Ambassador Lighthizer said a million times, and I agree, the enforcement mechanisms are going to be crucial.  But if they were to open their markets as we have requested regarding tariffs and non-tariffs, if they would let American companies own the subsidiary in China, so there's no forced transfer of the family jewels of technology, if we have --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But it --</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- some rule of law regarding I.P. theft, here's my point, open markets will allow the United States to export like crazy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But I understand that, Larry.</p><p>KUDLOW:  And that has been hand -- we've been handcuffed.  If we do that, if we do that, not only will the United States grow faster --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- because of that, China will grow faster.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That all sounds great, but can you actually do that, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Competition is the solution.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's the point, because if you're saying, \"OK, China, we are agreeing that you are opening your markets, and as a result, we will meet your demands, but then they say okay, but you have to have a communist, a government leader on the board of any company that has 100 percent.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Which is -- which is extraordinary, you're absolutely right.  It's extraordinary.  And it's --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So I mean -- so you could say it's great --</p><p>KUDLOW:  And unacceptable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- that you're going to open markets.</p><p>KUDLOW:  It's unacceptable.  It's unacceptable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But they -- aren't they saying that a communist has to be on the board of any company that has 100 percent?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I think that's been the past and I think that's going to be a very hot topic in these trade talks because that is completely unacceptable to us.  No question about it.  We will see how this turns out.  China, unfortunately, you know, they're in a slump.  China's economy is slumping very bad.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  I think part of that slump is a function of the President's tough negotiating with tariffs, when necessary, OK, part of that slump is in the last five to ten years.  China has moved in the wrong direction, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  The market-based reforms have been moving in their own direction.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But they're not market-based.  They are communists and they want communists on the board of -- So I'm just wondering, all of this sounds great, if you can actually get it done.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Oh, I know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Larry, stay with us.  We want to talk to you about other things because the tax plan and the deregulations have worked.  But there are some other ideas coming into play ahead of 2020.</p><p>KUDLOW:  China should not use the Venezuelan form of the economic policy.  We need to go back to who is it that said free market capitalism is the best path to prosperity?  It was the (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, that would -- that would be you and Ronald Reagan.  Stay with us.  We will be right back.  More with Larry Kudlow.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Thank you.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We come to you live this morning from Washington, D.C. and I am sitting with National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow, in an exclusive interview this morning.  And we were talking about China and what you can get done.  How important is tomorrow and Thursday in terms of meeting a deadline, that March 1st, in terms of a deal on the table?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I think's very important.  Look, I --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think you'll get a deal by March 1?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I don't want to predict.  It's just too hard to predict.  And, of course, these are decisions that will be made by the President, who is his own best negotiator.  Best I can is, as I said, the scope of this thing's going to as wide and broad as anything we have ever seen.  That does not ensure positive negotiator.  Best I can is, as I said, the scope of this thing is going to be as wide and broad as anything we've ever seen.  That does not ensure positive outcomes --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- right?  I think everybody, including the President, is basically moderately optimistic about this, OK?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Wait, let me ask you, your tax plan --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Ultimately -- one other thought which the President believes that he and President Xi will probably be the ultimate negotiators.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  OK?  And the work being done tomorrow and Thursday is vitally important to lay out options, OK?  But --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So the President will be involved in these talks tomorrow and Thursday?</p><p>KUDLOW:  That is what he has been saying in our meetings.  And I hope so because he's a great negotiator.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me move on to the tax plan.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because we're hearing a lot of ideas in terms of taxes now, now with a lot of 2020 hopefuls.  The Tax and Jobs Act obviously did move the needle on economic growth along with the deregulation out of this administration.  Now you've got Elizabeth Warren talking about two to three percent tax on the very high wealth people.  So if you have $50 million in wealth, you'll get two percent tax.  If you've got a billion dollars in assets, you'll get taxed three percent.  And you've got Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez talking about tax of 70 percent tax --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- on the highest earners.  What is your take on this?  Give us your reaction and what kind of an impact those policies might have.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Right.  These are prosperity killers, these are growth killers, these are job killers, these are incentive killers.  This is a return to some heavy government planning essentially direct to the economy.  You know, I hate to dwell on this because it's a crisis right now, but take a look at Venezuela, just for the heck of it.  What (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There was a time when that was vibrant -- it was a vibrate country.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That is correct.  That is correct.  And investment was flocking to it.  Then they took, down through the years, really exact measures you're describing that are coming from some of these Democratic candidates --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- and the economy was destroyed.  I mean I hear this notion we have to have equality, equality of income, equality of results, which I think runs counter to all human nature.  You know what?  A place like Venezuela has equality.  Everybody's poor.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think they'll be able to reverse the tax cuts then?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Everybody's poor in Venezuela, except for a hand -- Maduro and a handful of this top military people.  Is that what we want in America?  We are growing right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So will the Dems be able to reverse your tax cut plans?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Never.  Never, not until the President's configuration.  I -- look, first of all, if they want to try to raise taxes, it will be defeated in the Senate, Republican.  I personally believe even if it went beyond that --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- the President would veto any efforts to turn back his program.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How important --</p><p>KUDLOW:  We're doing what people said we couldn't do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But how important is debt?</p><p>KUDLOW:  They said we couldn't grow at three, four percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But how important is debt, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  We're growing at three, four percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Let's not mess with it.  If it ain't broke, don't fix it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Congressional Budget --</p><p>KUDLOW:  There's a tremendous surge in prosperity here shared by the middle and lower middle income people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Congressional Budget Office is saying that the deficit is hit -- set to hit $897 billion this year.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That would be the highest level since World War II.  When does debt become a priority?  Do you think the President, let's say he does have another term, will try to attack the entitlements?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, look, I think right now the two issues are maintaining economic growth.  You know, growth is the single biggest factor in these budget calculations.  Growth brings income and revenues.  And in fact I haven't gone through it with a fine-toothed comb yet, but I will.  I think I see that the CBO is acknowledging that our faster growth, which they did not predict, is now paying for over 80 percent of the tax cuts.  OK?  And I think you'll see more about that as we get through.  The reports just came out yesterday.</p><p>Second point I want to make is we will have a tough spending budget coming up in a few weeks, a very tough spending budget with reductions of at least five percent across the board, in non-defense accounts.  So I think that's going to be very important.  Let's minimize government where possible.  Let's grow the economy to its max.  And you will see the debt burden, which I thought debt, as a share of GDP, will be coming down, and by the way, it already is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  OK.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That's what happened during the Reagan years.  That's what happened during the John F. Kennedy years.  So, I wrote about it in my book.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That -- that's the best way to measure that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But, Larry, you know what I don't understand?  I mean you're all about growth, you have been for all your entire career.  Why are so many people worried about the slowdown?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why are we hearing some people say a recession is on the horizon?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, there's just -- it's funny in this town and I guess a little bit in New York, this is a lot of pessimism.  I don't --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you expect a recession this year or 2020?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I do not.  I don't see it right now.  If I look at financial indicators, credit spreads, the actual numbers, you know, it's just -- we -- GDP will come out a week late because the Commerce Department has reopened.  We've seen stuff like falling unemployment claims, rising manufacturing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But what are the markets telling us, Larry?  In the month of December, there was no high-yield debt issuance at all.  Credit markets are still tight.</p><p>KUDLOW:  They've come back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They've come back a bit.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Come back.  I like that.  Profits, the mother's milk of stocks, I don't know who first that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You did.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Profits, the mother's milk of stocks are rising.  The early indications are they won't to 25 percent but they're going to rise 10, to 15 percent.  I like that a lot.  Interest rates, the level of rates, are historically low.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you're not worried about market volatility?</p><p>KUDLOW:  There's a million things to worry about when I get up in the morning, you know, mainly getting here on time so I could do this great interview.  But I just want to say, if you look at the sum total of all the evidence right now, there's no recession out there.  I am the happy warrior.  I am an optimist.  President Trump is an optimist.  I think America, right now, we are the hottest economy in the world and we should remain so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll end it there.  Larry Kudlow.  Good to see you, sir.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow.  Back in a moment.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The government shutdown may be over, but the effects are still being felt.  Hillary Vaughn is live this morning at a craft brewery in Escondido, California where the shutdown effects are actually still lingering.  Hillary.</p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Hi, Maria.  Good morning.  Craft beer is a $76.2 billion industry, and for many craft breweries, like Stone Brewery, where we are today, the effects of the government shutdown are not over.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOMINIC ENGELS, CEO, STONE BREWING:  When the industry craft is built on seasonal beers, it's built on new beers, it's the new sexy thing, and if we can't get the new sexy thing to market, then we're not going to connect with our fans.  They're going to be disappointed.  We're going to make the sales numbers we planned to make in our financial plans, and these things will have repercussions.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUGHN:  As Federal workers at the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau are finally back in the office, a mountain of paperwork is waiting, about 11,000 applications for alcohol labels have been backlogged leaving craft breweries waiting to ship and sell all their new beer across state line, which means they're in limbo until these approvals go through.  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Hillary.  Thanks very much.  We've be watching that.  Hillary Vaughn.  Stay with us.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  President Trump is tweeting this morning.  He's talking about a former staffer.  Here's what he just said.  \"A low level staffer that I hardly knew named Cliff Sims wrote yet another boring book based on made up stories in fiction.  He pretended to be an insider when, in fact, he was nothing more than a gofer.  He signed a non-disclosure agreement.  He is a mess.  Dagen McDowell, great to see you this morning thank you so much.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  John Hilsenrath, Matt Schlapp.  I don't know why the President tweets this.  He's got how many million view, you know, users and followers.  He just let everybody know who this guy is like --</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, THE AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Well, he literally sat in a -- he sat in a cubicle outside my wife's office in the West Wing, and so it is kind of amazing like this insider whole kind of mythology is something the President knows is not true.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  But he's got some extra sales thanks to that tweet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  That's what I'm saying.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think, Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  Again, everybody's got a book to write.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jim Comey, this guy.  Hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Oh, that was a good answer.  Hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, Jim Comey's book, yes, well, there's -- I think that will be a story that we're going to continue following, Jim Comey and the FBI.  You know what.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Everybody wants to be Norma Desmond, Maria.  I'm ready for my close up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  Thanks, everybody.  Great panel today.

Good morning, everyone, I'm Maria Bartiromo, thanks for joining us live this morning from Washington.  It is Tuesday, January 29th, your top stories right now 6:00 a.m. on the east coast.  Earnings in focus this morning, investors are watching results from several Dow components ahead of the open this morning.  The one to watch after the close is Apple.  We've got everything you need to know this morning previewing the report.  Apple under fire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile, FaceTime hit with a new bug that lets people eavesdrop on you without your knowledge.  How you can fix it, coming up -- big story.  Rising tensions with China meanwhile, the U.S. bringing charges against Huawei as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  The very latest on state of negotiations with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin this morning.  That interview at 8:00 a.m. Eastern, join us for that.  PG&amp;E makes it official, California's largest utility filed to bankruptcy protection, following the massive wild fires.  We've got all the details, coming up.</p><p>Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz roasted.  The billionaire hackled at an event last night as he gears up toward a possible independent run for the White House.  We've got a big show this morning coming from D.C., U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is here, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow is here along with House Minority, California Congressman Kevin McCarthy.  Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell will join me, along with AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka.  Don't miss a moment of it.  We've got a big three hours, coming up.</p><p>And we turn now -- right now, we kick it off with Wall Street markets.  We're looking to see a rebound this morning.  Take a look at Futures actually have just turned negative once again.  Futures down just fractionally, about 6 points on the Dow Industrials; 1-1/2 points lower on the S&amp;P; and the NASDAQ down 13 points.  This, after stocks finished lower yesterday on China growth fears along with weak guidance from Nvidia and Caterpillar.  We told you -- the Caterpillar numbers right here.  And of course, it did worsen throughout the day as investors react to a weaker-than-expected earnings and guidance.</p><p>Joining me right now is Federated Investors Chief Equity Market Strategist, Phil Orlando.  And Phil, it's good to see you this morning.</p><p>PHIL ORLANDO, CHIEF EQUITY MARKET STRATEGIST, FEDERATED INVESTORS:  Thanks for having me back, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All indications that we are seeing a slowdown and worries around China, among other issues, how do you see the markets here as more earnings have come into play?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, you had this 20 percent waterfall decline in stock prices in the fourth quarter of last year, we thought the market was attempting to price in the prospect of recession this year.  Multiples contracted from 18 times earnings down to 14 times earnings.  In our view, there's no risk of recession this year.  So, the rally that we've seen over the last month, 14 percent rally, the market is starting to price in the fact that maybe we're not going to have a recession.  But we've had a 14 percent rally in a month.  That's very, very powerful.  We would absolutely expect some consolidation here over the next month or two particularly as we've got these critical sign posts coming up in the month of March, but as we look out over the balance of the year, we do think that multiples will return to that 18 level, and we're going to end up with a pretty good year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  To what do you attribute the slowdown?  We've got earnings in focus and we're looking at a number of companies out that give weaker-than-expected guidance or miss on the top line.  Lockheed Martin, Pfizer, and Verizon are reporting this morning.  Apple is, of course, out after the bell, so when you look at the earnings picture, where in terms of industry are you seeing the most slowdown?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, I think in a word, uncertainty is what's impacting earnings and guidance to some degree.  You've got the Fed flip-flops that we saw in the fourth quarter last year, the uncertainty about whether or not the United States and China are going to be able to consummate this trade deal.  You've got Brexit overhanging on the global market and certainly the government shutdown, which was up there for 35 days, and it was just temporarily resolved last Friday.  You've got a number of issues there, all of which are impacting companies in some way, shape or form.  So, with earnings up 25 percent year-over-year in the first three quarters of last year, this fourth quarter is a little softer, I think we're up about 13 percent.  So far, we're about a quarter of the way through the earnings season.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>ORLANDO:  And I think what companies are pointing to are some combination of those four issues that I just mentioned.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you mentioned the shutdown.  The shutdown apparently costing the economy $11 billion according to new analysis from the Congressional Budget Office, although Larry Kudlow is disputing that number, and he's going to join us this morning live to talk about it.  The report says that it hit $3 billion, that's one-tenth of a percent of economic activity in the fourth quarter alone.  So, are there sectors that were -- that were hit hardest in that regard, or do you want to look at those companies that are largely tied to the China trade as one area of the real weakness?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the council of economic advisers under Trump had advised us that the shutdown was going to take about one-tenth of one percent out of GDP per week.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, remember, the shutdown started right around Christmas, so that makes sense that we lost, you know, a tenth of a percent in the fourth quarter, you know, maybe a half a percent here in the first quarter.  We're at 1.7 percent GDP growth in the first quarter, consensus blue chip is around 22, 23.  So, we think this pretext a little high and there will be, you know, sort of a downward revision as we get later in the quarter.  But in terms of industries, I think it's really across the board.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Across the board.</p><p>ORLANDO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about technology because it's big week for tech, Apple, of course, the big story today, reporting after the close tonight -- the only big tech reporting.  Microsoft, Facebook out tomorrow, Amazon is out on Thursday.  This is the week that we'll focus on technology and that's where really the growth stories have been.  Would you want to put new money to work in any of these names ahead of their earnings?</p><p>ORLANDO:  Short answer is probably no.  Again, you've had this 14 percent rally here in the last month, you've got concerns about slowing economic growth both in the U.S. and China.  We think that those issues will be resolved as we get into the back half of the year, but right now, you know, why run the risk of putting new money to work after you've had a big rally in some of these names ahead of what could be a disappointing earnings number or perhaps conservative guidance.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, the stock has come down because people were worried about it.  So, we'll see what the numbers are.  Would you, at some point, go back in to tech?  What's your favorite group right now, Phil?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, the areas that we like best in the U.S. markets are energy, financial services, industrials, and health care.  In terms of looking overseas, emerging markets look very attractive to us.  So, the areas that have really gotten hit the most are the ones that we've been attracted to.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there.  So, the valuations are better, I guess, is what you're saying.</p><p>ORLANDO:  The valuations are much more attractive.  We think the fundamentals are still very strong.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Phil, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>ORLANDO:  Great to see you.  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Phil Orlando joining us there.  Meanwhile, a bug in Apple's FaceTime app lets users listen in someone's phone without even the person knowing.  Dagen McDowell, what's happening this morning?  Good morning to you, Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well, Apple has some explaining to do, but particularly on this earnings call this afternoon.  So, there's a bug in the Apple iPhone that would allow people to eavesdrop on FaceTime users' calls.  A FaceTime user calling another person could listen in while the recipients phone is still ringing even if the person never accepts the call.  This was -- it involves several steps in the Group FaceTime feature on the iPhone.</p><p>Apple has disabled that Group FaceTime while it tries to come up with a fix for this, but you can eavesdrop in on somebody, essentially listening through the microphone, even if a person never takes that call, you could eavesdrop on rooms with unattended devices and even receive unauthorized video from the phone.  And again, it would take several steps to do this, but this is coming from a company, Maria, that loves to brag about its privacy protections and even throws shade at the likes of Facebook and other technology companies.</p><p>And adding embarrassment to embarrassment, yesterday was International Data Privacy Day and Tim Cook was tweeting about that.  Here's what he said on Twitter yesterday before this bug, this eavesdropping bug was disclosed.  We must keep fighting for the kind of world we want to live in.  On this Data Privacy Day, let us all insist on action and reform for vital privacy protections.  The dangers are real and the consequences are too important.  Big whoops for Apple, and of course, everything that happens in the business world is a political opportunity.  The Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo had to weigh in on this as well, putting out a statement late yesterday, say, \"Urging FaceTime users to temporarily disable the app.  So, Apple beat him to it, they're trying to fix it.  Embarrassment nonetheless.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible because you don't even know -- I mean, the phone could be ringing and you don't even know that they're listening.  I mean, that's the worst part of it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  I can explain later as the show goes on how this work, but you'd have to place a FaceTime call, go to the group, add yourself to the call and then the recipient of the call would have to hit maybe one like the on-button on the phone in order to activate it, but it was possible, and it was all over the internet yesterday how to do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, if -- so, if it's -- if it's not on and you say -- and you do -- and you decline the phone call, they can't listen in?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Unless you -- but you can't touch the phone at all.  Like, it's not even declining the phone.  Like, if you hit the up -- the up volume button on the phone, and so if I was playing this trick on you, it would activate it, and they could essentially hear what was going on in the room.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Unbelievable.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  I want to hear more about that, for sure.  Meanwhile, there's this, as expected, PG&amp;E filed for bankruptcy protection following those devastating wildfires in California.  Cheryl Casone on that in headlines right now.  Cheryl, good morning to you.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  Well, PG&amp;E is facing roughly about 30 billion in potential liabilities, as investigators are looking into whether the company's equipment played a role in starting California's deadliest fire.  More than 100 people died following a series of wildfires that burned hundreds of thousands of acres over a two-year period.  The utility providing energy service to 60 million people, we should add.  Taking a look at shares of PG&amp;E, look at that, in the premarket down nearly nine percent.  And those loses have actually paired back in the last hour or so, folks.</p><p>Well, China's Vice Premier has arrived in Washington for high-level trade talks that are going to start tomorrow.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and trade representative Robert Lighthizer will attend the two-day meeting.  Yesterday, the Trump administration announced a pair of indictments against Chinese telecom giant, Huawei.  The U.S. is accusing the company of trying to steal trade secrets from T-Mobile.  The Justice Department also charging Huawei with conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran.</p><p>And the China story continues, folks, shares of Nvidia are lower this morning.  The chipmaker is warning investors, and expects much weaker sales thanks in part, yes, to China's slowing economy.  It also previously cautioned the sales of its graphics processors that are used in video games PCs would be disappointing.  The China effect continues.  Chips for video gaming account for more than half of their business, they lost half their market value since hitting their peak back on October 1st, Maria.  So, Goldman Sachs had to come out last Friday, Maria, warning that a lot of these chip companies that have massive exposure to China are going to have really rough reports.  Micron Technology, even Wynn Resorts, the casino company, has got big China exposure, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, for sure.  All right, Cheryl, thanks so much.  Coming up next, five police officers are injured this morning, four of them shot while serving a search warrant.  The very latest coming up.  And then a venti-size disaster for Howard Schultz last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire (BLEEP).</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Former Starbucks CEO having a rough time exploring a 2020 Presidential run as he gets heckled.  We break it down right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Live from Washington, we are eyeing 2020, former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz facing backlash last night on his first stop of his book tour.  It was his first public appearance after announcing a possible Independent Presidential run.  It did not begin smoothly.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire (BLEEP).  Go back to getting ratio'd on Twitter.  Go back to Davos with the other billionaire elite who think they know how to run the world.  That's not what democracy needs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, my goodness.  Schultz is also facing backlash from former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.  Here's what he tweeted: \"In 2020, the great likelihood is that an Independent would just split the anti-Trump vote and end up re-electing the President.  That's a risk I refused to run in 2016, and we can't afford to run it now.\"</p><p>Here with me this morning to talk more about all of that is Dagen McDowell back in New York, Wall Street Journal Global Economics Editor Jon Hilsenrath here in D.C. with me, along with the American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp.  Gentlemen, it's good to see you.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Welcome to Washington.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, thank you so much.  And welcome to presidential politics, Howard Schultz.  What do you think about that?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Well, I'm going to get some popcorn.  This could be a real interesting Democratic primary, and whatever this Independent thing is, don't you love Michael Bloomberg who has probably spent a million dollars on polling, trying to figure out every way to become the President.  Publicly chastising Schultz for running as an Independent when that's exactly what Bloomberg would just love to do if he could.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  You know, on the one hand, Dagen, I feel like there is an opening for an Independent because there's such extremes and radical conversation going on certainly on the left.  And on the other hand, I don't know, how much is a cup of coffee at Starbucks?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Again, that $18.00 cup of Joe, I'm joking, I'm exaggerating.  It's helping --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think it's like $6.00.  I mean, seriously.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, we love cart coffee around this place.  But again, that's helping fund this run.  But Michael Bloomberg -- you know what, Michael Bloomberg should run for the Democratic nomination if he thinks he can win, it's just hilarious to have this multibillionaire lecturing Howard Schultz about an Independent run when actually a cup of Starbucks coffee has more charisma than Michael Bloomberg, number one.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Number two, it's going to be really interesting to see the narrative in the spring of 1992 with Ross Perot was -- Ross Perot was going to divide the Democratic vote, that it wouldn't hurt the Republican.  This could very well -- I mean, it depends on who -- what Howard Schultz says on the campaign trail and how far-left the Democrats go when they're running for the nomination.  But I'll say this, what he said so far about pay -- how to pay for Medicare For All and how that's impossible, I would be really interested to hear him talk about how to fix the health care system, because he might come to the table with some really interesting ideas and force the Democrats to answer the hard questions about paying for this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that is the thing, I mean, this party unfortunately, it's very hard for someone who's a centrist to actually have a shot.  You had Tim Ryan from Ohio, he wanted to do it, he's an economic thinker, he doesn't have a shot because of the same thing, you've got the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's 70 percent tax rate, the loudest voice in the room.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I mean, there's no question that these primaries are starting out very much from the left, you know, you have talk about a wealth tax, and 70 percent high-income tax threshold.  You have Elizabeth Warren who is going around beating up on the banks.  This is definitely a left-leaning primary season that we're going to be going into.  What I find so fascinating is the journeys that these different billionaires are traveling.  You know, you had President Trump who supported a lot of Democrats as a businessman in New York City traveling over to Republican Party, now you have Michael Bloomberg who started out as a Republican Mayor --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- traveling over to the Democratic Party, and Howard Schultz doesn't know where to go.  He doesn't know where he fits in.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He doesn't know where -- and what about Senator Kamala Harris?  Let's listen to her, because she held a CNN Townhall meeting in Iowa last night.  Harris is vowing to eliminate private health insurance with Medicare For All if elected president.  What's your take, Matt?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Making insurance companies illegal.  Look, the Democratic Party has become quite radicalized.  Think about this, less choices for the patient is the solution to our problems.  That seems insane.  Also, do we really think the government, when you get your tags to drive your car, or when you pay your taxes at the IRS, do you really think all the solutions to our problems are there?  I don't.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Let me ask you this, who does President Trump want to see come out of this whole --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think he wants Howard Schultz to run.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think -- he was taunting him yesterday.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH:  No, besides Howard Schultz, among the Democrats, who does he -- who does he want to (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>SCHLAPP:  I think most Republicans -- I'm not going to speak for the President -- but I think most Republicans believe that Elizabeth Warren is so far out there on the loony left, basically Marxism, socialism that I think they find that a delicious opportunity.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Can I --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- call the confiscation, Dagen.  He called it (INAUDIBLE) I mean, this two or three percent tax on assets, confiscation.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It is wealth confiscation.  It's totally communist and then to try and find people when they hand in their U.S. citizenship when other countries come calling, wanting you move there because they won't come and take your hard-earned money.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  One thing I want to point out that Jon Hilsenrath said that Howard Schultz doesn't know where to go.  President Trump should be worried about a Howard Schultz, because what if he comes to the table, like I said, with ideas that appeal to voters in this country who feel left out.  Who left out from the Republican Party and certainly left out by the left-leaning Democrats in this environment.  So, be very, very careful.  And one other thing I'll add with Howard Schultz at that -- at that bookstore, that's just the New York City welcome wagon.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's the way they treat all tourists in this city.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, I think you make a good point because there is that path.  That path of centrism.  I mean, that path of the center, because people do feel like it's gone wacky all the way on the left, for sure.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  It's a centrist country, but don't forget Hillary.  She's making noises.  Maybe that's the President's favorite opponent.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH:  We haven't seen any --</p><p>SCHLAPP:  She's making noises.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  We haven't seen anyone travel that centrist path as an Independent to presidency.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  So, it was a smart move on Howard Schultz's part.  We'll see.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Or a risky one for all those billions --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, certainly risky.  Take a quick break.  Extreme weather warning meanwhile on the other side of this break, millions of people across the country are gearing up for an Arctic blast as temperatures are plummeting, that's next.</p><p>Then showing their cards, British Prime Minister Theresa May asking Parliament to put up its plans from Britain's exit from the E.U.  Details on the historic debate.  And the vote happening later today, back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  It is cold out, and the deep freeze is setting in, hitting millions of Americans with subzero and dangerous temperatures.  Fox News Senior Meteorologist Janice Dean in the Fox Weather Center right now with the very latest.  Janice, tell us about it.</p><p>JANICE DEAN, FOX NEWS SENIOR METEOROLOGIST:  Hi, Maria, yes, we could be dealing with historic lows.  These are current windchills, what it feels like when you go outside and you are not protected.  Dangerous, potentially life-threatening windchills of -41 in International Falls, -18 in Chicago, but we still have another blast behind this.  So, these are morning lows, these are not windchill temperatures: Chicago -25 on Thursday, -31 in Minneapolis, -16 in Detroit.  Again, those are not windchill values.  Those are actual air temperatures.  But with the windchill, in some cases, we could get windchill values of -40 to -50.  If you go outside, your skin is going to freeze in minutes.</p><p>So, here's Chicago, Illinois.  Your all-time record low is -28.  So, we're going to flirt with historic lows, Maria.  This is a big deal.  The good news is it won't be long lasting.  By the weekend, we'll start to rebound, but I also want to make mention with this arctic cold front as we have snow across the deep south.  Snow that could cripple travel across portions of Atlanta, Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, and towards the southeast, so that's another dangerous part of the storm is the -- not only extreme cold but the snow as far as south as the gulf coast.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Janice.  Wow, what a story, thank you so much.</p><p>DEAN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will be watching.  Janice Dean.  Coming up next, the State of the Union is back on, it is February 5th.  Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi extending an invitation to the President, he accepted the offer.  Then, we're taking a look at the enormous cost of the shutdown.  What is the real number?  Plus, place your bets, Super Bowl fans getting ready to throw down an enormous amount of cash.  So, bet on the big game Sunday.  We break down all the numbers.  Stay with us.  Live from Washington this morning.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us.  We are coming to you live from Washington this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, January 29th, your top stories right now 6:31 on the east coast right now.  Earnings season is in full swing, a lot of big names reporting their fourth quarter today.  Xerox and Pfizer set to report in just a few moments, we'll bring you the numbers as soon as they hit the tape, and tell you how they are impacting markets.  Rising tensions with China, the U.S. is bringing charges against Huawei, as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will be my special guest, in about 90 minutes time.  We will break it all down with the Treasury Secretary, coming up.  So, stay with us.</p><p>Meanwhile, Futures relatively flat this morning, take a look at markets, down 20 points on the Dow Industrials, down 4 points on the S&amp;P, down 18 points on the NASDAQ.  We are expecting some pressure at the start of trading this morning, after all the major indices finished lower, yesterday, on Wall Street.</p><p>In fact, at 4:00, the Dow Industrials gave up 208 points, that was almost 1 percent lower, the S&amp;P 500 down 21, that was three quarters of a percent lower, and the NASDAQ with a 79-point decline yesterday, at the close, down better than 1 percent.</p><p>Investors are watching some big news this week, J.P. Morgan, calling this week the most important week of the first quarter, and here is why, you've got earnings, you've got the British vote, you've got U.S.-China trade talks, you've got a Federal Reserve decision, we're not expecting a Fed hike.</p><p>We've got fourth quarter GDP coming out.  And, of course, at the end of the week, the job's report for the month of January, a big week, investors want to watch it and will be covering it all.</p><p>European indices this morning look like this, in terms of trading.  We are looking at gains in Europe.  The FT-100 up one and a quarter percent, 86 points higher, the CAC Quarante in Paris is up a half a percent, 26 points higher, and the DAX Index in Germany, higher by a fraction, as you can see there.</p><p>Asian markets overnight, flat, take a look.  No real moves there, because mover was the KOSPI Index in Korea, up a quarter of a percent.</p><p>Well, there is tragedy in Houston to report, five police officers injured.  Four of them shot, while serving a search warrant.  We have the very latest, coming up.</p><p>And a debate in parliament, British lawmakers set to vote on the latest plan for the U.K. to leave the European Union.  We are previewing that and we will take a look at the impact across the world.</p><p>We've got a big program this morning from D.C., U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is coming up this morning, along National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow, they will take a look at all of these expectations that the economy is slowing.</p><p>Plus, House Minority Leader and California Congressman, Kevin McCarthy, is with us, along with Michigan Congresswoman, Debbie Dingell.  Plus, AFL CIO, President Richard Trumpa, here as well, big show, don't miss a moment of it, big three hours, coming up. And we are kicking off this half an hour right now, with this top story, feeling the effects of the shutdown, Washington, D.C. back in business for now, President Trump will give his State of the Union of Address on February 5th, Tuesday.  The address was originally supposed to be today.</p><p>Even though the shutdown is over, the U.S. is still feeling effects, new numbers from the Congressional Budget Office to report.  The U.S. GDP will be $3 billion lower during the fourth quarter of 2018, because of this shutdown.  On the immigration front, backlogs of immigration courts grew by at least 10 percent, according to Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about all of that is Americans for Tax Reform President, Grover Norquist, Grover, good to see you.</p><p>GROVER NORQUIST, PRESIDENT, AMERICANS FOR TAX REFORM:  Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So, the CBO is talking about a $3 billion-dollar hit, in fact, as a result of the shutdown, Larry Kudlow is having an issue with this.  He says, frequently disagrees with the CBO anyway.  What's your take in terms of what the shutdown cost the economy?</p><p>NORQUIST:  Look, the key thing is that the economy continues to grow and we're looking at a three percent rate of growth for the year, so $3 billion is a big number, unless you compare it to the GDP of the United States in the fourth quarter.</p><p>So, actually, we're doing fairly well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You don't think it had much of an impact then, Grover?</p><p>NORQUIST:  No, it's a small impact and we have a tremendous growth for the year, which is way beyond what the CBO said was possible, when they scored this.  The CBO needs to spend a little more time going back to explain why they were so wrong on all of their recent predictions, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  Go ahead.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Grover, the Federal Reserve and most of the economist that we surveyed at the Wall Street Journal are saying that the economy is slowing down in 2019.  We had a nice burst in 2018 in part, because of tax cuts and in part, because there's more spending, $300 billion of additional spending.</p><p>But now, they say the economy is slowing along with the global economy, what does that say about the impact of these tax cuts, are the tax cuts really created the long-run growth that Republicans said was going to happen?</p><p>NORQUIST:  The tax cuts do two things.  We were at 35 percent rate, which is the highest in the world.  It made sense for an American company like Burger King to be bought by Canadian company, because even though they're selling the same hamburgers, the same number of employees, it was worth more, because we had a worldwide tax system at 35 percent.</p><p>By taking 35 down to 21, we became competitive with Europe.  I mean, our friends, the Germans were at 25, the Japanese were at 25.  I'm sorry, the Japanese were at 30.  The Chinese were at 25.  And we were at 35.  We weren't even close to being competitive.  It's a huge change in the direction for the country.</p><p>And if the CBO tells you they're pessimistic, they didn't think you could do three percent, they laughed at three percent growth, said you could never do more than --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  The question is, is that three percent growth.  I think a lot of people understand that the corporate tax rate was uncompetitive, even some Democrats wanted to lower their corporate tax rate, but the question is, this new tax code that we've got, is that sufficient to sustain the three percent growth in 2019?</p><p>NORQUIST:  It's a good first start.  We also need to do something about the workforce.  We need more workers and frankly, there's more tax reduction that needs to be done and spending restraint is very important at the end of the day.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  I want to go back to this question about a shutdown, Grover, which is, people are saying, they're almost using the reason why you couldn't cut government, because somehow, that would have a negative impact on our economic growth.  That seems like a very dangerous road to go down.</p><p>Isn't it true that all of this money that they are saying didn't get put into the economy, are you worried that the government actually won't spend all of that by the time that the authority over the money, expires?</p><p>NORQUIST:  For the government to -- I was taught this (INAUDIBLE) economics in college also.  The government takes your money, and then spends it.  It's much better for the economy than if it lets you spend it.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Right.</p><p>NORQUIST:  Because you would waste some of it by investing it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because they can spend money better than you, of course.</p><p>NORQUIST:  And that's the oddest thing because, of course, that's nonsense.  East Germany should have done very well, under this theory, but it doesn't, so --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  What the government is doing is borrowing other people's money and spending it, right?  I mean, we're talking about deficits that are nearing a trillion dollars.</p><p>NORQUIST:  The (INAUDIBLE) cost the government is how much the government spends, whether they borrowed or take it, it's still gone from the -- from the real economy.  The cost of government is total government spending.  We should have taxes low, and then the least destructive way possible, all taxes are somewhat destructive.  And you have less borrowing if you have less spending.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what about all of these new plans?  And by the way, we are getting earnings right now, as we're talking 3M and Xerox, both beat expectations, although 3M is cutting its forecast for the year.  What about all of these ideas about taxing the wealthy?  New York Congressman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez claims for a 70 percent marginal tax rate on the tippy top, as she calls it.</p><p>Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts senator, hopeful, for 2020, two percent tax on Americans whose assets exceed 50 million.  If you're a billionaire, three percent, what's the impact?</p><p>NORQUIST:  OK, magicians like to do this, so you're not looking at, you know -- watch my right hand, don't look at the left hand.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NORQUIST:  The reason they talk about high tax rates on rich people, is that they want to gouge the middle class.  The difference between the United States and Sweden, Finland, Denmark, the countries that Cortez talked about is, they don't have the 70 percent rate, just back up for sec -- there isn't a country in the world with a 70 percent income tax rate.</p><p>Many countries used to, the Beatle song, 19 for me, one for you, 95 percent tax rate, and then the Beatles moved to United States, and everybody who could pay tennis, left Sweden.  And all the countries of the world realize that tax rates that high were stupid and destructive and didn't help equality or growth or anything like that.</p><p>So, they got rid of them.  The whole world got rid of them.  We did it, it was stupid.  We back offed it and had strong economic growth as a result, so 70 percent stupid and destructive.  It's not America saying, the world says that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You probably showed the op-ed today, in the Journal, in California, and taxes as well.  The Journal, this week, by Cypress founder, T.J. Rodgers, which was very good, Another California Tax Grab, he writes.  In it, the politicians have fueled an affordability crisis that drives away businesses and exacerbates homelessness.</p><p>California Governor, Gavin Newsom, called for even higher taxes in his inauguration speech earlier this month.</p><p>NORQUIST:  California is a good example of 70 percent play.  They have a 13 percent rate on people making a million dollars, but they have 8 percent rate on people making $42,000.  So, they want the middle class people in California to think you're OK, because we're really screwing the other guy.</p><p>And point of fact, Florida has a zero percent first income tax, Texas has a zero percent first income tax, 8 percent looks good compared to 13.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NORQUIST:  Looks lousy compared to zero percent.  They want the middle class to think somebody else is paying the freight.  That's why they have those phoney high tax rates that don't raise much money.  It's to fool the middle class.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it is talking point, and it works for the populist.  Let me bring in Dagen McDowell on this, because we hear this every time we go into the tax discussion and we have a Democrat on which takes out another one of those talking points on taxes, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And I want to say that Senator Kamala Harris said that the first thing -- she said it last night, in the town hall, he first thing she do is to cut taxes for the middle class.  Well, roughly half this country pays no net federal income tax, number one, and the Republicans just did that particularly, doubling the standard deduction.</p><p>So, I don't know who she's going to cut taxes for.  But this is the ruse and this is the big liberal lie that all of these big new welfare state initiatives, whether it's green energy, even single payer, it's all going to be paid for by the super rich.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And that it's not going to be -- that the paying won't be spread across every person in this country to fund this welfare state.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And by the way, the numbers don't add up even if you tax all the rich, you're not going to get the amount of money you need for this green deal, Grover.</p><p>NORQUIST:  You don't even balance the budget if you do that, never mind half money for new things.  Look, the big difference between United States and Denmark, United States and Sweden, it's not how much money higher income people pay, it's what happens to middle-income people.</p><p>Denmark, Finland, Sweden, the tax rate on middle income people is 10, 15, 20 points higher than an American middle class person.  And, you add to that the value added tax.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NORQUIST:  The difference between United States and Europe is how heavily taxed middle income people are, and they have those (INAUDIBLE) high rates that very few people pay, to make people in the middle class think that they are getting a deal.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Speaking of middle income tax -- a lot of Democrats want a carbon tax, gasoline tax and even some big American business.  That's the way to address the issue of climate change.  Do you see any path towards a carbon tax that would be acceptable to your point --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I guess, but real quick, Grover.</p><p>NORQUIST:  No.  No, absolutely not.  And the reason is, you can look at Washington State, very deep blue Washington State.  They have twice had it on the ballot and twice defeated a carbon dioxide tax, gasoline taxes lose overwhelmingly.  This is too obvious tax on middle-income people.  It's a loser up.  They are having this fight in -- our dear friends in France or loggerhead down the subject.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We know how that played out.</p><p>NORQUIST:  We had the Ontario government and the Alberta government collapsed as a result of this, and three times, in Australia.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Grover, thank you.  Yes.</p><p>NORQUIST:  Bad politics and lousy economics.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Grover, thank you for the facts, we appreciate it, Grover Norquist, joining us there.</p><p>Five officers injured in a shooting in Texas, meanwhile, Cheryl Casone in New York, with the details, there.  Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  That's right, Maria.  Four officers were shot and another officer suffered a knee injury in Houston.  They were serving a search warrant at a suspected drug house.  Police say two of them were hit in the neck.  Those officers are in critical but stable condition.  Two suspects were killed at the scene.</p><p>Well, a key E.U. negotiator, warning the risk of Britain leaving the European Union without a deal, is very high, as parliament votes on amendments in Theresa May's exit plan today.  Lawmakers set to consider more than 10 different amendments before taking votes.  That's going to be at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>And those votes come after May's plan to leave the European Union was overwhelmingly rejected earlier this month, a lot of those votes against her from her own party.</p><p>Well, Americans will be betting an estimated $6 billion on the Super Bowl, that's according to the survey by the American Gaming Association.  About 22.7 million U.S. adults plan to place a bet on the upcoming Atlanta game, of those bets, 94.47 percent, reportedly illegal, but let the games begin, Maria, and those are your headlines.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Be there to watch it all, front-row seat.</p><p>CASONE:  I'm there for you, Maria.  I've got surprises for you, coming up.  You're going to love them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK, looking forward to it.  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, crisis in Venezuela to take a look at, new sanctions have been placed on the country's oil.  Plus, National Security Advisor, John Bolton, may have inadvertently revealed the administration's next move.  Why his notes are raising eyebrows this morning.</p><p>Then, farming in America, why farmers are being forced to rent water.  That's up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A look at some of the big headlines across America this morning.  The Chicago Tribune reporting on the Pension Agency criticizing Sears Chairman Eddie Lampert's plan to acquire the bankrupt retailer.  The article explaining that the agency sets to takeover Sears.  Pensions objects to the bid, calling it the final fulfillment of a year-long's scheme to deprive Sears and its creditors of assets and its employees of jobs while lining Lampert's on owns pockets.</p><p>The Daily Camera in Colorado, reporting on how Boulder County farmers are increasingly renting water.  The report explains how ownership from agricultural interests has dropped from 85 percent in the late 1950s to just 30 percent.  The water increasingly moving to municipal control.</p><p>And the Mercury News writing that how in one California city you can text 911 for emergency help.  According to the paper, the police department there announced that the service is now available in the city.  It is meant to help people who are hearing or voice impaired.  The police are also recommending that you not send emojis.  Well, yes, I would think not.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  What are we coming to?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  My God, but it is good that you can text 911.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  That's a good step, just don't text person emoji.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, crisis in Venezuela new sanctions placed on the country's oil, plus National Security Advisor John Bolton may have inadvertently revealed the administration's next move, why his notes on his legal pad are raising eyebrows this morning?  We're breaking that down when we come right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A framework for peace.  The U.S. and Taliban negotiators making a preliminary on key issues to end the war in Afghanistan -- the longest war in American history.  The two top points American troop withdrawal and insurgence vowing to end terrorist attacks abroad, that's according to the Wall Street Journal.  Many hurdles remain to ensure the peace is in place.  Joining me right now is Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst, General Jack Keane.  General, it's always a pleasure to see you.</p><p>GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST:  Good to see you, Maria, and welcome to Washington again.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  And what do you think about this?  I mean, are we supposed to be trusting the Taliban?</p><p>KEANE:  No, we can never ever trust the Taliban, that doesn't mean that we can't have a treaty with them.  But here's what I think is going on, a couple of things have changed: one is the Taliban in the last couple of years have gone all out as we have so dramatically reduced our forces, thinking that they will going to be able to overthrow the regime, because the only thing the United States is really doing is training and assisting the ground forces -- no longer doing the fighting, however provide an air power.  That didn't work.  They retook some territory but never took capitals or provinces and they never took -- they never able to secure a province.  So, what has happened?  The war stalemated.  The Taliban cannot take over the government and the government cannot defeat Taliban, even with our assistance.</p><p>Second thing, and this is crucial, Pakistan has gotten involved in this in a way they've never have before.  They forced the Taliban to go to the peace negotiation table, why?  Pakistan knows it's no longer in national interest to keep this thing stalemated.  There's growing al-Qaeda and growing ISIS presence in Afghanistan which gives the Pakistanis some concern.  So, those are the new things that are happening.  That's why the negotiations have some momentum.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's the thing, though.  I mean, so many people were worried when the president said: we were withdrawing the troops.  And where do you stand on that now?  I mean, do you feel better about it given this peace deal?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, let me answer it this way -- I mean, it is an essential question: the Taliban themselves, we are trying to get an agreement with them that, one, they'll stop trying to overthrow the government and number two, they'll power share with them and also, they will assist in taking down the al-Qaeda and the ISIS.  I don't think we can trust them to do that, based on the fact that they provided safe haven for Osama bin Laden for almost 10 years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  So, what do we do?</p><p>KEANE:  So, we leave in place, after we bring out the troops that are providing the training and assistance.  We leave in place a counterterrorism force and an intelligence capability indefinitely.  We're doing that in Yemen, we're doing it in Libya and we're doing it in Africa.  The one in Africa is off the coast.  It's a Maritime Joint Task Force.  That is what we need to do, that is the guaranty against the Taliban because the issue in Afghanistan has always been, we would never intervene in the civil war in Afghanistan between the northern alliance and Taliban for one reason only, we didn't evade, because they attacked the United States.  That's the reason we're there.  We don't want that to happen again and we cannot trust the Taliban to provide that guarantee for us.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, let me move on and ask you about sanctions on the Venezuelan oil industry.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin who will be here shortly this morning along with Security Adviser John Bolton, explain the decision in a briefing yesterday and issued warning for disputed President Nicolas Maduro.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN BOLTON, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR:  The president has made it very clear on this -- on this matter that all options are on the table.</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY:  There's no reason why these resources shouldn't be used for the economic benefit of the people there.  There's no reason for the poverty and the starvation and the humanitarian crisis.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to this announcement yesterday?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, increased pressure on Maduro regime is certainly a welcome thing.  I mean, this really comes down to the loyalty of the military to Maduro.  As long as that loyalty is there, it's unlikely that Maduro is going the leave.  If that loyalty starts to fall apart, I hope we're working a 'plan b', which is engineering right now some kind of exit path for Maduro, where he can go into exile with recriminations in Venezuela.  The Reagan administration did this very successfully on Ferdinand Marcos, back in 1986, overwhelming popular opposition to him, hundreds of thousands of people.  We engineered his exit.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me squeeze in this question before you go general.  This image from the briefing going viral and it shows John Bolton's notepad with the notation: \"5,000 troops to Colombia.\"  Whoa, do you think we should be sending troops to the region?  What do you think about this?  Caught on camera.</p><p>KEANE:  Look, when we deposed Noriega in 1989 operation just cost Panama, 26,000 troops, is what it took.  When we deposed a dictator in Haiti, 28,000.  The ease of troops that would only be in there, move into Venezuela, if there's a problem at the embassy to our diplomat.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How significance is revealing such a secret?</p><p>KEANE:  I think he'd probably wanted to reveal it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  General Jack Keane, good to see you sir.  Thank you so much.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Show: MORNINGS WITH MARIA][Date: January 29, 2019][Time: 07:00:00][Tran: 012902cb.231][Type: SHOW][Head: Interview with Rep.

Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo coming to you live this morning from Washington, D.C.  It is Tuesday, January 29th.</p><p>Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>It is a busy day on the earnings calendar this morning.  3M among the Dow components reporting their fourth quarter.  The company cut its forecast for 2019.  Pfizer also cut this morning.  The stock under pressure this morning after the guidance came in below expectations.

Join us live as the Treasury Secretary will join the program, coming up.</p><p>Markets are under pressure this morning.  Futures pointing to a lower opening for the broader averages although right now it is more like a flat showing than lower.</p><p>The Dow Industrials are up 3 points right now.  S&amp;P 500 pretty much flat, up a quarter point.  And the Nasdaq is down 4 points.  It's been back and forth on futures this after declines across the board yesterday, of course.</p><p>Stocks finished off of the lows of the day but nonetheless, the Dow Industrials were down 209 points, almost 1 percent.  S&amp;P was down 20.  The Nasdaq was down 79, better than 1 percent lower.</p><p>Global markets this morning.  Take a look at European indices, higher across the board.  This right here, this is the high of the morning.  FT 100 up 1.5 percent, 97 points higher.  CAC 40 in Paris up 39 points, almost 1 percent.  And the DAX index in Germany up about 20 points right now.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets were little changed, pretty much across the board as you can see.</p><p>Well, the date is official now with the government back open, President Trump will give his State of the Union address one week from today.

Take a look, the social media service eyeing a major change to better compete with Instagram.  We'll tell you all about it coming up.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning.  And joining me to break it all down -- Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell in New York; the \"Wall Street Journal's\" global economics editor Jon Hilsenrath here in D.C. with me; and the American Conservative Union chairman, Matt Schlapp.  Great to see you -- guys.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Great to be here.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen -- good morning to you.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning.  We were talking about the shutdown.  So it's over for the time being.</p><p>The Democrats have actually been hurt by it as well.  Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows that positive feelings about the Democratic Party have fallen to 35 percent this month.  That's down 4 percentage points since December.  And that is essentially in line with the positive feelings that people have about Republicans.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean that's a really good point because the President really did not get hurt certainly on his base, from his base, by the shutdown.  What do you guys think?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Two things.  First is that the President's base was actually energized that he would make a spending fight.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Remember, immigration is a spending fight because if he can stop illegal immigration or reduce it, you don't have all these social services costs.</p><p>But the second thing is, the President's brand is that he will fight, he will fight harder than any politician on the field and he reiterated that brand.  So if he can increase that reputation, I think it appeals to Independents.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They said dig in.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  But isn't his brand also -- it's about fighting and continuing to fight and winning.  And he didn't win the wall in this case.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  I don't agree with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We don't know if he won the wall yet.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  There's three steps to this - -</p><p>HILSENRATH:  In this case, right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  In this case.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  -- there's three really important things.  Number one, the bill he signed has $1.3 billion in barrier funding annualized.</p><p>Number two, he's got to exhaust all legislative efforts if he's going to go the emergency route in order to have a good case in court.</p><p>And number three, the American people when it comes to immigration, he is on the right side of this policy argument.  And Democrats who are against border security, they're going to be sorry for this eventually.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  But you know what.  You better be --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, go ahead -- Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- but you better be careful about what you do and this goes to all politicians because I was flying on Friday and that was an utter nightmare.  If you want to anger everybody in the electorate, you pull another fast one like that where people are grounded and you've got an hour and-a-half plane flight where you're at 8,000 feet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But who are you blaming?</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They were blaming (INAUDIBLE) and blaming the Democrats because --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They were blaming everybody.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- Nancy Pelosi dug in.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They were blaming everybody.  But TSA agents down in Raleigh, Durham were going to food banks because they were spending what little money they had on gas trying to get to and from work.  So again, I don't care who is responsible for it.  They're all responsible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, businesses did start, you know, putting the uncertainty out there, sitting on cash, making decisions later.  We know.  I mean the SEC closed, can't get any IPOs through.  FDA closed, got to worry about obvious food shortages or food issues.</p><p>So we were beginning to see some real impact.  And Dagen saw it firsthand at the airport.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  That's true.  But if you're a federal employee in this town, let's face it, you make a little bit of a bargain.  Yes, every year you might have to go through a shutdown with your salary.</p><p>But you know, the other thing, Maria, that we don't talk about, it's almost impossible to fire a federal employee.  There's some pretty cushy gigs --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good point.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  -- in THIS town where you basically have an insurance policy against ever getting fired unless you do something just awful.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  And you can read all the GAO reports that's backed that up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're talking about all of that this morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But there are people barely making ends meet who are trying to drive to work, and spending all their money on gasoline and going to food banks who were working for the TSA and not getting paid.</p><p>And when the Republicans stop thinking about them and start talking about the workers who aren't needed, the ones who are furloughed you have really missed the boat.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, maybe.  But how about the fact that we've got a border wall in Nancy Pelosi's state?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that immoral, the wall that separates Tijuana from San Diego --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  But --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- is that immoral?  I don't think so.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They need to start asking all of these Democrats who think that the wall is immoral or don't want to fund it, ok, let's take down the walls that are there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's how you put --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will the three million people in Tijuana assimilate with the three million people in San Diego if that wall is torn down?  I think so.  And we're going to talk about that this morning.</p><p>We've got a big show this morning from D.C., live.  Coming up Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is here, live.  National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow has a thing or two to say about the CBO protections about what exactly the impact is on the economy from that shutdown.</p><p>House Minority Leader and California Congressman Kevin McCarthy will walk us through what these next three weeks look like with his colleagues in terms of this negotiating on border wall funding.</p><p>Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell is here.</p><p>Along with AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka.</p><p>Don't miss a moment of it.  A big two hours coming up.</p><p>And we kick it off this hour right now with markets.  Futures are pointing to a flat opening this morning amid all of this uncertainty over China trade, earnings.  It's an enormous week this week.</p><p>This after stocks finished to the downside yesterday on the China growth fears, the weak guidance from Nvidia and Caterpillar as well, and of course these worries about what happens with China and the U.S.  There's conversations happening tomorrow.</p><p>Joining us right now is the founder, CEO and chief investment strategist at Mainstay Capital Management David Kudla.  David -- good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>DAVID KUDLA, FOUNDER/CEO/CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, MAINSTAY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So we've been talking about what a week this is with the fourth quarter earnings coming out.  That's been pretty much driving the story.  We have a jobs report coming out at the end of the week on Friday.  Brexit discussions, the vote today.  U.S./China discussions tomorrow.  A fourth quarter GDP number.  How do you want to invest with all of this?</p><p>KUDLA:  I think investors should be looking at stocks right now that they want to own.  We've been invested through -- the past month has been very good for stock investors.  13 percent rise through Friday from the lows of December 24th.  And that's in both growth stocks and value stocks, so a broad market advance.</p><p>We're going to see some give and take here now after this nice advance of last month but investors should be picking, you know, their points here, have their list out on stocks they want to own.  We look for a good 2019 for stock investors.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is it good news, Jon Hilsenrath, that the Fed gave us a pivot that we know that the Fed is on pause right now and that we know that they're even ready to consider slowing down the unwind of the bond portfolio?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  I don't think it's good news.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I think it shows that the Fed is becoming less confident about how strong and sustainable the economy is.  I mean it is a sign that inflation isn't picking up and that's good news.  But you see some real trepidation coming out of the Fed right now with the global economy slowing, with markets being unstable and volatile.</p><p>I think the Fed is a little worried about the outlook and that shouldn't really give us a lot of encouragement.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about that, David?  I mean the economy's slowing.</p><p>KUDLA:  But Jon this -- yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLA:  But John -- the important thing here is what happened in the fourth quarter is we had mixed messages out of fed chair Jerome Powell.  We had on October 3rd we were far away from neutral.  Then by November we were close to neutral rates.  Then on the 16th in the Fed meeting they were going to do what's right no matter what.</p><p>Then he came in on January 4th and finally said we're going to be considerate of market and economic conditions and now we're seeing a more consistent and accommodative message out of the Fed.  And that's very important for the markets.</p><p>That's music to the market's ears and that's why we've now seen a sustained advance.  So the markets and investors are now looking at a Fed that seems as though they are going to be considerate of or accommodative or take into account what's happening with the markets, with the economy, and not just normalize rates for the sake of normalizing rates.</p><p>They won't have $50 billion rolling off the balance sheet on auto pilot and they won't raise rates just to raise rates to get to a normalized rate structure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that was the worry in the fourth quarter.</p><p>KUDLA:  -- in pause like in 2016 if the market and economy warrants it.  That's important.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That was they worry in the fourth quarter -- that they were on auto pilot-- Jon.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  Yes, I make two points.</p><p>KUDLA:  That drove volatility in the fourth quarter, the Fed.  .</p><p>HILSENRATH:  David makes a really important point, you know.  So this has been Jerome Powell's first year at the Fed.  He's had a bit of a honeymoon with the market.  And then what the market has discovered in the last month or two is that Mr. Powell, you know, he kind of prides himself on being a plain-spoken communicator but his communication has confused a lot of people in the market.  And he's really had to do a lot of corrections over the last few weeks --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- so that raised some questions about him.</p><p>But the other thing about -- you know, the market wants to see the Fed on an easier path.  Ok.  But the underlying message there is that this economy can't sustain very high rates.</p><p>So it doesn't send a really encouraging message about economic growth and the economic outlook when we see that the Fed is starting to recognize it just can't sustain a tighter monetary policy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But look, we're getting the news from the companies themselves with the fourth quarter numbers coming out.  Verizon just reported mixed earnings.  They beat on earnings, but they missed on revenue.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Caterpillar.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Technology reporting late today, Apple.  And we heard from Apple already.  Facebook, Amazon -- all reporting this week, Microsoft.  It's going to be a big week for technology.  And of course you mentioned Caterpillar.  That was the big kahuna yesterday that really set the tone for the markets because Caterpillar is a great indicator of economic activity across the world, in particular China.</p><p>So stay on earnings for a second, David.  Give me your take on technology.  Because you've got Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft coming out this week.</p><p>KUDLA:  Well, you know, tech stocks got beat up very bad in the fourth quarter.  They've come back in this rally and we think that tech stocks have further to go.</p><p>Look, we think that investors should stay with tech stocks.  We have an opportunity here to add value stocks to the portfolio.  Cyclicals came into 2019 at their lowest valuation relative to the S&amp;P 500 ever.</p><p>So investors now can diversify their portfolio in an opportunistic way, holding both growth stocks.  Those tech stocks that we think still have some rebound and some further runway ahead of them, and by adding value stocks that are very opportunistic.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  David -- it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>KUDLA:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Still bullish on this market.  David Kudla joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, the State of the Union is back on, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi extended officially the invitation to President Trump to do the State of the Union in the House Chamber.  He accepted the offer.</p><p>Plus we're taking a look at the enormous cost of the shutdown, what exactly is the number?  A lot of people say it wasn't very much at all.</p><p>Then, Snapchat's unthinkable change, how the photo sharing app is attempting to compete with Instagram by changing a key feature.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>New revelations in the sexual misconduct claims against the former CEO of Wynn Resorts.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with headlines now in New York -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Maria.  The \"Wall Street Journal\" is reporting that executives at Wynn Resort ignored allegations of sexual misconduct by Steve Wynn over more than a decade.  According to a regulator's report Wynn was accused of sexually assaulting or harassing salon workers, cocktail servers and flight attendants who worked for his company.</p><p>Under a proposed settlement, the Nevada Gaming Control Board won't try to revoke Wynn's regulatory licenses but Wynn is going to pay a fine.  Steve Wynn has denied any claims of misconduct.  There's a one year chart of Wynn's in front of you right there.</p><p>Well, Snapchat has named Lara Sweet as its interim CFO.  This is another shift in leadership at Snap as the company has lost several high profile employees over the last year.  Meanwhile Snap is reportedly considering allowing longer lasting or even permanent videos on Snapchat.  It will apply the Snap shared publicly on this story's features.  Snap is down 52 percent from one year ago.  There's that chart for you.</p><p>Well, Porsche is speeding past Tesla in a fast charging race.  The car maker says it new Porsche Taycan is going to be able to add more than 60 miles of charge in just four minutes.  That will be the fastest available today, exceeding Tesla's super charging stations which needs about 30 minutes to charge a vehicle's battery to at least 80 percent.  Charging times are a key selling point obviously for these car makers and now Porsche is giving Taycan owners three years of free charging.</p><p>And obviously we're going to be hearing from Tesla this week, Maria.  Earnings are coming out from Elon Musk and company.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Cheryl -- thank you so much.</p><p>Coming up next, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi challenged over her words describing a border wall as immoral.  We will break it down when we come back.</p><p>Then support on the links, fans rallying around a pro golfer whose two shot penalty was deemed unfair.  More on that.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Keeping America safe, the government is back open but the focus now is whether President Trump can make a deal with Democratic leadership on funding for the border wall.</p><p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has called it immoral, any wall is immoral.  But her home state of California protects the southern border in some places with an actual wall -- the wall separating Tijuana and San Diego.</p><p>Joining me right now is Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell.  And the last time you were on you said you wanted to look at this again.  Congresswoman -- it's good to see you.</p><p>REP. DEBBIE DINGELL (D), MICHIGAN:  It's good to see you.  Welcome to Washington.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.</p><p>What's your take on this?  I mean can Nancy Pelosi really get away with calling a wall immoral when she has a wall in her own state, separating Tijuana from San Diego?</p><p>DINGELL:  Here is what I think is going to happen.  You've got strong countries (ph), both sides of the aisle, both houses.  They're going to go into that room and they want to cut a deal that's going to keep our nation safe.  I don't think anybody wants to see what we just went through for 35 days.</p><p>It hurt the economy.  It hurt -- and I do believe -- this is going to sound corny but I don't -- you know, why do we point -- why do we need to have a Trump win, a Pelosi win.  We need an American win.</p><p>So I'm hoping they're going to go in that room.  I've talked to my colleagues on both sides.  I've talked to Roy Blunt.  I've talked to all my Democratic colleagues in the House.  They want to win.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DINGELL:  They want to go in and put together a package that's going to keep --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So how do you win?  What's the position in terms of wall funding?  Because they may very well -- your colleagues may very well come back and say ok, here's $5 billion towards border security, not a dime toward a wall.</p><p>DINGELL:  I don't know -- if people are really working together, that may not happen.  You know, there may be money, if there are appropriate places for a wall or fence or --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is there a movement within your party, do you think, among your colleagues that they feel that, yes, some money should go for an actual barrier?</p><p>DINGELL:  I think what I hear among my colleagues is let's go into a room and do something that makes sense.  Let's come up with -- we need to -- I've said this to you a million times.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DINGELL:  We need to strengthen our borders at both sides.  Everybody talks about the southern border.  I've got this northern border too which just had a huge human trafficking problem again in the last few --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But there are areas of the southern border that are very dense.  In other words like when you just look at the wall in Nancy's state and that is three million people on one side in Tijuana, three million people on the other side in San Diego.  If you tear that wall down -- I mean isn't it obvious many of the people on the Tijuana side will assimilate into the United States?</p><p>DINGELL:  Then let me ask you this question.  Build a wall, tear down a wall -- are there structures that are working that are in place?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  .</p><p>DINGELL:  So that's -- what I do think we need drones.  We need to fill the 3,000 open patrol --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's common ground, both sides believe in that.</p><p>DINGELL:  Both agree --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Technology and drones -- definitely.</p><p>DINGELL:  We need technology.  We need to make these ports safer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Specifically in a dense area, like Tijuana/San Diego, drones wouldn't work.  I mean maybe you want that in addition to a wall.  When you have such a dense area, where there's three million people on one side of the wall and three m million on the other, don't you need an actual barrier?</p><p>DINGELL:  But they are going to go in this room.  There are people that know what they're doing.  They're people -- they're senior people that have been on homeland security, people from the areas that are impacted --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think they're going to deal?  We won't shut down the government again?</p><p>DINGELL:  I pray to God, we never shut down the government.  Not only do I pray to God that doesn't come out of conference but you're going to see Republicans and Democrats working together.  We'll get --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This whole wall issue, Congresswoman, sort of underscores what's going on I think in both parties.  Now you've got former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz seeing an opening as a result of the radicalness on both sides.</p><p>He's facing backlash on his first stop for his book tour last night.  It was his first public appearance after announcing a possible Independent presidential run.  It did not go smoothly.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire (EXPLETIVE DELETED).  Go back to (INAUDIBLE) on Twitter.  Go back to Davos with the other billionaire elites who think they know how to run the world.  That's not what the country needs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  You know, I give you a lot of credit just being in politics, by the way.</p><p>Schultz is also being criticized by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, billionaire.  He tweeted this, \"In 2020 the great likelihood is that an Independent would just split the anti-Trump vote and end up reelecting the President.  That's a risk.  I refused to run in 2016 and we can't afford it right now.</p><p>Congresswoman -- do you think an Independent run is viable?  Do you think an Independent run from Schultz would hurt the Democrats?</p><p>DINGELL:  I think it's viable.  He has the money to spend it.  But I think he would hurt the Democrats.  I'm fearful that I am -- I'm trying to step back.  I'm not getting any candidate I want to see who is going to emerge, who's got people skills.</p><p>But this is dangerous.  And as you know, told you two years ago, Donald Trump could become president.  Nobody believed me.  You all thought I was crazy.  You may not have but most people did.</p><p>And I still think he could get reelected.  And if we do not run a strong campaign and we don't have somebody like that that pulls votes off --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  One of the issues is the messaging of what the platform is.  So what do you think the Democratic candidate for 2020 should have as their platform?  What's most important?</p><p>DINGELL:  You know what we didn't do and one of the reasons I believe firmly that President Trump became President Trump.  One, people are tired of partisan bickering.  They're tired of seeing things not get done in Washington.</p><p>There are a lot of people that are hurting in this country, just working men and women who want to know that we actually care about them.  They're scared about healthcare.  They're scared about escalating drug costs.  There's -- look at our --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So healthcare should be the platform?</p><p>DINGELL:  it's one piece of it.  Infrastructure, let's create jobs.  What are we going to do about education?  Trade?</p><p>Now, the President -- you want to know why he won Michigan?  Trade.  They're tired of bad trade deals that ship jobs overseas.  We don't have a level playing field.  The President's trade policy is all over the place.</p><p>It's not consistent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you going to vote for the ratification of USMCA?</p><p>DINGELL:  I don't call it USMC.  I call it NAFTA 2.0.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you going to vote for ratification.</p><p>DINGELL:  I haven't decided yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is on your plate now in the next month.</p><p>DINGELL:  Very much on my plate.  And talk to Lighthizer about it all the time.  But I'm not voting for any bill that doesn't have and acting legislation that keeps more manufacturing from going to Mexico.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wasn't that one of the key things of this new law?</p><p>DINGELL:  But Blazer still went to --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Keeping jobs here.</p><p>DINGELL:  Blazers went to Mexico in July.  I'm not seeing any more American cars go to Mexico and get built for $1.50 to $3.50 and then gets shipped back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you want a change before you vote for it?</p><p>DINGELL:  He knows how I feel.  I'm not -- one of the more likely people to vote for it but I'm not voting for it in the form that it's in right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.   We'll leave it there.</p><p>Congresswoman -- it's good to see you.</p><p>DINGELL:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.  Congresswoman Debbie Dingell joining us here.</p><p>Coming up, the longest government shutdown in American history is over.  But another shutdown threat is on the horizon.

The new teaser trailer for \"Toy Story 4\" drops with a big surprise.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Tuesday, January 29th.  Your top stories right now at 7:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Earnings season in full swing this morning for the fourth quarter.  Several Dow components reporting their fourth quarter this morning.  Verizon reported a mixed quarter earlier this hour.  Pfizer and 3M also under pressure this morning as you can see.  3M up three percent, although Pfizer and Verizon down better than one percent.</p><p>Rising tensions with China continuing, the U.S. bringing charges against Chinese telecom company Huawei as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning between the two nations.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will be joining me as my special guest this morning at the top of the hour, 8:00 a.m. Eastern.  Join us for that talk on China and the economy as we break it all down with the Treasury secretary.</p><p>Markets this morning are hovering around the flat line.  Take a look.  Dow Industrials up 20 points right now, 26 higher.  The S&amp;P 500 is down by almost one point and the NASDAQ down about three points.</p><p>All this after the major indices finished lower yesterday across the board at 04:00 on Wall Street.  Dow industrials were down 208 points and then actually was off of the lows of the -- of the day, down almost one percent at the close.  S&amp;P 500 gave up 21 points, that was three-quarters of one percent.  And the NASDAQ was down 79 points, better than one percent lower.</p><p>In Europe this morning, a mixed story, actually mostly higher.  FT-100 at the high of the morning right here, up 1-1/4 percent, 83 points higher, ahead of the British vote on the U.K. leaving the E.U.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is up 42 points, almost one percent higher and the DAX Index in Germany higher by 25, quarter of a percent higher there.</p><p>Asian markets mostly quiet overnight.  Take a look, as you can see, it was pretty much across the board.</p><p>$100,000 penalty, how one misstep cost a professional golfer big time.  The outcry, coming up.</p><p>And Woody and Buzz Lightyear are back, the new teaser trailer for \"Toy Story 4\" is out and it marks the return of one character after 20 years.  We will bring it to you.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning.  But first, our top story this half an hour, shutdown showdown, the government open for business again after the last -- at least for the next three weeks, rather.  But the main issue, funding the wall has not been resolved and the White House is not letting it go.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  What I do know is that if they don't come back with a deal, that means Democrats get virtually nothing.  That will make the president and force him to have to take executive action that does not give Democrats the things that they want.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is the House Minority leader, Congressman Kevin McCarthy.  Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you.</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  Thanks for having me back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So, what do the next three weeks look like?  Take us through these negotiating.  Do you expect any money for the wall?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  I expect us to solve this problem in the end.  What's interesting here is the whole time speaker Pelosi said I couldn't negotiate anything until you open up government.  The president put the public first and said OK, let's go through, I'll give you three weeks.</p><p>Now Wednesday, we'll have the conference committee, the senators and the congressional members' appropriation sit down and we'll see if they're serious about it, if they're willing to do something.  Because I believe Nancy Pelosi is out of step with her own party.  If you look at her number two, Steny Hoyer.  He said of course, that walls are not immoral, and that he believes some fencing involved.  From her Agricultural secretary to her Agricultural chair to our Armed Services chair, they both believe in a wall too.  Her Agriculture chairman said give Trump the money.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and she continues to say that it's immoral which I find incredible given the fact she has a wall in her own state.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  As my state too.  You know what I find --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And your state too, exactly.  California.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  You know what I find immoral?  When you really talk about this, this is about stopping human trafficking.  In 2016, they stopped more than 2,000 individuals involved in that.  I think it's immoral that you would allow that to continue.  I don't believe anybody in America that says they support border security believes that there is no such thing as some barrier.</p><p>And the president said, he does not a -- he does not want a wall from sea to shining sea.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  He just believes in the area you need some form of barrier and he's correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, where do you think are the most important areas that you would need the wall?  I mean, we talked earlier about this wall in your state, Tijuana, San Diego where it's very dense, three million people on one side, three million people on the other.  Can you make the case that that dense area is elsewhere where that's why the president is so stuck on having this wall there?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  And it's not the president saying, it's the experts.  The president sat down with the experts and they said this is what we need to be able to secure our border.</p><p>So in certain areas, like in San Diego, we stopped illegal movement by more than 95 percent.  You look at Yuma, Arizons, El Paso another -- El Paso became one of the safest cities in the nation after being able to put it through.  That's what we need, in certain parts of the country along the border, you need a barrier.  In other parts you could put the drones in this part area.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what are you expecting to give on?  And what -- do you think they're going to offer the $5.7 billion that the president wants for border security?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  But we're arguing over one-tenth of one percent of the budget.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a great point.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  The Democrats have voted for a wall before.  But now that the president brings forward what the experts want, they say no.  That is what's so confusing to me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, what -- why is this so important for the president right now?  Going into 2020, I mean, is she seeing this as a campaign promise and that's why he doesn't -- she won't agree to it.  Because I don't know how she can call it immoral, given the wall in her own state, your own state.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Again, it's such a little price to pay for so much more security when you look at the human trafficking.  Think of the number of lives that we will save from this process if we have a secure border.</p><p>But what's more importantly, it's the president that sat down and tried to be reasonable, find common ground.  He's the one who brought DACA into it.</p><p>And let's not forget, speaker Pelosi just a year ago holds the record for the longest speech on the floor, eight hours, over one issue, DACA, which she shut the government down over.  And now she thinks that's not important?  I think those people are important as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think that this -- a negotiation, an agreement will include a DACA deal?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  It could.  It doesn't have to.  But because the Democrats and speaker Pelosi have been saying no.  The president said he was willing to go there, three more years of DACA for a portion of the border security that the experts are asking for.  I just find her out of step with her own party.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, there seems to be a movement within the party, even some of the newer congress people coming in, fresher faces saying you know what, yes, we do need border security and we do need the money.  So, are they going head to head?  I mean, are they -- do they even have a voice?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  They don't even have a voice.  Because remember, she has so much power.  She will not allow the vote to come up.  I believe inside the conference we could come up with an agreement.  The question is, will speaker Pelosi even allow that to be voted on the floor?  If we had a vote on the floor, I believe it would pass.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think that the president will allow the government to shut down again?  I mean, is the president really prepared to have another government shutdown if he doesn't get the money?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Look, I think the president's going to try to find a way to solve this one way or another.  I don't know that shutting the government down solves it.  I there's other ways to do that the president can.  I know he firmly believes in a legislative process.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Should he call for a national emergency?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  He has the power to do that.  I think the best road forward right now is a legislative agreement.  And what's so interesting to me, I'd listened to these Democrats celebrate Nancy Pelosi.  You celebrated someone that got you status quo.  They're still a DACA problem, they're still a border security problem.</p><p>And government is designed to find common ground and compromise.  The president was the one person looking reasonable in all these discussions.  I know the president's committed to this.  He will get the border secure one way or another.  He's giving the Democrats an opportunity.  He gave them an opportunity all along this discussion.  They said then open up the government, they'll discuss it.  So he did that and gave them a three week time.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean, I think this whole thing, the government shutdown and the constant resist upsets people.  I mean, you have to wonder if in fact -- you know, she keeps resisting everything that the president wants, if the people will turn on her.  Because people want to see you guys get something done.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Yes, she is celebrating status quo.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  That's not where we need to be --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me move on and ask you about 2010, congressman.  Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz thinking about running for office.  He was at a book signing last night in New York and he was heckled over his bid.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump.  You egotistical billionaire (INAUDIBLE).  Go back to getting ratioed on Twitter.  Go back to Davos with the other billionaire elites who think they know how to run the world.  That's not what the country needs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This heckler not the only one weighing in.  Michael Bloomberg former mayor of New York City also told Schultz not to run as an independent.  He said this, given the strong pull of partisanship and the realities of the electoral college system, there's no way an independent can win.  That is truer today than ever before.  Is that where we are, an independent can't win, congressman?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  No, I think it's Bloomberg upset.  Because remember, he went from a Republican to an independent to a Democrat and he just spent $120 million giving to the Democrats so they can win the majority in the House and he doesn't want his money to be wasted, so he doesn't want competition.</p><p>Look, I think there's ample opportunity for an independent to get in this race, only because the Democrats are now become social Democrats.  They're talking about a 70 percent tax rate.  They're talking about these green deals.  They're talking about socialism.  If you listen to what some of these new Democrats say, they think Venezuela's problem is not because they're a socialist country, it's because of sanctions.  They're so out of step.  They are putting letters in to help those who want to go sign up for ISIS, to be easy on them to the judge.  I mean, I have -- this is not the America we live in, and that's the difference.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  This party is so out of step and I think you'll find a lot of moderate Democrats who say I want somebody else who could talk about this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, that's why a number of moderate Democrats can't really get the OK from the party leadership because they're not left enough.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  This new socialist Democrat Party has left the Democratic Party.  They are in to -- remember, Bernie Sanders is not registered as a Democrat.  He's registered as a socialist.  AOC does not call herself a Democrat, she calls herself a Democrat socialist.  This party is moving to a whole different place.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Real quick before you go, when the election happened back in November.  You said one of your priorities going to be to get the majority back.  How are you going to do it?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Well, first of all, you've got to make sure you can recruit.  I think, you put the ideas up there.  Ideas should win at the end of the day.  You look at where we are financially in this country.  A lot of that happens to do with the policies that we're able to create, from the tax policy, the battle we had with you human trafficking and other that we were able to do.

Congressman Kevin McCarthy, joining us there.</p><p>Still ahead, Richard Trumka AFL-CIO president on the impact of the shutdown on American workers, what he'd like to see, back in a moment with that.</p><p>And then, support on the links, a pro golfer given a big fine and a two-shot penalty which many are calling grossly unfair.  What went wrong, right here.</p><p>Plus, you've got a friend and a big surprise, the trailer for \"Toy Story 4\" drops with a character we haven't seen in 20 years.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Prosecutors resting their case against Joaquin El Chapo Guzman.  Cheryl Casone in New York with details and headlines, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It; must something else, Maria.  The federal government has now rested its case.  They called 56 witnesses.  The trial of the notorious Mexican drug kingpin started back in mid-November.  El Chapo told the trial judge yesterday he will not take the stand in his own defense.  One witness is scheduled to appear for the defense today.  Closing arguments expected to take place tomorrow and Thursday.  Big story, a lot of New Yorkers have been following very closely.</p><p>Well, professional golfer Haotong Li is getting a huge outpouring of support from fellow golfers after losing out on nearly $100,000 Saturday for a minor infraction.  It happened at the Omega Dubai Desert Classic.  Li was on the 18th green when judges accuses caddie of standing too close behind him as he got ready to putt.  Well, the ensuing penalty dropped Li's score from 71 to 73.  And he went from third to 12th.  Tour officials say the correct call was made but acknowledge it was grossly unfair.  They're looking at the giving referees more discretion in cases like this going forward.</p><p>And then, get ready for \"Toy Story 4\".  Pixar is putting out this teaser video, shows the revival of Woody's love interest, Bo Peep.  And she is back with a new, more modern look.  She was last seen in \"Toy Story 2\", back in 1999.  It is now 20 years later, \"Toy Story 4\" is going to be released, Maria, this June .  Those are your headlines from New York, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like it.  Bo Peep.  All right, thank you Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, the lingering effects of the shutdown showdown.  AFL-CIO Richard Trumka will join us to talk about the impact on American workers.  He's up next.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We are focused on the American worker this morning.  White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney saying that the 800,000 federal workers who were not paid twice during the partial government shutdown should receive those checks by the end of this week.</p><p>Joining us right now is American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organization's president, AFL-CIO, Richard Trumka.  It's great to see you, Richard.  Thank you so much for being here.</p><p>RICHARD TRUMKA, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR AND CONGRESS OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION:  Maria, thanks for having me on today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Give us your take on what the impact of the shutdown was.</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, I think there's several impacts.  There's impact on the people and you not only have government workers who get back pay but you have the government contractors who won't get back pay unless something is done.  That was a devastating effect on them.  It had a devastating effect on the economy itself.  $11 billion, although we'll pick some of that back up later in the year.</p><p>But you had a devastating effect on the airline industry where you had people, airline controllers, traffic controllers that were in school that actually just up and left.  They said we're not going to do this anymore (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What could -- what could have been done about it then, Rich?  Because you as the leader that you are and representing so many workers across the country have to be unnerved when you see open borders and illegals coming in and taking your jobs.</p><p>TRUMKA:  Look, that's just not how it works anymore.  I mean, you have people that got laid off from the president's place that have been here 20 years.  They're not taking anybody's job.  What we want to do is make sure every worker in this country has the same rights so that they can't be exploited.</p><p>Because what happens right now with undocumented workers is, they're great when no one's around.  When they try to organize and get a voice, then they start squeezing them.  They start ex -- you know, doing, calling in ICE and different things.</p><p>The idea is if everybody has the same rights, then they can't exploit those people and everybody can actually have a fair playing field.  What happens to American workers -- employers right now, is you have an employer that hires people, makes them work in unfair condition, misclassifies them, underpays them, and they're competing against our employer.  That employer needs to pay everybody the same rate, live by the same working conditions, so that we can all compete.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you're OK with illegals coming in and as long as everybody's treated the same?</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, Maria, it's a -- it's a nice cliche, illegals coming in.  But you know yourself that most people that are here undocumented or illegally came in legally.  So the whole system needs to be addressed.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, but there are apprehensions that we could look at, just in the month of December, just in the month of November, where apprehensions were of illegal immigrants coming in and wanting asylum in the United States.</p><p>TRUMKA:  There's no question that the system is broken.  We need to fix the system and have a path towards citizenship so that those workers that have been here for years and are actually making the economy run, even the president's golf courses and things like that, they have a chance to get citizenship and they work their work there.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Just a question on the golf courses.  As you know, that's the H2B program, people who come here as foreign workers, come under a specified amount of time for DOL.  I think the real question is is that, what happens to all the people, not who have been here who came legally and overstayed the visa, but what about all the people who come every day at the southern border and can cross into our country?  That's really the pernicious problem.  And even on wall, built with American workers, you'd be for that.</p><p>TRUMKA:  But listen, the people that come back and forth, you have Americans that go to Mexico and Mexicans that come to America to work.  I think Mexico --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you don't think there's a problem at the border at all?</p><p>TRUMKA:  I didn't say that.  There is -- there is a problem.  We do need border security.  And no, I don't think that a wall's the answer to it.  Every time someone's tried to build a wall it's not been very successful.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, the one in Tijuana is successful.</p><p>TRUMKA:  Ask the Chinese, ask the French.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The wall -- the wall in Tijuana --</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Ask Tijuana (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tijuana and San Diego, what abut that Richard?</p><p>TRUMKA:  I'm sorry?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The wall, between Tijuana -- separating Tijuana from San Diego, is that successful?</p><p>TRUMKA:  There are places -- there are places probably where it works.  Is that the answer to everything?  No.  Should that have been the reason for a shutdown?  Absolutely not.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  I want -- I want to ask a broader political question.  We've seen in the last two elections that increasingly voters, blue collar voters, voters in manufacturing towns all over America, the kind of rank and file people that you represent are voting for Republicans, they're going for Trump.  Does the AFL-CIO need to realign its own approach to politics in this town, given that more and more of its people are going with people like Donald Trump and his trade policies and the Republican Party?</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, that's a -- that's a question we could talk about two or three hours for.  First of all, we have realigned our politics.  We are issuing -- we're issue oriented right now.  We put an issue out and if a politician supports that issue, then we support them.</p><p>In fact, in this last election we elected two union members to the Senate, three to governorship, 18 to the House of Representative, and 925 to state legislatures, because those workers will go and support our issues.  That's what we try to do.  We find it more and more difficult to find Republicans that actually support us.  Now, the American worker believes that neither the political system --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got to jump.</p><p>TRUMKA:  -- or the economic system works for them.  They want somebody to change the rules.  That's why they voted for Trump.  If he changes the rules to their advantage, some of them will vote for him again.  If he doesn't, he stands a chance of losing those workers and right now he's losing those workers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Richard, thank you so much for joining us.  We appreciate it.  Richard Trumka there.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Show: MORNINGS WITH MARIA][Date: January 29, 2019][Time: 08:00:00][Tran: 012903cb.231][Type: SHOW][Head: Apple Disables Group FaceTime Function That Was Allowing Callers To Listen And View Without Your Consent; British Parliament To Vote On Brexit Amendments; Kudlow on the Economy; Craft Brewers Impacts from the Government Shutdown; Kudlow on China Trade][Sect: News; Domestic][Byline: Maria Bartiromo, Gerri Willis, Ashley Webster, Hillary Vaughn, Dagen McDowell][Guest: Steven Mnuchin, Larry Kudlow, Matt Schlapp, Jon Hilsenrath][Spec: FaceTime; Huawei; Apple; Brexit; Federal Reserve; 3M; Harley-Davidson; Verizon; Oath Media; Channel Inventory; World War II; CBO; Trade Talks; Deregulations; Tax Plan; China Trade; Slowdown; Government Shutdown]</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good Tuesday morning.  Welcome back, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  Live from Washington this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is January 29th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  Earnings in focus.  Investors watching results from several Dow components this morning ahead of the opening bell.  One to watch after the bell tonight -- after the close is Apple.</p><p>Meanwhile, Apple under fire FaceTime hit with a new bug that allows people to eavesdrop on you without your knowledge and even if you don't take the call.  Rising tensions with China, the U.S. brings charges against Chinese telecom company, Huawei as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  The very latest on the state of negotiations with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin coming up.</p><p>Markets are searching for direction this morning.  Take a look at the futures ahead of the open this morning.  Dow industrials picking up speed up 55 points right now, a quarter of a percent higher.  S&amp;P 500 is up two and the NASDAQ right now right now showing a gain of 11 points at the open in about an hour and a half.  This after declines across the board yesterday.  Stocks finished off of the lows, but nonetheless the Dow Industrials gave up 209 points yesterday 4:00, almost one percent lower.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 gave up 21 points, three quarters of a percent lower.  And the NASDAQ was down 79 points.  That was better than one percent lower yesterday.  Global markets this morning are mostly higher.  Take a look at European indices with the FT-100-is at the high of the morning, up 86 points, 1-1/4 percent ahead of the vote on Brexit.  CAC quarante in Paris us up 44 points and the DAX index up 21, fractional gain there.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets were little changed.  Take a look, it was pretty much across the board.  Now, our top story this morning, concerns of a global slowdown.  Last week in Davos I spoke with Bridgewater Associates founder, Ray Dalio, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, and Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey.  Here's what they said about the possibility of an economic slowdown on the horizon.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RAY DALIO, FOUNDER, BRIDGEWATER ASSOCIATES:  Europe has a negative growth and the United States is going to have a negative growth environment.  I don't mean absolute negative, I mean slowing of growth in a material way that could be close to between zero and two percent over the next 18 months.</p><p>BRIAN MOYNIHAN, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, BANK OF AMERICA:  We have the top research firm in the world, and they have done a great job.  And they have the U.S. growing at 2-1/2 percent this year.  The world growing 3-1/2 percent GDP growth.  But that's down from last year.  And so the confusion in the environment right now is a slowdown or is it going in to a recession?</p><p>Nothing we see says it's close to a recession.</p><p>JAMES QUINCEY, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, COCA-COLA:  I think we are in danger of talking ourselves into a problem.  It's just a little bit slower growth.  It's not a recession or a decline.  So we see -- we see a little -- a little softer 2019, maybe a little less tail wind than 2018.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now in a Fox Business exclusive is the treasury secretary of the United States, Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  Great to see you, Secretary.</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, UNITED STATES TREASURY SECRETARY:  Great to see you as well, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.  Your reaction to really what seems like now a unanimous feeling that a slowdown is on the horizon.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, Maria, from everything we see, the U.S. economy is still quite strong.  The companies are doing quite well.  And we see still tremendous investment in capital and human investments.  There's no question that as it relates to Europe and China, there is a slowdown.  We're monitoring that carefully.  But we still see a tremendous opportunity and a lot of capital coming into the U.S.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Federal Reserve basically told us they are on pause.  They may even pause the balance sheet unwind which is also telling us that the Fed is also expecting a slowdown, but do you believe a recession is on the horizon in 2020 even though you're seeing strength and stability so far?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  We see no indications whatsoever of a recession on the horizon.  And from everything we see from speaking to a large across the board businesses, the combination of tax reform, regulatory relief and trade is still has a very strong impact on the U.S. economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And some people are saying that the impact of certainly of trade and tariffs is causing some uncertainty.  So how much of this slowdown that we're expecting later on even if it's not right now is due to what you say you're watching China and Europe and how much of it is uncertainty around the President's tariffs program?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, Maria, as you said, there are people who expect a slowdown but I would just comment a year ago with the projections were 2-1/2 percent.  And we were at three.  We feel very comfortable we're going to hit three for last year.  And we think there's still a very good case for three percent this year.  Now, as it relates to trade, we couldn't be more pleased with the USMCA.  We are looking forward to Congress passing that quickly.</p><p>That's a very important trade deal.  We have two days of talks with China starting tomorrow.  The President is going to be involved in those talks at the conclusion.  We've been updating him.  We have another 30 days after this.  So I think we're making significant progress, and I think on the trade front, these are all very positive impacts for the U.S. economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about the trade talks because this story of China, first off, thank you to the President and to the administration for pushing back on China because that's another unanimous feeling out there, that the President did the right thing in terms of stopping China from some of its practices.  What are you expecting out of these talks?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, the President wants fair trade with China.  It's got to be reciprocal.  Right now China has free access into our markets, and we have limited access to there.  So the critical issue that we've talked about is market access, making sure there aren't forced joint ventures, not forced transfer of technology and that we have a mechanism that when we reach an agreement that we can monitor that agreement and that they'll live up to it.</p><p>And that's how I expect we will make significant progress this week on those issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How much of a priority is espionage?  Obviously the administration unveiling a sweeping set of criminal charges against Huawei Technologies.  We have had on a number of CEOs that have said yes, they have stolen trade secrets from us.  Has this come into the conversation with your Chinese leadership?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  No, let me be clear.  Those are separate issues.  And that's a separate dialogue.  So as it relates to the Huawei issues that's being run by the Justice Department.  I have no involvement in that.  I found out about that yesterday when it was announced.  So those are not part of trade discussions.  Forced technology issues are part of trade discussions but any issues as it relates to violation of U.S. law or U.S. sanctions are going through a separate track, which is the Justice Department.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, I guess the broader issue is, is this a cultural thing in China?  I mean this weekend on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" over on Fox News I spoke with the ranking member of the Intel Committee, House Intel Committee Devin Nunes and he went through some of the practices that China does every day.  Listen to this.  I've got to get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  China might have accessed allied intelligence shared with Poland and passed it on to Moscow.</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R), CALIFORNIA:  What the Chinese are doing is that they have these companies that are essentially owned by the party, the Communist Party and essentially this is a dictatorship.  There's very few people that own these companies.  They weaponize the.  So when all over the -- all over the world you have Chinese technology specifically as it relates to infrastructure on -- communications infrastructure, they will go in and they beat every other company around the world.</p><p>And in fact, they've driven a lot of companies out of business because they come in undercut.  They want to have control over all the com systems or communication systems all over the globe.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's pretty incredible.  We will handle your infrastructure of telecom and then they have a way in of spying.  How can you separate that from the conversation on trade and on forced transfer of technology?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Maria, I think you can easily separate these issues.  So there are two different issues.  One is an issue of state subsidies where they do subsidize state enterprises and they compete unfairly.  Those are trade issues, those are violations of the WTO and that's something from an economic standpoint.  We are going to enforce very seriously.  I think you know among the National Security Council, so I'm going to be careful what I say on national security issues.</p><p>But I assure you whether it's China or anywhere else in the world, our security services, DHS and others will make sure that we protect the U.S. infrastructure, we protect from cyberattacks.  That's something we're very well aware of.  But these are separate issues and shouldn't be confused.  We are focused on what are unfair economic practices.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So the best case that you can get from China is what?  Opening up their markets?  Already we are seeing some likelihood of that, UBS I guess was the first bank that was allowed to operate in China and own 51 percent of that bank.  They say they're going to go to 100 percent in three years.  Are you seeing a significant opening in terms of the Chinese willingness to open their markets to foreigners?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I do, but I think that's a good start.  But why should we have to wait three years for a U.S. company to own 100 percent in the financial services?  China can operate and own 100 percent of companies here.  So that's an example where, you know, they're moving in the right direction.  We want to speed that up.  But the issue is really we want to make sure that U.S. companies can compete fairly in China.</p><p>And if we can do that, China has a very large growing middle class.  It's an enormous market.  As I have said before, this is one of the biggest opportunities for U.S. companies in U.S. business if we can get this right.  And President Trump is determined.  This is the first administration that has aggressively said to China, you need to play fair.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is the President willing to drop all tariffs, should he get a good deal that's acceptable?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I think everything is on the table.  So the President is -- will look at, again, the objective is to have a very fair deal.  Hopefully we'll make progress this week.  The President will be involved in these negotiations and discussions.  And we've still got a lot of work to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the President said look, I'm a tariff guy.  I like tariffs.  So does that mean these tariffs are for, you know, no end in sight or would he be willing to drop the tariffs all together?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  The President hasn't made any decisions on that.  There have been no recommendations from the economic team on that yet.  The first step is to make sure we get a good agreement.  And when we get a good agreement, we'll make a recommendation to the President and he will consider that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have seen the Chinese economy get impacted.  You're still talking about 6.4 percent growth, we think, but that is lower than some people think.  What's your worry or how concerning is it that the Chinese slowdown will impact the United States?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, there's no question that China is slowing down.  They still have significant growth rates.  We're beginning to see the impact on that on world growth.  Our objective is not to slow down China.  Our objective is to make sure that U.S. companies can do business in China and can do business fairly.  So we're monitoring these issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary, stay with us.  We want to get into the shutdown and get your impact on how much the shutdown cost the economy and what you're expecting there.  Stay with us.  More of my exclusive interview with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin when we come right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are life live this morning in Washington, D.C.  And I'm sitting right now with -- in a Fox Business exclusive with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  And Treasury Mnuchin, we were talking about the broad economy.  I want to ask your thoughts on the shutdown.  The CBO says that the shutdown caused $11 billion impact to the economy, $3 billion which is completely lost because of the 35-day shutdown.  Your reaction?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Maria, Kevin Hassett, the CEA is working on final numbers for us.  I think his view is that there's no question that there was some cost but those costs will be recovered as money comes back into the system.  I think it's -- he views that it will almost all be recovered.  Now as it relates to the exact numbers, I haven't seen the final numbers yet.  But the good news is we got the government open.</p><p>People are back to work and we have not seen any significant impact on the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Has -- is the President prepared to shut down the government again in three weeks if he doesn't get the money for the border wall?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Maria, I had dinner last night with the President, the Vice President, Senator Lindsey Graham.  We had a very good discussion on this issue.  There's no question in my mind that the President, the Vice President want to do a fair deal.  Lindsey has been terrific in helping to negotiate this.  I hope the Democrats are sincere.  If they are, there's a sincere deal that will include a lot of different issues that need to be resolved.</p><p>But if they're not sincere, the President has all his options on the table.  And he's determined that he's going to make sure we have border security.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's the impact on the IRS?  There's a lot of worry out there that people are not going to get their checks after April 15th as a result of this shutdown.  What can we expect?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, let me just comment on both the treasury, our bureaus, the IRS in particular, I want to thank the enormous number of government employees who came in and worked during the shutdown.  I think as you know, we had the ability to bring in critical employees.  We never would have been able to do the sanctions that we've been doing over the last month without the hardworking people.</p><p>And the IRS had a large number of critical employees to make sure that we were ready to open for business as usual.  So we're ready to open for tax season.  We're taking tax returns.  We'll be ready for tax refunds.  We will have the phones restaffed.  Now, let me just say that there's no question, this time of the year, there's very, very heavy call volume.  That's something we have to manage.  I encourage taxpayers who have questions to try to go to the web first.</p><p>But we are ready for tax season, and I can assure you that tax refunds will be paid as normal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  So, tax refunds will be paid as normal.  That's the bottom line.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  People were worried about that.  Let me move to the sanctions and in particular Venezuela because you've applied sanctions on the Venezuelan oil industry.  Tell us specifically what the impact here is.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, sanctions are a very important tool in our national security portfolio.  And when we look at national security issues, we look at economic tools.  We look at diplomacy.  We look at national security tools, military options.  So there's no question that what we're trying to do is to cut off the money to the regime that should not be in power and make sure that the President Guaido has access to funds and has access to the assets of the country.</p><p>And to make sure we protect these assets for the people of Venezuela.  It's really quite sad.  This is a country that is very, very rich in oil resources that has had extraordinary poverty and extraordinary humanitarian issues over the last issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And have you spoken with the opposition leader party about this?  What has been the response so far?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I haven't personally, but I know the Vice President has been in communication.  I think the response has been very positive.  We've been very careful in balancing this.  We've -- I've spoken to many of the refineries over the last week.  I want to make sure that there was significant capacity.  There's a lot of oil on the water already in transit to the U.S. refineries.  So I think on the one hand, we've been able to cut off Venezuelan oil going forward.</p><p>But we're managing this with the U.S. refineries.  We've issued licenses for the U.S. refineries to continue to operate.  And if Venezuela wants to continue to sell us oil, which we would like to buy that money would go into blocked accounts and will be protected for the people of Venezuela.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what about other industries in Venezuela?  I mean, the sanctions are on the oil industry.  What about other money, other imports that they still get that?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  We will always look at additional sanctions.  We want to make sure that things like medicine and other humanitarian issues continue to go to the people.  We will always look at additional sanctions to make sure we protect the assets of the country for the people of Venezuela.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why was it important for the President to back the opposition leader?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I think he is the rightful leader of the country, the national assembly, the constitution.  I think, you know, democracy is very important to the people of the United States.  And we want to make sure that there are free and fair elections and that there is a proper democracy that's very important to the national security of the United States.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary, it's good to have you on the program.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you very much.  Secretary Steven Mnuchin joining us.  Coming up, earnings in focus.  Major companies reporting this week including Apple after the bell tonight.  What you need to know ahead of those numbers.

The company says they are checking it.  But you should know that Tim Cook on Monday, well, he was saying big things about International Data Privacy Day asking users to insist on reforms.  Oops, I guess they got a problem.  Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Gerri.  Thanks very much.  Gerri Willis on Wall Street.  British lawmakers will debate several amendments to the U.K.'s planned exit from the European Union today and let Prime Minister Theresa May know what parliament is prepared to vote for.  Ashley Webster is live in London right now with that.  Ashley?</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.  Good morning, Maria.  This is if Parliament knows exactly what it will vote for.  There will be at least 15 amendments to choose from -- will be debated.  That will be up to the Common Speaker John Bercow.  He will decide which ones will be debated.  And it could indeed shape the future of what Brexit will look like moving forward.</p><p>Now, among the most popular amendments that we are expecting to be the debated will be what's called the Cooper amendment, that's Yvette Cooper, the Labour M.P.  It basically says if no deal is reached by February the 26th, it would postpone Brexit for nine months essentially to end of the year from march 29th, that's the date that exists now.  Then there's the Brady amendment, the Graham Brady (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>He basically is putting forward an amendment that would replace the Irish backstop with what is called alternative arrangements, such pretty vague, basically anything elsewhere and what we have now and there is no time limit on that backstop.  We have heard that Prime Minister Theresa May has already told European leaders that she wants to reopen Brexit negotiations.  Let's not forget, just last month, in December, the Prime Minister said it wasn't going to be reopened that the E.U had given her their best deal.</p><p>Now she wants to turn around and say look, you need to reopen negotiations.  I'm going to find out from Parliament what they are prepared to vote for and let's go from there.  And it calls today is January 29th.  The Brexit deadline, March 29th.  We have exactly two months left to go, Maria.  And let's be honest, there is no sign yet of a -- of a deal in place that a majority of people in Parliament can get behind.</p><p>Yesterday we had a whole series of warnings about what would happen if there was a no deal scenario.  Just crashing out retail consortiums saying, look, there's going to be empty shelves, prices are going to go up, a break in the supply chain.  It will be very, very detrimental to the British economy.  So that is the background.  Later on today, we'll find out what Parliament can get behind.  Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Ashley.  Thanks so much.  We'll check back with you.  Ashley Webster in London this morning.  Coming up.  The shutdown impact on your wallet.  I will be speaking with National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow on the economic effects of the shutdown.  Plus Federal debt reportedly headed to the highest level since World War II.</p><p>That is next.  One brewery feeling the impact.  The shutdown hitting one San Diego beer company.  We've got that story.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thank so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo coming to you live this morning from Washington, D.C.  It is Tuesday, January 29th.  Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Earnings season in full swing.  We have heard from Harley-Davidson, hit in the pre-markets after disappointing numbers.  Xerox as well headed higher after beating expectations.  Look at Harley-Davidson's shares down almost 10 percent right now.  China, one of the issues, once again.  Meanwhile rising tensions with China on the U.S. level.  The U.S. bringing charges against Chinese telecom company, Huawei, as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  Moments ago, I spoke with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin who talked about what the U.S. is looking for in the coming talks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MNUCHIN:  The President wants fair trade with China.  It's got to be reciprocal.  Right now, China has free access into our markets and we have limited access to there.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Futures this morning are higher.  Take a look, we have the highs of the morning right here with the Dow Jones Industrial average up 73 points, a third of a percent.  The S&amp;P 500 up 4-1/2, and the NASDAQ higher by 18 points, one-quarter of one percent.  European indices this morning are also higher.  Take a look.  FT-100 in London is up almost 100 points, 1-1/2 percent.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is up 55, better than one percent.  And the DAX Index in Germany up 37 points, that's one-third of one percent.  Asian markets mostly flat overnight as you'll see that was pretty much across the board with Japan and Korea squeaking out a fractional gain.</p><p>Our top story this half an hour, the cost of the government shutdown.  The CBO says about $3 billion out of 2019's projected GDP was completely lost due to the shutdown.  Joining me right now in a FOX Business exclusive is National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow.  Larry, it's great to see you this morning.</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for being here.  So obviously 35 days, government shutdown, CBO says $3 billion is lost.  Never coming back.  Your reaction.</p><p>KUDLOW:  With respect, once again, we disagree with the CBO.  I don't think we're going to lose anything.  This is completely temporary.  None of the incentives in the economy have been changed by this.  You know, that's the key point.  President Trump lowered marginal tax rates on individuals and most especially businesses.  And then he had this massive sweeping rollback of costly and burden regulations, which freed up the whole economy, including the energy sector, which has turned out to be a boom.  Why would we lose something just because of a temporary issue regarding the government?  Now, I'm always interested in sort of counting angels on the head of a pin.  We have about a $20 trillion economy, fair?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  There -- what was their number, three billion out of 20 trillion?  Do you know what the --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Three billion.  Yes, no, you're right.  You're right.</p><p>KUDLOW:  - percentage that is?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I totally understand.</p><p>KUDLOW:  I don't understand why we even mess with it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Actually, they're saying the total impact was $8-11 billion.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But that will come back, except for the $3 billion they say that is completely lost.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, again, with all due respect to the professionals at the CBO, I disagree.  Again, because the incentives in the economy -- here's the big difference between I guess the administration and the Congressional Budget Office and a lot of other forecasters.  We believe the economy is growing at three percent plus.  By the way, the Commerce Department for 2018 has scored I believe 3.1 percent.  We'll get the rest of those numbers in a week or two.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KUDLOW:  The CBO does not.  They never have.  They've never given us credit for the incentive effect of lowering taxes and regulations.  Supply side incentives are kicking in.  If you look at the whole panoply all of the economic data, whether it's very strong Christmas retail sales, whether it's industrial production, manufacturing, the best since the '80s, whether it's business equipment, which means the capex boom is happening that we always hoped for.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KUDLOW:  You'll see in my judgment, at least, the three percent trend line will continue.  CBO and many others have us at two.  But this goes back before the President.  This goes back way before.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  They don't believe the economy can grow.  They don't give any credit --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, even somebody like a Steve Schwarzman will say 4.2 percent growth in the second quarter is very hard to sustain on a $20 trillion economy.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, I'll keep working on Steve Schwarzman.  He's a good guy.  But in a $20 trillion economy, which again will grow rapidly, I see no reason why we can't continue three percent plus.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That's the whole point.  The idea that was sold to everybody I guess going back several years, maybe going back 10 or 15 years, that we're in some secular stagnation is just plain wrong.  With the right set of policies, to unleash --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- American animal spirit --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we saw that with the tax plan and the deregulation.  I totally get that.</p><p>KUDLOW:  And you look at the --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But what about tariffs and trade, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  The -- just one --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because the CBO'S report also brings that up.</p><p>KUDLOW:  One last one on this, the face of the new Trump economy -- I just want to put this in here, it's the thought I've had for quite a while.  These are men and women running small businesses.  These are blue-collar workers.  You look at the evidence, the employment for blue-collar workers, the best increase since the mid to late '80s, when I was a Reagan Cub Scout here in Washington, D.C.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  The wage rates of blue-collar manufacturing autos, they're rising faster than white-collar workers.  This is a direct result --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- of the incentives we've put into the economy.  CBO, again, it's not personal to my friends at the CBO, they don't give us any credit for these incentives.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No, I understand that.  But the --</p><p>KUDLOW:  And I want to stay with that story.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- the report on the trade policies estimated that new tariffs on imports and exports will cut an average of one-tenth of a percent from economic growth through 2029.  What's your take on that, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because we know that these tariffs are in place.  They still are impacting business and uncertainties.  So, is the President prepared to do away with all tariffs if he gets that agreement from the other side?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, I don't want to go there.  I mean, that's going to be his decision as you know.  Vice Premier Liu He is coming and we will have high level discussions Wednesday and Thursday and we're all looking forward to that, as is the President.  The President, as I read him, moderately optimistic about this trade story.  So, that's good.  What was it, one-tenth of one percent by 2029?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  So then here we are in 2019, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, no.  One-tenth of a percent from economic growth through 2029.</p><p>KUDLOW:  See, this is too hard, Maria.  It's way too hard --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- to figure that stuff out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you don't think there's going to be any -- there's --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Could it be possible that there's no impact from the shutdown?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Yes, quite possible.  I never -- it's utterly totally temporary.  So, that's -- let me --- look, let me go back -- the growth potential from China trade, people tend to look at this as a negative.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Look, I don't know the outcome of these talks.  Here's what I know, the scope of the discussion will be the broadest and deepest in the history of U.S.-China trade.  Literally everything's on the table.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Point number one.  Point number two, if China opens its markets --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is a big deal.</p><p>KUDLOW:  OK?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it looks like there's (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>KUDLOW:  Which is huge.  You know, I don't want to predict, and as Ambassador Lighthizer said a million times, and I agree, the enforcement mechanisms are going to be crucial.  But if they were to open their markets as we have requested regarding tariffs and non-tariffs, if they would let American companies own the subsidiary in China, so there's no forced transfer of the family jewels of technology, if we have --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But it --</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- some rule of law regarding I.P. theft, here's my point, open markets will allow the United States to export like crazy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But I understand that, Larry.</p><p>KUDLOW:  And that has been hand -- we've been handcuffed.  If we do that, if we do that, not only will the United States grow faster --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- because of that, China will grow faster.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That all sounds great, but can you actually do that, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Competition is the solution.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's the point, because if you're saying, \"OK, China, we are agreeing that you are opening your markets, and as a result, we will meet your demands, but then they say okay, but you have to have a communist, a government leader on the board of any company that has 100 percent.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Which is -- which is extraordinary, you're absolutely right.  It's extraordinary.  And it's --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So I mean -- so you could say it's great --</p><p>KUDLOW:  And unacceptable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- that you're going to open markets.</p><p>KUDLOW:  It's unacceptable.  It's unacceptable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But they -- aren't they saying that a communist has to be on the board of any company that has 100 percent?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I think that's been the past and I think that's going to be a very hot topic in these trade talks because that is completely unacceptable to us.  No question about it.  We will see how this turns out.  China, unfortunately, you know, they're in a slump.  China's economy is slumping very bad.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  I think part of that slump is a function of the President's tough negotiating with tariffs, when necessary, OK, part of that slump is in the last five to ten years.  China has moved in the wrong direction, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  The market-based reforms have been moving in their own direction.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But they're not market-based.  They are communists and they want communists on the board of -- So I'm just wondering, all of this sounds great, if you can actually get it done.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Oh, I know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Larry, stay with us.  We want to talk to you about other things because the tax plan and the deregulations have worked.  But there are some other ideas coming into play ahead of 2020.</p><p>KUDLOW:  China should not use the Venezuelan form of the economic policy.  We need to go back to who is it that said free market capitalism is the best path to prosperity?  It was the (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, that would -- that would be you and Ronald Reagan.  Stay with us.  We will be right back.  More with Larry Kudlow.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Thank you.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We come to you live this morning from Washington, D.C. and I am sitting with National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow, in an exclusive interview this morning.  And we were talking about China and what you can get done.  How important is tomorrow and Thursday in terms of meeting a deadline, that March 1st, in terms of a deal on the table?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I think's very important.  Look, I --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think you'll get a deal by March 1?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I don't want to predict.  It's just too hard to predict.  And, of course, these are decisions that will be made by the President, who is his own best negotiator.  Best I can is, as I said, the scope of this thing's going to as wide and broad as anything we have ever seen.  That does not ensure positive negotiator.  Best I can is, as I said, the scope of this thing is going to be as wide and broad as anything we've ever seen.  That does not ensure positive outcomes --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- right?  I think everybody, including the President, is basically moderately optimistic about this, OK?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Wait, let me ask you, your tax plan --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Ultimately -- one other thought which the President believes that he and President Xi will probably be the ultimate negotiators.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  OK?  And the work being done tomorrow and Thursday is vitally important to lay out options, OK?  But --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So the President will be involved in these talks tomorrow and Thursday?</p><p>KUDLOW:  That is what he has been saying in our meetings.  And I hope so because he's a great negotiator.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me move on to the tax plan.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because we're hearing a lot of ideas in terms of taxes now, now with a lot of 2020 hopefuls.  The Tax and Jobs Act obviously did move the needle on economic growth along with the deregulation out of this administration.  Now you've got Elizabeth Warren talking about two to three percent tax on the very high wealth people.  So if you have $50 million in wealth, you'll get two percent tax.  If you've got a billion dollars in assets, you'll get taxed three percent.  And you've got Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez talking about tax of 70 percent tax --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- on the highest earners.  What is your take on this?  Give us your reaction and what kind of an impact those policies might have.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Right.  These are prosperity killers, these are growth killers, these are job killers, these are incentive killers.  This is a return to some heavy government planning essentially direct to the economy.  You know, I hate to dwell on this because it's a crisis right now, but take a look at Venezuela, just for the heck of it.  What (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There was a time when that was vibrant -- it was a vibrate country.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That is correct.  That is correct.  And investment was flocking to it.  Then they took, down through the years, really exact measures you're describing that are coming from some of these Democratic candidates --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- and the economy was destroyed.  I mean I hear this notion we have to have equality, equality of income, equality of results, which I think runs counter to all human nature.  You know what?  A place like Venezuela has equality.  Everybody's poor.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think they'll be able to reverse the tax cuts then?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Everybody's poor in Venezuela, except for a hand -- Maduro and a handful of this top military people.  Is that what we want in America?  We are growing right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So will the Dems be able to reverse your tax cut plans?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Never.  Never, not until the President's configuration.  I -- look, first of all, if they want to try to raise taxes, it will be defeated in the Senate, Republican.  I personally believe even if it went beyond that --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- the President would veto any efforts to turn back his program.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How important --</p><p>KUDLOW:  We're doing what people said we couldn't do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But how important is debt?</p><p>KUDLOW:  They said we couldn't grow at three, four percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But how important is debt, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  We're growing at three, four percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Let's not mess with it.  If it ain't broke, don't fix it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Congressional Budget --</p><p>KUDLOW:  There's a tremendous surge in prosperity here shared by the middle and lower middle income people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Congressional Budget Office is saying that the deficit is hit -- set to hit $897 billion this year.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That would be the highest level since World War II.  When does debt become a priority?  Do you think the President, let's say he does have another term, will try to attack the entitlements?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, look, I think right now the two issues are maintaining economic growth.  You know, growth is the single biggest factor in these budget calculations.  Growth brings income and revenues.  And in fact I haven't gone through it with a fine-toothed comb yet, but I will.  I think I see that the CBO is acknowledging that our faster growth, which they did not predict, is now paying for over 80 percent of the tax cuts.  OK?  And I think you'll see more about that as we get through.  The reports just came out yesterday.</p><p>Second point I want to make is we will have a tough spending budget coming up in a few weeks, a very tough spending budget with reductions of at least five percent across the board, in non-defense accounts.  So I think that's going to be very important.  Let's minimize government where possible.  Let's grow the economy to its max.  And you will see the debt burden, which I thought debt, as a share of GDP, will be coming down, and by the way, it already is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  OK.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That's what happened during the Reagan years.  That's what happened during the John F. Kennedy years.  So, I wrote about it in my book.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That -- that's the best way to measure that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But, Larry, you know what I don't understand?  I mean you're all about growth, you have been for all your entire career.  Why are so many people worried about the slowdown?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why are we hearing some people say a recession is on the horizon?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, there's just -- it's funny in this town and I guess a little bit in New York, this is a lot of pessimism.  I don't --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you expect a recession this year or 2020?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I do not.  I don't see it right now.  If I look at financial indicators, credit spreads, the actual numbers, you know, it's just -- we -- GDP will come out a week late because the Commerce Department has reopened.  We've seen stuff like falling unemployment claims, rising manufacturing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But what are the markets telling us, Larry?  In the month of December, there was no high-yield debt issuance at all.  Credit markets are still tight.</p><p>KUDLOW:  They've come back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They've come back a bit.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Come back.  I like that.  Profits, the mother's milk of stocks, I don't know who first that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You did.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Profits, the mother's milk of stocks are rising.  The early indications are they won't to 25 percent but they're going to rise 10, to 15 percent.  I like that a lot.  Interest rates, the level of rates, are historically low.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you're not worried about market volatility?</p><p>KUDLOW:  There's a million things to worry about when I get up in the morning, you know, mainly getting here on time so I could do this great interview.  But I just want to say, if you look at the sum total of all the evidence right now, there's no recession out there.  I am the happy warrior.  I am an optimist.  President Trump is an optimist.  I think America, right now, we are the hottest economy in the world and we should remain so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll end it there.  Larry Kudlow.  Good to see you, sir.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow.  Back in a moment.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The government shutdown may be over, but the effects are still being felt.  Hillary Vaughn is live this morning at a craft brewery in Escondido, California where the shutdown effects are actually still lingering.  Hillary.</p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Hi, Maria.  Good morning.  Craft beer is a $76.2 billion industry, and for many craft breweries, like Stone Brewery, where we are today, the effects of the government shutdown are not over.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOMINIC ENGELS, CEO, STONE BREWING:  When the industry craft is built on seasonal beers, it's built on new beers, it's the new sexy thing, and if we can't get the new sexy thing to market, then we're not going to connect with our fans.  They're going to be disappointed.  We're going to make the sales numbers we planned to make in our financial plans, and these things will have repercussions.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUGHN:  As Federal workers at the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau are finally back in the office, a mountain of paperwork is waiting, about 11,000 applications for alcohol labels have been backlogged leaving craft breweries waiting to ship and sell all their new beer across state line, which means they're in limbo until these approvals go through.  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Hillary.  Thanks very much.  We've be watching that.  Hillary Vaughn.  Stay with us.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  President Trump is tweeting this morning.  He's talking about a former staffer.  Here's what he just said.  \"A low level staffer that I hardly knew named Cliff Sims wrote yet another boring book based on made up stories in fiction.  He pretended to be an insider when, in fact, he was nothing more than a gofer.  He signed a non-disclosure agreement.  He is a mess.  Dagen McDowell, great to see you this morning thank you so much.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  John Hilsenrath, Matt Schlapp.  I don't know why the President tweets this.  He's got how many million view, you know, users and followers.  He just let everybody know who this guy is like --</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, THE AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Well, he literally sat in a -- he sat in a cubicle outside my wife's office in the West Wing, and so it is kind of amazing like this insider whole kind of mythology is something the President knows is not true.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  But he's got some extra sales thanks to that tweet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.

Good morning, everyone, I'm Maria Bartiromo, thanks for joining us live this morning from Washington.  It is Tuesday, January 29th, your top stories right now 6:00 a.m. on the east coast.  Earnings in focus this morning, investors are watching results from several Dow components ahead of the open this morning.  The one to watch after the close is Apple.  We've got everything you need to know this morning previewing the report.  Apple under fire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile, FaceTime hit with a new bug that lets people eavesdrop on you without your knowledge.  How you can fix it, coming up -- big story.  Rising tensions with China meanwhile, the U.S. bringing charges against Huawei as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  The very latest on state of negotiations with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin this morning.  That interview at 8:00 a.m. Eastern, join us for that.  PG&amp;E makes it official, California's largest utility filed to bankruptcy protection, following the massive wild fires.  We've got all the details, coming up.</p><p>Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz roasted.  The billionaire hackled at an event last night as he gears up toward a possible independent run for the White House.  We've got a big show this morning coming from D.C., U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is here, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow is here along with House Minority, California Congressman Kevin McCarthy.  Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell will join me, along with AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka.  Don't miss a moment of it.  We've got a big three hours, coming up.</p><p>And we turn now -- right now, we kick it off with Wall Street markets.  We're looking to see a rebound this morning.  Take a look at Futures actually have just turned negative once again.  Futures down just fractionally, about 6 points on the Dow Industrials; 1-1/2 points lower on the S&amp;P; and the NASDAQ down 13 points.  This, after stocks finished lower yesterday on China growth fears along with weak guidance from Nvidia and Caterpillar.  We told you -- the Caterpillar numbers right here.  And of course, it did worsen throughout the day as investors react to a weaker-than-expected earnings and guidance.</p><p>Joining me right now is Federated Investors Chief Equity Market Strategist, Phil Orlando.  And Phil, it's good to see you this morning.</p><p>PHIL ORLANDO, CHIEF EQUITY MARKET STRATEGIST, FEDERATED INVESTORS:  Thanks for having me back, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All indications that we are seeing a slowdown and worries around China, among other issues, how do you see the markets here as more earnings have come into play?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, you had this 20 percent waterfall decline in stock prices in the fourth quarter of last year, we thought the market was attempting to price in the prospect of recession this year.  Multiples contracted from 18 times earnings down to 14 times earnings.  In our view, there's no risk of recession this year.  So, the rally that we've seen over the last month, 14 percent rally, the market is starting to price in the fact that maybe we're not going to have a recession.  But we've had a 14 percent rally in a month.  That's very, very powerful.  We would absolutely expect some consolidation here over the next month or two particularly as we've got these critical sign posts coming up in the month of March, but as we look out over the balance of the year, we do think that multiples will return to that 18 level, and we're going to end up with a pretty good year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  To what do you attribute the slowdown?  We've got earnings in focus and we're looking at a number of companies out that give weaker-than-expected guidance or miss on the top line.  Lockheed Martin, Pfizer, and Verizon are reporting this morning.  Apple is, of course, out after the bell, so when you look at the earnings picture, where in terms of industry are you seeing the most slowdown?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, I think in a word, uncertainty is what's impacting earnings and guidance to some degree.  You've got the Fed flip-flops that we saw in the fourth quarter last year, the uncertainty about whether or not the United States and China are going to be able to consummate this trade deal.  You've got Brexit overhanging on the global market and certainly the government shutdown, which was up there for 35 days, and it was just temporarily resolved last Friday.  You've got a number of issues there, all of which are impacting companies in some way, shape or form.  So, with earnings up 25 percent year-over-year in the first three quarters of last year, this fourth quarter is a little softer, I think we're up about 13 percent.  So far, we're about a quarter of the way through the earnings season.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>ORLANDO:  And I think what companies are pointing to are some combination of those four issues that I just mentioned.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you mentioned the shutdown.  The shutdown apparently costing the economy $11 billion according to new analysis from the Congressional Budget Office, although Larry Kudlow is disputing that number, and he's going to join us this morning live to talk about it.  The report says that it hit $3 billion, that's one-tenth of a percent of economic activity in the fourth quarter alone.  So, are there sectors that were -- that were hit hardest in that regard, or do you want to look at those companies that are largely tied to the China trade as one area of the real weakness?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the council of economic advisers under Trump had advised us that the shutdown was going to take about one-tenth of one percent out of GDP per week.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, remember, the shutdown started right around Christmas, so that makes sense that we lost, you know, a tenth of a percent in the fourth quarter, you know, maybe a half a percent here in the first quarter.  We're at 1.7 percent GDP growth in the first quarter, consensus blue chip is around 22, 23.  So, we think this pretext a little high and there will be, you know, sort of a downward revision as we get later in the quarter.  But in terms of industries, I think it's really across the board.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Across the board.</p><p>ORLANDO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about technology because it's big week for tech, Apple, of course, the big story today, reporting after the close tonight -- the only big tech reporting.  Microsoft, Facebook out tomorrow, Amazon is out on Thursday.  This is the week that we'll focus on technology and that's where really the growth stories have been.  Would you want to put new money to work in any of these names ahead of their earnings?</p><p>ORLANDO:  Short answer is probably no.  Again, you've had this 14 percent rally here in the last month, you've got concerns about slowing economic growth both in the U.S. and China.  We think that those issues will be resolved as we get into the back half of the year, but right now, you know, why run the risk of putting new money to work after you've had a big rally in some of these names ahead of what could be a disappointing earnings number or perhaps conservative guidance.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, the stock has come down because people were worried about it.  So, we'll see what the numbers are.  Would you, at some point, go back in to tech?  What's your favorite group right now, Phil?</p><p>ORLANDO:  So, the areas that we like best in the U.S. markets are energy, financial services, industrials, and health care.  In terms of looking overseas, emerging markets look very attractive to us.  So, the areas that have really gotten hit the most are the ones that we've been attracted to.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there.  So, the valuations are better, I guess, is what you're saying.</p><p>ORLANDO:  The valuations are much more attractive.  We think the fundamentals are still very strong.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Phil, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>ORLANDO:  Great to see you.  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Phil Orlando joining us there.  Meanwhile, a bug in Apple's FaceTime app lets users listen in someone's phone without even the person knowing.  Dagen McDowell, what's happening this morning?  Good morning to you, Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well, Apple has some explaining to do, but particularly on this earnings call this afternoon.  So, there's a bug in the Apple iPhone that would allow people to eavesdrop on FaceTime users' calls.  A FaceTime user calling another person could listen in while the recipients phone is still ringing even if the person never accepts the call.  This was -- it involves several steps in the Group FaceTime feature on the iPhone.</p><p>Apple has disabled that Group FaceTime while it tries to come up with a fix for this, but you can eavesdrop in on somebody, essentially listening through the microphone, even if a person never takes that call, you could eavesdrop on rooms with unattended devices and even receive unauthorized video from the phone.  And again, it would take several steps to do this, but this is coming from a company, Maria, that loves to brag about its privacy protections and even throws shade at the likes of Facebook and other technology companies.</p><p>And adding embarrassment to embarrassment, yesterday was International Data Privacy Day and Tim Cook was tweeting about that.  Here's what he said on Twitter yesterday before this bug, this eavesdropping bug was disclosed.  We must keep fighting for the kind of world we want to live in.  On this Data Privacy Day, let us all insist on action and reform for vital privacy protections.  The dangers are real and the consequences are too important.  Big whoops for Apple, and of course, everything that happens in the business world is a political opportunity.  The Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo had to weigh in on this as well, putting out a statement late yesterday, say, \"Urging FaceTime users to temporarily disable the app.  So, Apple beat him to it, they're trying to fix it.  Embarrassment nonetheless.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible because you don't even know -- I mean, the phone could be ringing and you don't even know that they're listening.  I mean, that's the worst part of it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  I can explain later as the show goes on how this work, but you'd have to place a FaceTime call, go to the group, add yourself to the call and then the recipient of the call would have to hit maybe one like the on-button on the phone in order to activate it, but it was possible, and it was all over the internet yesterday how to do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, if -- so, if it's -- if it's not on and you say -- and you do -- and you decline the phone call, they can't listen in?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Unless you -- but you can't touch the phone at all.  Like, it's not even declining the phone.  Like, if you hit the up -- the up volume button on the phone, and so if I was playing this trick on you, it would activate it, and they could essentially hear what was going on in the room.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Unbelievable.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  I want to hear more about that, for sure.  Meanwhile, there's this, as expected, PG&amp;E filed for bankruptcy protection following those devastating wildfires in California.  Cheryl Casone on that in headlines right now.  Cheryl, good morning to you.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  Well, PG&amp;E is facing roughly about 30 billion in potential liabilities, as investigators are looking into whether the company's equipment played a role in starting California's deadliest fire.  More than 100 people died following a series of wildfires that burned hundreds of thousands of acres over a two-year period.  The utility providing energy service to 60 million people, we should add.  Taking a look at shares of PG&amp;E, look at that, in the premarket down nearly nine percent.  And those loses have actually paired back in the last hour or so, folks.</p><p>Well, China's Vice Premier has arrived in Washington for high-level trade talks that are going to start tomorrow.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and trade representative Robert Lighthizer will attend the two-day meeting.  Yesterday, the Trump administration announced a pair of indictments against Chinese telecom giant, Huawei.  The U.S. is accusing the company of trying to steal trade secrets from T-Mobile.  The Justice Department also charging Huawei with conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran.</p><p>And the China story continues, folks, shares of Nvidia are lower this morning.  The chipmaker is warning investors, and expects much weaker sales thanks in part, yes, to China's slowing economy.  It also previously cautioned the sales of its graphics processors that are used in video games PCs would be disappointing.  The China effect continues.  Chips for video gaming account for more than half of their business, they lost half their market value since hitting their peak back on October 1st, Maria.  So, Goldman Sachs had to come out last Friday, Maria, warning that a lot of these chip companies that have massive exposure to China are going to have really rough reports.  Micron Technology, even Wynn Resorts, the casino company, has got big China exposure, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, for sure.  All right, Cheryl, thanks so much.  Coming up next, five police officers are injured this morning, four of them shot while serving a search warrant.  The very latest coming up.  And then a venti-size disaster for Howard Schultz last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire (BLEEP).</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Former Starbucks CEO having a rough time exploring a 2020 Presidential run as he gets heckled.  We break it down right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Live from Washington, we are eyeing 2020, former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz facing backlash last night on his first stop of his book tour.  It was his first public appearance after announcing a possible Independent Presidential run.  It did not begin smoothly.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire (BLEEP).  Go back to getting ratio'd on Twitter.  Go back to Davos with the other billionaire elite who think they know how to run the world.  That's not what democracy needs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, my goodness.  Schultz is also facing backlash from former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.  Here's what he tweeted: \"In 2020, the great likelihood is that an Independent would just split the anti-Trump vote and end up re-electing the President.  That's a risk I refused to run in 2016, and we can't afford to run it now.\"</p><p>Here with me this morning to talk more about all of that is Dagen McDowell back in New York, Wall Street Journal Global Economics Editor Jon Hilsenrath here in D.C. with me, along with the American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp.  Gentlemen, it's good to see you.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Welcome to Washington.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, thank you so much.  And welcome to presidential politics, Howard Schultz.  What do you think about that?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Well, I'm going to get some popcorn.  This could be a real interesting Democratic primary, and whatever this Independent thing is, don't you love Michael Bloomberg who has probably spent a million dollars on polling, trying to figure out every way to become the President.  Publicly chastising Schultz for running as an Independent when that's exactly what Bloomberg would just love to do if he could.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  You know, on the one hand, Dagen, I feel like there is an opening for an Independent because there's such extremes and radical conversation going on certainly on the left.  And on the other hand, I don't know, how much is a cup of coffee at Starbucks?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Again, that $18.00 cup of Joe, I'm joking, I'm exaggerating.  It's helping --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think it's like $6.00.  I mean, seriously.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, we love cart coffee around this place.  But again, that's helping fund this run.  But Michael Bloomberg -- you know what, Michael Bloomberg should run for the Democratic nomination if he thinks he can win, it's just hilarious to have this multibillionaire lecturing Howard Schultz about an Independent run when actually a cup of Starbucks coffee has more charisma than Michael Bloomberg, number one.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Number two, it's going to be really interesting to see the narrative in the spring of 1992 with Ross Perot was -- Ross Perot was going to divide the Democratic vote, that it wouldn't hurt the Republican.  This could very well -- I mean, it depends on who -- what Howard Schultz says on the campaign trail and how far-left the Democrats go when they're running for the nomination.  But I'll say this, what he said so far about pay -- how to pay for Medicare For All and how that's impossible, I would be really interested to hear him talk about how to fix the health care system, because he might come to the table with some really interesting ideas and force the Democrats to answer the hard questions about paying for this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that is the thing, I mean, this party unfortunately, it's very hard for someone who's a centrist to actually have a shot.  You had Tim Ryan from Ohio, he wanted to do it, he's an economic thinker, he doesn't have a shot because of the same thing, you've got the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's 70 percent tax rate, the loudest voice in the room.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I mean, there's no question that these primaries are starting out very much from the left, you know, you have talk about a wealth tax, and 70 percent high-income tax threshold.  You have Elizabeth Warren who is going around beating up on the banks.  This is definitely a left-leaning primary season that we're going to be going into.  What I find so fascinating is the journeys that these different billionaires are traveling.  You know, you had President Trump who supported a lot of Democrats as a businessman in New York City traveling over to Republican Party, now you have Michael Bloomberg who started out as a Republican Mayor --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- traveling over to the Democratic Party, and Howard Schultz doesn't know where to go.  He doesn't know where he fits in.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He doesn't know where -- and what about Senator Kamala Harris?  Let's listen to her, because she held a CNN Townhall meeting in Iowa last night.  Harris is vowing to eliminate private health insurance with Medicare For All if elected president.  What's your take, Matt?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Making insurance companies illegal.  Look, the Democratic Party has become quite radicalized.  Think about this, less choices for the patient is the solution to our problems.  That seems insane.  Also, do we really think the government, when you get your tags to drive your car, or when you pay your taxes at the IRS, do you really think all the solutions to our problems are there?  I don't.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Let me ask you this, who does President Trump want to see come out of this whole --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think he wants Howard Schultz to run.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think -- he was taunting him yesterday.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH:  No, besides Howard Schultz, among the Democrats, who does he -- who does he want to (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>SCHLAPP:  I think most Republicans -- I'm not going to speak for the President -- but I think most Republicans believe that Elizabeth Warren is so far out there on the loony left, basically Marxism, socialism that I think they find that a delicious opportunity.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Can I --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- call the confiscation, Dagen.  He called it (INAUDIBLE) I mean, this two or three percent tax on assets, confiscation.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It is wealth confiscation.  It's totally communist and then to try and find people when they hand in their U.S. citizenship when other countries come calling, wanting you move there because they won't come and take your hard-earned money.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  One thing I want to point out that Jon Hilsenrath said that Howard Schultz doesn't know where to go.  President Trump should be worried about a Howard Schultz, because what if he comes to the table, like I said, with ideas that appeal to voters in this country who feel left out.  Who left out from the Republican Party and certainly left out by the left-leaning Democrats in this environment.  So, be very, very careful.  And one other thing I'll add with Howard Schultz at that -- at that bookstore, that's just the New York City welcome wagon.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's the way they treat all tourists in this city.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, I think you make a good point because there is that path.  That path of centrism.  I mean, that path of the center, because people do feel like it's gone wacky all the way on the left, for sure.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  It's a centrist country, but don't forget Hillary.  She's making noises.  Maybe that's the President's favorite opponent.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH:  We haven't seen any --</p><p>SCHLAPP:  She's making noises.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  We haven't seen anyone travel that centrist path as an Independent to presidency.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  So, it was a smart move on Howard Schultz's part.  We'll see.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Or a risky one for all those billions --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, certainly risky.  Take a quick break.  Extreme weather warning meanwhile on the other side of this break, millions of people across the country are gearing up for an Arctic blast as temperatures are plummeting, that's next.</p><p>Then showing their cards, British Prime Minister Theresa May asking Parliament to put up its plans from Britain's exit from the E.U.  Details on the historic debate.  And the vote happening later today, back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  It is cold out, and the deep freeze is setting in, hitting millions of Americans with subzero and dangerous temperatures.  Fox News Senior Meteorologist Janice Dean in the Fox Weather Center right now with the very latest.  Janice, tell us about it.</p><p>JANICE DEAN, FOX NEWS SENIOR METEOROLOGIST:  Hi, Maria, yes, we could be dealing with historic lows.  These are current windchills, what it feels like when you go outside and you are not protected.  Dangerous, potentially life-threatening windchills of -41 in International Falls, -18 in Chicago, but we still have another blast behind this.  So, these are morning lows, these are not windchill temperatures: Chicago -25 on Thursday, -31 in Minneapolis, -16 in Detroit.  Again, those are not windchill values.  Those are actual air temperatures.  But with the windchill, in some cases, we could get windchill values of -40 to -50.  If you go outside, your skin is going to freeze in minutes.</p><p>So, here's Chicago, Illinois.  Your all-time record low is -28.  So, we're going to flirt with historic lows, Maria.  This is a big deal.  The good news is it won't be long lasting.  By the weekend, we'll start to rebound, but I also want to make mention with this arctic cold front as we have snow across the deep south.  Snow that could cripple travel across portions of Atlanta, Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, and towards the southeast, so that's another dangerous part of the storm is the -- not only extreme cold but the snow as far as south as the gulf coast.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Janice.  Wow, what a story, thank you so much.</p><p>DEAN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will be watching.  Janice Dean.  Coming up next, the State of the Union is back on, it is February 5th.  Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi extending an invitation to the President, he accepted the offer.  Then, we're taking a look at the enormous cost of the shutdown.  What is the real number?  Plus, place your bets, Super Bowl fans getting ready to throw down an enormous amount of cash.  So, bet on the big game Sunday.  We break down all the numbers.  Stay with us.  Live from Washington this morning.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us.  We are coming to you live from Washington this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, January 29th, your top stories right now 6:31 on the east coast right now.

Rising tensions with China, the U.S. is bringing charges against Huawei, as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will be my special guest, in about 90 minutes time.  We will break it all down with the Treasury Secretary, coming up.  So, stay with us.</p><p>Meanwhile, Futures relatively flat this morning, take a look at markets, down 20 points on the Dow Industrials, down 4 points on the S&amp;P, down 18 points on the NASDAQ.  We are expecting some pressure at the start of trading this morning, after all the major indices finished lower, yesterday, on Wall Street.</p><p>In fact, at 4:00, the Dow Industrials gave up 208 points, that was almost 1 percent lower, the S&amp;P 500 down 21, that was three quarters of a percent lower, and the NASDAQ with a 79-point decline yesterday, at the close, down better than 1 percent.</p><p>Investors are watching some big news this week, J.P. Morgan, calling this week the most important week of the first quarter, and here is why, you've got earnings, you've got the British vote, you've got U.S.-China trade talks, you've got a Federal Reserve decision, we're not expecting a Fed hike.</p><p>We've got fourth quarter GDP coming out.  And, of course, at the end of the week, the job's report for the month of January, a big week, investors want to watch it and will be covering it all.</p><p>European indices this morning look like this, in terms of trading.  We are looking at gains in Europe.  The FT-100 up one and a quarter percent, 86 points higher, the CAC Quarante in Paris is up a half a percent, 26 points higher, and the DAX Index in Germany, higher by a fraction, as you can see there.</p><p>Asian markets overnight, flat, take a look.  No real moves there, because mover was the KOSPI Index in Korea, up a quarter of a percent.</p><p>Well, there is tragedy in Houston to report, five police officers injured.  Four of them shot, while serving a search warrant.  We have the very latest, coming up.</p><p>And a debate in parliament, British lawmakers set to vote on the latest plan for the U.K. to leave the European Union.

The address was originally supposed to be today.</p><p>Even though the shutdown is over, the U.S. is still feeling effects, new numbers from the Congressional Budget Office to report.  The U.S. GDP will be $3 billion lower during the fourth quarter of 2018, because of this shutdown.  On the immigration front, backlogs of immigration courts grew by at least 10 percent, according to Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about all of that is Americans for Tax Reform President, Grover Norquist, Grover, good to see you.</p><p>GROVER NORQUIST, PRESIDENT, AMERICANS FOR TAX REFORM:  Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So, the CBO is talking about a $3 billion-dollar hit, in fact, as a result of the shutdown, Larry Kudlow is having an issue with this.  He says, frequently disagrees with the CBO anyway.  What's your take in terms of what the shutdown cost the economy?</p><p>NORQUIST:  Look, the key thing is that the economy continues to grow and we're looking at a three percent rate of growth for the year, so $3 billion is a big number, unless you compare it to the GDP of the United States in the fourth quarter.</p><p>So, actually, we're doing fairly well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You don't think it had much of an impact then, Grover?</p><p>NORQUIST:  No, it's a small impact and we have a tremendous growth for the year, which is way beyond what the CBO said was possible, when they scored this.  The CBO needs to spend a little more time going back to explain why they were so wrong on all of their recent predictions, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go.  Go ahead.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Grover, the Federal Reserve and most of the economist that we surveyed at the Wall Street Journal are saying that the economy is slowing down in 2019.  We had a nice burst in 2018 in part, because of tax cuts and in part, because there's more spending, $300 billion of additional spending.</p><p>But now, they say the economy is slowing along with the global economy, what does that say about the impact of these tax cuts, are the tax cuts really created the long-run growth that Republicans said was going to happen?</p><p>NORQUIST:  The tax cuts do two things.  We were at 35 percent rate, which is the highest in the world.  It made sense for an American company like Burger King to be bought by Canadian company, because even though they're selling the same hamburgers, the same number of employees, it was worth more, because we had a worldwide tax system at 35 percent.</p><p>By taking 35 down to 21, we became competitive with Europe.  I mean, our friends, the Germans were at 25, the Japanese were at 25.  I'm sorry, the Japanese were at 30.  The Chinese were at 25.  And we were at 35.  We weren't even close to being competitive.  It's a huge change in the direction for the country.</p><p>And if the CBO tells you they're pessimistic, they didn't think you could do three percent, they laughed at three percent growth, said you could never do more than --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  The question is, is that three percent growth.  I think a lot of people understand that the corporate tax rate was uncompetitive, even some Democrats wanted to lower their corporate tax rate, but the question is, this new tax code that we've got, is that sufficient to sustain the three percent growth in 2019?</p><p>NORQUIST:  It's a good first start.  We also need to do something about the workforce.  We need more workers and frankly, there's more tax reduction that needs to be done and spending restraint is very important at the end of the day.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  I want to go back to this question about a shutdown, Grover, which is, people are saying, they're almost using the reason why you couldn't cut government, because somehow, that would have a negative impact on our economic growth.  That seems like a very dangerous road to go down.</p><p>Isn't it true that all of this money that they are saying didn't get put into the economy, are you worried that the government actually won't spend all of that by the time that the authority over the money, expires?</p><p>NORQUIST:  For the government to -- I was taught this (INAUDIBLE) economics in college also.  The government takes your money, and then spends it.  It's much better for the economy than if it lets you spend it.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Right.</p><p>NORQUIST:  Because you would waste some of it by investing it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because they can spend money better than you, of course.</p><p>NORQUIST:  And that's the oddest thing because, of course, that's nonsense.  East Germany should have done very well, under this theory, but it doesn't, so --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  What the government is doing is borrowing other people's money and spending it, right?  I mean, we're talking about deficits that are nearing a trillion dollars.</p><p>NORQUIST:  The (INAUDIBLE) cost the government is how much the government spends, whether they borrowed or take it, it's still gone from the -- from the real economy.  The cost of government is total government spending.  We should have taxes low, and then the least destructive way possible, all taxes are somewhat destructive.  And you have less borrowing if you have less spending.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what about all of these new plans?  And by the way, we are getting earnings right now, as we're talking 3M and Xerox, both beat expectations, although 3M is cutting its forecast for the year.  What about all of these ideas about taxing the wealthy?  New York Congressman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez claims for a 70 percent marginal tax rate on the tippy top, as she calls it.</p><p>Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts senator, hopeful, for 2020, two percent tax on Americans whose assets exceed 50 million.  If you're a billionaire, three percent, what's the impact?</p><p>NORQUIST:  OK, magicians like to do this, so you're not looking at, you know -- watch my right hand, don't look at the left hand.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NORQUIST:  The reason they talk about high tax rates on rich people, is that they want to gouge the middle class.  The difference between the United States and Sweden, Finland, Denmark, the countries that Cortez talked about is, they don't have the 70 percent rate, just back up for sec -- there isn't a country in the world with a 70 percent income tax rate.</p><p>Many countries used to, the Beatle song, 19 for me, one for you, 95 percent tax rate, and then the Beatles moved to United States, and everybody who could pay tennis, left Sweden.  And all the countries of the world realize that tax rates that high were stupid and destructive and didn't help equality or growth or anything like that.</p><p>So, they got rid of them.  The whole world got rid of them.  We did it, it was stupid.  We back offed it and had strong economic growth as a result, so 70 percent stupid and destructive.  It's not America saying, the world says that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You probably showed the op-ed today, in the Journal, in California, and taxes as well.  The Journal, this week, by Cypress founder, T.J. Rodgers, which was very good, Another California Tax Grab, he writes.  In it, the politicians have fueled an affordability crisis that drives away businesses and exacerbates homelessness.</p><p>California Governor, Gavin Newsom, called for even higher taxes in his inauguration speech earlier this month.</p><p>NORQUIST:  California is a good example of 70 percent play.  They have a 13 percent rate on people making a million dollars, but they have 8 percent rate on people making $42,000.  So, they want the middle class people in California to think you're OK, because we're really screwing the other guy.</p><p>And point of fact, Florida has a zero percent first income tax, Texas has a zero percent first income tax, 8 percent looks good compared to 13.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NORQUIST:  Looks lousy compared to zero percent.  They want the middle class to think somebody else is paying the freight.  That's why they have those phoney high tax rates that don't raise much money.  It's to fool the middle class.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it is talking point, and it works for the populist.  Let me bring in Dagen McDowell on this, because we hear this every time we go into the tax discussion and we have a Democrat on which takes out another one of those talking points on taxes, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And I want to say that Senator Kamala Harris said that the first thing -- she said it last night, in the town hall, he first thing she do is to cut taxes for the middle class.  Well, roughly half this country pays no net federal income tax, number one, and the Republicans just did that particularly, doubling the standard deduction.</p><p>So, I don't know who she's going to cut taxes for.  But this is the ruse and this is the big liberal lie that all of these big new welfare state initiatives, whether it's green energy, even single payer, it's all going to be paid for by the super rich.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And that it's not going to be -- that the paying won't be spread across every person in this country to fund this welfare state.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And by the way, the numbers don't add up even if you tax all the rich, you're not going to get the amount of money you need for this green deal, Grover.</p><p>NORQUIST:  You don't even balance the budget if you do that, never mind half money for new things.  Look, the big difference between United States and Denmark, United States and Sweden, it's not how much money higher income people pay, it's what happens to middle-income people.</p><p>Denmark, Finland, Sweden, the tax rate on middle income people is 10, 15, 20 points higher than an American middle class person.  And, you add to that the value added tax.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NORQUIST:  The difference between United States and Europe is how heavily taxed middle income people are, and they have those (INAUDIBLE) high rates that very few people pay, to make people in the middle class think that they are getting a deal.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Speaking of middle income tax -- a lot of Democrats want a carbon tax, gasoline tax and even some big American business.  That's the way to address the issue of climate change.  Do you see any path towards a carbon tax that would be acceptable to your point --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I guess, but real quick, Grover.</p><p>NORQUIST:  No.  No, absolutely not.  And the reason is, you can look at Washington State, very deep blue Washington State.  They have twice had it on the ballot and twice defeated a carbon dioxide tax, gasoline taxes lose overwhelmingly.  This is too obvious tax on middle-income people.  It's a loser up.  They are having this fight in -- our dear friends in France or loggerhead down the subject.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We know how that played out.</p><p>NORQUIST:  We had the Ontario government and the Alberta government collapsed as a result of this, and three times, in Australia.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Grover, thank you.  Yes.</p><p>NORQUIST:  Bad politics and lousy economics.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Grover, thank you for the facts, we appreciate it, Grover Norquist, joining us there.</p><p>Five officers injured in a shooting in Texas, meanwhile, Cheryl Casone in New York, with the details, there.  Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  That's right, Maria.  Four officers were shot and another officer suffered a knee injury in Houston.  They were serving a search warrant at a suspected drug house.  Police say two of them were hit in the neck.  Those officers are in critical but stable condition.  Two suspects were killed at the scene.</p><p>Well, a key E.U. negotiator, warning the risk of Britain leaving the European Union without a deal, is very high, as parliament votes on amendments in Theresa May's exit plan today.  Lawmakers set to consider more than 10 different amendments before taking votes.  That's going to be at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>And those votes come after May's plan to leave the European Union was overwhelmingly rejected earlier this month, a lot of those votes against her from her own party.</p><p>Well, Americans will be betting an estimated $6 billion on the Super Bowl, that's according to the survey by the American Gaming Association.  About 22.7 million U.S. adults plan to place a bet on the upcoming Atlanta game, of those bets, 94.47 percent, reportedly illegal, but let the games begin, Maria, and those are your headlines.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Be there to watch it all, front-row seat.</p><p>CASONE:  I'm there for you, Maria.  I've got surprises for you, coming up.  You're going to love them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK, looking forward to it.  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, crisis in Venezuela to take a look at, new sanctions have been placed on the country's oil.  Plus, National Security Advisor, John Bolton, may have inadvertently revealed the administration's next move.  Why his notes are raising eyebrows this morning.</p><p>Then, farming in America, why farmers are being forced to rent water.  That's up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A look at some of the big headlines across America this morning.  The Chicago Tribune reporting on the Pension Agency criticizing Sears Chairman Eddie Lampert's plan to acquire the bankrupt retailer.  The article explaining that the agency sets to takeover Sears.  Pensions objects to the bid, calling it the final fulfillment of a year-long's scheme to deprive Sears and its creditors of assets and its employees of jobs while lining Lampert's on owns pockets.</p><p>The Daily Camera in Colorado, reporting on how Boulder County farmers are increasingly renting water.  The report explains how ownership from agricultural interests has dropped from 85 percent in the late 1950s to just 30 percent.  The water increasingly moving to municipal control.</p><p>And the Mercury News writing that how in one California city you can text 911 for emergency help.  According to the paper, the police department there announced that the service is now available in the city.  It is meant to help people who are hearing or voice impaired.  The police are also recommending that you not send emojis.  Well, yes, I would think not.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  What are we coming to?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  My God, but it is good that you can text 911.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  That's a good step, just don't text person emoji.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, crisis in Venezuela new sanctions placed on the country's oil, plus National Security Advisor John Bolton may have inadvertently revealed the administration's next move, why his notes on his legal pad are raising eyebrows this morning?  We're breaking that down when we come right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A framework for peace.  The U.S. and Taliban negotiators making a preliminary on key issues to end the war in Afghanistan -- the longest war in American history.  The two top points American troop withdrawal and insurgence vowing to end terrorist attacks abroad, that's according to the Wall Street Journal.  Many hurdles remain to ensure the peace is in place.  Joining me right now is Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst, General Jack Keane.  General, it's always a pleasure to see you.</p><p>GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST:  Good to see you, Maria, and welcome to Washington again.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  And what do you think about this?  I mean, are we supposed to be trusting the Taliban?</p><p>KEANE:  No, we can never ever trust the Taliban, that doesn't mean that we can't have a treaty with them.  But here's what I think is going on, a couple of things have changed: one is the Taliban in the last couple of years have gone all out as we have so dramatically reduced our forces, thinking that they will going to be able to overthrow the regime, because the only thing the United States is really doing is training and assisting the ground forces -- no longer doing the fighting, however provide an air power.  That didn't work.  They retook some territory but never took capitals or provinces and they never took -- they never able to secure a province.  So, what has happened?  The war stalemated.  The Taliban cannot take over the government and the government cannot defeat Taliban, even with our assistance.</p><p>Second thing, and this is crucial, Pakistan has gotten involved in this in a way they've never have before.  They forced the Taliban to go to the peace negotiation table, why?  Pakistan knows it's no longer in national interest to keep this thing stalemated.  There's growing al-Qaeda and growing ISIS presence in Afghanistan which gives the Pakistanis some concern.  So, those are the new things that are happening.  That's why the negotiations have some momentum.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's the thing, though.  I mean, so many people were worried when the president said: we were withdrawing the troops.  And where do you stand on that now?  I mean, do you feel better about it given this peace deal?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, let me answer it this way -- I mean, it is an essential question: the Taliban themselves, we are trying to get an agreement with them that, one, they'll stop trying to overthrow the government and number two, they'll power share with them and also, they will assist in taking down the al-Qaeda and the ISIS.  I don't think we can trust them to do that, based on the fact that they provided safe haven for Osama bin Laden for almost 10 years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  So, what do we do?</p><p>KEANE:  So, we leave in place, after we bring out the troops that are providing the training and assistance.  We leave in place a counterterrorism force and an intelligence capability indefinitely.  We're doing that in Yemen, we're doing it in Libya and we're doing it in Africa.  The one in Africa is off the coast.  It's a Maritime Joint Task Force.  That is what we need to do, that is the guaranty against the Taliban because the issue in Afghanistan has always been, we would never intervene in the civil war in Afghanistan between the northern alliance and Taliban for one reason only, we didn't evade, because they attacked the United States.  That's the reason we're there.  We don't want that to happen again and we cannot trust the Taliban to provide that guarantee for us.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, let me move on and ask you about sanctions on the Venezuelan oil industry.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin who will be here shortly this morning along with Security Adviser John Bolton, explain the decision in a briefing yesterday and issued warning for disputed President Nicolas Maduro.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN BOLTON, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR:  The president has made it very clear on this -- on this matter that all options are on the table.</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY:  There's no reason why these resources shouldn't be used for the economic benefit of the people there.  There's no reason for the poverty and the starvation and the humanitarian crisis.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to this announcement yesterday?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, increased pressure on Maduro regime is certainly a welcome thing.  I mean, this really comes down to the loyalty of the military to Maduro.  As long as that loyalty is there, it's unlikely that Maduro is going the leave.  If that loyalty starts to fall apart, I hope we're working a 'plan b', which is engineering right now some kind of exit path for Maduro, where he can go into exile with recriminations in Venezuela.  The Reagan administration did this very successfully on Ferdinand Marcos, back in 1986, overwhelming popular opposition to him, hundreds of thousands of people.  We engineered his exit.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me squeeze in this question before you go general.  This image from the briefing going viral and it shows John Bolton's notepad with the notation: \"5,000 troops to Colombia.\"  Whoa, do you think we should be sending troops to the region?  What do you think about this?  Caught on camera.</p><p>KEANE:  Look, when we deposed Noriega in 1989 operation just cost Panama, 26,000 troops, is what it took.  When we deposed a dictator in Haiti, 28,000.  The ease of troops that would only be in there, move into Venezuela, if there's a problem at the embassy to our diplomat.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How significance is revealing such a secret?</p><p>KEANE:  I think he'd probably wanted to reveal it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  General Jack Keane, good to see you sir.  Thank you so much.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Show: MORNINGS WITH MARIA][Date: January 29, 2019][Time: 07:00:00][Tran: 012902cb.231][Type: SHOW][Head: Interview with Rep.

And joining me to break it all down -- Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell in New York; the \"Wall Street Journal's\" global economics editor Jon Hilsenrath here in D.C. with me; and the American Conservative Union chairman, Matt Schlapp.  Great to see you -- guys.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Great to be here.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen -- good morning to you.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning.  We were talking about the shutdown.  So it's over for the time being.</p><p>The Democrats have actually been hurt by it as well.  Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows that positive feelings about the Democratic Party have fallen to 35 percent this month.  That's down 4 percentage points since December.  And that is essentially in line with the positive feelings that people have about Republicans.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean that's a really good point because the President really did not get hurt certainly on his base, from his base, by the shutdown.  What do you guys think?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Two things.  First is that the President's base was actually energized that he would make a spending fight.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Remember, immigration is a spending fight because if he can stop illegal immigration or reduce it, you don't have all these social services costs.</p><p>But the second thing is, the President's brand is that he will fight, he will fight harder than any politician on the field and he reiterated that brand.  So if he can increase that reputation, I think it appeals to Independents.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They said dig in.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  But isn't his brand also -- it's about fighting and continuing to fight and winning.  And he didn't win the wall in this case.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  I don't agree with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We don't know if he won the wall yet.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  There's three steps to this - -</p><p>HILSENRATH:  In this case, right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  In this case.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  -- there's three really important things.  Number one, the bill he signed has $1.3 billion in barrier funding annualized.</p><p>Number two, he's got to exhaust all legislative efforts if he's going to go the emergency route in order to have a good case in court.</p><p>And number three, the American people when it comes to immigration, he is on the right side of this policy argument.  And Democrats who are against border security, they're going to be sorry for this eventually.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  But you know what.  You better be --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, go ahead -- Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- but you better be careful about what you do and this goes to all politicians because I was flying on Friday and that was an utter nightmare.  If you want to anger everybody in the electorate, you pull another fast one like that where people are grounded and you've got an hour and-a-half plane flight where you're at 8,000 feet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But who are you blaming?</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They were blaming (INAUDIBLE) and blaming the Democrats because --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They were blaming everybody.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- Nancy Pelosi dug in.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They were blaming everybody.  But TSA agents down in Raleigh, Durham were going to food banks because they were spending what little money they had on gas trying to get to and from work.  So again, I don't care who is responsible for it.  They're all responsible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, businesses did start, you know, putting the uncertainty out there, sitting on cash, making decisions later.  We know.  I mean the SEC closed, can't get any IPOs through.  FDA closed, got to worry about obvious food shortages or food issues.</p><p>So we were beginning to see some real impact.  And Dagen saw it firsthand at the airport.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  That's true.  But if you're a federal employee in this town, let's face it, you make a little bit of a bargain.  Yes, every year you might have to go through a shutdown with your salary.</p><p>But you know, the other thing, Maria, that we don't talk about, it's almost impossible to fire a federal employee.  There's some pretty cushy gigs --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good point.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  -- in THIS town where you basically have an insurance policy against ever getting fired unless you do something just awful.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  And you can read all the GAO reports that's backed that up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're talking about all of that this morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But there are people barely making ends meet who are trying to drive to work, and spending all their money on gasoline and going to food banks who were working for the TSA and not getting paid.</p><p>And when the Republicans stop thinking about them and start talking about the workers who aren't needed, the ones who are furloughed you have really missed the boat.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, maybe.  But how about the fact that we've got a border wall in Nancy Pelosi's state?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that immoral, the wall that separates Tijuana from San Diego --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  But --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- is that immoral?  I don't think so.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They need to start asking all of these Democrats who think that the wall is immoral or don't want to fund it, ok, let's take down the walls that are there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's how you put --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will the three million people in Tijuana assimilate with the three million people in San Diego if that wall is torn down?  I think so.  And we're going to talk about that this morning.</p><p>We've got a big show this morning from D.C., live.  Coming up Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is here, live.  National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow has a thing or two to say about the CBO protections about what exactly the impact is on the economy from that shutdown.</p><p>House Minority Leader and California Congressman Kevin McCarthy will walk us through what these next three weeks look like with his colleagues in terms of this negotiating on border wall funding.</p><p>Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell is here.</p><p>Along with AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka.</p><p>Don't miss a moment of it.  A big two hours coming up.</p><p>And we kick it off this hour right now with markets.  Futures are pointing to a flat opening this morning amid all of this uncertainty over China trade, earnings.  It's an enormous week this week.</p><p>This after stocks finished to the downside yesterday on the China growth fears, the weak guidance from Nvidia and Caterpillar as well, and of course these worries about what happens with China and the U.S.  There's conversations happening tomorrow.</p><p>Joining us right now is the founder, CEO and chief investment strategist at Mainstay Capital Management David Kudla.  David -- good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>DAVID KUDLA, FOUNDER/CEO/CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, MAINSTAY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So we've been talking about what a week this is with the fourth quarter earnings coming out.  That's been pretty much driving the story.  We have a jobs report coming out at the end of the week on Friday.  Brexit discussions, the vote today.  U.S./China discussions tomorrow.  A fourth quarter GDP number.  How do you want to invest with all of this?</p><p>KUDLA:  I think investors should be looking at stocks right now that they want to own.  We've been invested through -- the past month has been very good for stock investors.  13 percent rise through Friday from the lows of December 24th.  And that's in both growth stocks and value stocks, so a broad market advance.</p><p>We're going to see some give and take here now after this nice advance of last month but investors should be picking, you know, their points here, have their list out on stocks they want to own.  We look for a good 2019 for stock investors.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is it good news, Jon Hilsenrath, that the Fed gave us a pivot that we know that the Fed is on pause right now and that we know that they're even ready to consider slowing down the unwind of the bond portfolio?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  I don't think it's good news.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I think it shows that the Fed is becoming less confident about how strong and sustainable the economy is.  I mean it is a sign that inflation isn't picking up and that's good news.  But you see some real trepidation coming out of the Fed right now with the global economy slowing, with markets being unstable and volatile.</p><p>I think the Fed is a little worried about the outlook and that shouldn't really give us a lot of encouragement.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about that, David?  I mean the economy's slowing.</p><p>KUDLA:  But Jon this -- yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLA:  But John -- the important thing here is what happened in the fourth quarter is we had mixed messages out of fed chair Jerome Powell.  We had on October 3rd we were far away from neutral.  Then by November we were close to neutral rates.  Then on the 16th in the Fed meeting they were going to do what's right no matter what.</p><p>Then he came in on January 4th and finally said we're going to be considerate of market and economic conditions and now we're seeing a more consistent and accommodative message out of the Fed.  And that's very important for the markets.</p><p>That's music to the market's ears and that's why we've now seen a sustained advance.  So the markets and investors are now looking at a Fed that seems as though they are going to be considerate of or accommodative or take into account what's happening with the markets, with the economy, and not just normalize rates for the sake of normalizing rates.</p><p>They won't have $50 billion rolling off the balance sheet on auto pilot and they won't raise rates just to raise rates to get to a normalized rate structure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that was the worry in the fourth quarter.</p><p>KUDLA:  -- in pause like in 2016 if the market and economy warrants it.  That's important.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That was they worry in the fourth quarter -- that they were on auto pilot-- Jon.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  Yes, I make two points.</p><p>KUDLA:  That drove volatility in the fourth quarter, the Fed.  .</p><p>HILSENRATH:  David makes a really important point, you know.  So this has been Jerome Powell's first year at the Fed.  He's had a bit of a honeymoon with the market.  And then what the market has discovered in the last month or two is that Mr. Powell, you know, he kind of prides himself on being a plain-spoken communicator but his communication has confused a lot of people in the market.  And he's really had to do a lot of corrections over the last few weeks --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- so that raised some questions about him.</p><p>But the other thing about -- you know, the market wants to see the Fed on an easier path.  Ok.  But the underlying message there is that this economy can't sustain very high rates.</p><p>So it doesn't send a really encouraging message about economic growth and the economic outlook when we see that the Fed is starting to recognize it just can't sustain a tighter monetary policy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But look, we're getting the news from the companies themselves with the fourth quarter numbers coming out.  Verizon just reported mixed earnings.  They beat on earnings, but they missed on revenue.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Caterpillar.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Technology reporting late today, Apple.  And we heard from Apple already.  Facebook, Amazon -- all reporting this week, Microsoft.  It's going to be a big week for technology.  And of course you mentioned Caterpillar.  That was the big kahuna yesterday that really set the tone for the markets because Caterpillar is a great indicator of economic activity across the world, in particular China.</p><p>So stay on earnings for a second, David.  Give me your take on technology.  Because you've got Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft coming out this week.</p><p>KUDLA:  Well, you know, tech stocks got beat up very bad in the fourth quarter.  They've come back in this rally and we think that tech stocks have further to go.</p><p>Look, we think that investors should stay with tech stocks.  We have an opportunity here to add value stocks to the portfolio.  Cyclicals came into 2019 at their lowest valuation relative to the S&amp;P 500 ever.</p><p>So investors now can diversify their portfolio in an opportunistic way, holding both growth stocks.  Those tech stocks that we think still have some rebound and some further runway ahead of them, and by adding value stocks that are very opportunistic.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  David -- it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>KUDLA:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Still bullish on this market.  David Kudla joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, the State of the Union is back on, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi extended officially the invitation to President Trump to do the State of the Union in the House Chamber.  He accepted the offer.</p><p>Plus we're taking a look at the enormous cost of the shutdown, what exactly is the number?  A lot of people say it wasn't very much at all.</p><p>Then, Snapchat's unthinkable change, how the photo sharing app is attempting to compete with Instagram by changing a key feature.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>New revelations in the sexual misconduct claims against the former CEO of Wynn Resorts.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with headlines now in New York -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Maria.  The \"Wall Street Journal\" is reporting that executives at Wynn Resort ignored allegations of sexual misconduct by Steve Wynn over more than a decade.  According to a regulator's report Wynn was accused of sexually assaulting or harassing salon workers, cocktail servers and flight attendants who worked for his company.</p><p>Under a proposed settlement, the Nevada Gaming Control Board won't try to revoke Wynn's regulatory licenses but Wynn is going to pay a fine.  Steve Wynn has denied any claims of misconduct.  There's a one year chart of Wynn's in front of you right there.</p><p>Well, Snapchat has named Lara Sweet as its interim CFO.  This is another shift in leadership at Snap as the company has lost several high profile employees over the last year.  Meanwhile Snap is reportedly considering allowing longer lasting or even permanent videos on Snapchat.  It will apply the Snap shared publicly on this story's features.  Snap is down 52 percent from one year ago.  There's that chart for you.</p><p>Well, Porsche is speeding past Tesla in a fast charging race.  The car maker says it new Porsche Taycan is going to be able to add more than 60 miles of charge in just four minutes.  That will be the fastest available today, exceeding Tesla's super charging stations which needs about 30 minutes to charge a vehicle's battery to at least 80 percent.  Charging times are a key selling point obviously for these car makers and now Porsche is giving Taycan owners three years of free charging.</p><p>And obviously we're going to be hearing from Tesla this week, Maria.  Earnings are coming out from Elon Musk and company.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Cheryl -- thank you so much.</p><p>Coming up next, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi challenged over her words describing a border wall as immoral.  We will break it down when we come back.</p><p>Then support on the links, fans rallying around a pro golfer whose two shot penalty was deemed unfair.  More on that.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Keeping America safe, the government is back open but the focus now is whether President Trump can make a deal with Democratic leadership on funding for the border wall.</p><p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has called it immoral, any wall is immoral.  But her home state of California protects the southern border in some places with an actual wall -- the wall separating Tijuana and San Diego.</p><p>Joining me right now is Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell.  And the last time you were on you said you wanted to look at this again.  Congresswoman -- it's good to see you.</p><p>REP. DEBBIE DINGELL (D), MICHIGAN:  It's good to see you.  Welcome to Washington.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.</p><p>What's your take on this?  I mean can Nancy Pelosi really get away with calling a wall immoral when she has a wall in her own state, separating Tijuana from San Diego?</p><p>DINGELL:  Here is what I think is going to happen.  You've got strong countries (ph), both sides of the aisle, both houses.  They're going to go into that room and they want to cut a deal that's going to keep our nation safe.  I don't think anybody wants to see what we just went through for 35 days.</p><p>It hurt the economy.  It hurt -- and I do believe -- this is going to sound corny but I don't -- you know, why do we point -- why do we need to have a Trump win, a Pelosi win.  We need an American win.</p><p>So I'm hoping they're going to go in that room.  I've talked to my colleagues on both sides.  I've talked to Roy Blunt.  I've talked to all my Democratic colleagues in the House.  They want to win.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DINGELL:  They want to go in and put together a package that's going to keep --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So how do you win?  What's the position in terms of wall funding?  Because they may very well -- your colleagues may very well come back and say ok, here's $5 billion towards border security, not a dime toward a wall.</p><p>DINGELL:  I don't know -- if people are really working together, that may not happen.  You know, there may be money, if there are appropriate places for a wall or fence or --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is there a movement within your party, do you think, among your colleagues that they feel that, yes, some money should go for an actual barrier?</p><p>DINGELL:  I think what I hear among my colleagues is let's go into a room and do something that makes sense.  Let's come up with -- we need to -- I've said this to you a million times.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DINGELL:  We need to strengthen our borders at both sides.  Everybody talks about the southern border.  I've got this northern border too which just had a huge human trafficking problem again in the last few --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But there are areas of the southern border that are very dense.  In other words like when you just look at the wall in Nancy's state and that is three million people on one side in Tijuana, three million people on the other side in San Diego.  If you tear that wall down -- I mean isn't it obvious many of the people on the Tijuana side will assimilate into the United States?</p><p>DINGELL:  Then let me ask you this question.  Build a wall, tear down a wall -- are there structures that are working that are in place?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  .</p><p>DINGELL:  So that's -- what I do think we need drones.  We need to fill the 3,000 open patrol --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's common ground, both sides believe in that.</p><p>DINGELL:  Both agree --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Technology and drones -- definitely.</p><p>DINGELL:  We need technology.  We need to make these ports safer.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Specifically in a dense area, like Tijuana/San Diego, drones wouldn't work.  I mean maybe you want that in addition to a wall.  When you have such a dense area, where there's three million people on one side of the wall and three m million on the other, don't you need an actual barrier?</p><p>DINGELL:  But they are going to go in this room.  There are people that know what they're doing.  They're people -- they're senior people that have been on homeland security, people from the areas that are impacted --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think they're going to deal?  We won't shut down the government again?</p><p>DINGELL:  I pray to God, we never shut down the government.  Not only do I pray to God that doesn't come out of conference but you're going to see Republicans and Democrats working together.  We'll get --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This whole wall issue, Congresswoman, sort of underscores what's going on I think in both parties.  Now you've got former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz seeing an opening as a result of the radicalness on both sides.</p><p>He's facing backlash on his first stop for his book tour last night.  It was his first public appearance after announcing a possible Independent presidential run.  It did not go smoothly.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire (EXPLETIVE DELETED).  Go back to (INAUDIBLE) on Twitter.  Go back to Davos with the other billionaire elites who think they know how to run the world.  That's not what the country needs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  You know, I give you a lot of credit just being in politics, by the way.</p><p>Schultz is also being criticized by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, billionaire.  He tweeted this, \"In 2020 the great likelihood is that an Independent would just split the anti-Trump vote and end up reelecting the President.  That's a risk.  I refused to run in 2016 and we can't afford it right now.</p><p>Congresswoman -- do you think an Independent run is viable?  Do you think an Independent run from Schultz would hurt the Democrats?</p><p>DINGELL:  I think it's viable.  He has the money to spend it.  But I think he would hurt the Democrats.  I'm fearful that I am -- I'm trying to step back.  I'm not getting any candidate I want to see who is going to emerge, who's got people skills.</p><p>But this is dangerous.  And as you know, told you two years ago, Donald Trump could become president.  Nobody believed me.  You all thought I was crazy.  You may not have but most people did.</p><p>And I still think he could get reelected.  And if we do not run a strong campaign and we don't have somebody like that that pulls votes off --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  One of the issues is the messaging of what the platform is.  So what do you think the Democratic candidate for 2020 should have as their platform?  What's most important?</p><p>DINGELL:  You know what we didn't do and one of the reasons I believe firmly that President Trump became President Trump.  One, people are tired of partisan bickering.  They're tired of seeing things not get done in Washington.</p><p>There are a lot of people that are hurting in this country, just working men and women who want to know that we actually care about them.  They're scared about healthcare.  They're scared about escalating drug costs.  There's -- look at our --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So healthcare should be the platform?</p><p>DINGELL:  it's one piece of it.  Infrastructure, let's create jobs.  What are we going to do about education?  Trade?</p><p>Now, the President -- you want to know why he won Michigan?  Trade.  They're tired of bad trade deals that ship jobs overseas.  We don't have a level playing field.  The President's trade policy is all over the place.</p><p>It's not consistent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you going to vote for the ratification of USMCA?</p><p>DINGELL:  I don't call it USMC.  I call it NAFTA 2.0.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you going to vote for ratification.</p><p>DINGELL:  I haven't decided yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is on your plate now in the next month.</p><p>DINGELL:  Very much on my plate.  And talk to Lighthizer about it all the time.  But I'm not voting for any bill that doesn't have and acting legislation that keeps more manufacturing from going to Mexico.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wasn't that one of the key things of this new law?</p><p>DINGELL:  But Blazer still went to --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Keeping jobs here.</p><p>DINGELL:  Blazers went to Mexico in July.  I'm not seeing any more American cars go to Mexico and get built for $1.50 to $3.50 and then gets shipped back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you want a change before you vote for it?</p><p>DINGELL:  He knows how I feel.  I'm not -- one of the more likely people to vote for it but I'm not voting for it in the form that it's in right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.   We'll leave it there.</p><p>Congresswoman -- it's good to see you.</p><p>DINGELL:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.  Congresswoman Debbie Dingell joining us here.</p><p>Coming up, the longest government shutdown in American history is over.  But another shutdown threat is on the horizon.  We will talk about the next three weeks, what it looks like with House Minority Leader, Kevin McCarthy.  He's up next.</p><p>Then you've got a friend again.  The new teaser trailer for \"Toy Story 4\" drops with a big surprise.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Tuesday, January 29th.  Your top stories right now at 7:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Earnings season in full swing this morning for the fourth quarter.  Several Dow components reporting their fourth quarter this morning.  Verizon reported a mixed quarter earlier this hour.  Pfizer and 3M also under pressure this morning as you can see.  3M up three percent, although Pfizer and Verizon down better than one percent.</p><p>Rising tensions with China continuing, the U.S. bringing charges against Chinese telecom company Huawei as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning between the two nations.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will be joining me as my special guest this morning at the top of the hour, 8:00 a.m. Eastern.  Join us for that talk on China and the economy as we break it all down with the Treasury secretary.</p><p>Markets this morning are hovering around the flat line.  Take a look.  Dow Industrials up 20 points right now, 26 higher.  The S&amp;P 500 is down by almost one point and the NASDAQ down about three points.</p><p>All this after the major indices finished lower yesterday across the board at 04:00 on Wall Street.  Dow industrials were down 208 points and then actually was off of the lows of the -- of the day, down almost one percent at the close.  S&amp;P 500 gave up 21 points, that was three-quarters of one percent.  And the NASDAQ was down 79 points, better than one percent lower.</p><p>In Europe this morning, a mixed story, actually mostly higher.  FT-100 at the high of the morning right here, up 1-1/4 percent, 83 points higher, ahead of the British vote on the U.K. leaving the E.U.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is up 42 points, almost one percent higher and the DAX Index in Germany higher by 25, quarter of a percent higher there.</p><p>Asian markets mostly quiet overnight.  Take a look, as you can see, it was pretty much across the board.</p><p>$100,000 penalty, how one misstep cost a professional golfer big time.  The outcry, coming up.</p><p>And Woody and Buzz Lightyear are back, the new teaser trailer for \"Toy Story 4\" is out and it marks the return of one character after 20 years.  We will bring it to you.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning.  But first, our top story this half an hour, shutdown showdown, the government open for business again after the last -- at least for the next three weeks, rather.  But the main issue, funding the wall has not been resolved and the White House is not letting it go.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  What I do know is that if they don't come back with a deal, that means Democrats get virtually nothing.  That will make the president and force him to have to take executive action that does not give Democrats the things that they want.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is the House Minority leader, Congressman Kevin McCarthy.  Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you.</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  Thanks for having me back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So, what do the next three weeks look like?  Take us through these negotiating.  Do you expect any money for the wall?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  I expect us to solve this problem in the end.  What's interesting here is the whole time speaker Pelosi said I couldn't negotiate anything until you open up government.  The president put the public first and said OK, let's go through, I'll give you three weeks.</p><p>Now Wednesday, we'll have the conference committee, the senators and the congressional members' appropriation sit down and we'll see if they're serious about it, if they're willing to do something.  Because I believe Nancy Pelosi is out of step with her own party.  If you look at her number two, Steny Hoyer.  He said of course, that walls are not immoral, and that he believes some fencing involved.  From her Agricultural secretary to her Agricultural chair to our Armed Services chair, they both believe in a wall too.  Her Agriculture chairman said give Trump the money.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and she continues to say that it's immoral which I find incredible given the fact she has a wall in her own state.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  As my state too.  You know what I find --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And your state too, exactly.  California.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  You know what I find immoral?  When you really talk about this, this is about stopping human trafficking.  In 2016, they stopped more than 2,000 individuals involved in that.  I think it's immoral that you would allow that to continue.  I don't believe anybody in America that says they support border security believes that there is no such thing as some barrier.</p><p>And the president said, he does not a -- he does not want a wall from sea to shining sea.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  He just believes in the area you need some form of barrier and he's correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, where do you think are the most important areas that you would need the wall?  I mean, we talked earlier about this wall in your state, Tijuana, San Diego where it's very dense, three million people on one side, three million people on the other.  Can you make the case that that dense area is elsewhere where that's why the president is so stuck on having this wall there?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  And it's not the president saying, it's the experts.  The president sat down with the experts and they said this is what we need to be able to secure our border.</p><p>So in certain areas, like in San Diego, we stopped illegal movement by more than 95 percent.  You look at Yuma, Arizons, El Paso another -- El Paso became one of the safest cities in the nation after being able to put it through.  That's what we need, in certain parts of the country along the border, you need a barrier.  In other parts you could put the drones in this part area.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what are you expecting to give on?  And what -- do you think they're going to offer the $5.7 billion that the president wants for border security?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  But we're arguing over one-tenth of one percent of the budget.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a great point.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  The Democrats have voted for a wall before.  But now that the president brings forward what the experts want, they say no.  That is what's so confusing to me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, what -- why is this so important for the president right now?  Going into 2020, I mean, is she seeing this as a campaign promise and that's why he doesn't -- she won't agree to it.  Because I don't know how she can call it immoral, given the wall in her own state, your own state.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Again, it's such a little price to pay for so much more security when you look at the human trafficking.  Think of the number of lives that we will save from this process if we have a secure border.</p><p>But what's more importantly, it's the president that sat down and tried to be reasonable, find common ground.  He's the one who brought DACA into it.</p><p>And let's not forget, speaker Pelosi just a year ago holds the record for the longest speech on the floor, eight hours, over one issue, DACA, which she shut the government down over.  And now she thinks that's not important?  I think those people are important as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think that this -- a negotiation, an agreement will include a DACA deal?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  It could.  It doesn't have to.  But because the Democrats and speaker Pelosi have been saying no.  The president said he was willing to go there, three more years of DACA for a portion of the border security that the experts are asking for.  I just find her out of step with her own party.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, there seems to be a movement within the party, even some of the newer congress people coming in, fresher faces saying you know what, yes, we do need border security and we do need the money.  So, are they going head to head?  I mean, are they -- do they even have a voice?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  They don't even have a voice.  Because remember, she has so much power.  She will not allow the vote to come up.  I believe inside the conference we could come up with an agreement.  The question is, will speaker Pelosi even allow that to be voted on the floor?  If we had a vote on the floor, I believe it would pass.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think that the president will allow the government to shut down again?  I mean, is the president really prepared to have another government shutdown if he doesn't get the money?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Look, I think the president's going to try to find a way to solve this one way or another.  I don't know that shutting the government down solves it.  I there's other ways to do that the president can.  I know he firmly believes in a legislative process.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Should he call for a national emergency?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  He has the power to do that.  I think the best road forward right now is a legislative agreement.  And what's so interesting to me, I'd listened to these Democrats celebrate Nancy Pelosi.  You celebrated someone that got you status quo.  They're still a DACA problem, they're still a border security problem.</p><p>And government is designed to find common ground and compromise.  The president was the one person looking reasonable in all these discussions.  I know the president's committed to this.  He will get the border secure one way or another.  He's giving the Democrats an opportunity.  He gave them an opportunity all along this discussion.  They said then open up the government, they'll discuss it.  So he did that and gave them a three week time.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean, I think this whole thing, the government shutdown and the constant resist upsets people.  I mean, you have to wonder if in fact -- you know, she keeps resisting everything that the president wants, if the people will turn on her.  Because people want to see you guys get something done.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Yes, she is celebrating status quo.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  That's not where we need to be --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me move on and ask you about 2010, congressman.  Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz thinking about running for office.  He was at a book signing last night in New York and he was heckled over his bid.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Don't help elect Trump.  You egotistical billionaire (INAUDIBLE).  Go back to getting ratioed on Twitter.  Go back to Davos with the other billionaire elites who think they know how to run the world.  That's not what the country needs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This heckler not the only one weighing in.  Michael Bloomberg former mayor of New York City also told Schultz not to run as an independent.  He said this, given the strong pull of partisanship and the realities of the electoral college system, there's no way an independent can win.  That is truer today than ever before.  Is that where we are, an independent can't win, congressman?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  No, I think it's Bloomberg upset.  Because remember, he went from a Republican to an independent to a Democrat and he just spent $120 million giving to the Democrats so they can win the majority in the House and he doesn't want his money to be wasted, so he doesn't want competition.</p><p>Look, I think there's ample opportunity for an independent to get in this race, only because the Democrats are now become social Democrats.  They're talking about a 70 percent tax rate.  They're talking about these green deals.  They're talking about socialism.  If you listen to what some of these new Democrats say, they think Venezuela's problem is not because they're a socialist country, it's because of sanctions.  They're so out of step.  They are putting letters in to help those who want to go sign up for ISIS, to be easy on them to the judge.  I mean, I have -- this is not the America we live in, and that's the difference.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  This party is so out of step and I think you'll find a lot of moderate Democrats who say I want somebody else who could talk about this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, that's why a number of moderate Democrats can't really get the OK from the party leadership because they're not left enough.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  This new socialist Democrat Party has left the Democratic Party.  They are in to -- remember, Bernie Sanders is not registered as a Democrat.  He's registered as a socialist.  AOC does not call herself a Democrat, she calls herself a Democrat socialist.  This party is moving to a whole different place.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Real quick before you go, when the election happened back in November.  You said one of your priorities going to be to get the majority back.  How are you going to do it?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Well, first of all, you've got to make sure you can recruit.  I think, you put the ideas up there.  Ideas should win at the end of the day.  You look at where we are financially in this country.  A lot of that happens to do with the policies that we're able to create, from the tax policy, the battle we had with you human trafficking and other that we were able to do.  I think you're going to find as going directly to, we've got to find a suburban areas to be able to win again in and I think we're going to be very successful.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, it's good to see you.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Congressman Kevin McCarthy, joining us there.</p><p>Still ahead, Richard Trumka AFL-CIO president on the impact of the shutdown on American workers, what he'd like to see, back in a moment with that.</p><p>And then, support on the links, a pro golfer given a big fine and a two-shot penalty which many are calling grossly unfair.  What went wrong, right here.</p><p>Plus, you've got a friend and a big surprise, the trailer for \"Toy Story 4\" drops with a character we haven't seen in 20 years.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Prosecutors resting their case against Joaquin El Chapo Guzman.  Cheryl Casone in New York with details and headlines, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It; must something else, Maria.  The federal government has now rested its case.  They called 56 witnesses.  The trial of the notorious Mexican drug kingpin started back in mid-November.  El Chapo told the trial judge yesterday he will not take the stand in his own defense.  One witness is scheduled to appear for the defense today.  Closing arguments expected to take place tomorrow and Thursday.  Big story, a lot of New Yorkers have been following very closely.</p><p>Well, professional golfer Haotong Li is getting a huge outpouring of support from fellow golfers after losing out on nearly $100,000 Saturday for a minor infraction.  It happened at the Omega Dubai Desert Classic.  Li was on the 18th green when judges accuses caddie of standing too close behind him as he got ready to putt.  Well, the ensuing penalty dropped Li's score from 71 to 73.  And he went from third to 12th.  Tour officials say the correct call was made but acknowledge it was grossly unfair.  They're looking at the giving referees more discretion in cases like this going forward.</p><p>And then, get ready for \"Toy Story 4\".  Pixar is putting out this teaser video, shows the revival of Woody's love interest, Bo Peep.  And she is back with a new, more modern look.  She was last seen in \"Toy Story 2\", back in 1999.  It is now 20 years later, \"Toy Story 4\" is going to be released, Maria, this June .  Those are your headlines from New York, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like it.  Bo Peep.  All right, thank you Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, the lingering effects of the shutdown showdown.  AFL-CIO Richard Trumka will join us to talk about the impact on American workers.  He's up next.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We are focused on the American worker this morning.  White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney saying that the 800,000 federal workers who were not paid twice during the partial government shutdown should receive those checks by the end of this week.</p><p>Joining us right now is American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organization's president, AFL-CIO, Richard Trumka.  It's great to see you, Richard.  Thank you so much for being here.</p><p>RICHARD TRUMKA, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR AND CONGRESS OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION:  Maria, thanks for having me on today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Give us your take on what the impact of the shutdown was.</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, I think there's several impacts.  There's impact on the people and you not only have government workers who get back pay but you have the government contractors who won't get back pay unless something is done.  That was a devastating effect on them.  It had a devastating effect on the economy itself.  $11 billion, although we'll pick some of that back up later in the year.</p><p>But you had a devastating effect on the airline industry where you had people, airline controllers, traffic controllers that were in school that actually just up and left.  They said we're not going to do this anymore (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What could -- what could have been done about it then, Rich?  Because you as the leader that you are and representing so many workers across the country have to be unnerved when you see open borders and illegals coming in and taking your jobs.</p><p>TRUMKA:  Look, that's just not how it works anymore.  I mean, you have people that got laid off from the president's place that have been here 20 years.  They're not taking anybody's job.  What we want to do is make sure every worker in this country has the same rights so that they can't be exploited.</p><p>Because what happens right now with undocumented workers is, they're great when no one's around.  When they try to organize and get a voice, then they start squeezing them.  They start ex -- you know, doing, calling in ICE and different things.</p><p>The idea is if everybody has the same rights, then they can't exploit those people and everybody can actually have a fair playing field.  What happens to American workers -- employers right now, is you have an employer that hires people, makes them work in unfair condition, misclassifies them, underpays them, and they're competing against our employer.  That employer needs to pay everybody the same rate, live by the same working conditions, so that we can all compete.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you're OK with illegals coming in and as long as everybody's treated the same?</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, Maria, it's a -- it's a nice cliche, illegals coming in.  But you know yourself that most people that are here undocumented or illegally came in legally.  So the whole system needs to be addressed.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, but there are apprehensions that we could look at, just in the month of December, just in the month of November, where apprehensions were of illegal immigrants coming in and wanting asylum in the United States.</p><p>TRUMKA:  There's no question that the system is broken.  We need to fix the system and have a path towards citizenship so that those workers that have been here for years and are actually making the economy run, even the president's golf courses and things like that, they have a chance to get citizenship and they work their work there.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Just a question on the golf courses.  As you know, that's the H2B program, people who come here as foreign workers, come under a specified amount of time for DOL.  I think the real question is is that, what happens to all the people, not who have been here who came legally and overstayed the visa, but what about all the people who come every day at the southern border and can cross into our country?  That's really the pernicious problem.  And even on wall, built with American workers, you'd be for that.</p><p>TRUMKA:  But listen, the people that come back and forth, you have Americans that go to Mexico and Mexicans that come to America to work.  I think Mexico --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you don't think there's a problem at the border at all?</p><p>TRUMKA:  I didn't say that.  There is -- there is a problem.  We do need border security.  And no, I don't think that a wall's the answer to it.  Every time someone's tried to build a wall it's not been very successful.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, the one in Tijuana is successful.</p><p>TRUMKA:  Ask the Chinese, ask the French.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The wall -- the wall in Tijuana --</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Ask Tijuana (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tijuana and San Diego, what abut that Richard?</p><p>TRUMKA:  I'm sorry?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The wall, between Tijuana -- separating Tijuana from San Diego, is that successful?</p><p>TRUMKA:  There are places -- there are places probably where it works.  Is that the answer to everything?  No.  Should that have been the reason for a shutdown?  Absolutely not.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  I want -- I want to ask a broader political question.  We've seen in the last two elections that increasingly voters, blue collar voters, voters in manufacturing towns all over America, the kind of rank and file people that you represent are voting for Republicans, they're going for Trump.  Does the AFL-CIO need to realign its own approach to politics in this town, given that more and more of its people are going with people like Donald Trump and his trade policies and the Republican Party?</p><p>TRUMKA:  Well, that's a -- that's a question we could talk about two or three hours for.  First of all, we have realigned our politics.  We are issuing -- we're issue oriented right now.  We put an issue out and if a politician supports that issue, then we support them.</p><p>In fact, in this last election we elected two union members to the Senate, three to governorship, 18 to the House of Representative, and 925 to state legislatures, because those workers will go and support our issues.  That's what we try to do.  We find it more and more difficult to find Republicans that actually support us.  Now, the American worker believes that neither the political system --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got to jump.</p><p>TRUMKA:  -- or the economic system works for them.  They want somebody to change the rules.  That's why they voted for Trump.  If he changes the rules to their advantage, some of them will vote for him again.  If he doesn't, he stands a chance of losing those workers and right now he's losing those workers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Richard, thank you so much for joining us.  We appreciate it.  Richard Trumka there.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Show: MORNINGS WITH MARIA][Date: January 29, 2019][Time: 08:00:00][Tran: 012903cb.231][Type: SHOW][Head: Apple Disables Group FaceTime Function That Was Allowing Callers To Listen And View Without Your Consent; British Parliament To Vote On Brexit Amendments; Kudlow on the Economy; Craft Brewers Impacts from the Government Shutdown; Kudlow on China Trade][Sect: News; Domestic][Byline: Maria Bartiromo, Gerri Willis, Ashley Webster, Hillary Vaughn, Dagen McDowell][Guest: Steven Mnuchin, Larry Kudlow, Matt Schlapp, Jon Hilsenrath][Spec: FaceTime; Huawei; Apple; Brexit; Federal Reserve; 3M; Harley-Davidson; Verizon; Oath Media; Channel Inventory; World War II; CBO; Trade Talks; Deregulations; Tax Plan; China Trade; Slowdown; Government Shutdown]</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good Tuesday morning.  Welcome back, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  Live from Washington this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is January 29th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  Earnings in focus.  Investors watching results from several Dow components this morning ahead of the opening bell.  One to watch after the bell tonight -- after the close is Apple.</p><p>Meanwhile, Apple under fire FaceTime hit with a new bug that allows people to eavesdrop on you without your knowledge and even if you don't take the call.  Rising tensions with China, the U.S. brings charges against Chinese telecom company, Huawei as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  The very latest on the state of negotiations with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin coming up.</p><p>Markets are searching for direction this morning.  Take a look at the futures ahead of the open this morning.  Dow industrials picking up speed up 55 points right now, a quarter of a percent higher.  S&amp;P 500 is up two and the NASDAQ right now right now showing a gain of 11 points at the open in about an hour and a half.  This after declines across the board yesterday.  Stocks finished off of the lows, but nonetheless the Dow Industrials gave up 209 points yesterday 4:00, almost one percent lower.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 gave up 21 points, three quarters of a percent lower.  And the NASDAQ was down 79 points.  That was better than one percent lower yesterday.  Global markets this morning are mostly higher.  Take a look at European indices with the FT-100-is at the high of the morning, up 86 points, 1-1/4 percent ahead of the vote on Brexit.  CAC quarante in Paris us up 44 points and the DAX index up 21, fractional gain there.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets were little changed.  Take a look, it was pretty much across the board.  Now, our top story this morning, concerns of a global slowdown.  Last week in Davos I spoke with Bridgewater Associates founder, Ray Dalio, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, and Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey.  Here's what they said about the possibility of an economic slowdown on the horizon.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RAY DALIO, FOUNDER, BRIDGEWATER ASSOCIATES:  Europe has a negative growth and the United States is going to have a negative growth environment.  I don't mean absolute negative, I mean slowing of growth in a material way that could be close to between zero and two percent over the next 18 months.</p><p>BRIAN MOYNIHAN, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, BANK OF AMERICA:  We have the top research firm in the world, and they have done a great job.  And they have the U.S. growing at 2-1/2 percent this year.  The world growing 3-1/2 percent GDP growth.  But that's down from last year.  And so the confusion in the environment right now is a slowdown or is it going in to a recession?</p><p>Nothing we see says it's close to a recession.</p><p>JAMES QUINCEY, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, COCA-COLA:  I think we are in danger of talking ourselves into a problem.  It's just a little bit slower growth.  It's not a recession or a decline.  So we see -- we see a little -- a little softer 2019, maybe a little less tail wind than 2018.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now in a Fox Business exclusive is the treasury secretary of the United States, Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  Great to see you, Secretary.</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, UNITED STATES TREASURY SECRETARY:  Great to see you as well, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.  Your reaction to really what seems like now a unanimous feeling that a slowdown is on the horizon.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, Maria, from everything we see, the U.S. economy is still quite strong.  The companies are doing quite well.  And we see still tremendous investment in capital and human investments.  There's no question that as it relates to Europe and China, there is a slowdown.  We're monitoring that carefully.  But we still see a tremendous opportunity and a lot of capital coming into the U.S.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Federal Reserve basically told us they are on pause.  They may even pause the balance sheet unwind which is also telling us that the Fed is also expecting a slowdown, but do you believe a recession is on the horizon in 2020 even though you're seeing strength and stability so far?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  We see no indications whatsoever of a recession on the horizon.  And from everything we see from speaking to a large across the board businesses, the combination of tax reform, regulatory relief and trade is still has a very strong impact on the U.S. economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And some people are saying that the impact of certainly of trade and tariffs is causing some uncertainty.  So how much of this slowdown that we're expecting later on even if it's not right now is due to what you say you're watching China and Europe and how much of it is uncertainty around the President's tariffs program?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, Maria, as you said, there are people who expect a slowdown but I would just comment a year ago with the projections were 2-1/2 percent.  And we were at three.  We feel very comfortable we're going to hit three for last year.  And we think there's still a very good case for three percent this year.  Now, as it relates to trade, we couldn't be more pleased with the USMCA.  We are looking forward to Congress passing that quickly.</p><p>That's a very important trade deal.  We have two days of talks with China starting tomorrow.  The President is going to be involved in those talks at the conclusion.  We've been updating him.  We have another 30 days after this.  So I think we're making significant progress, and I think on the trade front, these are all very positive impacts for the U.S. economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about the trade talks because this story of China, first off, thank you to the President and to the administration for pushing back on China because that's another unanimous feeling out there, that the President did the right thing in terms of stopping China from some of its practices.  What are you expecting out of these talks?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, the President wants fair trade with China.  It's got to be reciprocal.  Right now China has free access into our markets, and we have limited access to there.  So the critical issue that we've talked about is market access, making sure there aren't forced joint ventures, not forced transfer of technology and that we have a mechanism that when we reach an agreement that we can monitor that agreement and that they'll live up to it.</p><p>And that's how I expect we will make significant progress this week on those issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How much of a priority is espionage?  Obviously the administration unveiling a sweeping set of criminal charges against Huawei Technologies.  We have had on a number of CEOs that have said yes, they have stolen trade secrets from us.  Has this come into the conversation with your Chinese leadership?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  No, let me be clear.  Those are separate issues.  And that's a separate dialogue.  So as it relates to the Huawei issues that's being run by the Justice Department.  I have no involvement in that.  I found out about that yesterday when it was announced.  So those are not part of trade discussions.  Forced technology issues are part of trade discussions but any issues as it relates to violation of U.S. law or U.S. sanctions are going through a separate track, which is the Justice Department.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, I guess the broader issue is, is this a cultural thing in China?  I mean this weekend on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" over on Fox News I spoke with the ranking member of the Intel Committee, House Intel Committee Devin Nunes and he went through some of the practices that China does every day.  Listen to this.  I've got to get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  China might have accessed allied intelligence shared with Poland and passed it on to Moscow.</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R), CALIFORNIA:  What the Chinese are doing is that they have these companies that are essentially owned by the party, the Communist Party and essentially this is a dictatorship.  There's very few people that own these companies.  They weaponize the.  So when all over the -- all over the world you have Chinese technology specifically as it relates to infrastructure on -- communications infrastructure, they will go in and they beat every other company around the world.</p><p>And in fact, they've driven a lot of companies out of business because they come in undercut.  They want to have control over all the com systems or communication systems all over the globe.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's pretty incredible.  We will handle your infrastructure of telecom and then they have a way in of spying.  How can you separate that from the conversation on trade and on forced transfer of technology?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Maria, I think you can easily separate these issues.  So there are two different issues.  One is an issue of state subsidies where they do subsidize state enterprises and they compete unfairly.  Those are trade issues, those are violations of the WTO and that's something from an economic standpoint.  We are going to enforce very seriously.  I think you know among the National Security Council, so I'm going to be careful what I say on national security issues.</p><p>But I assure you whether it's China or anywhere else in the world, our security services, DHS and others will make sure that we protect the U.S. infrastructure, we protect from cyberattacks.  That's something we're very well aware of.  But these are separate issues and shouldn't be confused.  We are focused on what are unfair economic practices.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So the best case that you can get from China is what?  Opening up their markets?  Already we are seeing some likelihood of that, UBS I guess was the first bank that was allowed to operate in China and own 51 percent of that bank.  They say they're going to go to 100 percent in three years.  Are you seeing a significant opening in terms of the Chinese willingness to open their markets to foreigners?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I do, but I think that's a good start.  But why should we have to wait three years for a U.S. company to own 100 percent in the financial services?  China can operate and own 100 percent of companies here.  So that's an example where, you know, they're moving in the right direction.  We want to speed that up.  But the issue is really we want to make sure that U.S. companies can compete fairly in China.</p><p>And if we can do that, China has a very large growing middle class.  It's an enormous market.  As I have said before, this is one of the biggest opportunities for U.S. companies in U.S. business if we can get this right.  And President Trump is determined.  This is the first administration that has aggressively said to China, you need to play fair.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is the President willing to drop all tariffs, should he get a good deal that's acceptable?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I think everything is on the table.  So the President is -- will look at, again, the objective is to have a very fair deal.  Hopefully we'll make progress this week.  The President will be involved in these negotiations and discussions.  And we've still got a lot of work to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the President said look, I'm a tariff guy.  I like tariffs.  So does that mean these tariffs are for, you know, no end in sight or would he be willing to drop the tariffs all together?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  The President hasn't made any decisions on that.  There have been no recommendations from the economic team on that yet.  The first step is to make sure we get a good agreement.  And when we get a good agreement, we'll make a recommendation to the President and he will consider that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have seen the Chinese economy get impacted.  You're still talking about 6.4 percent growth, we think, but that is lower than some people think.  What's your worry or how concerning is it that the Chinese slowdown will impact the United States?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, there's no question that China is slowing down.  They still have significant growth rates.  We're beginning to see the impact on that on world growth.  Our objective is not to slow down China.  Our objective is to make sure that U.S. companies can do business in China and can do business fairly.  So we're monitoring these issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary, stay with us.  We want to get into the shutdown and get your impact on how much the shutdown cost the economy and what you're expecting there.  Stay with us.  More of my exclusive interview with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin when we come right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are life live this morning in Washington, D.C.  And I'm sitting right now with -- in a Fox Business exclusive with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  And Treasury Mnuchin, we were talking about the broad economy.  I want to ask your thoughts on the shutdown.  The CBO says that the shutdown caused $11 billion impact to the economy, $3 billion which is completely lost because of the 35-day shutdown.  Your reaction?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Maria, Kevin Hassett, the CEA is working on final numbers for us.  I think his view is that there's no question that there was some cost but those costs will be recovered as money comes back into the system.  I think it's -- he views that it will almost all be recovered.  Now as it relates to the exact numbers, I haven't seen the final numbers yet.  But the good news is we got the government open.</p><p>People are back to work and we have not seen any significant impact on the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Has -- is the President prepared to shut down the government again in three weeks if he doesn't get the money for the border wall?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Maria, I had dinner last night with the President, the Vice President, Senator Lindsey Graham.  We had a very good discussion on this issue.  There's no question in my mind that the President, the Vice President want to do a fair deal.  Lindsey has been terrific in helping to negotiate this.  I hope the Democrats are sincere.  If they are, there's a sincere deal that will include a lot of different issues that need to be resolved.</p><p>But if they're not sincere, the President has all his options on the table.  And he's determined that he's going to make sure we have border security.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's the impact on the IRS?  There's a lot of worry out there that people are not going to get their checks after April 15th as a result of this shutdown.  What can we expect?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, let me just comment on both the treasury, our bureaus, the IRS in particular, I want to thank the enormous number of government employees who came in and worked during the shutdown.  I think as you know, we had the ability to bring in critical employees.  We never would have been able to do the sanctions that we've been doing over the last month without the hardworking people.</p><p>And the IRS had a large number of critical employees to make sure that we were ready to open for business as usual.  So we're ready to open for tax season.  We're taking tax returns.  We'll be ready for tax refunds.  We will have the phones restaffed.  Now, let me just say that there's no question, this time of the year, there's very, very heavy call volume.  That's something we have to manage.  I encourage taxpayers who have questions to try to go to the web first.</p><p>But we are ready for tax season, and I can assure you that tax refunds will be paid as normal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  So, tax refunds will be paid as normal.  That's the bottom line.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  People were worried about that.  Let me move to the sanctions and in particular Venezuela because you've applied sanctions on the Venezuelan oil industry.  Tell us specifically what the impact here is.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Well, sanctions are a very important tool in our national security portfolio.  And when we look at national security issues, we look at economic tools.  We look at diplomacy.  We look at national security tools, military options.  So there's no question that what we're trying to do is to cut off the money to the regime that should not be in power and make sure that the President Guaido has access to funds and has access to the assets of the country.</p><p>And to make sure we protect these assets for the people of Venezuela.  It's really quite sad.  This is a country that is very, very rich in oil resources that has had extraordinary poverty and extraordinary humanitarian issues over the last issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And have you spoken with the opposition leader party about this?  What has been the response so far?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I haven't personally, but I know the Vice President has been in communication.  I think the response has been very positive.  We've been very careful in balancing this.  We've -- I've spoken to many of the refineries over the last week.  I want to make sure that there was significant capacity.  There's a lot of oil on the water already in transit to the U.S. refineries.  So I think on the one hand, we've been able to cut off Venezuelan oil going forward.</p><p>But we're managing this with the U.S. refineries.  We've issued licenses for the U.S. refineries to continue to operate.  And if Venezuela wants to continue to sell us oil, which we would like to buy that money would go into blocked accounts and will be protected for the people of Venezuela.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what about other industries in Venezuela?  I mean, the sanctions are on the oil industry.  What about other money, other imports that they still get that?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  We will always look at additional sanctions.  We want to make sure that things like medicine and other humanitarian issues continue to go to the people.  We will always look at additional sanctions to make sure we protect the assets of the country for the people of Venezuela.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why was it important for the President to back the opposition leader?</p><p>MNUCHIN:  I think he is the rightful leader of the country, the national assembly, the constitution.  I think, you know, democracy is very important to the people of the United States.  And we want to make sure that there are free and fair elections and that there is a proper democracy that's very important to the national security of the United States.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary, it's good to have you on the program.</p><p>MNUCHIN:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you very much.  Secretary Steven Mnuchin joining us.  Coming up, earnings in focus.  Major companies reporting this week including Apple after the bell tonight.  What you need to know ahead of those numbers.  Then the U.K. facing a crucial test.  British lawmakers voting later today on measures surrounding the U.K.'s potential exit from the European Union.  Back in a moment with that.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Earnings driving markets this morning.  3M, Harley-Davidson, Verizon out with mixed reports this morning.  Gerri Willis is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange watching markets.  Gerri?</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  That's right.  3M, Dow component, a split decision here missing on estimates beating on revenue.  The EPS line $2.27 a share.  Revenue 7.95 billion.  They lowered their 2019 guidance.  But they say they're positioned for success in 2019 despite the global slowdown.  Stock trading higher.  Harley-Davidson, let's get to that, a big miss on both the top and the bottom line.</p><p>EPS of 17 cents a share.  Revenue of 955 million.  The stock is down and down hard this morning nearly 10 percent.  They're citing restructuring charges, incremental tariffs and recall costs.  Big troubles for the hog.  Verizon beating on EPs but missing on revenue.  We're seeing yet another split decision here.  EPS of a $1.12 a share.  Revenue of 34.3 billion.  The stock trading down nearly four percent here.</p><p>Profit hurt by the restructuring of Oath Media business as we have discussed.  Apple coming after the bell, this is critical earnings release for the markets here.  EPS estimate of $4.17 a share.  Revenue of 84 billion.  We will be focused like a laser on iPhone.  iPhone sales in China, is there an iPhone recession going on in China right now?  Watch Channel Inventory for some of the details about that.</p><p>Meanwhile, Apple having trouble with FaceTime.  A bug where callers can eavesdrop on FaceTime calls has cropped up.  The company says they are checking it.  But you should know that Tim Cook on Monday, well, he was saying big things about International Data Privacy Day asking users to insist on reforms.  Oops, I guess they got a problem.  Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Gerri.  Thanks very much.  Gerri Willis on Wall Street.  British lawmakers will debate several amendments to the U.K.'s planned exit from the European Union today and let Prime Minister Theresa May know what parliament is prepared to vote for.  Ashley Webster is live in London right now with that.  Ashley?</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.  Good morning, Maria.  This is if Parliament knows exactly what it will vote for.  There will be at least 15 amendments to choose from -- will be debated.  That will be up to the Common Speaker John Bercow.  He will decide which ones will be debated.  And it could indeed shape the future of what Brexit will look like moving forward.</p><p>Now, among the most popular amendments that we are expecting to be the debated will be what's called the Cooper amendment, that's Yvette Cooper, the Labour M.P.  It basically says if no deal is reached by February the 26th, it would postpone Brexit for nine months essentially to end of the year from march 29th, that's the date that exists now.  Then there's the Brady amendment, the Graham Brady (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>He basically is putting forward an amendment that would replace the Irish backstop with what is called alternative arrangements, such pretty vague, basically anything elsewhere and what we have now and there is no time limit on that backstop.  We have heard that Prime Minister Theresa May has already told European leaders that she wants to reopen Brexit negotiations.  Let's not forget, just last month, in December, the Prime Minister said it wasn't going to be reopened that the E.U had given her their best deal.</p><p>Now she wants to turn around and say look, you need to reopen negotiations.  I'm going to find out from Parliament what they are prepared to vote for and let's go from there.  And it calls today is January 29th.  The Brexit deadline, March 29th.  We have exactly two months left to go, Maria.  And let's be honest, there is no sign yet of a -- of a deal in place that a majority of people in Parliament can get behind.</p><p>Yesterday we had a whole series of warnings about what would happen if there was a no deal scenario.  Just crashing out retail consortiums saying, look, there's going to be empty shelves, prices are going to go up, a break in the supply chain.  It will be very, very detrimental to the British economy.  So that is the background.  Later on today, we'll find out what Parliament can get behind.  Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Ashley.  Thanks so much.  We'll check back with you.  Ashley Webster in London this morning.  Coming up.  The shutdown impact on your wallet.  I will be speaking with National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow on the economic effects of the shutdown.  Plus Federal debt reportedly headed to the highest level since World War II.</p><p>That is next.  One brewery feeling the impact.  The shutdown hitting one San Diego beer company.  We've got that story.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thank so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo coming to you live this morning from Washington, D.C.  It is Tuesday, January 29th.  Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Earnings season in full swing.  We have heard from Harley-Davidson, hit in the pre-markets after disappointing numbers.  Xerox as well headed higher after beating expectations.  Look at Harley-Davidson's shares down almost 10 percent right now.  China, one of the issues, once again.  Meanwhile rising tensions with China on the U.S. level.  The U.S. bringing charges against Chinese telecom company, Huawei, as trade talks are set to resume tomorrow morning.  Moments ago, I spoke with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin who talked about what the U.S. is looking for in the coming talks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MNUCHIN:  The President wants fair trade with China.  It's got to be reciprocal.  Right now, China has free access into our markets and we have limited access to there.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Futures this morning are higher.  Take a look, we have the highs of the morning right here with the Dow Jones Industrial average up 73 points, a third of a percent.  The S&amp;P 500 up 4-1/2, and the NASDAQ higher by 18 points, one-quarter of one percent.  European indices this morning are also higher.  Take a look.  FT-100 in London is up almost 100 points, 1-1/2 percent.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is up 55, better than one percent.  And the DAX Index in Germany up 37 points, that's one-third of one percent.  Asian markets mostly flat overnight as you'll see that was pretty much across the board with Japan and Korea squeaking out a fractional gain.</p><p>Our top story this half an hour, the cost of the government shutdown.  The CBO says about $3 billion out of 2019's projected GDP was completely lost due to the shutdown.  Joining me right now in a FOX Business exclusive is National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow.  Larry, it's great to see you this morning.</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for being here.  So obviously 35 days, government shutdown, CBO says $3 billion is lost.  Never coming back.  Your reaction.</p><p>KUDLOW:  With respect, once again, we disagree with the CBO.  I don't think we're going to lose anything.  This is completely temporary.  None of the incentives in the economy have been changed by this.  You know, that's the key point.  President Trump lowered marginal tax rates on individuals and most especially businesses.  And then he had this massive sweeping rollback of costly and burden regulations, which freed up the whole economy, including the energy sector, which has turned out to be a boom.  Why would we lose something just because of a temporary issue regarding the government?  Now, I'm always interested in sort of counting angels on the head of a pin.  We have about a $20 trillion economy, fair?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  There -- what was their number, three billion out of 20 trillion?  Do you know what the --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Three billion.  Yes, no, you're right.  You're right.</p><p>KUDLOW:  - percentage that is?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I totally understand.</p><p>KUDLOW:  I don't understand why we even mess with it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Actually, they're saying the total impact was $8-11 billion.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But that will come back, except for the $3 billion they say that is completely lost.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, again, with all due respect to the professionals at the CBO, I disagree.  Again, because the incentives in the economy -- here's the big difference between I guess the administration and the Congressional Budget Office and a lot of other forecasters.  We believe the economy is growing at three percent plus.  By the way, the Commerce Department for 2018 has scored I believe 3.1 percent.  We'll get the rest of those numbers in a week or two.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KUDLOW:  The CBO does not.  They never have.  They've never given us credit for the incentive effect of lowering taxes and regulations.  Supply side incentives are kicking in.  If you look at the whole panoply all of the economic data, whether it's very strong Christmas retail sales, whether it's industrial production, manufacturing, the best since the '80s, whether it's business equipment, which means the capex boom is happening that we always hoped for.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KUDLOW:  You'll see in my judgment, at least, the three percent trend line will continue.  CBO and many others have us at two.  But this goes back before the President.  This goes back way before.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  They don't believe the economy can grow.  They don't give any credit --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, even somebody like a Steve Schwarzman will say 4.2 percent growth in the second quarter is very hard to sustain on a $20 trillion economy.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, I'll keep working on Steve Schwarzman.  He's a good guy.  But in a $20 trillion economy, which again will grow rapidly, I see no reason why we can't continue three percent plus.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That's the whole point.  The idea that was sold to everybody I guess going back several years, maybe going back 10 or 15 years, that we're in some secular stagnation is just plain wrong.  With the right set of policies, to unleash --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- American animal spirit --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we saw that with the tax plan and the deregulation.  I totally get that.</p><p>KUDLOW:  And you look at the --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But what about tariffs and trade, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  The -- just one --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because the CBO'S report also brings that up.</p><p>KUDLOW:  One last one on this, the face of the new Trump economy -- I just want to put this in here, it's the thought I've had for quite a while.  These are men and women running small businesses.  These are blue-collar workers.  You look at the evidence, the employment for blue-collar workers, the best increase since the mid to late '80s, when I was a Reagan Cub Scout here in Washington, D.C.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  The wage rates of blue-collar manufacturing autos, they're rising faster than white-collar workers.  This is a direct result --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- of the incentives we've put into the economy.  CBO, again, it's not personal to my friends at the CBO, they don't give us any credit for these incentives.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No, I understand that.  But the --</p><p>KUDLOW:  And I want to stay with that story.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- the report on the trade policies estimated that new tariffs on imports and exports will cut an average of one-tenth of a percent from economic growth through 2029.  What's your take on that, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because we know that these tariffs are in place.  They still are impacting business and uncertainties.  So, is the President prepared to do away with all tariffs if he gets that agreement from the other side?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, I don't want to go there.  I mean, that's going to be his decision as you know.  Vice Premier Liu He is coming and we will have high level discussions Wednesday and Thursday and we're all looking forward to that, as is the President.  The President, as I read him, moderately optimistic about this trade story.  So, that's good.  What was it, one-tenth of one percent by 2029?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  So then here we are in 2019, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, no.  One-tenth of a percent from economic growth through 2029.</p><p>KUDLOW:  See, this is too hard, Maria.  It's way too hard --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- to figure that stuff out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you don't think there's going to be any -- there's --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Could it be possible that there's no impact from the shutdown?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Yes, quite possible.  I never -- it's utterly totally temporary.  So, that's -- let me --- look, let me go back -- the growth potential from China trade, people tend to look at this as a negative.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Look, I don't know the outcome of these talks.  Here's what I know, the scope of the discussion will be the broadest and deepest in the history of U.S.-China trade.  Literally everything's on the table.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Point number one.  Point number two, if China opens its markets --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is a big deal.</p><p>KUDLOW:  OK?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it looks like there's (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>KUDLOW:  Which is huge.  You know, I don't want to predict, and as Ambassador Lighthizer said a million times, and I agree, the enforcement mechanisms are going to be crucial.  But if they were to open their markets as we have requested regarding tariffs and non-tariffs, if they would let American companies own the subsidiary in China, so there's no forced transfer of the family jewels of technology, if we have --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But it --</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- some rule of law regarding I.P. theft, here's my point, open markets will allow the United States to export like crazy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But I understand that, Larry.</p><p>KUDLOW:  And that has been hand -- we've been handcuffed.  If we do that, if we do that, not only will the United States grow faster --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- because of that, China will grow faster.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That all sounds great, but can you actually do that, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Competition is the solution.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's the point, because if you're saying, \"OK, China, we are agreeing that you are opening your markets, and as a result, we will meet your demands, but then they say okay, but you have to have a communist, a government leader on the board of any company that has 100 percent.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Which is -- which is extraordinary, you're absolutely right.  It's extraordinary.  And it's --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So I mean -- so you could say it's great --</p><p>KUDLOW:  And unacceptable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- that you're going to open markets.</p><p>KUDLOW:  It's unacceptable.  It's unacceptable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But they -- aren't they saying that a communist has to be on the board of any company that has 100 percent?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I think that's been the past and I think that's going to be a very hot topic in these trade talks because that is completely unacceptable to us.  No question about it.  We will see how this turns out.  China, unfortunately, you know, they're in a slump.  China's economy is slumping very bad.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  I think part of that slump is a function of the President's tough negotiating with tariffs, when necessary, OK, part of that slump is in the last five to ten years.  China has moved in the wrong direction, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  The market-based reforms have been moving in their own direction.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But they're not market-based.  They are communists and they want communists on the board of -- So I'm just wondering, all of this sounds great, if you can actually get it done.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Oh, I know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Larry, stay with us.  We want to talk to you about other things because the tax plan and the deregulations have worked.  But there are some other ideas coming into play ahead of 2020.</p><p>KUDLOW:  China should not use the Venezuelan form of the economic policy.  We need to go back to who is it that said free market capitalism is the best path to prosperity?  It was the (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, that would -- that would be you and Ronald Reagan.  Stay with us.  We will be right back.  More with Larry Kudlow.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Thank you.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We come to you live this morning from Washington, D.C. and I am sitting with National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow, in an exclusive interview this morning.  And we were talking about China and what you can get done.  How important is tomorrow and Thursday in terms of meeting a deadline, that March 1st, in terms of a deal on the table?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I think's very important.  Look, I --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think you'll get a deal by March 1?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I don't want to predict.  It's just too hard to predict.  And, of course, these are decisions that will be made by the President, who is his own best negotiator.  Best I can is, as I said, the scope of this thing's going to as wide and broad as anything we have ever seen.  That does not ensure positive negotiator.  Best I can is, as I said, the scope of this thing is going to be as wide and broad as anything we've ever seen.  That does not ensure positive outcomes --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- right?  I think everybody, including the President, is basically moderately optimistic about this, OK?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Wait, let me ask you, your tax plan --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Ultimately -- one other thought which the President believes that he and President Xi will probably be the ultimate negotiators.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLOW:  OK?  And the work being done tomorrow and Thursday is vitally important to lay out options, OK?  But --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So the President will be involved in these talks tomorrow and Thursday?</p><p>KUDLOW:  That is what he has been saying in our meetings.  And I hope so because he's a great negotiator.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me move on to the tax plan.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because we're hearing a lot of ideas in terms of taxes now, now with a lot of 2020 hopefuls.  The Tax and Jobs Act obviously did move the needle on economic growth along with the deregulation out of this administration.  Now you've got Elizabeth Warren talking about two to three percent tax on the very high wealth people.  So if you have $50 million in wealth, you'll get two percent tax.  If you've got a billion dollars in assets, you'll get taxed three percent.  And you've got Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez talking about tax of 70 percent tax --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- on the highest earners.  What is your take on this?  Give us your reaction and what kind of an impact those policies might have.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Right.  These are prosperity killers, these are growth killers, these are job killers, these are incentive killers.  This is a return to some heavy government planning essentially direct to the economy.  You know, I hate to dwell on this because it's a crisis right now, but take a look at Venezuela, just for the heck of it.  What (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There was a time when that was vibrant -- it was a vibrate country.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That is correct.  That is correct.  And investment was flocking to it.  Then they took, down through the years, really exact measures you're describing that are coming from some of these Democratic candidates --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- and the economy was destroyed.  I mean I hear this notion we have to have equality, equality of income, equality of results, which I think runs counter to all human nature.  You know what?  A place like Venezuela has equality.  Everybody's poor.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think they'll be able to reverse the tax cuts then?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Everybody's poor in Venezuela, except for a hand -- Maduro and a handful of this top military people.  Is that what we want in America?  We are growing right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So will the Dems be able to reverse your tax cut plans?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Never.  Never, not until the President's configuration.  I -- look, first of all, if they want to try to raise taxes, it will be defeated in the Senate, Republican.  I personally believe even if it went beyond that --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  -- the President would veto any efforts to turn back his program.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How important --</p><p>KUDLOW:  We're doing what people said we couldn't do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But how important is debt?</p><p>KUDLOW:  They said we couldn't grow at three, four percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But how important is debt, Larry?</p><p>KUDLOW:  We're growing at three, four percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The --</p><p>KUDLOW:  Let's not mess with it.  If it ain't broke, don't fix it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Congressional Budget --</p><p>KUDLOW:  There's a tremendous surge in prosperity here shared by the middle and lower middle income people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Congressional Budget Office is saying that the deficit is hit -- set to hit $897 billion this year.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That would be the highest level since World War II.  When does debt become a priority?  Do you think the President, let's say he does have another term, will try to attack the entitlements?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Well, look, I think right now the two issues are maintaining economic growth.  You know, growth is the single biggest factor in these budget calculations.  Growth brings income and revenues.  And in fact I haven't gone through it with a fine-toothed comb yet, but I will.  I think I see that the CBO is acknowledging that our faster growth, which they did not predict, is now paying for over 80 percent of the tax cuts.  OK?  And I think you'll see more about that as we get through.  The reports just came out yesterday.</p><p>Second point I want to make is we will have a tough spending budget coming up in a few weeks, a very tough spending budget with reductions of at least five percent across the board, in non-defense accounts.  So I think that's going to be very important.  Let's minimize government where possible.  Let's grow the economy to its max.  And you will see the debt burden, which I thought debt, as a share of GDP, will be coming down, and by the way, it already is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  OK.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That's what happened during the Reagan years.  That's what happened during the John F. Kennedy years.  So, I wrote about it in my book.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLOW:  That -- that's the best way to measure that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But, Larry, you know what I don't understand?  I mean you're all about growth, you have been for all your entire career.  Why are so many people worried about the slowdown?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why are we hearing some people say a recession is on the horizon?</p><p>KUDLOW:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, there's just -- it's funny in this town and I guess a little bit in New York, this is a lot of pessimism.  I don't --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you expect a recession this year or 2020?</p><p>KUDLOW:  I do not.  I don't see it right now.  If I look at financial indicators, credit spreads, the actual numbers, you know, it's just -- we -- GDP will come out a week late because the Commerce Department has reopened.  We've seen stuff like falling unemployment claims, rising manufacturing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But what are the markets telling us, Larry?  In the month of December, there was no high-yield debt issuance at all.  Credit markets are still tight.</p><p>KUDLOW:  They've come back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They've come back a bit.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Come back.  I like that.  Profits, the mother's milk of stocks, I don't know who first that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You did.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Profits, the mother's milk of stocks are rising.  The early indications are they won't to 25 percent but they're going to rise 10, to 15 percent.  I like that a lot.  Interest rates, the level of rates, are historically low.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you're not worried about market volatility?</p><p>KUDLOW:  There's a million things to worry about when I get up in the morning, you know, mainly getting here on time so I could do this great interview.  But I just want to say, if you look at the sum total of all the evidence right now, there's no recession out there.  I am the happy warrior.  I am an optimist.  President Trump is an optimist.  I think America, right now, we are the hottest economy in the world and we should remain so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll end it there.  Larry Kudlow.  Good to see you, sir.</p><p>KUDLOW:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow.  Back in a moment.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The government shutdown may be over, but the effects are still being felt.  Hillary Vaughn is live this morning at a craft brewery in Escondido, California where the shutdown effects are actually still lingering.  Hillary.</p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Hi, Maria.  Good morning.  Craft beer is a $76.2 billion industry, and for many craft breweries, like Stone Brewery, where we are today, the effects of the government shutdown are not over.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOMINIC ENGELS, CEO, STONE BREWING:  When the industry craft is built on seasonal beers, it's built on new beers, it's the new sexy thing, and if we can't get the new sexy thing to market, then we're not going to connect with our fans.  They're going to be disappointed.  We're going to make the sales numbers we planned to make in our financial plans, and these things will have repercussions.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUGHN:  As Federal workers at the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau are finally back in the office, a mountain of paperwork is waiting, about 11,000 applications for alcohol labels have been backlogged leaving craft breweries waiting to ship and sell all their new beer across state line, which means they're in limbo until these approvals go through.

We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  President Trump is tweeting this morning.  He's talking about a former staffer.  Here's what he just said.  \"A low level staffer that I hardly knew named Cliff Sims wrote yet another boring book based on made up stories in fiction.  He pretended to be an insider when, in fact, he was nothing more than a gofer.  He signed a non-disclosure agreement.  He is a mess.

He's got how many million view, you know, users and followers.  He just let everybody know who this guy is like --</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, THE AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Well, he literally sat in a -- he sat in a cubicle outside my wife's office in the West Wing, and so it is kind of amazing like this insider whole kind of mythology is something the President knows is not true.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  But he's got some extra sales thanks to that tweet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.

However, currently, it's unclear how much they advanced their goal of bringing some of the world\u2019s largest companies to heel.  Invective flew as legislators questioned Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai of Google, and Tim Cook of Apple at a hearing of the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust. For the last year, that panel has probed the business practices of the Silicon Valley giants with an eye to determining if they need to be regulated more heavily, or even broken up.  In nearly five hours of testimony and questioning, however, there were few startling revelations or striking confrontations. While the executives faced hostile questioning and frequent interruptions from lawmakers of both parties, little seemed to land more than glancing blows. The CEOs testified via video to lawmakers, at times appearing together on the committee room display as tiny individual figures in a mostly empty array of squares. Most committee members were seated, masks on, in the hearing room in Washington. (Also read: ) The execs provided lots of data purporting to show how much competition they face and just how valuable their innovation and essential services are to consumers. But they sometimes struggled to answer pointed questions about their business practices. They also confronted a range of other concerns about alleged political bias, their effect on US democracy, and their role in China.  The panel\u2019s chairman, Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, said each platform controlled by Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple \u201cis a bottleneck for a key channel of distribution.\u201d  \u201cWhether they control access to information or to a marketplace, these platforms have the incentive and ability to exploit this power,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can charge exorbitant fees, impose oppressive contracts, and extract valuable data from the people and businesses that rely on them.\u201d  \u201cSimply put: They have too much power.\u201d  The four CEOs command corporations whose products are woven into the fabric of everyday life, with millions or even billions of customers, and a combined market value greater than the entire German economy. One of them, Bezos, is the world\u2019s richest individual; Zuckerberg is the fourth-ranked billionaire.  And they had a few rough moments. Pichai and Zuckerberg, for instance, appeared discomfited when pressed about unsavory aspects of their companies\u2019 businesses, but got respites when their inquisitors ran out of time. Bezos also acknowledged that alleged misdeeds at Amazon \u2014 such as reports that the company has used data generated by independent sellers on its platform to compete against them \u2014 would be \u201cunacceptable\u201d if proven to be true.  Zuckerberg was also asked about a series of popular conspiracy theories \u2014 including that the coronavirus pandemic is a hoax \u2014 that have thrived on Facebook\u2019s platform during the deadly virus\u2019 grip across the globe.  Zuckerberg offered assurances that the social network\u2019s users don\u2019t want to see misinformation in their feeds, so the company has taken big steps to scrub its site of inaccurate coronavirus claims. But that only invited more push back from lawmakers who noted that just on Monday the company struggled to take down a video of pro-Trump doctors peddling misleading claims that Americans don\u2019t need to wear masks and an unproven anti-malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, as a sure-fire way to treat the virus. Outside observers were able to draw radically different conclusions from the event. Richard Hamilton Jr., a former Justice Department antitrust lawyer, said that everyone on the committee seemed to be in agreement on the need for tougher regulation of all four companies \u2014 an \u201cominous\u201d sign, he said. But Stephen Beck, CEO of the management consulting firm cg42, said the tech companies and their brands emerged relatively unscathed.  In particular, he said, Cook was particularly polished and well prepared, enabling the Apple CEO to put on what Beck called \u201ca master class in terms of how to handle these situations.\u201d Cook drew less attention from lawmakers than did the other CEOs after arguing that Apple isn\u2019t dominant in any of its markets.  Among the toughest questions for Google and Amazon involved accusations that they used their dominant platforms to scoop up data about competitors in a way that gave them an unfair advantage.  Bezos, who was appearing before Congress for the first time, said he couldn\u2019t guarantee that the company had not accessed seller data to make competing products, an allegation that the company and its executives have previously denied.  \u201cWe have a policy against using seller specific data to aid our private label business,\u201d Bezos said in a response to a question from Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Washington Democrat. \u201cBut I can\u2019t guarantee to you that that policy hasn\u2019t been violated.\u201d  Pichai deployed an old Washington trick \u2014 appealing to the specific interests of legislators. In his opening remarks, he touted Google\u2019s value to mom-and-pop businesses in Bristol, Rhode Island, and Pewaukee, Wisconsin, which just happen to be located in the home districts of Cicilline and Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, the panel\u2019s senior Republican.  But the Google executive struggled as Cicilline accused the company of leveraging its dominant search engine to steal ideas and information from other websites and manipulating its results to drive people to its own digital services to boost its profits.  Pichai repeatedly deflected Cicilline\u2019s attacks by asserting that Google tries to provide the most helpful and relevant information to the hundreds of millions of people who use its search engine each day in an effort to keep them coming back instead of defecting to a rival service, such as Microsoft\u2019s Bing.  As Democrats largely focused on market competition, several Republicans aired longstanding grievances, claiming the tech companies are censoring conservative voices and questioning their business activities in China. \u201cBig Tech is out to get conservatives,\u201d insisted Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio.  In its bipartisan investigation, the Judiciary subcommittee collected testimony from mid-level executives of the four firms, competitors and legal experts, and pored over more than a million internal documents from the companies. A key question: whether existing competition policies and century-old antitrust laws are adequate for overseeing the tech giants, or if new legislation and enforcement funding are needed.  Cicilline has called the four companies monopolies, although he says breaking them up should be a last resort. While forced breakups may appear unlikely, the wide scrutiny of Big Tech points toward possible new restrictions on its power.  The companies face legal and political offensives on multiplying fronts, from Congress, the Trump administration, federal and state regulators and European watchdogs. The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have been investigating the four companies\u2019 practices.

WhatsApp was bought by Facebook in 2014 for $19 billion[1], while Instagram was bought in 2012 for $1 billion[2].\"Looking at the most downloaded apps of the decade, Facebook has dominated the mobile space representing the four most downloaded apps of the decade with Facebook, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram,\" said App Annie market insight manager Adithya Venkatraman in a blog post[3]. \"Communication and social media apps are consumer favorites, accounting for seven of the top 10 apps by downloads this decade.\"The figures may add fuel to the fire for regulators, amid calls to break up Facebook's dominance in the market \u2014 or at least stop it hoovering up more rival apps. Indeed, Facebook is being investigated by US authorities over antitrust concerns, with reports[4] suggesting the Federal Trade Commission[5] could use an injunction to block the company from moving forward with plans to more closely link its various messaging apps, as such code sharing would make it difficult to break up the company in the future, should it be deemed necessary by regulators[6].The Facebook apps were followed in the rankings by Snapchat, Skype and TikTok. </p><p>The latter was one of two apps in the top ten, along with the UC Browser by Alibaba, that were released by Chinese companies instead of American ones. TikTok's inclusion in the list is particularly impressive given thatit was only released in 2016.While Facebook has the most downloads, it doesn't necessarily make the most money in the mobile market. According to App Annie, the top apps by consumer spend over the last decade were Netflix, Tinder and Pandora. Still, Facebook has increased its revenue from mobile which now makes up 94% of the company's advertising revenue, according to the company's third-quarter results. That's a far cry from 2012, just after the company went public, when investors worried about the company's inability to make money from mobile users[7].While Facebook has found success with advertising on Instagram, it's still looking for ways to earn revenue from WhatsApp, in particular by charging businesses that use the app to contact customers[8].Facebook aside, the App Annie stats highlighted that the past decade has been all about mobile, and that looksset to continue. \"This decade has been a time of remarkable growth for the mobile economy,\" added Venkatraman. \"With a 5% increase in downloads, and 15% growth in consumer spend... year-over-year in 2019 this looks set to continue in 2020.\" [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.itpro.co.uk/mobile/21647/facebook-whatsapp-and-the-price-of-messaging\">https://www.itpro.co.uk/mobile/21647/facebook-whatsapp-and-the-price-of-messaging</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.itpro.co.uk/642424/facebook-instagram-merger-gets-us-ftc-approval\">https://www.itpro.co.uk/642424/facebook-instagram-merger-gets-us-ftc-approval</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/a-look-back-at-the-top-apps-games-of-the-decade/\">https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/a-look-back-at-the-top-apps-games-of-the-decade/</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/ftc-weighs-seeking-injunction-against-facebook-over-how-its-apps-interact-11576178055\">https://www.wsj.com/articles/ftc-weighs-seeking-injunction-against-facebook-over-how-its-apps-interact-11576178055</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.itpro.co.uk/it-regulation/34479/what-is-the-federal-trade-commission-ftc\">https://www.itpro.co.uk/it-regulation/34479/what-is-the-federal-trade-commission-ftc</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.itpro.co.uk/policy-legislation/34556/zuckerberg-will-fight-us-lawmakers-big-tech-breakup-measures\">https://www.itpro.co.uk/policy-legislation/34556/zuckerberg-will-fight-us-lawmakers-big-tech-breakup-measures</url> [ 7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2019/q3/FB-Q3-2019-Earnings-Release.pdf\">https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2019/q3/FB-Q3-2019-Earnings-Release.pdf</url> [ 8]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.itpro.co.uk/strategy/29397/whatsapp-reveals-enterprise-app-in-its-monetisation-push\">https://www.itpro.co.uk/strategy/29397/whatsapp-reveals-enterprise-app-in-its-monetisation-push</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DENS133618157667134173725876100243</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DENS-133618</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XSB-Y7S1-F03R-N2XF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"617\"/><timeReceived>12:15 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Cloud Pro</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 18, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Indeed, Facebook is being investigated by US authorities over antitrust concerns, with reports[4] suggesting the Federal Trade Commission[5] could use an injunction to block the company from moving forward with plans to more closely link its various messaging apps, as such code sharing would make it difficult to break up the company in the future, should it be deemed necessary by regulators[6].Advertisement - Article continues belowThe Facebook apps were followed in the rankings by Snapchat, Skype and TikTok. </p><p>The latter was one of two apps in the top ten, along with the UC Browser by Alibaba, that were released by Chinese companies instead of American ones. TikTok's inclusion in the list is particularly impressive given thatit was only released in 2016.While Facebook has the most downloads, it doesn't necessarily make the most money in the mobile market. According to App Annie, the top apps by consumer spend over the last decade were Netflix, Tinder and Pandora. Still, Facebook has increased its revenue from mobile which now makes up 94% of the company's advertising revenue, according to the company's third quarter results. That's a far cry from 2012, just after the company went public, when investors worried about the company's inability to make money from mobile users[7].While Facebook has found success with advertising on Instagram, it's still looking for ways to earn revenue from WhatsApp, in particular by charging businesses that use the app to contact customers[8].Facebook aside, the App Annie stats highlighted that the past decade has been all about mobile, and that looksset to continue. \"This decade has been a time of remarkable growth for the mobile economy,\" added Venkatraman. \"With a 5% increase in downloads, and 15% growth in consumer spend... year-over-year in 2019 this looks set to continue in 2020.\" Featured Resources Transform the operator experience with enhanced automation

Riding on that change, Facebook is criticizing Apple for not opening up messaging on iOS to do the same. All told, Facebook is trying to pressure Apple to make messaging on iOS the same as it is on Android.  Reported by The Information[2], Facebook is publicly criticizing Apple again. </p><p>Last time it was over the privacy ad changes with iOS 14[3], now it's about messaging on iOS. Notably, the latest complaints from the social media giant come after Mark Zuckerberg levied an Apple deflection regarding messaging during the US House Judiciary's antirust hearing[4] looking into big tech. In the latest attack on Apple, Facebook executives are asking for the ability to have their messaging apps be the default on iOS. Facebook's Messenger app VP, Stan Chudnovsky said Apple's Messages app being locked as the default messenger isn't fair and wants to see Apple mirror what Android offers.'For any other developer in the [messaging] space, it isn't really a level playing field' on Apple's platform, Chudnovsky said. If Apple took an approach like Android's, he said, it would 'allow us to compete more fairly where iOS is dominant.'On Android, users can choose a third-party app to be their primary messaging service which will also receive their SMS messages sent to their phone number. However, as The Information notes, Apple's Messages app and encrypted iMessages are a valuable part of iPhone and iPad's feature set and the company isn't likely to give up control of iOS messaging, at least not unless it's forced to.Chudnovksy said Facebook has asked Apple over the years to consider opening up default messaging. Apple has never agreed. Apple's Messages app is a core feature of its mobile software that encourages people to keep buying its devices, and the app's encryption of messages is also a cornerstone of the company's privacy pitch to consumers.Even though the chances of Apple allowing third-parties to be the iOS messenger default are likely slim, Facebook is clearly willing to push its luck. That comes after Facebook along with a number of other groups and ad agencies were able to get Apple to push back the new ad tracking feature[5] until next year. But even if Facebook doesn't get its way here, the situation piles more antitrust pressure on Apple as regulators around the world are keeping a close on the company. Just yesterday, the Coalition for App Fairness[6] was launched and includes Tile, Spotify, and Epic Games among its members. Facebook hasn't joined the coalition as of now, but a representative for the group shared a message of support for Facebook's desire to be the default messaging app on iOS.'Users deserve freedom of choice and option to decide the music, mail, chat, or any other necessary app that suits them best,' Sarah Maxwell, spokeswoman for the coalition, said in a statement. Apple declined to comment for this story.All of this comes as Facebook is working on unifying its messaging services across its apps[7] like Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Facebook has publicly shared a variety of times that it believes private messaging is the future[8] and this latest battle it has picked with Apple is another example of the company heading in that direction.

Riding on that change, Facebook is criticizing Apple for not opening up messaging on iOS to do the same. All told, Facebook is trying to pressure Apple to make messaging on iOS the same as it is on Android.        Reported by The Information , Facebook is publicly criticizing Apple again. Last time it was over the privacy ad changes with iOS 14 , now it\u2019s about messaging on iOS. Notably, the latest complaints from the social media giant come after Mark Zuckerberg levied an Apple deflection regarding messaging during the US House Judiciary\u2019s antirust hearing looking into big tech.    In the latest attack on Apple, Facebook executives are asking for the ability to have their messaging apps be the default on iOS. Facebook\u2019s Messenger app VP, Stan Chudnovsky said Apple\u2019s Messages app being locked as the default messenger isn\u2019t fair and wants to see Apple mirror what Android offers.     \u201cFor any other developer in the [messaging] space, it isn\u2019t really a level playing field\u201d on Apple\u2019s platform, Chudnovsky said. If Apple took an approach like Android\u2019s, he said, it would \u201callow us to compete more fairly where iOS is dominant.\u201d     On Android, users can choose a third-party app to be their primary messaging service which will also receive their SMS messages sent to their phone number. However, as The Information notes, Apple\u2019s Messages app and encrypted iMessages are a valuable part of iPhone and iPad\u2019s feature set and the company isn\u2019t likely to give up control of iOS messaging, at least not unless it\u2019s forced to.     Chudnovksy said Facebook has asked Apple over the years to consider opening up default messaging. Apple has never agreed. Apple\u2019s Messages app is a core feature of its mobile software that encourages people to keep buying its devices, and the app\u2019s encryption of messages is also a cornerstone of the company\u2019s privacy pitch to consumers.     Even though the chances of Apple allowing third-parties to be the iOS messenger default are likely slim, Facebook is clearly willing to push its luck. That comes after Facebook along with a number of other groups and ad agencies were able to get Apple to push back the new ad tracking feature until next year.    But even if Facebook doesn\u2019t get its way here, the situation piles more antitrust pressure on Apple as regulators around the world are keeping a close on the company.    Just yesterday, the Coalition for App Fairness was launched and includes Tile, Spotify, and Epic Games among its members. Facebook hasn\u2019t joined the coalition as of now, but a representative for the group shared a message of support for Facebook\u2019s desire to be the default messaging app on iOS.     \u201cUsers deserve freedom of choice and option to decide the music, mail, chat, or any other necessary app that suits them best,\u201d Sarah Maxwell, spokeswoman for the coalition, said in a statement. Apple declined to comment for this story.     All of this comes as Facebook is working on unifying its messaging services across its apps like Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Facebook has publicly shared a variety of times that it believes private messaging is the future and this latest battle it has picked with Apple is another example of the company heading in that direction.    What do you think? Would you like Apple to open up messaging to allow third-party apps to be the default? Or is it best for Apple to keep things how they are?

Facebook didn't -- and its failure to act may do more harm to its cause than Twitter's display of backbone.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That's because Facebook's fecklessness will only feed into the mounting pressure on policymakers to regulate how social media networks police themselves, and to deny them a crucial liability shield if they fail to meet some new government standard for evenhandedness. Both of those options are fraught with unintended consequences and potentially bad outcomes.</p><p>Trump himself is one of the leading proponents of regulating social media. The misbegotten executive order he released Thursday (which drew a lawsuit Tuesday from the tech advocacy group the Center for Democracy and Technology) seeks to have the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission determine when those companies are misleading the public about their policies toward speech and concealing some kind of bias.</p><p>Later that day, Trump tweeted and posted a 102-word attack on Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, saying he needed to get his city \"under control\" or Trump would send in the military. \"Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts,\" Trump wrote, quoting (consciously or not) a racist and brutal Miami police chief from 1967.</p><p>Although Trump later contended that he was trying to warn people about the consequences of looting, his original words run clearly afoul of both social media companies' guidelines against glorifying or inciting violence. Twitter responded by hiding the tweet behind a notice that Trump's words had violated the company's rules, forcing anyone who wanted to read the tweet to click on the link provided. Facebook responded by ... doing nothing, despite calls from inside and outside the company to take the comment down.</p><p>Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg later explained that \"although the post had a troubling historical reference, we decided to leave it up because the National Guard references meant we read it as a warning about state action, and we think people need to know if the government is planning to deploy force.\" He stood by that decision even as hundreds of Facebook employees protested -- apparently the first time the company has witnessed such a large-scale action -- and some of the country's most prominent civil rights leaders pressed him to change his mind. The employee revolt continued Tuesday, still to no avail.</p><p>Granted, moderating the torrential flow of content on a site as popular as Facebook is a huge challenge, which in itself is a good argument against sites growing to Facebook's scale. And there's necessarily some subjectivity involved. But lax moderation led Facebook to become a hotbed for fakery, hate speech and other damaging uses of the network. It has responded with some better rules and procedures, but they're meaningless if they're not enforced.</p><p>The more exceptions Zuckerberg carves out for powerful people, the more inconsistent and ineffective his rules will appear -- boosting the case for orders like Trump's, which would give political appointees the power to shape how social media companies compete. And maybe Zuckerberg is comfortable with that idea, considering that he can afford the lawyers and lobbyists needed to navigate the new environment while upstart competitors cannot. But no one else should want that outcome.</p><p>Washington would be far better off focusing on ways to protect Facebook users and their privacy, particularly from the manipulation that the company empowers its advertisers to do by exploiting their personal information. Lawmakers, including Rep. Anna G. Eshoo (D-Menlo Park) and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), have introduced bills to stop Facebook and its ilk from micro-targeting political ads without users' permission, preventing campaigns from tailoring their messages to play on the susceptibilities of small groups in ways that avoid detection.</p><p>But Congress has been just as leery of protecting internet users' privacy as Zuckerberg has been of enforcing Facebook's rules against Trump. They both need to change course.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LATN-GQ6E67AU</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LAT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6023-R8Y1-JBFS-C1Y8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">306910</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"729\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Los Angeles Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Los Angeles Times</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 3, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Editorial</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>CENTER FOR DEMOCRACY &amp;

AP Photo/Andrew Harnik[1]  Courtesy ofBhaskar Chakravorti[2], Tufts University[3] It is almost too easy to bash Facebook these days. Nearly a third of Americans[4] feel the country's most popular social media platform[5] is bad for society. As the company approaches its 15th birthday, Americans rate its social benefit[6] as better than Marlboro cigarettes[7], but worse than McDonald's. Yet as a scholar of digital technologies[8] and their effects on society - and even though I am not on Facebook - I worry that public perception has become overly critical of Facebook. </p><p>It's true that the company has been behaving like many 15-year-old adolescents, acting irresponsibly and selfishly[9], and making endless promises[10] to do better, at least until the next mess is uncovered. However, as talk grows of fines[11] and regulations[12], it's worth remembering there is such a thing as overregulation, which would respond to the urgency and charged political climate of the current moment but hurt the public interest in the long run. Official action to rein in Facebook's power should reflect on the bad and ugly things the company has done and allowed to happen. But the debate shouldn't forget some things about Facebook that would qualify as 'great,' which may have been missed in the avalanche of negative sentiment toward the company and its leaders. The bad stuff The individual and social harms due to Facebook are many, including contributing to concentration in the online advertising market[13], with negative impact on productivity and wage growth[14], distracting[15] students[16] and potentially causing users[17] mental distress[18] and giving rise to symptoms akin to substance abuse[19]. The bottom line is clear: Spending too much time on Facebook may be bad for you. Things get ugly All technology companies have been experiencing some heightened skepticism[20]. However, more Americans felt negatively toward Facebook[21] than those who felt similarly about Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Apple combined, according to a 2017 poll. Facebook's place in the public perception has only deteriorated since then. The company's violations of user trust[22] are legion, including ignoring its own privacy policies[23], sharing data without permission[24], tricking children into spending their parents' money[25], allowing disinformation campaigns[26] that affect elections in the U.S. and elsewhere, and - perhaps worst of all - magnifying propaganda that has sparked violence[27] around the world. In the U.S., the company's services have allowed bias and discrimination to take root. In early 2018, the National Fair Housing Alliance and affiliated groups sued Facebook, alleging that its advertising platform let landlords and real-estate brokers discriminate[28] against women, disabled veterans and single mothers, among other groups. The company's own civil-rights audit found it contributed to voter suppression[29] and targeted manipulative advertising to impressionable groups. That report came on the heels of two comprehensive reports compiled for the U.S. Senate detailing how Russian government agents used Facebook[30] and other social media sites to influence Americans' thinking[31]. The company's rap sheet is long and growing. Its repeated assurances that it will fix[32] the problems are now roundly assumed to be empty promises. But wait, there is great stuff, too With this much going wrong, it is easy to forget that the company has shown great technological and business sophistication in connecting people like never before. Facebook combined innovative social-networking ideas[33] from others and bought up potential competitors[34] like Instagram and WhatsApp. This itself constitutes an innovation in creating a connectivity platform like no other. In terms of contribution to the economy, the company is right - if a tad self-serving - to note that it has helped small businesses[35] reach new customers and build relationships with both existing and prospective clients. The value of those connections is unclear - a single 'like' could be worth anywhere between nothing and US$214.81[36], depending on the type of business and what it's looking for Facebook users to do. An independent study from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis found that from 2005 to 2015, U.S. gross domestic product grew one-tenth of 1 percent faster[37] than it would have if Facebook hadn't existed. In terms of how connectivity helps advance other innovations, Facebook is a key contributor to leading-edge open-source coding projects[38] in a range of applications, such as machine learning, gaming, 3D printing, home automation, scientific programming and data analysis, among others. The company has also leveraged its huge network of users to help authorities[39], communities[40] and families[41] respond efficiently to natural and human-caused disasters. Particular groups of Facebook users may also see distinct benefits from being connected. Elderly people may get a cognitive boost[42]; people who seek a self-esteem boost[43] from viewing their own profiles, shy people[44], people with diabetes[45] and people on the autism spectrum[46] have all felt more support and improved well-being from using the site. Can Facebook turn great to good? As Facebook turns 15, the company faces a critical set of challenges. U.S. officials will be scrutinizing its activities and seeking ways to curb its power in society. Regulating Facebook itself will not be easy[47], and will generate endless debate. The company will also have to contend with covert online agents seeking to undermine democracy[48] by using Facebook to influence elections in India, Europe, Nigeria and Poland, among other places - not to mention the 2020 U.S. presidential election. The company's management will have to take bold steps, not only to defend Facebook's positive features, but to eliminate - or at least reduce - the harm the company's products and services do to people and society. Most companies aspire to go from 'good to great[49]'; Facebook's challenge at 15 is a bit more complicated: It must convince a skeptical public and regulators chomping at the bit that it can mitigate the effects of its bad and the ugly sides - and go from being great to being a force for good in the world[50].

But he left open several possibilities about the use of the information to deepen what the company knows about users.</p><p>Metadata is not the actual content of messages but can contain information on users' contacts, devices, and location from which, privacy advocates say, companies that already possess vast amounts of data on consumers could still collect valuable information and make inferences.</p><p>In the case of Facebook, the advocates say, that information would still prove to be lucrative in the ad-targeting infrastructure that brought in much of the company's $15 billion in revenue last quarter.</p><p>In his letter to Facebook, Hawley asked what data the company would glean when users exchanged messages with advertisers, especially if they used a Facebook subsidiary that facilitates online payments, and whether that would be fed back into the advertising architecture.</p><p>\"Information about transactions can be used for personalization on the Facebook platform in accordance with Facebook's data policy,\" Martin responded.</p><p>Hawley, who has emerged as one of the foremost Republican critics of big tech companies, said in a statement that he was \"frankly shocked by Facebook's response.\"</p><p>\"I thought they'd swear off the creepier possibilities I raised,\" said Hawley, who floated the possibility that Facebook could determine which users live together through rent payments on the platform. \"But instead, they doubled down.\"</p><p>While Congress continues to debate privacy measures that would allow consumers to opt out of data collection service by service, Hawley has championed a proposal that would block all websites from collecting unnecessary data.</p><p>Martin noted in the letter that the company uses metadata to \"help make the platform safer, reduce Spam and fraud, and cooperate with law enforcement requests\" \u2014 a purpose that he said would become more important once the company cannot see content directly.</p><p>He added that Facebook would be consulting with law enforcement, regulators, and privacy and safety experts on how to foster user confidence.</p><p>The company did provide some specifics. It said it planned to encrypt private messages between more than two participants but did not plan to offer complete encryption for the content shared in groups, which Martin said \"are well-suited for easily finding new communities of people with similar interests.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BGLOBE-c3b030f6-8256-11e9-9330-eac65922dc8a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BGLOBE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W77-1D71-JC2G-C383-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8110</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"618\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Boston Globe</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 30, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The most compelling takeaway from the report is the fact a company commissioned such an investigation in the first place. It seemed the company was directly responding to public pressure. Facebook is proving what conservatives have long argued when it comes to regulation: market pressure works.</p><p><br/>Facebook relies on people wanting to use its platform, so one can imagine the honchos at the company most certainly do not want to alienate conservatives, liberals or anyone in between. Silicon Valley elites still have work to do to earn back the trust of wary conservatives, but this report should be one step in the right direction.<br/>Yet, there are loud and growing calls from the right, including elected officials,\u00a0for the heavy hand of government to intervene\u00a0\u2013 undermining fundamental constitutional principles, limited government, and free market values.<br/>For decades, conservatives correctly argued that government intervention stifles innovation and often favors entrenched interests. Those same economic principles apply equally to the tech sector. Imposing some sort of regulatory scheme to police speech on platforms or plan the tech economy risks would do more to box out competition, solidify the market-share of the same companies conservatives distrust, and, ironically, eliminate these firms\u2019 incentive to care. It\u2019s much easier to capture and convince a handful of unelected government regulators to do your bidding than it is to satisfy individuals making their own decisions.<br/>This brings up another critical problem with conservative calls for tech bias regulation: who are these supposed unbiased bureaucrats to be entrusted with regulating social media companies? Government is comprised of human beings who have their own biases and incentives. These people, the rank-and-file members of the \u201cdeep state\u201d Washington bureaucracy, have drawn the ire of the conservative movement for decades. Even now, conservatives rejoice at the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to shrink and reform an out-of-touch administrative state. What a terrible idea to empower these same people to police online speech, as\u00a0legislation\u00a0from Republican Sen.\u00a0Josh Hawley\u00a0(R-Mo.) and a rumored\u00a0executive order\u00a0from\u00a0President Trump\u00a0would do.<br/>Another big problem is a constitutional one. The Constitution unambiguously protects free speech from government in the First Amendment: \u201cCongress shall make no law \u2026 abridging the freedom of speech\u2026.\u201d So it\u2019s particularly distressing when the conservatives, whose namesake is derived from conserving the ideals of the Constitution and the American Revolution, now routinely propose First Amendment-curtailing regulations in their feud with big tech. The First Amendment is quite plainly a restriction on the government, not a mandate to guarantee a soapbox or impose a muzzle.<br/>Yet here we are in this bizarre moment of some conservative voices suggesting Congress revisit Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Section 230 prevents companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon, Ebay, etc. from being held liable for what third parties \u2013 like you and me - post to their platforms. This is a reasonable protection, given that it is impossible for these firms to preemptively or flawlessly police the billions of posts and other items uploaded daily. Section 230 is not dissimilar to common sense protections that other industries enjoy. For example, we do not hold automobile manufacturers accountable for driver errors. That unfair burden would grind much personal and economic activity to a halt.<br/>Amending Section 230 to protect political content or replacing Section 230 with a new government bureau would, in effect, create tiers of protected speech. This Animal Farm-approach to free speech, with all speech free but some speech more free, is patently unconstitutional and something conservatives should vehemently reject.<br/>Conservative dissatisfaction with Silicon Valley firms is understandable given the documented leftward lean of their employees and questions about protection of personal data. Conservatives should keep up the pressure on firms like Facebook to provide a social media experience that welcomes, not alienates. A government clampdown would further empower bureaucrats to use the heavy hand of government against conservatives the second that the other side is in charge once again.<br/>Originally published at The Hill.<br/>Image:\u00a0Experts:\u00a0Patrick HedgerDate:\u00a0Tuesday, August 27, 2019Source:\u00a0The HillIssues:\u00a0Business and GovernmentAntitrust and CompetitionSearch Keywords:\u00a0ANTITRUSTFACEBOOKMedia appearance type:\u00a0Op-Eds and ArticlesTeaser:\u00a0Facebook last week\u00a0released the first portion of an independent report compiled by former Sen.

The move is the latest salvo in...</p><p>FACEBOOK Inc said today that Apple Inc had declined its request to waive a 30% commission fee the iPhone maker charges apps listed on iOS devices, taking a shot at its fellow Big Tech peer as developers challenge the policy.    The move is the latest salvo in a long-running cold war between two of the world\u2019s most powerful tech companies, which have clashed over their approaches to user privacy as both face regulatory scrutiny over alleged anticompetitive behaviour.    Facebook said it requested the waiver so that small businesses would not have to pay Apple\u2019s cut for a new paid online events product the world\u2019s biggest social media company is launching on its core platform.    Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.    Yesterday, Apple removed popular video game Fortnite from its app store for violating its in-app payment guidelines, sparking a backlash online and prompting developer Epic Games to file a federal antitrust suit challenging Apple\u2019s rule.    Apple takes a cut of between 15% and 30% for most app subscriptions and payments made inside apps, though there are some exceptions for companies that already have a credit card on file for iPhone customers if they also offer an in-app payment that would benefit Apple.    Developers have long criticized the commissions, as well as Apple\u2019s prohibitions on courting customers for outside sign-ups, and what some developers see as an opaque and unpredictable app-vetting process.    A mock-up of the new events product on iPhone, provided by Facebook, showed that the company planned to tell users that Apple would take 30% of the purchase.    Google also typically takes a 30% commission for payments within apps on its Android devices, although it was not immediately clear whether it would assess a charge in this case.    In its Android mock-up, Facebook noted only that it would not take a fee, without disclosing its arrangement with Google.    Google declined to comment on its fee arrangement for the product, and Facebook did not respond to the request for comment.    Facebook also did not say whether it had tried to make use of Apple\u2019s \u201cmultiplatform\u201d exceptions.    The disclosure is likely to touch a nerve with Apple, whose App Store rules bar developers from discouraging the use of its in-app purchase system.    Spotify in the past has said Apple rejected its attempts to communicate with users about the fee structures.    Fidji Simo, who heads the core Facebook app, announced the tool in a media conference call featuring small business owners who praised it as a way to reach customers and earn revenue online during the coronavirus pandemic.    She said Facebook considered it \u201cimportant to be transparent, when people are supporting small businesses,\u201d as users might not be aware that part of their payments could be \u201cgoing to an almost US$2 tril (RM8.4 tril) company\u201d.    Asked if she thought Apple would approve the change, even with language about fees that could discourage users from using the in-app purchase mechanism, she said she expected to find out \u201cin the next couple days\u201d. \u2013 Aug 15, 2020, Reuters</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

In its Android mock-up, Facebook noted only that it would not take a fee, without disclosing its arrangement with Google.<br/>Google declined to comment on its fee arrangement for the product, and Facebook did not respond to the request for comment.<br/>Facebook also did not say whether it had tried to make use of Apple's \"multiplatform\" exceptions.<br/>The disclosure is likely to touch a nerve with Apple, whose App Store rules bar developers from discouraging the use of its in-app purchase system.

Spotify in the past has said Apple rejected its attempts to communicate with users about the fee structures.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>Fidji Simo, who heads the core Facebook app, announced the tool in a media conference call featuring small business owners who praised it as a way to reach customers and earn revenue online during the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0<br/>She said Facebook considered it \"important to be transparent, when people are supporting small businesses,\" as users might not be aware that part of their payments could be \"going to an almost $2 trillion company.\"\u00a0<br/>Asked if she thought Apple would approve the change, even with language about fees that could discourage users from using the in-app purchase mechanism, she said she expected to find out \"in the next couple days.\"\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-M1362023</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MJ-N4W1-DYDW-747P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"514\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 19, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Facebook Inc said on Friday...</p><p>Facebook Inc  said on Friday that Apple Inc  had declined its request to waive a 30% commission fee the iPhone maker charges apps listed on iOS devices, taking a shot at its fellow Big Tech peer as developers challenge the policy.      Facebook Inc  said on Friday that Apple Inc  had declined its request to waive a 30% commission fee the iPhone maker charges apps listed on iOS devices, taking a shot at its fellow Big Tech peer as developers challenge the policy.   The move is the latest salvo in a long-running cold war between two of the world\u2019s most powerful tech companies, which have clashed over their approaches to user privacy as both face regulatory scrutiny over alleged anticompetitive behavior.    Facebook said it requested the waiver so that small businesses would not have to pay Apple\u2019s cut for a new paid online events product the world\u2019s biggest social media company is launching on its core platform.   Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.   On Thursday, Apple removed popular video game \u201cFortnite\u201d from its app store for violating its in-app payment guidelines, sparking a backlash online and prompting developer Epic Games to file a federal antitrust lawsuit challenging Apple\u2019s rules.   Apple takes a cut of between 15% and 30% for most app subscriptions and payments made inside apps, though there are some exceptions for companies that already have a credit card on file for iPhone customers if they also offer an in-app payment that would benefit Apple.    Developers have long criticized the commissions, as well as Apple\u2019s prohibitions on courting customers for outside sign-ups, and what some developers see as an opaque and unpredictable app-vetting process.   A mock-up of the new events product on iPhone, provided by Facebook, showed that the company planned to tell users that Apple would take 30% of the purchase.   Google  also typically takes a 30% commission for payments within apps on its Android devices, although it was not immediately clear whether it would assess a charge in this case. In its Android mock-up, Facebook noted only that it would not take a fee, without disclosing its arrangement with Google.   Google declined to comment on its fee arrangement for the product, and Facebook did not respond to the request for comment.    Facebook also did not say whether it had tried to make use of Apple\u2019s \u201cmultiplatform\u201d exceptions.   The disclosure is likely to touch a nerve with Apple, whose App Store rules bar developers from discouraging the use of its in-app purchase system. Spotify in the past has said Apple rejected its attempts to communicate with users about the fee structures.   Fidji Simo, who heads the core Facebook app, announced the tool in a media conference call featuring small business owners who praised it as a way to reach customers and earn revenue online during the coronavirus pandemic.   She said Facebook considered it \u201cimportant to be transparent, when people are supporting small businesses,\u201d as users might not be aware that part of their payments could be \u201cgoing to an almost $2 trillion company.\u201d  .youTubeVideoPlayer{  height: 520px; }  @media only screen and (max-width:480px){  .youTubeVideoPlayer{   height: 220px;  } }    Also Watch   Top 18 National Headlines At A Glance | CNN News18      Asked if she thought Apple would approve the change, even with language about fees that could discourage users from using the in-app purchase mechanism, she said she expected to find out \u201cin the next couple days.\u201d   Disclaimer: This post has been auto-published from an agency feed without any modifications to the text and has not been reviewed

The move is the latest salvo in a long-running cold war between two of the world\u2019s most powerful tech companies, which have clashed over their approaches to user privacy as both face regulatory scrutiny over alleged anticompetitive behavior.   Facebook said it requested the waiver so that small businesses would not have to pay Apple\u2019s cut for a new paid online events product the world\u2019s biggest social media company is launching on its core platform.   Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.   On Thursday, Apple removed popular video game \u201cFortnite\u201d from its app store for violating its in-app payment guidelines, sparking a backlash online and prompting developer Epic Games to file a federal antitrust lawsuit challenging Apple\u2019s rules.   Apple takes a cut of between 15% and 30% for most app subscriptions and payments made inside apps, though there are some exceptions for companies that already have a credit card on file for iPhone customers if they also offer an in-app payment that would benefit Apple.   Developers have long criticized the commissions, as well as Apple\u2019s prohibitions on courting customers for outside sign-ups, and what some developers see as an opaque and unpredictable app-vetting process.   A mock-up of the new events product on iPhone, provided by Facebook, showed that the company planned to tell users that Apple would take 30% of the purchase.   Google also typically takes a 30% commission for payments within apps on its Android devices, although it was not immediately clear whether it would assess a charge in this case. In its Android mock-up, Facebook noted only that it would not take a fee, without disclosing its arrangement with Google.   Google declined to comment on its fee arrangement for the product, and Facebook did not respond to the request for comment.   Facebook also did not say whether it had tried to make use of Apple\u2019s \u201cmultiplatform\u201d exceptions.   The disclosure is likely to touch a nerve with Apple, whose App Store rules bar developers from discouraging the use of its in-app purchase system. Spotify in the past has said Apple rejected its attempts to communicate with users about the fee structures.   Fidji Simo, who heads the core Facebook app, announced the tool in a media conference call featuring small business owners who praised it as a way to reach customers and earn revenue online during the coronavirus pandemic.   She said Facebook considered it \u201cimportant to be transparent, when people are supporting small businesses,\u201d as users might not be aware that part of their payments could be \u201cgoing to an almost $2 trillion company.\u201d   Asked if she thought Apple would approve the change, even with language about fees that could discourage users from using the in-app purchase mechanism, she said she expected to find out \u201cin the next couple days.\u201d   Disclaimer: This post has been auto-published from an agency feed without any modifications to the text and has not been reviewed by an editor</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42843115377</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60KP-YH91-F07F-83MS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"580\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Yahoo!

The move is the latest salvo in a long-running cold war between two of the world's most powerful tech companies, which have clashed over their approaches to user privacy as both face regulatory scrutiny over alleged anticompetitive behaviour.    Facebook said it requested the waiver so that small businesses would not have to pay Apple's cut for a new paid online events product the world's biggest social media company is launching on its core platform.    Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.    On Thursday, Apple removed popular video game \"Fortnite\" from its app store for violating its in-app payment guidelines, sparking a backlash online and prompting developer Epic Games to file a federal antitrust lawsuit challenging Apple's rules.    Apple takes a cut of between 15% and 30% for most app subscriptions and payments made inside apps, though there are some exceptions for companies that already have a credit card on file for iPhone customers if they also offer an in-app payment that would benefit Apple.    Developers have long criticized the commissions, as well as Apple's prohibitions on courting customers for outside sign-ups, and what some developers see as an opaque and unpredictable app-vetting process.    A mock-up of the new events product on iPhone, provided by Facebook, showed that the company planned to tell users that Apple would take 30% of the purchase.    Google also typically takes a 30% commission for payments within apps on its Android devices, although it was not immediately clear whether it would assess a charge in this case. In its Android mock-up, Facebook noted only that it would not take a fee, without disclosing its arrangement with Google.    Google declined to comment on its fee arrangement for the product, and Facebook did not respond to the request for comment.    Facebook also did not say whether it had tried to make use of Apple's \"multiplatform\" exceptions.    The disclosure is likely to touch a nerve with Apple, whose App Store rules bar developers from discouraging the use of its in-app purchase system. Spotify in the past has said Apple rejected its attempts to communicate with users about the fee structures.    Fidji Simo, who heads the core Facebook app, announced the tool in a media conference call featuring small business owners who praised it as a way to reach customers and earn revenue online during the coronavirus pandemic.    She said Facebook considered it \"important to be transparent, when people are supporting small businesses,\" as users might not be aware that part of their payments could be \"going to an almost US$2 trillion company.\"    Asked if she thought Apple would approve the change, even with language about fees that could discourage users from using the in-app purchase mechanism, she said she expected to find out \"in the next couple days.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

The move is the latest salvo in a long-running cold war between two of the world\u2019s most powerful tech companies, which have clashed over their approaches to user privacy as both face regulatory scrutiny over alleged anticompetitive behaviour.    Facebook said it requested the waiver so that small businesses would not have to pay Apple\u2019s cut for a new paid online events product the world\u2019s biggest social media company is launching on its core platform.    Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.    On Aug 13, Apple removed popular video game Fortnite from its app store for violating its in-app payment guidelines, sparking a backlash online and prompting developer Epic Games to file a federal antitrust lawsuit challenging Apple\u2019s rules.    Apple takes a cut of between 15% and 30% for most app subscriptions and payments made inside apps, though there are some exceptions for companies that already have a credit card on file for iPhone customers if they also offer an in-app payment that would benefit Apple.    Developers have long criticised the commissions, as well as Apple\u2019s prohibitions on courting customers for outside sign-ups, and what some developers see as an opaque and unpredictable app-vetting process.    A mock-up of the new events product on iPhone, provided by Facebook, showed that the company planned to tell users that Apple would take 30% of the purchase.    Google also typically takes a 30% commission for payments within apps on its Android devices, although it was not immediately clear whether it would assess a charge in this case. In its Android mock-up, Facebook noted only that it would not take a fee, without disclosing its arrangement with Google.    Google declined to comment on its fee arrangement for the product, and Facebook did not respond to the request for comment.    Facebook also did not say whether it had tried to make use of Apple\u2019s \u201cmultiplatform\u201d exceptions.    The disclosure is likely to touch a nerve with Apple, whose App Store rules bar developers from discouraging the use of its in-app purchase system. Spotify in the past has said Apple rejected its attempts to communicate with users about the fee structures.    Fidji Simo, who heads the core Facebook app, announced the tool in a media conference call featuring small business owners who praised it as a way to reach customers and earn revenue online during the coronavirus pandemic.    She said Facebook considered it \u201cimportant to be transparent, when people are supporting small businesses\u201d, as users might not be aware that part of their payments could be \u201cgoing to an almost US$2 trillion (RM8.38 trillion) company\u201d.    Asked if she thought Apple would approve the change, even with language about fees that could discourage users from using the in-app purchase mechanism, she said she expected to find out \u201cin the next couple days\u201d. \u2013 Reuters</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier
