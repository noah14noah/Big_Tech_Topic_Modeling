Among the companies likely to be part of the agency's probe are Facebook Inc.</p><p>(NASDAQ: FB[2]), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN[3]),Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL[4]) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL[5])'s Google.What It MeansThe companies already face extensive regulatory interest and the Journal reported the DOJ review would go beyond already-known looks by the DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission[6] into the sector's business practices. The new review could mean some companies could face antitrust investigations from both the Justice Department and the FTC, which earlier this year created a task force to study competition in the industry. In addition to the growth and size of the companies[7], the agency has expressed interest in how the companies might take advantage of the data created by their large user networks, the report said.Price ActionShares of Apple, Facebook, Amazon.com and Google were all trading down in the after-hours session with Facebook seeing the biggest drop, down 1.66%.

She is currently writing a book about textile artisans. The WSJ ran an exclusive today, suggesting that state attorneys general may begin to cooperate more closely with the feds to take on Google, according to State Attorneys General to Meet With Justice Officials to Coordinate on Google Probe:[1] State attorneys general will meet with U.S. Justice Department attorneys next week to share information on their respective probes of Alphabet[2] Inc.'s Google unit, a step that could eventually lead to both groups joining forces, according to people familiar with the matter. The meeting is seen as the start of a periodic dialogue that could expand into more formal cooperation as the probes continue, the people said. </p><p>To date, federal and state authorities involved in the probe haven't shared investigative materials about their concurrent probes of Google, some of the people said. At least seven state attorneys general who are part of the investigation have been invited to the meeting, one of the people said. The group\u2014comprising the executive committee of the states' investigation into Google\u2014is led by Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general.Recall, as does the Journal, that state AGs have in the past teamed up with the Department of Justice (DoJ) when the parties are serious about antitrust enforcement #8212; something the feds have been loath to do for quite some time. But during the Clinton administration, the DoJ did undertake enforcement actions, such as its suit against Microsoft, which was brought with the cooperation of several state GAs. According to the WSJ: State antitrust enforcers often team up with their federal counterparts, including when the Justice Department and a group of 21 attorneys general worked together when they sued Microsoft[3]in the late 1990s. Silicon Angle reports in DOJ and state attorneys general could join forces in Google antitrust probe[4] that the state probe of Google began last year:Attorneys general from 48 U.S. states, plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico launched a formal antitrust investigation into Google[5] last year, headed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. At least seven of those attorneys general are expected to attend this week's meeting.Attorney General William Barr commented on the significance of the size of the coalition of state AGS. Per the WSJ: The size of the coalition reflects #8216;the importance of these issues to Americans across the country, regardless of location or political persuasion,#8217; U.S. Attorney General William Barr said last month in a speech to the National Association of Attorneys General in Washington. Now, what, pray tell, our these state AGs and the DoF looking to investigate? The Journal reports: The state and federal investigations have given considerable focus to Google's powerful position in the lucrative market for online advertising. The company's dominant position in online search and possible anticompetitive behavior by Google in its Android mobile operating system have also drawn scrutiny, according to the people familiar with the matter. To clarify that latter statement, Bloomberg takes a bow in State AGs, U.S. Justice Lawyers to Discuss Google Probe: WS[6]J: A coalition of 48 states opened an antitrust investigation that will dig into Google's operations in search and mobile software, going beyond an initial focus on the company's advertising business, Bloomberg News said in November, citing two people familiar with the probe. The state officials met privately in Denver in November to help prepare for an investigation that will likely present challenging competition issues, one of the people said at the time. The states were also planning to map out a strategy for dividing the workload of the investigation, said two of the people. Now, I should note here, that no less an authority than Bill Black has noted that the 48-state investigation may actually not be all it's cracked up to be; see 48 States to Investigate Google: Anti-Trust or Politicking?[7]One thing Black zeroed in on #8212; and which leapt out at me also, is that the Texas AG, Ken Paxton, is taking a lead role in the state probe. But Republicans, and particularly conservative ones, are inherently hostile to the notion of aggressive anitrust enforcement. The wrinkle here is that Paxton appears to have targeted the tech companies for ideological reasons #8212; because they're #8216;liberal#8217; #8212; rather than for any antitrust principle. How this plays out in the realm of antitrust enforcement is anybody's guess. Another point that Black highlights is the dependence of state AGs on campaign contributions #8212; a reason that California didn't sign on to take on Google, a major source of funds.Will the state AG's follow through on a tough antitrust agenda, with all that implies for circumscribing their ability to raise raising campaign funds? Again, the answer is unclear. I think. What that means is that we must watch very carefully to see whether this state investigation of Google is intended to draw blood, or whether it will remain just some elaborate form of kabuki. That all being said, and despite the basic Republican hostility, going back at least to the Reagan years, for aggressive antirust enforcement, the WSJ quotes US AG Barr as expressing support for a broad focus, according to the WSJ: Mr. Barr hinted that a broad approach might be best. #8216;Many online platforms are not only big, but also offer a wide breadth of products and services,#8217; he said. #8216;Antitrust enforcers therefore must take an equally broad view of these platforms' offerings, and the relationships between different markets, products and business practices.#8217; Both the Justice Department and the states have been beefing up their legal teams. Some state attorneys general have said publicly they need close cooperation with the Justice Department in order to take on Google successfully. But I should note that such talk is cheap. The attention of American regulators has not been limited to alleged anti-competitive behavior by Google alone. As the WSJ notes: In addition to probes by the states and Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission is examining certain practices at Facebook Inc., including whether it acquired potential rivals such as Instagram and WhatsApp to head off competition. The House Judiciary Committee is looking at Facebook, Google, Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. for possible anticompetitive practices. There are signs of a partisan divide emerging as to how to pursue the Google probes, with the WSJ noting: It is possible partisan divisions could re-emerge in the Google investigation. When it comes to large tech companies, some Democrats are privately skeptical that a Republican-led administration will take what Democrats view as sufficient action to curb perceived abuses of market power. Fueling that sentiment is the outcome of two recent federal investigations of Facebook and Google's YouTube. Officials on the Federal Trade Commission split along party lines about whether settlements with the firms were tough enough, with Republicans casting the settlements as historic victories and Democrats calling them weak. Where is the Google investigation going? I'm not sure. But I point outthat while the Journal notes #8216;some Democrats are privately skeptical that a Republican-led administration will take what Democrats view as sufficient action to curb perceived abuses of market power#8217; #8212; we didn't see the DoJ, when led by either by AG Eric Holder or AG Loretta Lynch taking an aggressive stance regarding antitrust enforcement against any of these Big Tech firms, either. The reality is, both parties have colluded in letting the situation get as far out of control as it has #8212; so that Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google have been able to achieve such overwhelming market dominance, so that each can squelch inconvenient competition. India's Competition Probe On a related note, I would like to reiterate that when we look aboard, we do find regulators taking a more critical stance towards the possible anti-competitive practices of local subsidiaries of American technology behemoths. Take India as an example. Earlier this month, Jeff Bezos visited India. Things did not go well, And despite a request, he was unable to meet with prime minister Narendra Modi, or any of his ministers. And that was not the only problem. As I wrote in Jeff Bezos' Not So Excellent Indian Adventure: Modi Government Disses Inept Amazon.[8] The day before he arrived, the Competition Commission of India initiated an investigation into Amazon, for alleged violations of competition law, as reported by livemint inAmazon, Flipkart to be probed for abuse of competition law[9] The Competition Commission of India (CCI) on Monday ordered a probe into alleged competition law violations by Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart over allegations that the e-commerce majors promoted and gave discounts to #8216;preferred#8217; sellers, entered into exclusive partnerships with smartphone brands and abused their dominant position. CCI[10] noted four alleged practices on both the marketplaces\u2014exclusive launch of mobile phones, preferred sellers on the platforms, deep discounting and preferential promotion of private labels. The antitrust body said such exclusive arrangements between smartphone or mobile phone brands and e-commerce platforms or select companies selling exclusively on either of the platforms merit an investigation. #8216;It needs to be investigated whether the alleged exclusive arrangements, deep-discounting and preferential listing by the OPs (opposite parties) are being used as an exclusionary tactic to foreclose competition and are resulting in an appreciable adverse effect on competition contravening the provisions of Section 3 (1) read with Section 3(4) of the Act,#8217; the CCI order stated.The Bottom Line Whether the Trump DoJ can be bothered to enforce US antirust laws vigorously remains to be seen. If it chooses to #8216;cooperate#8217; more closely with state probes that are not going anywhere, that's not exactly news, either. It's been quite some time before the US was truly serious about antitrust enforcement. That's a bipartisan failing, and not just something that can be pinned on Republicans. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2020/01/wsj-reports-state-ags-to-cooperate-with-feds-to-take-on-google.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#\">https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2020/01/wsj-reports-state-ags-to-cooperate-with-feds-to-take-on-google.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#</url> This entry was posted in Banking industry[11], Free markets and their discontents[12], Guest Post[13], Legal[14], Politics[15], Regulations and regulators[16] on January 27, 2020[17] by Jerri-Lynn Scofield[18].

It would remove the autoplay feature from YouTube, end infinite scrolling on Twitter and Facebook feeds, limit scrolling time to three-minute sessions, set default limits on the use of platforms to 30 minutes a day, and outlaw Snapchat streaks (rewards for consecutive days of contact with friends) and most 'gamification' (badges, rewards) for any online service. These diktats are the opposite of market freedom. The bill's final kicker is a proposed triennial Federal Trade Commission report to Congress describing how internet companies 'interfere with free choices of individuals' by 'exploiting human psychology and brain physiology.' </p><p>In other words, Mr. Hawley wants to restrict freedom because it interferes with free choice. Or something like that. Cut to a video of Orwell rolling over in his grave (though it won't autoplay). OK, to be fair, Skopos Labs gives the bill a measly 3% chance of being enacted. But that doesn't make it any less . . . cuckoo.Kessler's piece also calls out Hawley's laughable claim that there is no innovation at all in social media.This antitech inclination hasn't always defined Mr. Hawley's persona. As attorney general he said, 'American workers and American entrepreneurs can compete with anybody, anywhere if our government will stop making America a cost-prohibitive place to do business.' Hear, hear. When he won his Senate seat last year he ran mostly as a conventional conservative. But even then he already had his enemies marked. His first Senate speech lamented the 'cold and judgmental world of social media,' and things kind of went downhill from there.Hawley, of course, has been grandstanding a lot lately about how the \"cosmopolitan elite\"[3] are the problem. He conveniently leaves out the fact that he attended Stanford and Yale Law School, clerked for the Supreme Court, worked at a massive \"cosmopolitan\" law firm (based in DC and London), Hogan Lovells, and then became Attorney General for Missouri before becoming Senator. Hawley is about as \"cosmopolitan\" a Senator as you can find. But apparently, in grandstanding to what he seems to believe is a very, very gullible base, he wants to convince them that he's standing up to the \"elites\" and that the only innovation that matters is innovation that comes from \"the Heartland\" or some such nonsense. As Kessler notes, cynically, Hawley's act is all for show:Whether that worry is real or not doesn't matter; condemning tech is a form of pretend populism. Mr. Hawley is taking an Elizabeth Warren-esque 'I have a plan for that' approach, which is more about grabbing headlines than actually passing laws. Yet the claim that big tech companies don't deliver innovation is false. We can stream TV shows on subways, enjoy same-day package delivery, have a lady in our phones help us to avoid traffic, sort photos automatically by date, location and faces, and get instant answers to any question in our kitchens from something that looks like a hockey puck. Yeah, but what have you done for me lately?Kessler notes that Hawley's plans would completely destroy innovation online.Mr. Hawley's style of heavy-handed regulation is what killed Detroit, distracted phone companies, inflated health-care costs, and wrecked education. Don't let it kneecap the internet. It won't be long before the senator announces, 'If you like your social media, you can keep your social media.'Given the willingness of the WSJ to publish anti-internet nonsense of late, it's nice to see Kessler able to get at least something sensible through.Permalink[4] | Comments[5] | Email This Story[6] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190812/12125842757/dennis-prager-peddles-complete-nonsense-about-google-censorship-wsj.shtml\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190812/12125842757/dennis-prager-peddles-complete-nonsense-about-google-censorship-wsj.shtml</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://emailshare.cmail20.com/t/n/d-l-1ccb02f0bc8111e998e194ceb0df86c7-l-d-r-l/\">https://emailshare.cmail20.com/t/n/d-l-1ccb02f0bc8111e998e194ceb0df86c7-l-d-r-l/</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://theweek.com/articles/854997/gop-sen-josh-hawley-grossly-mischaracterized-views-4-academics-cosmopolitan-elites-speech\">https://theweek.com/articles/854997/gop-sen-josh-hawley-grossly-mischaracterized-views-4-academics-cosmopolitan-elites-speech</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190812/21544642765/wsj-rightly-attacks-senator-josh-hawleys-nannyish-laws-regarding-internet.shtml\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190812/21544642765/wsj-rightly-attacks-senator-josh-hawleys-nannyish-laws-regarding-internet.shtml</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190812/21544642765/wsj-rightly-attacks-senator-josh-hawleys-nannyish-laws-regarding-internet.shtml#comments\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190812/21544642765/wsj-rightly-attacks-senator-josh-hawleys-nannyish-laws-regarding-internet.shtml#comments</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190812/21544642765/wsj-rightly-attacks-senator-josh-hawleys-nannyish-laws-regarding-internet.shtml?op=sharethis\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190812/21544642765/wsj-rightly-attacks-senator-josh-hawleys-nannyish-laws-regarding-internet.shtml?op=sharethis</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DIRT1023051566414475109251761300077</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIRT-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WW3-WB71-JCMN-Y0W6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"816\"/><timeReceived>7:07 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Techdirt</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 21, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The NASDAQ is just about four percent from its record high, gaining 51 points, so we certainly have a comeback, and the reason this rally is being juiced, despite everything going on with trade, and worries there, is the hope that the Fed does cut rates maybe more than once this year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: And to that point, Laurel, let's look at the 10-year right now, we've been watching, of course, this affects everything, folks, this affects borrowing, mortgages, credit cards, everything, the 10-year, up a basis point right now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SIMONETTI: MORNINGS WITH MARIA starts now.</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Hey there, ladies, thank you so much. Good morning, everyone, happy Tuesday to you. It is Tuesday, June 11th; your top stories right now, 6:00 a.m. on the button.</p><p>A new tariff threat on China this morning, President Trump may impose the next round if there is no meeting with Chinese head, Xi Jinping later this month at the G20.</p><p>Meanwhile, Huawei warning of a sale slowdown, the new sign that U.S. pressure is weighing on the company. Next hour, my exclusive interview with the chief security officer of Huawei, Andy Purdy, is here, live.</p><p>Targeting big technology, the House Judiciary Committee holding its first hearing today over anticompetitive practices, what to expect, coming up.</p><p>Plus, a $450-million mystery, solved. We will tell you where the missing Leonardo Da Vinci painting, Salvator Mundi, was reportedly found, wait until you see this.</p><p>MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And this early Tuesday morning, looking like the rally is continuing this morning, take a look at Futures, another strong move this morning, with the Dow Futures up 113 points right now, half a percent, the S&amp;P is up 13, and the NASDAQ up 51.</p><p>Stocks higher on trade optimism even as the U.S. and China remain at odds over potential deal. President Trump spoke yesterday on the negotiations which could happen at the upcoming G20 summit after earlier threatening tariffs.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think President Xi of China, great relationship with him, I think he'll be there, we are scheduled to talk and to meet right now. We're getting 25 percent or $250 billion worth of goods. It's a lot of money that's pouring into our treasury. We've never gotten $0.10 from China, now we're getting a lot of money from China.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is former Mitt Romney Policy Director and Research Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Lanhee Chen, and Lanhee, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>LANHEE CHEN, RESEARCH FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION: Hi, Maria, good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What's your take on this standoff between the U.S. and China at this point?</p><p>CHEN: Well, look, I think that the dynamic here is interesting because both sides could benefit from a deal, there's no question about it on United States side for President Trump. Their political benefits would obviously be huge economic benefits.</p><p>And the Chinese economy is hurting, Maria, we all know that they could certainly benefit from a deal as well, but there seems to be a little bit of mano a mano here, between President Trump and President Xi, in terms of who will blink first.</p><p>And, you know, the G20 summit in Osaka here, at the end of the month, was always considered to be the milestone. We'll have to see. I'm still optimistic the two sides sit down and that they make some progress toward a deal. But all bets have been off here, recently, with the tension mounting both with respect to trade, but also with respect to national security issues such as the Huawei issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I know, but what if a deal is not done? I mean, we know that China reneged on the initial agreement that the two sides came together on, and that included making it into law, that the Chinese could not steal intellectual property, force the transfer of technology, and then they reneged, so there is a chance that there's no deal, what kind of impact would that have to the U.S.?</p><p>CHEN: Well, absolutely there's a chance there's no deal because the changes that the President is asking China to make are quite fundamental, I mean, this is the way they've done business for some time, Maria, you're aware the fact that this is how they have conducted themselves.</p><p>They have talked about forced technology transfers, they have required them, they've required joint ventures with Chinese state enterprises for the U.S. businesses to compete, they've required intellectual property in order to do business, and so these are all things the Chinese have done.</p><p>What the President is asking for, in that sense, is fundamental change. So yes, it's entirely possible the Chinese say, look, we are not willing to do this. But I tend to think that Xi Jinping has an existential problem, Maria, and that is unless he is willing to make some of these changes, unless he's willing to do this, there's not going to be a deal.</p><p>And without a deal, his economy and his potential to stay in power without there being any kind of domestic unrest decreases significantly, I think.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CHEN: So, he's got to be able to do a deal for his own domestic concerns.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, then there's the spying, right, Chinese spying? Now, the U.S. is banning the energy department researchers from accepting jobs with foreign military affiliated groups, your reaction? Because, I mean, there's a whole host of espionage going on.</p><p>We're going to speak with the chief security officer of Huawei, later today. And he may very well, you know, dispute this. But, you know, look at the -- look at what the U.S. is doing to stop the potential espionage?</p><p>CHEN: Unquestionably, this is part of China's playbook. They did it in Australia several years ago. They did it in other countries with western influence. The United States is now placed where China is looking to gain influence, whether that influence is in the private sector, in the nonprofit sector, we see it on academic campuses all over the country with the so-called Confucius institutes.</p><p>Obviously, China understands that the influence game is incredibly important, which is why these issues that we're talking about here, Maria, it goes so much beyond trade. There's a tendency in the conventional media to cover this as a trade story. It's not just that, it's a national security story as you alluded to.</p><p>And so it's very important for the United States to understand that China is looking to leverage influence in many places across the country and that is something that's very important as we consider this next round of discussions President Trump is going to have with President Xi.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, we'll be watching that, very important story. Lanhee, thanks very much for weighing in this morning.</p><p>CHEN: Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Lanhee Chen, joining us. And stay with us, I will be speaking with the Chief Security Officer at Huawei, Andy Purdy, in my exclusive interview this morning, in less than an hour, that's 7:00 a.m. Eastern, hear what Huawei has to say about all of this, coming up.</p><p>First, though, let's look at gasoline prices, they're falling, as Americans hit the road for summer vacations, Dagen is on that this morning, what's your take? Good morning, Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria, two words, road trip, that, why, because gasoline prices are so low, so the average retail gasoline price has fallen for five straight weeks, and now it's at $2.73 a gallon, that is sharply lower, down about $0.19 from a year ago.</p><p>This is the lowest level since early April that we've seen, and part of it, of course, is the drop in crude oil prices, crude oil last week, down more than 20 percent from its April peak, now in bear market territory. Why is this good news?</p><p>Because it puts more money in consumers' pockets, period, in a time where people are a little bit concerned about the U.S. economy looking soft, this would give people more money to spend, maybe go on that road trip for a vacation this summer.</p><p>We've got retail sales that are coming out on Friday, so maybe we'll see a little bit of life in that number because that has been a little weak spot in the economy, Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We'll watch that. Dagen, we'll see you in a few minutes.</p><p>Meanwhile, big technology in the hot seat today, Cheryl is on that this morning, Cheryl, good morning to you.</p><p>CASONE: Good morning, Maria, going to be an interesting day in Capitol Hill, as they are on the hot seat. The House Judiciary committee is going to be holding a hearing. It's going to be this afternoon on anticompetitive practices among technology giants.</p><p>Now, today's hearing expected to focus on the ways that big tech has changed the landscape for the news industry. And, of course, that's more of a revenue story for newspapers. They basically say that Google and Facebook are threatening their survival and responding to growing calls to break up big technology companies.</p><p>Instagram's chief says that breaking it off from Facebook will make Instagram a less safe space.</p><p>All right, a congressional panel, naming witnesses for next week's hearing on Boeing's 737 Max jets, the list includes Chesley Sullenberger, the former U.S. Airways pilot who safely landed an Airbus jet on New York's Hudson River, back in 2009, of course, that was known as the Miracle on the Hudson, and former Federal Aviation Administration Head Randy Babbitt is going to be speaking.</p><p>This is the second hearing on the grounded 737 Max, held by the House Aviation Subcommittee, the panel going to gather information to make sure that these jets are safe, of course, before they are allowed to fly again.</p><p>Well, investigators are combing through wreckage of a helicopter that crashed on top of a building here in midtown Manhattan yesterday afternoon. The chopper was flying in restricted air space, and in rain and fog, when it crashed. The pilot was killed. He was the only person on board.</p><p>He's been identified as Tim McCormack, a veteran pilot and former volunteer fire chief from Upstate New York. Now, in the wake of this accident, New York Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney is calling for a ban on all nonessential helicopter flights over the city.</p><p>Just an hour or so, our very own Susan Li is going to be talking with the head of Uber's helicopter venture and get his take on, of course, that crash yesterday, Maria, and it was such a thick -- it was almost a white out in the skies above Manhattan yesterday, I'm sure you saw.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and a lot of fog for sure. All right, we'll wait for that. Thank you, Cheryl. We'll take a short break. When we come back, a lot more to come, plus my exclusive interview with Huawei's security officer, stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, big show this morning, coming up, my exclusive interview with Huawei Technologies Chief Security Officer, Andy Purdy, back with us this morning, to respond to criticism about Huawei.</p><p>White House Council of Economic Advisors Chairman Kevin Hassett is here, along with Michigan Congresswoman House Energy and Commerce Committee Member, Congresswoman Debbie Dingell, joining us.</p><p>My first on FOX interview with Uber Aviation Programs Head, Eric Allison is here, along with my exclusive interview with the CEO of Lands' End, Jerome Griffith, joining us, plus, my first on FOX interview with the Knot Worldwide CMO, the Chief Marketing Officer, Dhanusha Sivajee, joining us this morning. Don't miss a moment of it. We've got a big show this Tuesday morning.</p><p>Meanwhile, now, the Mueller report, House of Representatives preparing to bring Attorney General William Barr and former White House Counsel Don McGahn to court over subpoenaing documents. This coming after a former White House counsel to Richard Nixon, John Dean, testified on Capitol Hill yesterday, where he said, \"remarkable parallels between Watergate and the findings of the Mueller report.\" Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOHN DEAN, FORMER WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL TO PRESIDENT NIXON: In many ways, the Mueller report is to President Trump, what the so-called Watergate road map, was to President Richard Nixon. Stated a little differently, Special Counsel Mueller has provided this committee with a road map.</p><p>REP. DOUG COLLINS (R-GA): This committee is now hearing from the 70s and they want their star witness back. They have the godfather here.</p><p>REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): So, you instructed Michael Cohen's lawyer to keep information from Republicans to obstruct the committee work.</p><p>DEAN: I didn't quite phrase it that way, no.</p><p>JORDAN: You know what? They took your advice.</p><p>REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): Mr. Dean has made a cottage industry out of accusing presidents of acting like Richard Nixon.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining the conversation this morning, Forbes Media chairman, former Republican presidential candidate, Steve Forbes is here, Washington Examiner columnist and Republican pollster, Kristen Soltis Anderson is here, Dagen McDowell, as well. Thanks, everybody, great to see you this morning. Good morning.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA: Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Pretty aggressive comments coming out of Mr. Dean. What was your take?</p><p>FORBES: Well, he got pushed back too, and the parallels to Watergate are false. In Watergate, there was a crime, there was no Russian collusion here, so what's the parallel, other than he wants to be in the limelight?</p><p>BARTIROMO: In fact, I see a parallel with the origins of the Russia investigation which William Barr and Mr. (INAUDIBLE) are looking at. I mean, no mention, Kristen, of the fact that you had cabal of people putting their finger on the scale early on in '16, no mention of what the parallel to Watergate is there.</p><p>KRISTEN SOLTIS ANDERSON, COLUMNIST, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: Well, I think, by in large, I'm looking at what voters are thinking about this, they have mostly moved on. I mean, there are things outlined in the Mueller report that are very concerning about what Russia was trying to do.</p><p>And so, absolutely, good that the report was done, good that there was information, sort of, pulled together about what Russia was attempting to do. But, in terms of this president, you know, his job approval hasn't moved since the release of the report, if anything, it ticked up a little bit.</p><p>With all of these new information out there, by in large, voters have said, OK, I'm glad it's done, now let's move on to fixing infrastructure, getting our economy even better, et cetera, et cetera.</p><p>FORBES: The Democrats base won't let them drop the issue. They still want a crime even though there's no crime.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>FORBES: And the real crime is what was done leading up to this Russian collusion story.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's exactly right. And what I keep saying, Dagen, probably, a million times, they've got their guy, now they're looking for the crime. That's not how we do things in America. First, you see a crime, and then you follow the crime. Here, they've got their guy, Donald Trump, and they're just going to investigate him until they find something.</p><p>MCDOWELL: John Dean wasn't even a fact witness, he was essentially an opinion witness, that he doesn't know anything about the Mueller report other than maybe reading the whole thing, which I did, and he seems to be there to be the narrator for the left-wing nuts, who are trying to school the American people on what was in it or what wasn't in it.</p><p>And I'll just turn to the Democrats on the House Committee, if you're going to pick somebody to go in front of cameras, why not pick somebody from a network that people actually watch? Nobody knows who this guy is. Again, this is the era -- the Brady Bunch was still on the air when this guy was relevant.</p><p>Nobody recognizes him. And by the way, Dana Perino said on \"THE FIVE\" yesterday, you know, that this testimony by John Dean yesterday was completely wiped out by that helicopter crash here, in New York City, which was probably, and I'm paraphrasing, beneficial to the Democrats, because this was not the way to go.</p><p>ANDERSON: The time that a hearing like that is going to make news is if someone is producing new information, saying something that hasn't been heard before, presenting something that people did not know before, sort of bringing someone who, you know, participated in things in the past that are bad, to say, I think this seems bad.</p><p>And you're right, it's opinion, it's not introducing a new piece of evidence to the American people.</p><p>FORBES: And almost half a century ago when Dean achieved his fame, talking about a cancer in the presidency. The real cancer is what the CIA and the FBI and others tried to do, semi-coup, either influence the campaign or try to destroy a legitimately elected president.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>FORBES: That's the real cancer.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And they used, you know, misinformation to get a FISA warrant to spy on an American citizen, and yet, here we have House Judiciary Committee Chair Jerry Nadler, going for contempt. He has announced yesterday that he will not look to hold Attorney General Bill Barr in contempt in connection with the Mueller report. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JERRY NADLER (D-NY): I am pleased that we have reached an agreement to review at least some of the evidence underlying the Mueller report, including interview notes, firsthand accounts of misconduct and other critical evidence. And that this material will be made available without delay to members of committee on both sides of the aisle.</p><p>As a result, I see no need to resort to the criminal contempt statute to enforce or able 19th subpoena, at least, for now, so long as the department upholds its end of the bargain.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: I mean, it's pretty incredible that they could get away with this, completely ignoring what you just mentioned, ignoring this misuse of power, putting their most important, most aggressive tools as an intel division of the government, to work against Donald Trump, these are tools that we use for terrorists, I'm talking about informants and wire-tapping.</p><p>FORBES: Well, what they're also were worried about is what Barr is going to uncover with the new investigation. They know that's going to be very, very bad, and anything they can do to divert it, anything they can do to destroy Barr's reputation. In the meantime, they're going to go all out to do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: including scrubbing every other word in the Mueller report to come up with this hearing, right?</p><p>ANDERSON: Yes, I mean, I think when it comes to trying to figure out what happened to lead us to this place, again, I think it's good that our intelligence agencies were trying to figure out what foreign countries were trying to do to hack into the DNC, et cetera, but when it comes to U.S. citizens, the rules are different, and the rules are different for a reason.</p><p>So, I think, making sure that things like our FISA courts are being used appropriately and not being used against, sort of, political opponents, is a very important, sort of, oversight, things that the government needs to - -</p><p>FORBES: opposition research from a presidential campaign.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And they never even told Donald Trump that they were investigating Russia, as the president-elect, you know, because they were actually investigating him.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. I said, if you're going to call a witness about obstruction of justice, why not call President Bill Clinton? He has more modern -- I said this yesterday, a more modern view of what obstruction would be like, because he was find --</p><p>I mean, he was impeached by the House, and not the Senate, and that should be a warning to these Democrats of what could blow up in their face if they move ahead with impeachment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: This, the same person who met with the (INAUDIBLE) sitting Attorney General Loretta Lynch, just a few days before Hillary was to be interviewed by the FBI. Talk about obstruction.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, that tarmac meeting.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right there on the tarmac.</p><p>FORBES: They just got together to talk about grandkids and golf stories.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and yoga (INAUDIBLE) we'll take a quick break, when we come back, United Tech fleeting Connecticut after its merger with Raytheon, once again, companies leaving because of the high taxes, we'll talk about that, then Google's new investment, the technology giant setting its sights on the Midwest now, where and why, next, right here, stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, headlines across America this morning, the Caledonian Record reports Vermont's Republican governor vetoing a bill that would have established a 24-hour waiting period to buy handguns, supporters of the legislation arguing that it would have reduced suicide rates in Vermont by protecting residents from expulsive acts of self-harm.</p><p>Governor Scott deciding existing restrictions on gun ownership that he signed into law last year, adequately address the supply side of the gun violence problem.</p><p>The Mercury News this morning, writing 2,220-acre Northern California Sand Fire now at 20 percent containment; heat wave forecast throughout the week. The biggest wildfire in Northern California so far this year, it was fanned by strong winds after first being reported Saturday afternoon, leading to the closure of Highway 16 and mandatory evacuations in several communities.</p><p>And the Detroit News says that Google is investing $17 million into Detroit, Ann Arbor. The tech giant says it's going to be pouring those millions into 14 states as it sees faster growth outside the San Francisco Bay Area, the Michigan investment adding nearly 100,000 square feet of space, and \"significant number of jobs.\"</p><p>Interesting, see Google investing in America. These companies, of course, have been under severe pressure for all the reasons, wondering if there's going to be regulatory action on them and here we have Google, investing in America.</p><p>FORBES: And in Michigan and near Detroit, which is a city that's remarkably is making a great comeback, we're going to have a great conference there in the fall. That city is on the move again.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it is, and you -- and so you're having a conference this fall.</p><p>FORBES: Yes, 30 under 30.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you're expecting -- you're expecting --</p><p>FORBES: thousands of people.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>FORBES: Welcome (INAUDIBLE) states are doing it. City is alive again. It's great to see.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Why did you choose Detroit?</p><p>FORBES: Because the city is making a comeback and we want to highlight it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's terrific.</p><p>FORBES: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And it's on Eastern Time, which helps, so you don't have time shift.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: If you're there. And it' a very short flight from --</p><p>FORBES: Want to travel to Asia recently, I'd love that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. See? And it's a great hub between Chicago and New York as well, and Google with all the investment here in New York City is running into problems with the cost of living here, with the --</p><p>Because Google has taken over a swath of buildings around the meat-packing district and the rents are so high and the cost of owning of apartment here, in New York, is so high, that they end up having to pay the employees a lot more too.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, that's a good point. All right, we'll take a break. When we come back, border crack-down, Mexico steps up to curb illegal immigration, what's compromising the effort, coming up. And then a $450- million mystery solved, the missing Leonardo Da Vinci painting discovered in an unlikely place, back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, June 11th. Your top stories right now 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Markets are higher and the Dow looking to make it seven straight. Futures pointing to gains at the opening of trading this morning. The Dow Industrials up 125 points, the S&amp;P is up 14, and NASDAQ up 50 points right now.</p><p>Firmer tone going into the day and Wall Street modest gains on yesterday, as well. The Dow Industrials on its longest streak in over a year with a game yesterday of 78 points and the NASDAQ was up 81.</p><p>Global markets this morning, similar story, we do have a firmer tone in Europe. The FT-100 is up 38 points. The CAC Quarante in Paris is up 44, and the DAX Index in Germany is up 157 that's 1-1/3 percent higher in Germany.</p><p>In Asia overnight. Stocks higher there as well, up on the Shanghai Composite in China, 2-1/2 percent. Big move there.</p><p>Meanwhile, Huawei is warning of a sales slowdown. The new sign that U.S. pressure is weighing on the company. Next hour my exclusive interview with the chief security officer of Huawei, Andy Purdy, once again joining us this morning.</p><p>The list of companies leaving Connecticut over taxes adding another member. United Technologies joining the exodus following its deal with Raytheon. Plus, a $415 million mystery has been solved. We will tell you where the missing Leonardo da Vinci painting. Salvator on Monday was reportedly found. All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning.</p><p>But first, our top story this half-an-hour. Crisis at the border. Mexican president, Obrador, cracking down on migrants heading to the United States after making a deal with President Trump to avert U.S. tariffs on Mexican exports. The president weighed in yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Mexico is doing more for the United States as of now than Congress. And then that specifically, the Democrats, they have to get their act together. They have to work and get something done because you get a tremendous problem at the border if people pouring in. And it means crime, it means drugs, have been so many other things.</p><p>We're building the wall. We're going to have close to 500 miles of wall built by the end of next year, that's a lot. And we're moving along very rapidly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: This as the cyber-attack was unleashed against a federal subcontractor working for U.S. Customs and Border Patrol. Compromising tens of thousands of photos, including traveler's faces, license plates.</p><p>Joining me right now is retired four-star general and Fox News senior strategic analyst General Jack Keane. General, good to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST: Yes. Good to see you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That was pretty extraordinary. Your reaction to what's taking place.</p><p>KEANE: Well, the cyber attacks, I mean, we've just got to take it as routine because they're happening all over the United States and with our allies. And it's our adversaries are doing this, Maria. I mean, China is the most prolific, Russia is the most talented. Even Iran and North Korea are involved.</p><p>And what I really appreciate is that this administration has loosened up the regulations and the policies for us to be able to retaliate. And I'm confident they are retaliating. We have the number one cyber offensive capability in the world. Nobody is as good as we are at that capability.</p><p>And we have been reluctant to use it in the past. And the fact that they're going to do that now, once we identify someone who's doing that to us, I believe we should use that capability to retaliate. Then, the United States will never announce that's going to happen. They're never going to talk about the results of it. It's going to largely be done by Cyber Command, which is a military organization work -- working with the National Security Agency that does that kind of work.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I mean, do we know who this subcontract you're working for U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, compromising tens of thousands of photos? Because that's traveler's faces and license plates, do we know what the goal of the perpetrator was? What -- why are they taking these pictures and license plates?</p><p>KEANE: Well, an adversary has the intention of doing something like that because they gain information about people, then they use it for manipulation. I mean, they stole, as you know, just a few years ago, all of the United States military's personnel records to include my. I got a letter from the military saying your entire personnel file has been compromised.</p><p>Nothing has been done to manipulate me, of course, but I don't know what else is being done by an adversary who's taking that kind of information.</p><p>Listen, I was a director at General Dynamics, Maria. And every single month, every month, they had hundreds of millions of penetrations by the Chinese. I'm not talking about a few thousand. I am talking about hundreds of millions. The FBI was in residence and they had some subcontractors that helped them build the most classified program in the United States, a nuclear-powered submarine. That is it.</p><p>And they penetrated that. They penetrated that through a subcontractor because they -- those subcontractors are spread out all over the United States. They may not have as good a defense as General Dynamics has. And then, they ride into that system and get into it.</p><p>Fortunately, we detected that. But that is how prolific they are every single day working against the United States of America.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and the actors are pretty much the same over and over again. China, Russia, North Korea. Let me ask about North Korea, because North Korean state media is out with a message for the United States, calling for the end of the \"hostile policy toward Pyongyang.</p><p>Nearly one year since President Trump met with Kim Jong-un in Singapore, this is new reports say that Kim Jong-nam the half-brother of Kim Jong-un, who was murdered in 2017, you remember, was actually a CIA operative working in the United States. Your thoughts.</p><p>KEANE: Well, we don't know that for a fact that he's a CIA operative. That's for sure. But it wouldn't surprise me and it certainly explains the aggressiveness that Kim Jong-un was used -- using to kill his stepbrother. BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>KEANE: Yes, obviously, he detected that kind of information. But, we go back to where are we with North Korea. I mean, he failed at the Hanoi summit. Because he came home empty-handed, he didn't get sanction relief that he wanted, we know now for a fact, he killed his chief negotiator who he fired him first, and then killed them, who was involved in that. And because he presented the same deal that they had done with previous administrations, and he always got sanction relief. With the Trump team, they did not get it.</p><p>He is leveraging everything he can to get back to another summit. Our administration wants to see some progress being done at lower levels before we involve the head of state again. And I think that's the right road to take. After all, Maria, they have never disclosed to us any inventory of something we desired at our first meeting which is give us the inventory of all your weapon systems. Let's put a timetable together to dismantle those weapon systems, and let's also have independent observers to monitor that. None of that has ever happened.</p><p>So, that's on the table and hopefully, before we have a meeting the next time, some of that is will be resolved and we can finally make some progress. After all, there has been no progress made on actual denuclearization. There's been progress made on return of remains, on the -- on the reciprocation of their relationship and relationship with South Korea.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>KEANE: But not on the actual denuclearization.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know, it's interesting because they go back and forth on this and have these meetings, and yet nothing solid on denuclearization at all so far. So, again, it's interesting to see what this president and the administration is going to do to really change the needle on what has become a culture. We'll see.</p><p>Before you go, General, let me ask you any thoughts on this merger in the defense business? I mean you've got United Technologies and Raytheon. You've watched various -- you know mergers within defense before. To see the impact on defense spending and the impacts on our defenses. Do you have any reaction?</p><p>KEANE: No, my instincts at consolidation in the defense industry is largely a good thing, not a bad thing. I mean, certainly, if you got downs only two or three, then, major OEMs and that, that would be a problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>KEANE: But, when I was a director of General Dynamics, we looked at this kind of consolidation, actually with Raytheon itself. So, I think that's likely what will coming out of that, will be better defense capabilities for the United States.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>KEANE: That's the way I see it. These are positive things that happen with the kind of consolidation. Taking advantage of the capabilities that each company has consolidated, bringing that together. Building a more effective, efficient company.</p><p>BARTIROMO: General, it's great to see this morning thanks so much.</p><p>KEANE: Yes, good talking to you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: General Jack Keane, joining us there.</p><p>Meanwhile, Audi is recalling its new electric E-Tron SUV. Cheryl Casone with that story now. Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: That's right, Maria. More than 1,600 vehicles being called back to fix a seal in the battery compartment that would avoid a fire. There have been no reports of fires, not only about a third of the E-Tron's affected by the recall are currently being driven by consumers right now on the roads.</p><p>Well, a mystery looks like it may be solved. The owner of this $450 million, Leonardo da Vinci painting is reportedly, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The painting's whereabouts have been unknown since its 2017 auction at Christie's.</p><p>Artnet.com, says the 500-year-old painting is being kept on a super yacht that is owned by the Saudi crown prince.</p><p>Back here at home. New York's Time Square are getting the glaze over. Krispy Kreme plans to open flagship doughnut shop, a big one that right in the heart of Midtown Manhattan. A sweet location, and going to have a glaze waterfall, oh yes. Stadium-style seating inside a larger than life doughnut box.</p><p>This at the renderings, Maria, obviously. They expect to open this mega doughnut shop in 2020. Looking to serve more guest a year than any other location around the world. And you know me and doughnuts, Maria. It's right down the street from the studio. So, if I'm missing one morning, you'll know where I'm at.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That'll be a big attraction.</p><p>CASONE: I cannot wait.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, quick break, and then, United Tech leaving Connecticut after the merger with Raytheon. Yet another corporation fleeing a high-tax state. We'll check that out.</p><p>Then, healthcare in America. What doctors say is the key to reversing effects of the most common, costly, and disabling illnesses? All right here, stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. New developments in the United Technologies- Raytheon merger, recording plans for their new headquarters. Here's Lauren Simonetti with the details now. Lauren, good morning.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Hey, good morning, Maria. So, there's questions about the location, United Technologies employs 19,000 at its headquarters in Connecticut. When its merger with Raytheon closes next year, to Massachusetts, those headquarters go. No job cuts expected in Connecticut. But United Technologies is the latest of several high-profile companies to leave high-taxed Connecticut. Aetna is leaving, pending the outcome its deal with CVS. General Electric left for Boston -- that was back in 2017.</p><p>Now, Connecticut Republicans are worried about more than the high taxes. They have the state's debt load, unfunded pension liabilities, new legislation that requires paid family medical leave and a higher minimum wage. That's perk for workers in a tight labor market but it's often a burden on business. And not much has changed under Democratic Governor, Ned Lamont. He has background in business in the cable industry. He campaigned on reversing some of the economic losses Connecticut saw under eight years, Dan Malloy. Connecticut actually ranked one of the worst states for business by Forbes last year, and to fill the coffers, they're looking at dealing things like increasing tolls and putting a tax on sweetened beverages -- a soda tax. Steve Forbes, you're here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>FORBES: Stay away from Connecticut. Stay away from New York, New Jersey, they're all so bad. And that's why a lot of people live in Pennsylvania where they have a three percent income tax rate, 3-1/4 percent. On route 78 which crosses New Jersey. The morning, it's a caravan. People from Pennsylvania --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Know it well. Oh, know it well. I have to take 78 to get down to Virginia. But again, what happens is, all the left-wing liberals move into these lower-taxed states which is part of what happened to Connecticut. Connecticut, at one point, I think in early 90s didn't even have a state income tax.</p><p>FORBES: Didn't have income tax.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And liberals start pouring in from New York City proper and they basically impose the same policies that destroyed places that they left in the first place.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Which is why I get worried about Texas. Because Texas as well, no state income tax, lower taxes, and a place where high-tax state residents like to --</p><p>FORBES: Maybe they should just carve out Austin.</p><p>BARTIROMO: They're turning purple, because Austin, just what you say, these liberals go there and these other policies. And so now, Austin is very different from Dallas or others.</p><p>FORBES: Dallas is starting to go to.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Dallas is starting to go purple, too.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A lot of these blue states have elected Republican governors in recent years, and it's places like Massachusetts with Charlie Baker, Maryland with Larry Hogan -- some of these Republican governors in blue states, and the most popular governors.</p><p>SIMONETTI: And a lot of these companies are moving to that area because of the way they encourage business research and development and the like. But Connecticut is just filled can so much money in terms of the wealthy people --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Wait, Connecticut's housing market has never recovered. Fairfield County, even in Greenwich, Connecticut, that housing market is weak. And outside of that, because, again, these policies drove G.E. out of Connecticut. So, you're going to layer on more of what is destroying business, sending them to other states and basically hurting working-class people in Connecticut. It's appalling and it's really sad. It's beautiful state with great people, but their leadership is just --</p><p>FORBES: For decades Connecticut was the richest state in the union.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>SIMONETTI: And it's when New York who is bad, crime and all of that. A lot of people went to beautiful suburbs, the safe suburbs of Connecticut but things have changed.</p><p>STEVE: You see a purplish impact in New Hampshire. People moving from Massachusetts into New Hampshire thanks to political climate there.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Even you came in Connecticut, you can get a pristine mid-center modern house by a famed architect, 4,000 square feet on at least acre of land for less than what you would pay for a one-bedroom apartment in New York City in a bad neighborhood and they have the greatest schools in Connecticut.</p><p>BARTIROMO: God, wow. Unbelievable. Well, no wonder people are leaving Connecticut, and companies are leaving Connecticut. There you go. Lauren, thank you. Lauren Simonetti. Coming up, staying healthy in America; simple changes can change your life in a big way. Elongate your life. We have an expert advice coming up. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Reversing unhealthy trends, specifically when it comes to chronic disease. My next guest says basic lifestyle changes can be key to reversing the effects of the most common costly and disabling illnesses. Joining us right now is the author of \"Undo It\", the President and Founder of the Preventative Medicine Research Institute, Dean Ornish. Dean, it's great to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>DEAN ORNISH, PRESIDENT AND FOUNDER, PREVENTATIVE MEDICINE RESEARCH INSTITUTE: Thanks, Maria. It's great to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, this seems like real, simple advice. Take us through some of the lifestyle changes that people should do to reverse chronic disease.</p><p>ORNISH: Thank you, and thanks for having me. We found in 40 years of research that simple lifestyle changes. Eat well, move more, stress less, love more can actually reverse the progression of the most common chronic diseases. We found, for the first time, heart disease, and diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol. We did a study where we found with that with Craig Venture, who decoded the human genome, that when you change your lifestyle, it changes your gene, turns on the good genes, turns off the bad genes. We did a study with (INAUDIBLE) and got the Nobel Prize for discovering Telomeres (INAUDIBLE) our chromosomes that regulate how long we live, that we could lengthen Telomeres. And when (INAUDIBLE) have published it, they called reversing aging at a cellular level. So, the more diseases we study, the evidence we have. How these simple changes can be so powerful, and how quickly you can feel --</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you've seen that these changes can actually have an impact in just a few weeks.</p><p>ORNISH: In just a few weeks, these mechanisms are so dynamic that when you make these changes, most people find it feeling so much better so quickly. It reframes the reason for making them from fear to prevent something bad from happening years later. But you think more clearly, you have more energy, you look younger, you feel better, sexual function even improves. So, these are choices worth making not just to live longer but to live better.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What's the one change that gives you the most bang, so to speak? The one thing that everybody should do?</p><p>ORNISH: It's really not one thing. It's all four.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Give me one idea. The biggest one.</p><p>ORNISH: I think it's important what we eat. You know, we found that that what you eat, not only are you avoiding the things that cause diseases, but there are hundreds of thousands of protective substances in fruits and vegetables that have anti-cancer, anti-heart disease, and even anti-aging properties.</p><p>FORBES: Like some bacon after the show?</p><p>ORNISH: Probably not. And these are actually cost effective as well. We've done studies -- we did a study with (INAUDIBLE) Blue Cross, Blue Shield, that they cut their cost -- their overall healthcare costs in half in the first year. You know, five percent of people account for 80 percent of the healthcare costs -- these are the ones who have chronic diseases.</p><p>FORBES: A friend of mine had terrible back problems, couldn't play golf anymore, went vegetarian plus fish and he's playing golf again.</p><p>ORNISH: Well, that's a go because inflammation is one of the mechanisms that underlies all of these different chronic diseases. It turns out that 86 percent of the $3.6 trillion we spent last year on healthcare, is for treating chronic diseases that are often preventable or even reversible by making these lifestyle changes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So, the four things that are on the front of your booking. It was eat well --</p><p>ORNISH: Eat well, move more, stress less, love more.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Love more. I want to ask about that. Because there's a lot of really fascinating research about the loneliness crisis and the way that loneliness kind of correlates with all of these bad health outcomes. What's your advice for love more?</p><p>ORNISH: Well, you know, it turns out that 50 years ago, most people have an extended family. They had a job they felt secured, they had a church for synagogue they went to regularly, they had a neighborhood with two or three generations of people, and we've lost something. It turns out that study after study have shown that people who are lonely and depressed are three to 10 times more likely to get sick and die prematurely from all causes when compared to those who have a sense of love and connection with community.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's probably this cycle because you end up -- you're alone and depressed and you're eating the wrongs foods.</p><p>ORNISH: That's right and you kind of spiral downwards.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You'll lose the judgment. You're also conducting the first randomized trial to determine if these lifestyle changes can reverse the progression of early stage Alzheimer's disease. This is a big good one.</p><p>ORNISH: It's a big one, because as you know, there are no good drugs for treating it or for preventing it that are really effective. My mom dies of Alzheimer's out of personal interest. And so, we're doing the first randomized trial to see because Alzheimer's shares many of the same mechanisms that these other diseases, too. And you know, early -- less intensive interventions can slow the progression. We're hoping to see, we don't know, of course, if we will, that we might be able to stop and reverse it. But whatever we show, it will be important. If we show we can reverse it, that will be landmark. Even if we show it does nothing, I think people need to know that, too.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How long did your mom suffer from Alzheimer's before passing?</p><p>ORNISH: It was about seven years, and she was brilliant. And it was just -- you know, when you lose your memory, you lose everything. So, if we can prevent that -- if we can reverse it, then we can prevent that. And since there are no good drugs, we're doing that. That would give a lot of people new hope and new choices.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Really, great advice, Dean. Great book. Congrats, number two or number one.</p><p>ORNISH: Well, it was number two yesterday, we'll hope it will be number one today.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Check out the books. Still ahead, my exclusive interview with the chief security officer of Huawei Technologies, that's next.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2019061101cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9V-SH71-JB20-G2B6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7612\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 11, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002T15</classCode><className>RAYTHEON CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000218H</classCode><className>UNITED TECHNOLOGIES CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS541512 COMPUTER SYSTEMS DESIGN SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS336414 GUIDED MISSILE &amp;

Ron Wyden will be a \"different brand\" of tech sector transparency with \"consequences\" for transgressing companies, the Oregon Democrat told us. Also Thursday, Senate Commerce Committee leadership hammered Google for not disclosing sooner its recent Google+ vulnerability (see 1810100066), given the company's chief privacy officer testified months after the issue reportedly was discovered (see 1809260050).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I'm getting ready to offer my privacy bill where we're going to use the FTC as the kind of pointperson in this fight,\" Wyden told us. Ensuring companies follow new transparency standards \"will take talent. That will take resources,\" he said. Asked when the bill will be introduced (see 1809050057), Wyden said, \"Soon.\"</p><p>In a letter to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Senate Commerce Chairman John Thune, R-S.D.; Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kansas; and Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., requested a copy of an internal memo that reportedly argued for withholding information on the recent Google+ vulnerability to avoid attention from regulators and lawmakers. \"Google must be more forthcoming with the public and lawmakers if the company is to maintain or regain the trust of the users of its services,\" the lawmakers wrote Thursday. A company spokesperson pointed to a recent blog saying the platform's goal is to ensure \"everyone is confident that their data is secure.\"</p><p>Determining the FTC's level of authority will be key to the legislative debate before the committee, Thune told us. The first two hearings on the matter showed consensus from industry and privacy experts that the FTC is the proper enforcer, he said: \"The question is how much authority and power they should have. Should they have rulemaking authority? And there are differences of opinion about that.\"</p><p>Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, argued in the first two hearings that any new privacy law should give the FTC the authority to fine and make rules on privacy. Currently, the agency relies on a consent decree framework, which typically requires multiple infractions to draw a civil penalty. Republicans are deciding where to draw the line, Schatz told us: \"They are in good faith trying to figure out how to make a national privacy law. We're in good discussions.\"</p><p>The FTC has the proper resources to police online privacy, Moran told us, but \"as the concerns of privacy increase, then we need to make sure they have additional resources to do so. ... It's up to us as Congress to provide the necessary money to expand those capabilities as the demands upon them increase.\"</p><p>Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., agreed the FTC has the proper resources and authority to do its job as online privacy enforcer: \"Does that mean they ought to be the only agency involved? Not necessarily.\" Verizon and others have proposed an expanded enforcement role for state attorneys general, which have become increasingly involved in big tech issues.</p><p>\"The tech sector would do well to be cooperative,\" Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., told us. \"They'd do themselves a favor, the industry being cooperative, as we kind of work through policy choices. If they're proactive, they get their governance right and they collaborate with us, it's a lot better than having Congress tell them how it's going to be done.\"</p><p>\u0192_&lt;\u0192_&lt;\u0192_&lt;\u0192_&lt;\u0192_&lt;\u0192_&lt;\u0192_&lt;Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., supports increasing FTC authority: \"We've got to do a better job of addressing these breaches and the privacy breaches and protecting individuals' digital footprint, and I think that's what we're seeing now at the federal level,\" she told us. \"We recognize that.\"</p><p>Sen. Angus King, I-Vt., told us there's no question data breaches -- whether it's Google, a federal agency or any other entity -- are a \"serious problem.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TG1-YHT1-JC8G-835D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"625\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 12, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The cross-pollination between Pennsylvania Avenue and Sand Hill Road led some political activists to describe the valley as a \u201cretirement community\u201d for White House operatives headed west.</p><p>That bicoastal bonhomie has dimmed amid a cascade of scandals over data privacy, the spread of misinformation and foreign intrusion on the companies\u2019 platforms.</p><p>\u201cThe reality is, the honeymoon is over and people are rightly demanding more regulation and transparency,\u201d said Steve Westly, the former California state controller and a venture capital investor in Menlo Park.</p><p>Among the 2020 candidates, Sen. Elizabeth Warren has set the pace on the issue, laying out a plan last month to break up the largest tech firms. Under Warren\u2019s proposal, the firms would be banned from operating marketplaces or exchanges while participating in those platforms. For example, Amazon couldn\u2019t run its online store while selling Amazon-branded products on the same site, and those functions would have to be split apart into separate companies. Some other recent tech mergers, like Facebook\u2019s acquisition of Instagram, would also have to be rolled back. The process, Warren argues, would make it harder for the corporate titans to push newer upstarts out of business.</p><p>While few of her rivals have gone that far, several are focusing on the issue. Sen. Amy Klobuchar is calling for stronger enforcement of antitrust laws \\x97 regulations to promote competition within industries \\x97 and proposing a \u201cdata tax,\u201d with tech companies having to pay up when they profit from large amounts of user data. The funds would go to new cybersecurity efforts.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had massive data breaches and people\u2019s identities stolen, and [tech companies] can no longer, with credibility, say, \\x91Hey, we don\u2019t need any rules of the road,\u2019\u201d the Minnesota senator told reporters during a recent visit to San Francisco.</p><p>Candidates like U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former housing secretary Julian Castro and U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard have also voiced support for increased use</p><p>of antitrust rules. Even U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, a Stanford grad with close Silicon Valley ties who once co-founded a video startup, has tough words for big tech firms.</p><p>\u201cThey are profiting off of our private data in ways that I think violate our basic, fundamental freedoms and rights,\u201d Booker declared at a town hall event in Washington last week, saying he wanted to get back to the days when \u201cwe used to do a lot better job of enforcing antitrust laws and broke up big companies during my childhood.\u201d</p><p>Notably, Sen. Kamala Harris \\x97 who represents many of the tech titans \\x97 hasn\u2019t said where she stands on breaking up the companies or using antitrust laws more aggressively, although she has had tough questions for executives in several Senate hearings.</p><p>As they campaign in the Bay Area in advance of California\u2019s March 2020 primary, all of the candidates will likely be pressured to articulate specific positions on the topic.</p><p>Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat whose district includes the headquarters of Apple and other big tech firms, said he hoped to see candidates embrace more nuanced perspectives. In an interview, he proposed stronger regulations preventing companies from using their platforms to unfairly advantage their products while not actually splitting the firms up \\x97 Amazon could still sell Amazon-branded batteries on its own site, just not put them at the top of every search result for \u201cbatteries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we have to have a scalpel, not a sledgehammer approach,\u201d said Khanna, one of the national co-chairs for Sanders\u2019 campaign. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have the only big tech companies being in China, with Alibaba and Baidu and Tencent \\x97 the focus should not be breaking something up just because it\u2019s big.\u201d</p><p>The drumbeat of tech scandals has emboldened the candidates\u2019 rhetoric. Trump\u2019s victory \\x97 and the role Facebook and other social media companies played as a conduit for Russian interference in the 2016 election \\x97 marked a turning point for how Democrats viewed big tech.</p><p>\u201cThe Democratic Party saw the tech executives as magicians,\u201d said Matt Stoller, a fellow at the liberal Open Markets Institute and a supporter of Warren\u2019s plan, \u201cbut it turns out they were just marketers.\u201d</p><p>Some executives have shown a willingness to accept moderate new regulations in the wake of the controversies. In a recent Washington Post op-ed, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg called for \u201ca more active role for governments and regulators\u201d in setting rules for the internet on issues like election integrity and data privacy.</p><p>Other Silicon Valley leaders are pushing back more forcefully. \u201cIt is in vogue right now to attack tech, and some of that is deserved and a whole lot of it is not,\u201d said Carl Guardino, the president and CEO of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, a business coalition that includes big tech companies. \u201cIf the reward for success is the destruction of a company determined through a political process and not the marketplace, what message does that send to future entrepreneurs?\u201d</p><p>Even as they bash the tech giants, the candidates are still coming to Silicon Valley to raise money in the affluent and heavily Democratic region. Harris, Booker, Klobuchar, Castro and others have held private fundraisers in San Francisco or the valley in recent weeks. (Notably, Warren has sworn off big-dollar, closed-door fundraisers completely.)</p><p>Local observers said that the tech community hadn\u2019t coalesced around supporting any one candidate, with Harris, Booker, former Vice President Joe Biden and former congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke among the most common choices.</p><p>The candidates are also making wide use of the big tech firms\u2019 services in getting their messages to voters and building their campaign infrastructure. Ads on Facebook and Google, as well as YouTube and Instagram, which are owned by the two giants, have become a key tool for campaigns to reach new voters, expand their email lists and solicit donations.</p><p>In the first three months of 2019, the Democratic presidential candidates spent $3.7 million on Facebook ads and $1.6 million on Google ads, according to an analysis by the political firm Bully Pulpit Interactive. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s reelection campaign and its joint fundraising committee with the Republican National Committee spent $3.8 million on Facebook and $2.4 million on Google over the same period.</p><p>In one ironic moment, Warren put up a flurry of advertisements on Facebook last month touting her plan to slice and dice the company. The tech giant took several of the ads down, citing a policy against using its logo, before reversing itself \u201cin the interest of allowing robust debate.\u201d</p><p>Warren quickly blasted a fundraising email to her supporters.</p><p>\u201cIf you want proof of Elizabeth\u2019s point that Facebook has too much power,\u201d her campaign wrote, \u201clook no further than their ability to shut down a debate over ... whether Facebook has too much power.\u201d</p><p>No presidential race in modern history has seen this kind of focus on tech firms, observers say, and it\u2019s only likely to be a sign of things to come.</p><p>\u201cIn every election from now to the end of my life and your life,\u201d Westly predicted, \u201ctechnology will be an increasingly big part of the debate.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>POLITICS</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>SAN JOSE, Calif. \\x97 In a sharp turnaround from past elections, the country\u2019s largest tech firms have emerged as some of the biggest boogeymen of the 2020 Democratic primary, with candidates vowing to crack down on or even break up companies that the party\u2019s past White House hopefuls once pointed to as icons of American ingenuity.</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>From beefed-up antitrust enforcement to data-privacy guarantees and new tech-focused taxes, the candidates\u2019 proposals are aimed at holding giants like Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon to account amid increased scrutiny of their actions and impacts on society.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRVJNL-32086529</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRVJNL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VWF-PBK1-JBKX-944K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">146817</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1400\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Providence Publications, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Providence Journal</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 14, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The single most important reason is that these \"fresh faces\" can bring new energy to the somewhat old-fashioned stock markets in the country.</p><p>While many see Shenzhen, the birthplace of tech firms like Tencent, Huawei and DJI, as China's Silicon Valley, and consider the city's ChiNext as \"China's Nasdaq\", it must be pointed out that in the last decade or so, most of China's best tech firms had opted for listing in the US, except Tencent (which chose to list in Hong Kong). As for those listed in Shenzhen, even though there are some good companies like Hikvision Digital Technology and BGI Genomics, the majority are not in good shape, while also being overpriced.</p><p>I had repeatedly pointed out in previous articles that stock markets in China and Hong Kong have a relatively low equity risk premium (ERP), which is a major component used in stock valuation. The past ten years saw an ERP of negative 11 percent for Shanghai A-Share Stock Price Index, and about zero percent for Hong Kong stock index. In comparison, the S&amp;P500 recorded a favorable equity risk premium of about 6.7 percent.</p><p>With a low or even negative ERP, investors would not be interested in participating in the market. That may explain why most of the Chinese capitalists are flocking to the \"unicorns\" in the country, investing in the primary market, rather in the secondary (open) market.</p><p>In the project-based, primary market investments, there are quite a few bright examples of multi-bagger returns, such as Alibaba, Tencent, and even Xiaomi (Xiaomi founder Lei Jun claims the firm's early investors reaped an amazing return of more than 800 times.)</p><p>That said, there are lots of untold failures in this kind of risk-intensive, low-liquidity investment. The return figures in China's primary market investment are not easy to find. As a comparison, among the investments made by VCs in the Silicon Valley, only one out of ten cases can exit through successful IPOs, about two or three cases would make an exit via a trade sale, while the remaining probably would incur a loss.</p><p>That is the reason why non-professional investors in the US rarely invest in a single VC project, they would invest in VC funds with diversified investments, and the investment ratio will generally not exceed 10 percent of all their equity investments, which accounts for 60 percent of the wealth of the high-net-worth individuals in the US.</p><p>Valuation is another major issue for investing in Chinese \"unicorns.\" Take Xiaomi as an example, whose market valuation was cut by almost half from the US$100 billion touted last year. We should note that the smartphone maker was still losing money last year, and its IPO price of HK$17 a share translates to a forecast price-earnings ratio of over 50 times in 2019, while Apple, the world's most valuable company, is trading at about 16 times trailing earnings.</p><p>Xiaomi categorizes itself as an \"internet firm\", However, sales of low-margin hardware account for 90 percent of the firm's revenue. In contrast, Apple earned over 15 percent of its revenue from software and services.</p><p>While some believe Xiaomi's dominance in India can help it grow into larger valuation, one should bear in mind that the consumption power in the Indian smartphone market is still relatively small,\u00a0and the average smartphone price in the Indian market is much lower than that of China.</p><p>In addition, though Xiaomi's business may not be as sensitive as that of telecoms equipment suppliers ZTE and Huawei, it is still a matter of concern amid the China-US trade and tech fight.</p><p>\"Unicorn\", referring to non-listed businesses valued at more than a billion dollars, was a term coined by Aileen Lee, a venture capitalist in the US back in 2013. At that time, unicorns were truly rare, with only 39 of them worldwide (all located in the US). But to date, the total number of unicorn companies has surged to about 300, with about 164 of them located in China and 132 in the US.</p><p>Some see a unicorn bubble as the companies may be getting overvalued by VCs or investors. If that is true in the US, we should brace for an even bigger bubble among Chinese unicorns.</p><p>This year, tech unicorns that headed to IPOs in the US, like Dropbox and Spotify, delivered a strong performance, as was the case with some Chinese unicorns listed in there, entities such as Bilibili, and Huya.</p><p>But among those that were listed in Hong Kong in the recent past, several firms, including Ping An Good Doctor, Razer, and Yixin Group, have seen their shares fall way below their offering prices.</p><p>Why are the big tech listings in Hong Kong faring much worse than those in the US? There are three possible reasons.</p><p>Firstly, in the past two years, the performance of Nasdaq index in the US has been far better than the Hong Kong key stock index. Secondly, investors in the US market have a better understanding and acceptance of new-economy firms. Thirdly, it may be that the valuations of Hong Kong tech listings have been more aggressive than those in the US.</p><p>And it should be noted that the mentioned tech listings are examples before Hong Kong's new weighted voting rights structure became\u00a0effective. Now, under the new listing regime, Hong Kong market is hungrier than ever before, willing to try every single way and even lowering the barrier in an attempt to lure tech unicorns to the city's bourse; earnings requirements for listing exist in name only.</p><p>In the second half of the year, there are nearly 90 companies queuing for IPOs, such as Chinese live-streaming platform Inke, the mainland's largest real estate agency E-House China, food delivery and internet giant Meituan Dianping, and biotech companies like Ascletis Pharma and Innovent Biologics. These companies filed for Hong Kong IPOs with aggressive valuations, reports suggest.</p><p>I support the idea of good companies coming to Hong Kong and China's A-share market for listing. But I am of the view that that the Hong Kong market does not have to give up the listing standards it deserves, let alone its responsibility of protecting investors.</p><p>On the enterprise side, I think companies and startups should not be too short-sighted on the valuation strategy. An over-priced IPO would eventually jeopardize the firm's long-term gains.\u00a0</p><p>The full article appeared in the Hong Kong Economic Journal on July 10</p><p>Translation by Ben Ng</p><p>[Chinese version \u4e2d\u6587\u7248]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HKEJIT-1887499</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HKEJIT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SSC-74W1-DXM8-X1MY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402685</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1324\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 EJ Insight of Hong Kong Economic Journal Co., Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>EJ Insight</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5530\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 11, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009STT</classCode><className>UNITED CO RUSAL LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>RUSAL (PAR)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>0486 (HKSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>CHINA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>HONGKONG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>TAIWAN</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Securities Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>Stock Exchanges</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0ZDMDg5MEQ3OTlGNEJCMkI0M0EyM0MwN0E1Njk1MEQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDBGREFBMDgyNTQ0NERFRUI3MEUwNDBFOTM5NDExREI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000919</classCode><className>INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N523210MM</classCode><className>STOCK EXCHANGES</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0ZDMDg5MEQ3OTlGNEJCMkI0M0EyM0MwN0E1Njk1MEQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDBGREFBMDgyNTQ0NERFRUI3MEUwNDBFOTM5NDExREI</classCode><className>Stock Exchanges</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001631</classCode><className>STOCK INDEXES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001500</classCode><className>RISK MANAGEMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N926150GC</classCode><className>BANKING &amp;

A company can transfer a certain amount of its shares to an intermediary, for example a bank, who then notifies the depositary bank abroad to issue depositary receipts for the stock on the local market.<br/> Allowing Xiaomi to sell CDRs could open the floodgates for more deals from so-called \"red chips\", overseas-incorporated Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong. China Mobile and others expressed interest in an A-share listing when Shanghai planned to launch an international board a decade ago.<br/> China's top legislative body could also decide to grant a one-off approval allowing Xiaomi to sell A-shares under its current structure.<br/> \"To list at home, Xiaomi will need the blessings from all related regulators, and it's challenging,\" said one of the people.\"<br/> Xiaomi declined to comment.<br/> TECHNOLOGY CONTEST<br/> Xiaomi has picked CLSA, a subsidiary of China's Citic Securities, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley as joint sponsors for its proposed IPO, other people close to the deal told IFR earlier. It is widely expected to float in Hong Kong, but has yet to decide on the timing or venue.<br/> A high-profile mainland listing, even alongside an international offering, would be a landmark for China's stock market at a time when global exchanges are vying to attract fast-growing technology issuers.<br/>  China has been stepping up its pursuit of major technology listings in recent months.<br/>  Foxconn Industrial Internet, the mainland unit of Taiwan's Foxconn, received unusually swift attention from the CSRC after applying for a Shanghai IPO on February 1 to fund investments totalling some Rmb27bn (US$4.3bn). Slightly over a week after the IPO application was filed, the regulator had responded with a long list of questions.<br/>  The CSRC has also given special treatment to another big tech company - Chinese security software maker Qihoo 360 Technology. The CSRC approved Qihoo's relisting last month, clearing the way for the first backdoor listing of a formerly overseas-listed Chinese company since May 2016.<br/>  The company, which delisted from the New York Stock Exchange in 2016, began trading on the Shanghai Stock Exchange as 360 Security Technology on Wednesday.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-n10408205</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RT9-2011-DYDW-74BR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"584\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 5, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009QBX</classCode><className>MORGAN STANLEY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>GS (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>MS (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Even as the Communist Party has kept an iron grip on politics and discourse, the country's technology industry has grown to rival Silicon Valley's in sophistication and ambition. <person><nameText>President Xi Jinping's </nameText></person>tilt toward strongman rule could put all that to the test. As Mr. Xi starts his second term, the Chinese government, which once viewed the internet primarily as a threat to its stranglehold on information, is harnessing big tech companies' capital and knowledge to realize its broader goals for the country. At a time when the <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>is moving to counter China's tech prowess, Beijing's heavier hand could pose its own threat to the country's competitiveness, and to the innovation that has transformed Chinese firms into global heavyweights. For China's government, WeChat, the country's most popular messaging and social media service, has become a key tool for policing what people say and do. </p><p>Political activists have reported being followed based on WeChat conversations; chat records have turned up as evidence in court. The e-commerce titan Alibaba, meanwhile, is helping city authorities manage traffic. The police have used technology from WeChat's parent company, Tencent, to monitor crowds at public events. JD.com, Alibaba's main rival in online shopping, is helping China's military to upgrade its procurement and logistics systems, state media reported recently. (A JD.com spokesman said, however, that its military cooperation was limited to the procurement of goods available to all customers on its site.) In scientific research \u2014 a focus for Mr. Xi as economic growth becomes harder to sustain \u2014 tech giants have joined with government institutes to run labs in fields like quantum computing, deep learning and human-computer interaction. Soon, Chinese citizens may even be able to use their accounts on Tencent's and Alibaba's apps as digital versions of their national ID cards. American tech firms also do business with governments, of course. And they, too, are sometimes asked to hand over user data to law enforcement agencies. <person><nameText>President Xi Jinping's </nameText></person>government is harnessing Chinese tech companies' capital and knowledge to realize its goals for the country. Alibaba, the e-commerce giant, is helping cities like Hangzhou manage traffic. China Stringer Network, via Reuters But in the United States, disagreements can be hammered out in court. China's judiciary is controlled by the Communist Party. Making themselves useful to the government is often the price that Chinese firms must pay for regulatory and financial blessings \u2014 even for the very right to exist as a business. \"If you see the situation clearly and are able to move in sync with the state, you will get great support,\" Wang Xiaochuan, chief executive of the internet search company Sogou, said in a recent interview with Phoenix Satellite Television. \"But if it's in your nature to say, 'I want freedom, I want to sing a tune different from the state's,' then you might suffer, more so than in the past.\" Phoenix subsequently removed that portion of the interview from its website. A Sogou spokesman declined to comment. Chinese tech companies have found a variety of ways of moving in sync with Beijing. Last year, they injected money into a struggling state telecom carrier, precisely the kind of company they had long sought to disrupt. Regulators picked Tencent and Ant Financial, an Alibaba corporate sibling, to build credit-scoring databases, though their role in those efforts has since been curtailed. Still, their systems and data would be key, analysts say, for China's ambitions to build a broader \"social credit\" system that would track people's financial activities, police records and other public behavior. Until recently, Tencent's website said its cloud services helped the Communist Party \"standardize and streamline party-building work.\" But that page was removed after The New York Times asked Tencent about it. The original web address now points to a page that describes how Tencent can help local governments manage data. \"He's scared the absolute bejesus out of everyone, which doesn't normally work in tech,\" said Ryan Manuel, a fellow at the University of Hong Kong, referring to Mr. Xi, who has been more willing than past leaders to purge officials and arrest high-profile businessmen. \"That fear is the antithesis of creativity.\" For many years, as Chinese companies became major players in online services, telecom gear, drones and more, the government neither boosted them nor meddled much in their operations. Now, though, as Beijing aims to make China a world technology leader, it is trying to steer private companies more directly, particularly in research and development. Pony Ma, left, Tencent's chief executive, and Jeff Bezos of Amazon with Mr. Xi in Redmond, Wash., in 2015. Mr. Ma is one of a growing number of Chinese tech leaders who have joined the country's rubber-stamp Parliament. Ted S. Warren, via Associated Press The government's \"Made in China 2025\" plan, which seeks to upgrade national capabilities in electric cars, robotics, semiconductors and other advanced industries, is a big factor behind the spiraling trade tensions with the United States. In areas such as supercomputers, satellite navigation and drones, Mr. Xi has pushed Chinese companies to work alongside the military to chase breakthroughs. At a speech last month in Beijing, Mr. Xi said that the internet and information technology represented the \"most dynamic and promising area for civil-military integration,\" according to the state news agency Xinhua. China's internet titans have already been roped into the government's plans to lead in artificial intelligence. Alibaba was designated, in November, as the national champion for developing \"smart city\" infrastructure. Tencent was picked to fill that role in medical imaging; the search giant Baidu is to lead for self-driving cars. A fourth company, iFlyTek, was named to spearhead voice recognition. Divvying up an industry before it has matured risks stifling competition, though. And shoehorning companies into specific activities could discourage them from exploring others. \"Having the state define and pick winners and losers is not how long-term sustainable innovation really happens,\" said Tai Ming Cheung, a professor at the University of California, San Diego, who studies technological development in China. Countries that have tried it, from the Soviet Union to Japan, \"haven't really fared well over the long run,\" Mr. Cheung said. China's record is mixed. In the 1960s and '70s, Mao's \"two bombs, one satellite\" program helped the government develop a nuclear bomb, a ballistic missile and its first satellite. More recently, state guidance has helped Chinese companies gain ground in high-speed rail and renewable power. In other fields, including flat-panel displays and cars, the country's industrial policy has flopped repeatedly. For China's tech giants, working with Beijing has become more important for another reason: Mr. Xi has tightened China's controls on the internet, and moved with remarkable force against companies that step out of line. Sina Weibo, a service that resembles Twitter, lost some of its appeal as a raucous forum amid a coordinated crackdown early in Mr. Xi's tenure on what regulators called rumor-mongering. Last month, regulators clamped down on Bytedance, one of China's most successful start-ups, shutting down its humor app and ordering it to clean up \"vulgar\" content on several of its other apps. As a result, tech potentates are trying harder than ever to keep the leadership happy. On the third floor of a gleaming Tencent high-rise in Shenzhen, the Communist Party makes its presence within the company literal. A chart on the wall shows how many employees are party members (more than 8,000 this year). Another display lists the monthly schedule for employees' party education. (This month's offering: training sessions on \"New Era, New Thought, New Journey.\") Tencent's mascot, a jaunty winking penguin, appears throughout with a hammer and sickle on its chest. Growing numbers of tech industry leaders have also joined the National People's Congress, China's rubber-stamp Parliament, and the People's Political Consultative Conference, an advisory group. In December, Jack Ma, Alibaba's executive chairman, announced that the company had started a $1.5 billion poverty relief fund. At a news conference before this year's legislative session, Pony Ma, Tencent's chief executive and a returning member of the congress, offered suggestions for improving schools and health care. \"The general secretary's remarks were very sophisticated and contained a lot of information,\" Pony Ma said after discussing innovation with Mr. Xi, according to state media, using one of Mr. Xi's official titles. \"I filled a full six pages with notes.\" Mr. Ma continued: \"This is a new opportunity for the rapid development of our innovative companies.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRFWK-625ed61f1a68e6e35fcd156c87f93525407e1270</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRFWK2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S7M-DHT1-JBCN-40JT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">387629</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1517\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 GateHouse Media, Inc.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

It's Deane Dray. We're starting the next presentation. We're delighted to have Xylem presenting next. We have Patrick Decker, President and CEO; and Matt Latino, Head of Investor Relations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Just as a point, don't try to adjust your screen. This is an audio-only presentation. And in the virtual world, everyone is interested in where people are connecting from.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So good afternoon, Patrick. Thanks for participating, and where are you joining us from today?</p><p>PATRICK K. DECKER, PRESIDENT, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, XYLEM INC.: Yes, absolutely. I'm -- so I'm in my home in Old Greenwich, Connecticut, so about 20 minutes from our office in Rye Brook. And I pop in now periodically, but we are still in the pandemic environment, at least in Rye Brook. But yes, I'm based in Connecticut. Just not too far from you.</p><p>DEANE MICHAEL DRAY: Yes, sir. And Matt, how about yourself?</p><p>MATTHEW LATINO, DIRECTOR OF IR, XYLEM INC.: Yes, same. I'm over here actually in Westchester County over in White Plains, not too far from the office in the other direction, but also going virtual. Yes.</p><p>DEANE MICHAEL DRAY: Good to hear.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>DEANE MICHAEL DRAY: So let's start. And Patrick, can you take us kind of a tour through your key end markets today? Since the second quarter, how things are holding up within the COVID world? You can talk about verticals, you can talk macro, just kind of the state of the company and your businesses.</p><p>PATRICK K. DECKER: Yes, happy to, Deane. So again, Deane, it would be remiss if I didn't thank you and RBC for organizing all this. We really appreciate the interest and support from all the investors that are on the line.</p><p>First, I -- let me begin by reaffirming our guidance for the third quarter. I'm really proud of our team. They continue to execute both commercially and operationally in what is obviously a very challenging environment given the pandemic. We do continue to see positive trends in sales and orders as we expected when we gave our last update in July, in our Q2 earnings. We would view April as the low point of this whole pandemic environment. And then we've seen improvement month-to-month since then.</p><p>We don't think that we're completely back to normal or without challenges from the pandemic at this stage, but things are very, very encouraging right now. In terms of end markets, just give me a couple of minutes here. We continue to see resilience in utilities, which is our largest end market. It's about 50% of our total revenue. That's the case, most notably, in wastewater. We benefit there from our strong installed base. And we provide, as we say, mission-critical applications serving utilities, predominantly on the OpEx side, which is about 2/3 of their spending around the world.</p><p>On the clean water side, we've seen some delays. I'd say modest delays in deployment of projects and replacement of meters and that really is due to things shifting from left to right around government restrictions, mainly driven by access to homes and availability of the utilities workforce. And so those are things that we simply see moving from left to right.</p><p>We are seeing orders to improve modestly as we do expect activity to start to resume in the second half of this year. There have been really no meaningful cancellations in projects. And we've actually won a couple of large deals over the last few months, that being England in the U.K. and Winston-Salem in North Carolina, as utilities do continue to see the economic value of our solutions.</p><p>Industrial, heavily impacted in Q2, down mid-teens, but activity has begun to resume. And as you've seen from some of the recent economic reports around industrial production, we're very encouraged by the market modestly improving through the balance of the year. Commercial, which really is about 10% of our revenue, is likely going to remain challenged for some time. But we are seeing our exposure resilient. We're focused more on the institutional side of things.</p><p>And I think similar to other companies that your investors may have listen to recently, we are seeing some positive signs there, probably a little bit more than we had thought. But again, too early to call that one. On the cost side, we do continue to expect about $70 million in structural cost actions this year and another $80 million next year. And that's going to put us in an even better position to improve our margin profile going forward.</p><p>And I'm really proud of the team in terms of what they've done in a few fronts. One, we quickly moved beyond, Deane, thinking about temporary actions. I really do not want to have a dagger hanging over people's heads, wondering kind of what's temporary, what's permanent. We move quickly to permanent to get people clarity. Two, I'm really proud of what the team's done on cash conversion. Really strong performance through the first half of the year, and we expect that can continue in the second half. And it really is driven predominantly by working capital efficiency. And the team is really focusing on that.</p><p>And then lastly, Deane, before I hand it back to you, really, really proud of what the commercial teams and finance team have done on solidifying our financing position in this environment. We came out with another green bond, which is ESG metric backed, kind of a stage setter for itself. But we couldn't get that really attractive financing to really give ourselves strong balance sheet, really strong capital deployment opportunities on the M&amp;A side if it wasn't for the commitment that our teams have around the globe around [ESG]. It's a real deal. It's not talk. We've been doing it for a long time, and I'm really, really proud of the team.</p><p>DEANE MICHAEL DRAY: That's a fabulous point to end on because that's a great opportunity.</p><p>I want to throw this to Matt. I guess you all know this, but I want to make sure the investors are aware that the #1 industrial stock owned by passive and active ESG investors is Xylem. So Matt, from your perspective -- look, you have to do a lot in order to just -- to be eligible for the ESG investors. And there's so much you have to do to be eligible to be able to issue a green bond. So you guys have done all of that. So just give us an update in terms of what else can Xylem be doing along the ESG side to make sure you stay the favorite among the ESG investors.</p><p>MATTHEW LATINO: Yes. Yes. No, thanks, Deane. I mean -- I think this is -- it's a personal passion of mine, but I think that's shared amongst a lot of my colleagues and certainly amongst Patrick and the rest of the leadership team as well. With -- when you're -- you set the bar fairly high, when we have high metrics, it's a lot to live up to, right? And you got to continue to keep trying to move that bar forward. And I think that we've tried to do that here over the last few years. I think it's not enough to just be playing in the space and be doing what we do.</p><p>While that is all great on its own, I think that we really tried to up the bar a little bit here for ourselves, particularly when we laid out our sustainable goal, the updated sustainability goals for 2025 last year. And so really starting to pivot from operations focus, kind of core ESG sustainability goals that a lot of companies set that are within your control, now thinking about what is your impact on customers, on the environment, on your own people. And thinking more broadly about that was something that we were trying to be thoughtful about, what we took there in terms of that approach. And then setting pretty ambitious goals to go and deliver those.</p><p>I think that, that really -- for a lot of our investors, that really resonated very strongly because that was a big step in the space. And I think that's something we're going to hold ourselves accountable for and something that we're excited about. As the business does better -- I think that's one of the really exciting things about this is as the business does better, we will deliver on our sustainability goals as well, right? They're tied. They're one and the same. And that's just something that as we've evolved this strategy, it's become more intertwined than ever before.</p><p>DEANE MICHAEL DRAY: Great to hear.</p><p>PATRICK K. DECKER: And Deane, it's one of my top -- it's one of my top 3 or 4 goals with the Board. So it's part of my compensation and what I get measured on every year. And that's the Sustainalytics rating.</p><p>DEANE MICHAEL DRAY: Good. Well, congrats on that, keep up the good work. And obviously, it's getting recognized.</p><p>PATRICK K. DECKER: Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>DEANE MICHAEL DRAY: All right. Patrick, if there is one question that I have and a bunch of investors have, and that is what the circumstances were in the middle of this COVID situation. There's an expectation that the water utilities are going to begin to embrace more of these smart water systems, more remote monitoring. Anything to avoid their -- sending their employees out unnecessarily if they can monitor a situation, a water quality, a leak, reservoir quality, so forth. Is -- and sometimes it takes a crisis to accelerate the adoption. Are you seeing any of that traction so far?</p><p>PATRICK K. DECKER: Yes. I mean we're definitely seeing an uptick from what I would say, Deane, is what utilities consider to be nice to have to need to have. It's the number of conversations I've had with CEOs. I'd say one of the few silver linings of the pandemic is the ability and frequency of Zoom or whatever platform video conversations with water utilities. And they're also all staying very plugged in on what each other are doing. And we definitely have seen a rapidly growing pipeline and digital adoption, where that manifests itself.</p><p>The 2 big issues that utilities are facing right now, which is, again, about 50% of our revenue. I do want to keep in perspective for the investors on the call that what really is in play here, as you well know, is predominantly the CapEx side versus OpEx. So OpEx represents about 2/3 or more of our total revenue and the spinning of utilities. And that's very resilient [during] crisis, when you look back over time. It really is the CapEx kind of greenfield items that are a little bit more variable.</p><p>And in the U.S., which -- people tend to focus more on our U.S. utility exposure. We're talking 8%, so less than 10%, 8% of our total revenue is U.S. utility CapEx exposure, which is really what kind of [lasts] around a bit during these crisis. On that front, it really has moved from nice to have to need to have. And the big issue is affordability, as you know, Deane. And so as utilities are thinking about going back and looking at their own rate cases with their regulators and committees approving their rate cases, they are looking for more affordable ways to deal with either aging infrastructure or building greenfield.</p><p>And that's where a number of our technologies come into play in helping them design those things in a much more affordable way, whether it be storm water, whether it be, again, nonrevenue water, improving their own revenues in that area. That's where we play. And we're definitely seeing an uptick there. I do want to keep it in perspective, Deane, that in absolute terms, we're still coming off of a relatively small base as a starting point. I mean we're helping make a market here. So it may not move the needle in 2021, it may be '22 and beyond before you see something that really moves the needle. But what I'm encouraged by is the trend line and the bidding activity that we see there.</p><p>So as you've all heard, coming -- through this pandemic and coming out, it's really not so much about new trends. It's about trends that were already there that are accelerating. And digital adoption is absolutely one of them, Deane. I mean no doubt about that.</p><p>DEANE MICHAEL DRAY: That's exactly what we're looking for. And for me, when you say doesn't necessarily move the needle, I don't think that's what investors are looking for as much as they want to see the orders, and they want to see the embracing of the technology. Because from our perspective, it looks compelling, but I understand completely that the water utilities move at a glacial pace, pun intended. And it really just -- you just need that tipping point, and maybe COVID is one of -- is a catalyst.</p><p>PATRICK K. DECKER: That's correct. One of -- so part of it is affordability. And the other is -- I think we oftentimes forget the fact that while we all are, for the most part, working remotely -- I mean some of us are traveling, I get all that. But the utilities are also dealing with the whole remote workforce aspect. So they also are looking at monitoring their assets remotely, using digital there. So it plays across different spectrums.</p><p>DEANE MICHAEL DRAY: Yes. Exactly. All right. I want to get back into some of the P&amp;L discussion. The forecast for the third quarter decrementals, potential at 45%, if I've got that correct. But that also includes some of the expense on employee support payments, which you all have done instantly and immediately to support your folks in a really troubled time. Is that still the right goal? And is there anything about mix that could change that?</p><p>PATRICK K. DECKER: Yes. So that is the number for Q3. And again, we're taking a very balanced view on that within the quarter. If you read through the quarter, it's important that we look at some impacts we had last year. We had a 90% incremental last year, which was some of the census, some of the metrology project revenue recognition. We had some tariff rebates in Applied Water and some other one-off items.</p><p>So if you kind of pull all that aside, our decremental would really be in that kind of mid- to high 30% range, which is more consistent with what we've seen historically. We've had the realization of cost savings from the actions that we began to take back in Q2. Those are going to come in through Q3. And they're really going to ramp up in Q4 and into '21, and those, really, are around business simplification.</p><p>And Matt, if you're on the line, you can certainly provide a little bit more color on that.</p><p>There is some employee support, Deane, that continues into Q3. It's a few million bucks, so $0.01 or $0.02 there. The majority of that commitment that we did around employee support, about $20 million to $25 million was really in Q2, which, again, was kind of the low point as we were taking care of our people there. Our margin expansion sequentially from Q2 to Q3 is about 200 basis points, and that's really being driven by the cost actions that we took as a result of the pandemic.</p><p>And then the last piece is mix. We still see some softness in dewatering, although things are trending a little bit more positive there. And our North America business in Sensus, from the metrology piece, which is really high margin.</p><p>So those are kind of the puts and takes from year-over-year and quarter sequential. But we feel good about what we laid out in Q3. Obviously, we haven't given guidance for the full year or next year yet. We'll talk about that in our upcoming earnings call. But things are trending pretty well right now.</p><p>DEANE MICHAEL DRAY: Good to hear. On -- in the second quarter, there was a positive preannouncement, which was a welcomed event because there had been a number of quarters where there was either disappointing guidance or shortfalls in margins. But how much of the second quarter is kind of the establish of a new trend? What has changed fundamentally in terms of like the cost out, the cost structure? I just -- everyone said, is this a turning point? And I want to know how relevant that might be.</p><p>PATRICK K. DECKER: Yes. I think -- look, I -- we feel that we are giving very balanced guidance. We're being prudent around that. I would say coming out of Q2, there were a couple of things going on. One, given our global exposure, Deane, where, again, we were really following the virus. I mean we truly are a global organization, especially given our Emerging Markets exposure. And we learned a lot from that. So we felt it prudent to be conservative in [Q2]. We also were coming off of a year where we had -- taking down guidance. And I don't want to revisit that neighborhood anytime soon.</p><p>So we were prudent and balanced. I would say in Q3 and going forward, we're going to continue to be balanced and prudent in that regard. I would say that I'm very proud of the team in terms of getting at the cost actions early. We opted to not go too much temporary and really focus on what was permanent to give our teams clarity. Temporary actions are necessary at times, furloughs, et cetera. But I think people, what they really want is clarity, and so we try to provide that to them.</p><p>On the demand side, the supply chain, we are back up to prepandemic capacity levels. We've also learned a lot of things, so we've become even more efficient in that regard. I think it's become a competitive advantage for us, especially on the service side relative to some competitors. In terms of how we're thinking philosophically, we'll have more to say about that in the upcoming earnings call. But I'm really -- just really proud of what the team has done here. And net-net, we feel good about where we're going from here.</p><p>DEANE MICHAEL DRAY: Good. Talk about the CFO transition and what does Sandy bring to the table.</p><p>PATRICK K. DECKER: Yes. So Mark's going to be around through the end of the year, which is making a very smooth transition for Sandy coming on board. Sandy actually worked with Mark in a former life. And so she's well-known by Mark and myself. And she's already begun to transition in with ourselves and board meetings and operational reviews coming up. So even though she's not officially started, she's going to hit the ground running.</p><p>I want to take the opportunity -- not that anybody is looking for this, and I'm sure Mark's not, as I'm sure he's listening. Mark's just been outstanding. I mean I just -- I hate to see him move on, although we all want to go do other things. And he's delivered incredible value over the time he's been here. He's going to -- he's totally behind Sandy. So he's here to make sure she makes a really strong transition.</p><p>She's got a really strong operational finance pedigree, given her background. We'll -- on the upcoming earnings call, we'll do a true profile of Sandy. But she also brings a big tech background. Coming in from Harman and what they've done in the auto space. I mean most of us think about Harman as being the audio company, but they did a lot of moves there with her and Dinesh in moving into automotive and transforming that space.</p><p>She sets us up well for where we're heading around the whole connected digital solutions piece in the water space. And so really excited for her to start next month. October 1 is her first day. And again, while we're sad to see Mark go, we're really, really excited about what she brings to the table and can't wait to get her on the team.</p><p>DEANE MICHAEL DRAY: That's fabulous. And not all companies are able to orchestrate in time and signal the CFO transitions as smoothly as you guys have done. Too often, we see the sudden kind of announcement that so and so is leaving and there's a search and you end up having more questions than you do have answers. And that's far, far, far from the case here. So congrats on that.</p><p>And we'll have plenty of opportunity for a tearjerker goodbye for Mark as he has done a fabulous job, and it's been a pleasure for us to work with him and the upgrades of how the financials have been communicated and the precision and so forth. It's been great to see. So -- but we'll have opportunity that send-off.</p><p>For the time we have remaining, I'd love to hear a bit more about M&amp;A. What's fascinated me is you all have done a kind of an interesting angle -- other than Sensus, which has been a terrific technology reach into smart meters but also on the communication side. But when you've bought so many of these small start-ups that it's basically a proxy for R&amp;D, and it has put you in a, like, leadership position in the smart water offerings. Is there more that you can do there?</p><p>PATRICK K. DECKER: Yes. No, it's a great point you make, Deane. I -- again, I definitely -- we definitely view M&amp;A -- well, let me step back and say, what I'm really proud of the team, especially during the pandemic but even before that -- and I want to go back for a moment to ESG because what Mark and the finance team and our commercial teams have been able to do, along with legal support and elsewhere, is to just even further strengthen our capital deployment position through being able to issue green bonds that are tied to ESG metrics. I mean, again, this is not us just talking fluff. I mean these are real, hard-core metrics that I'm held accountable for and the team is. We've got financing now tied to that, which is really attractive.</p><p>And so we didn't do that necessarily for M&amp;A, but we did that to kind of replace some of the financing we have expiring next year in some bonds. But the point is we're in a really great spot from a balance sheet and capital deployment position. So I just want to give that shout-out to the teams. But in terms of M&amp;A, absolutely, we're in a great spot. I would say that activity has ramped up a bit in terms of conversations. I'm not foreshadowing anything. But I think where things were very much kind of dry and stuck 6 months ago coming into the pandemic, time heals all that in terms of people beginning to get a view of what valuations kind of looked like. So we'll see what that looks like over the course of 2021.</p><p>In terms of priorities, we look at it by vertical, so end market. So utilities, you're right. We continue to have some opportunities out there in the pipeline to add smaller bolt-ons that are really a proxy for R&amp;D. Somebody already owns the IP. And therefore, you have to license it or go acquire it. So we've got a list of those opportunities that we'll continue to kind of peck away at. They're not going to move the needle in terms of capital deployed, but they will in terms of adding to the digital portfolio.</p><p>Things of larger size and scale, we've got a few of those in the pipeline. We continue to stay close to them. Some of those are stand-alone, some of those are built into larger strategics and we stay close to those. And as you know, it takes two to tango. So we'll see how those play out, but we certainly are in a capital position to do some things there. And that really is tied probably more to the industrial side of the equation where, right now, we've got some gaps in terms of channel, maybe product offering, technology offering, but it's an attractive space to be in.</p><p>So hopefully, over the course of the next year or more, there will be more to talk about there. But again, we're in a great spot right now to be able to execute those when the opportunities present themselves.</p><p>DEANE MICHAEL DRAY: That's great to hear. And it looks like we've got just 2 more minutes.</p><p>Patrick, when you were rattling off some of the recent wins, the Anglian win, to us, was important because there was a digital component to it. And maybe if you could expand on that. We're always interested when a municipality takes on either the digital part of smart meters. But what can you tell us? Because in developed market, water utility, big profile taking some digital service offerings and product offerings. What did they take? And what's the significance?</p><p>PATRICK K. DECKER: Yes. Thanks, Deane, for that question because I think that, oftentimes, because of the way we've positioned and explained things, the synergy around digital use of data, kind of smart networks, can come in 2 directions. One, there is the consultative offering that we bring, vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis what we now have branded Xylem Vue, V-U-E, which is where we use digital to help a utility better understand where should they invest their next dollar of OpEx or CapEx to get the best return. And that is a new, growing digital offering that we are doing both in our own, but also with some of our engineering consulting firm partners.</p><p>But there's also the other side, which is where we already have relationships where we might be selling a metrology deal or a treatment offering or a submersible wastewater offering. And what we're looking to build here, Deane, and we've seen early successes of this, is helping our teams understand how do they upsell with those utilities and other customers to say, hey, we're providing this today, but there's all these other things that we can do.</p><p>And a good example of that is we've had some of these opportunities around the world where it might have started off with maybe being a $5 million, $6 million kind of opportunity and it turns into a $50 million, 5-0 opportunity, because our teams are upselling the portfolio. But it -- really, Deane, to your point, it comes down to what problems are the utilities trying to solve. And in the case of the U.K. is one example, but it's not limited there. It really is around water losses, nonrevenue water, storm water overflow, energy efficiency within the treatment plant or the pumping stations. So it really is exciting to see the utilities taking a broader, smarter approach to how they're thinking about their capital allocation.</p><p>DEANE MICHAEL DRAY: That's great to hear. And Patrick, you know and I know we could be talking all afternoon about these opportunities, but we are time constrained today. Thank you for participating. Thank you for doing all the investor calls. I appreciate all your insights.</p><p>Matt, thank you for orchestrating all this. Best of luck to you.</p><p>I will declare the Xylem presentation to a close. And thank you all for participating.</p><p>PATRICK K.

Among the Act's provisions is a change in the date when daylight-saving time (DST) takes effect, from the first Sunday in April to the second Sunday in March. The idea is that the additional daylight hours (DST also will end in November instead of October) will enable consumers and businesses to use less energy (a more appealing and less-politically sensitive tactic to encourage energy conservation than something like a gasoline tax, but that's a topic for a different editorial).</p><p>But of course, it isn't that simple. Time will tell whether or not extending DST actually cuts energy consumption. But because of the need to \"manually\" change computers' internal clocks, the move clearly is going to increase aggravation for IT organizations. As it turns out, IT groups will need to update and apply patches to everything from infrastructure and networks to handheld devices, and from databases to applications that process time-sensitive transactions and/or support scheduling and sequencing tasks (not to mention having to remind employees who might end up late for work or business appointments to update cell phones, PDAs and anything else that runs on embedded technology). Financial services IT executives probably have been having flashbacks to the Y2K scare, reliving their concerns, preparations and expenditures for the risks of systems disruption that the year 2000 was expected to bring. For better or for worse, we may never know if the fact that chaos did not ensue on Jan. 1, 2000, meant that the massive reprogramming efforts paid off - or if it was all a big, tedious waste of effort.</p><p>We were still two weeks away from DST's March 11 start date as this column was written - too early to know how much havoc, if any, might be wreaked by the change. Although the big tech companies have provided patches and disseminated information about necessary upgrade steps, there still will be at least some DST-related distractions for IT organizations. It's yet another example of how the burden of new regulation sometimes weighs most heavily on IT - the folks who must \"spring forward\" to make sure their firms don't \"fall back\" in terms of compliance.</p><p>Katherine Burger, Editorial Director <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:kburger@cmp.com\">kburger@cmp.com</email></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.insurancetech.com\">http://www.insurancetech.com</url></p><p>Copyright  2007 CMP Media LLC.

Many critics have called for a revival of stricter antitrust enforcement, more assertive antitrust authorities, and a general rebalancing of economic power. These new policy proposals challenge long-standing assumptions in antitrust and competition law and may also threaten existing business models.</p><p>To this end, the Information Society Project (ISP) and the Thurman Arnold Project (TAP@Yale) will host a conference at Yale Law School, \"Big Tech &amp; Antitrust: Competition Policy in the Digital Age,\" on March 28-29, 2020.</p><p>The conference will bring together experts from different disciplines to explore the role of antitrust and competition law in the future of the digital economy. The conference aims:</p><p>* to advance regulatory theory in the area of antitrust and competition law;</p><p>* to develop scholarship about the kinds of harms antitrust and competition law need to address in the digital age;</p><p>* to respond to student interest in and requests for law and technology programming, especially at the intersection of Big Tech, privacy, innovation, and inequality.</p><p>This conference will explore the role of antitrust and competition law in shaping the future of the digital economy. It will also discuss what kinds of harms antitrust law needs to address in the digital age and how they can be specified and measured. It seeks to consider the relationship between antitrust law and broader concerns -- including privacy, innovation, and inequality. Finally, the conference will consider policy recommendations, including changes in the interpretation of antitrust laws and doctrines, enforcement practices, and the institutional organization of agencies. Discussions will span all academic disciplines, focusing on the following topics:</p><p>* Fundamental Questions of Antitrust and Competition Policy</p><p>* Market Structure</p><p>* Market Power</p><p>* Harm</p><p>* Enforcement Actions</p><p>* Mergers</p><p>* Institutional Design</p><p>The Information Society Project (ISP) is an intellectual center at Yale Law School, founded in 1997 by Professor Jack Balkin. The ISP explores issues at the intersection of law, technology, and society. It supports an international community of interdisciplinary scholars work to illuminate the complex relationships between law, technology, and society. The ISP produces scholarship, convenes legal experts, and hosts events to foster the cross-pollination of ideas and spark new collaborations.</p><p>The Thurman Arnold Project (TAP@Yale) launched in fall 2019 in response to the growing interest in competition enforcement by scholars, students, and the general public. The project is named in honor of Thurman Arnold, Yale Law Professor and head of the Antitrust Division from 1938-43, to capture the intellectual and enforcement tradition he represented, as well as his zeal for achieving competitive markets for the people of the United States. The project was founded by Professor Fiona Scott Morton, an economist at the School of Management, and is designed to bring together Yale scholars and students who are interested in antitrust to engage with one another and create rigorous antitrust research and policy, disseminate it, and enable links to enforcement and regulatory policy.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7022223 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7022223</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y6W-WNM1-DYG2-R036-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"574\"/><timeReceived>7:52 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 15, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

On walks to the supermarket or pharmacy I was passed by streams of cyclists in the trademark yellow uniform of Yandex's food delivery service. On the road, the few vehicles aside from police cars or buses were the taxis-disinfected at newly opened stations-of Yandex's ride-hailing company.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Often referred to in the West as Russia's Google, Yandex is really more like Google, Amazon, Uber, and maybe a few other companies combined. Russians query Alice, the company's virtual assistant, to help them order goods online in Yandex Market. They use its email system, listen to its music player, and visit its movie-recommending website. Over coffee, they read the morning news on the Yandex News aggregator. They send each other money through Yandex Wallet. And they find their way via Yandex Navigator, a tool analogous to Google Maps. Arkady Volozh, CEO and cofounder of the Nasdaq-traded company, has described it not simply as part of Russia's Silicon Valley, but as a Russian Silicon Valley unto itself.</p><p>New services appear at breakneck speed. Around Moscow, Yandex is testing a fleet of over 100 driverless cars, work that even the coronavirus was unable to pause. Yandex Lavka (\"Yandex Shop\"), a grocery delivery app that launched in June last year, guarantees deliveries within 15 minutes, faster than anything Amazon offers. One of the brains behind the project, Ilya Krasilshchik, 33, remembers how, during Russia's turbulent transition to a market economy in the early 1990s, his mother returned from a trip with a bucket of cocoa powder just in case the family wouldn't be able to get it at home. Now, decades later, Muscovites have excess at their fingertips: Lavka's most popular item in the summer of 2019 was quartered watermelon-delivered cold, of course.</p><p>On a snowy afternoon in late February, just before the pandemic gripped Russia, I turned off of a busy Moscow street into a quiet courtyard. I was meeting Rostislav Meshchersky, the 28-year-old manager of one of Lavka's so-called \"dark stores,\" the places where the products ordered online are discreetly warehoused for distribution. Meshchersky led me to an open garage door at the back of the courtyard, which led down into a basement lined with shelves filled with everything from pasta to fruit juice to toilet paper. \"I joke with my friends that I know immediately where to go in Moscow in the event of the apocalypse,\" he said.</p><p>Just weeks later, it wasn't such a joke. In April, Lavka received some 900,000 orders from Russians stuck at home under quarantine, while customers of Yandex's overall food services-restaurant delivery included-more than doubled. Although the company took a hit in businesses like ride-sharing when its entire fleet was taken off the streets during Russia's lockdown, the people stuck at home boosted traffic on the company's search and streaming video platforms.</p><p>But Yandex's success has come at a price. The Kremlin has long viewed the internet as a battlefield in its escalating tensions with the West and has become increasingly concerned that a company like Yandex, with the heaps of data it has on Russian citizens, could one day fall into foreign hands.</p><p>This means running a tech giant in Russia is a delicate dance. On the one hand is the Kremlin; on the other is New York, with investors' demands that the company maintain its independence. But in a pandemic-stricken world increasingly concerned with protecting borders and regulating the tech industry, Yandex's dilemma may not be just a Russian story.</p><p>A GOLDEN ARRANGEMENT</p><p>Yandex-short for \"yet another indexer\"-didn't always have its fingers in everything. After getting its start in 1997, the company for years vied for local search-engine supremacy with Rambler, another Russian company.</p><p>In the end, Rambler became the Yahoo to Yandex's Google. But Google itself soon entered the market, and while Yandex had an edge by rooting its search algorithm in the particulars of the Russian language, its California rival began to catch up. \"About half a year before Google went public, it made an offer to buy Yandex, and I have to say that we were looking at that offer very seriously,\" Leonid Boguslavsky, one of the company's first investors, told me.</p><p>The offer was made in 2003. But one of Yandex's cofounders, Ilya Segalovich, said, \"Let's fight,\" Boguslavsky recalled. Though Segalovich died in 2013 after a bout with stomach cancer, the fight continues to this day: while Google has periodically overtaken Yandex, the Russian firm currently has about 59% of Russian search traffic to Google's 39%.</p><p>The same year Segalovich died, Yandex hired Greg Abovsky, a Ukraine-born, Harvard Business School-educated hedge fund analyst who got his start with Morgan Stanley in New York. \"We had a realization right around the time I got here that search is going to slow down at some point,\" says Abovsky, who now serves as both CFO and COO. When he joined, advertising from search accounted for around 99% of the company's revenue. Today it's about 64%, and total revenue grew from $1.2 billion in 2013 to $2.8 billion in 2019.</p><p>But as Yandex developed into the dominant player in the Russian tech market, it also inevitably came under the watchful eye of the authorities.</p><p>One of the first moments was in August 2008, when Russia fought a five-day war with neighboring Georgia. As the conflict played out, Yandex News featured Russianlanguage articles covering both sides of the divide. The next month, according to journalists Andrei Soldatov and Irina Borogan in their book The Red Web, two Kremlin officials visited Yandex's headquarters. One was Vladislav Surkov, the deputy chief of Russia's presidential administration-the man who coined the Orwellian term \"sovereign democracy\" to describe a Russian system of governance that brooks no foreign meddling in its affairs.</p><p>Lev Gershenzon, the director of Yandex News at the time, was given the task of explaining to the official visitors how the service worked. According to the book, he recalled showing screenshots of articles that the aggregator's algorithm had selected as top stories. Surkov interrupted. \"This is our enemy,\" he said, pointing to a liberal outlet. \"That's what we do not need!\"</p><p>The company promised from then on to maintain an open line to the Kremlin, though Gershenzon said he would always reiterate that an algorithm, not a person, chose the top news. Still, he didn't always agree with how the line of communication was maintained.</p><p>\"Volozh and I went to the presidential administration building several times and I said to him, 'Listen, you have such a powerful business- why do you go to them? If it's really needed, let them come to you,'\" Gershenzon recalled in Holy War, a documentary miniseries about the Russian-language internet. \"Even a geek like me knew that if you bend over for them they'll never let you bend back upright again.\"</p><p>That same year, Yandex fought off a potential takeover by Kremlinlinked oligarch Alisher Usmanov, who lobbied for President Dmitry Medvedev's support on national security grounds. In 2009, to satisfy government interests, Yandex handed Russia's largest lender, the state-owned Sberbank, a so-called golden share, which allowed the bank to veto transactions involving more than a quarter of Yandex's stock. For a decade that arrangement appeased the Russian authorities- until it no longer did.</p><p>THE TIGHTROPE WALK</p><p>Last May, Russia passed a law to create a so-called \"sovereign internet,\" a state-owned communications infrastructure that would allow the country to cut itself off from the global internet while remaining online in a bubble of Russian-owned services. The law requires internet service providers to install equipment provided by the government for counteracting broadly defined \"threats\" to the internet's stability and integrity, and gives the authorities sweeping powers to take control of the network if such threats appear. Over tea at his offices one afternoon last winter, Igor Ashmanov, who was the director of Yandex's rival Rambler for a time in the early aughts and now is a proponent of the sovereign internet on state television and in government hearings, laid out its purpose.</p><p>\"Imagine you live in a small village near a city that provides your electricity, and the mayor of the city has said that you are his enemies and that if he can harm you, he will,\" Ashmanov told me. \"You might decide to buy a generator to make sure your electricity keeps running in case this crazy mayor turns off the switch. This is what the sovereign internet is about.\"</p><p>Perhaps more important to the Kremlin, the sovereign internet would also give Russia more control over what its own citizens can see online. In 2011 the Arab Spring, buoyed by social media, swept across the Middle East. That December, after Vladimir Putin announced he would run for president once again following an interim stint as prime minister, mass protests-planned on Facebook-rocked Russia. In the wake of the demonstrations, the Kremlin began to see foreign tech companies as tools used by other governments to meddle in its affairs. Putin himself vocalized those concerns at a press conference in 2014, when he described the internet as a \"CIA project\" and implied that Yandex itself had been \"pressured\" to include foreigners in its management and was registered overseas \"not only for tax purposes but for other reasons.\" (The parent company is incorporated in the Netherlands, and six of the 12 current board members are non-Russians, including John Boynton, the chairman, who is based in Massachusetts.)</p><p>That fear of foreign interference has only intensified over the years. During a government hearing on national security in 2018, Ashmanov described Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter as American weapons trained against Russia. \"What the Americans could do with a company like Yandex in their hands is something I don't even want to think about,\" Ashmanov told me.</p><p>As the ground shifted under its feet, Yandex struggled to keep its balance, according to Boynton, the board chairman. \"We've done everything we can to steer clear of politics,\" he said in a phone interview. And yet, he added, the company found that it was increasingly getting \"dragged into areas where we don't necessarily want to be.\"</p><p>Things came to a head on a Thursday morning in October 2018, when rumors leaked that Sberbank was in talks to buy up to a 30% stake in Yandex to protect the company from \"potential trouble.\" When trading opened up in New York, its shares plummeted 9.4%, losing over $1 billion in market value, over fears that the state lender could take control of the company. \"That was the moment when we realized that there was something bigger afoot,\" Boynton recalled.</p><p>The next day the company lost another $1 billion. At an emergency meeting that went into the early hours of Saturday, the Financial Times reported, Volozh decided not to pursue the Sberbank deal.</p><p>Yandex began talks with Putin's administration over a new governance structure, but the pressure on it continued to intensify. In June 2019, a little-known lawmaker, Anton Gorelkin, introduced a bill to limit foreign ownership in companies that the Russian government deemed \"significant information resources.\" Outside investors would be allowed to own only 20% of such companies-a severe blow to Yandex, which had 85% of its shares trading on US markets. When the Kremlin came out in support of Gorelkin's law a few months later, fears in New York wiped another $1.5 billion off Yandex's valuation in a single day.</p><p>In November last year, after 13 months of grueling negotiations, Yandex announced a solution. It would hand over Sberbank's golden share-that veto power over major transactions-to a newly formed \"public interest foundation\" with close government ties. The veto would also be beefed up to include deals and transactions relating to intellectual property or the transfer of Russian users' data. Although the new foundation would have 11 seats on its board, only three would belong to Yandex; the rest would be divided up among influential business groups and state-affiliated universities. Perhaps most important from the Kremlin's perspective, the new foundation would be able to block Yandex from entering into agreements with any foreign government.</p><p>That seemed to take the heat off. Gorelkin said he would take his law back to the drawing board. Days later, the Russian parliament passed a law requiring Russian tech to be automatically preloaded onto devices sold in Russia, a move that analysts calculated would boost Yandex's valuation by $1.4 billion. A few weeks after that, Putin, who had criticized Yandex's foreign ties a few years earlier, praised its projects with foreign partners and spoke positively of a closed-door meeting with its senior management.</p><p>Yet even if the Kremlin seems to have been appeased, not everyone is. Power in Russia's government is split between rival groups, with Putin mediating between them. For the constituency known as the siloviki-officials with ties to law enforcement-the Yandex foundation was seen as a half-victory, says Tatiana Stanovaya, the founder of a political analysis site, R.Politik. \"On the one hand, they see that Yandex is indirectly beholden to the government,\" she says. \"On the other hand, it's purely technical. Yandex won't just fulfill any and all demands. And if the confrontation with the West keeps escalating, [the authorities] may rethink this arrangement.\"</p><p>When I spoke with Boynton last winter after the dust had settled, he was in a buoyant mood. But he also noted that things could quickly change again. \"In Russia,\" he said, \"nothing is guaranteed.\"</p><p>A TEMPLATE FOR BIG TECH?</p><p>If the siloviki see Yandex as an unreliable collaborator, liberal critics see increasing signs that it is in the pocket of the authorities. In late February, for example, a policeman accused of planting drugs on an investigative reporter said he had found the journalist's address by asking Yandex Taxi to provide it. Yandex responded that it always yields to requests by security services to \"help save lives,\" though Roskomsvoboda, an anti-censorship group, pointed out that it is not always legally required to do so.</p><p>As the pandemic grew, questions about the company's independence became only more pointed. In early April, news surfaced that Moscow authorities were considering surveilling foreign tourists via their cellphone data once borders opened back up again-and that Yandex might develop the tool. The company denied the claim.</p><p>Then, when critical comments from opposition activists began popping up next to government buildings in Yandex Navigator, as a sort of digital alternative to street protests, Yandex deleted the messages, saying they were off-topic. Finally, one evening in late April, some internet users noticed that searches on Yandex for opposition leader Alexei Navalny were returning mostly negative content. Yandex apologized, saying that it was an \"experiment\" shown only to a small number of users. One Russian commentator, Alexander Plushev, noted that such testing is common on all tech platforms, but he added: \"Any incident with Yandex is now interpreted through the prism of its control by the authorities.\"</p><p>If Yandex capitulates too much to state control, it risks losing its most prized asset: its talent. \"I always say that my main competitors are [Moscow airports] Sheremetyevo and Domodedovo,\" says Misha Bilenko, who heads Yandex's Machine Intelligence and Research division.</p><p>Bilenko himself spent 23 years in the United States, including a decade at Microsoft, before returning to Russia several years ago. What drew him back, he says, was the access to so many different resources within Yandex and the opportunity to help improve the lives of Russians en masse. But as one employee who asked to speak anonymously told me, Yandex would lose that type of draw and power if the government tried too hard to tame it. \"We have a lot of progressive people here,\" the person said. \"If we don't like what we see, we'll leave.\"</p><p>Today Yandex, at least publicly, is claiming that all is well. Its concessions to the Kremlin could have been much bigger. They're also ones that others may soon consider. \"What Yandex has done isn't only relevant within the context of Putin's Russia,\" Bloomberg columnist Leonid Bershidsky argued last year. \"It could be seen as a template for Big Tech.\"</p><p>Like Yandex, Bershidsky continued, companies such as Google or Facebook could set up quasiautonomous governance structures with the right to veto certain decisions. \"If such a structure can win approval even from an authoritarian regime such as the Russian one ... it could probably satisfy most Big Tech critics in democracies, too,\" he wrote.</p><p>Indeed, in May of this year Facebook named the first members of its \"oversight board\" as a response to anger over its opaque content moderation process. The body is stacked with legal and human rights luminaries who can review and overturn some of the platform's decisions. Though the board has nothing like the power of Yandex's public interest foundation, it was a big concession from a company that has always fiercely defended its control over what goes on its platform.</p><p>With politicians on both ends of the US political spectrum calling for increasing regulation of Big Tech, such moves are likely to keep happening. The kind of flexibility Yandex has had to learn may prove essential for companies that want to not only survive but flourish.</p><p>Evan Gershkovich is a reporter for the Moscow Times.

A little walk through Memory Lane shows how even on the propaganda front, Silicon Valley is relying on old wine in new bottles. By Yasha Levine[1],the author ofSurveillance Valley: The Secret Military History of the Internet[2]. Originally published at Substack What a Western Electric advert from 1944 can teach us about Google and Facebook I was in the New York Public Library recently doing research in the archives when I stumbled on a 1944 pamphlet[3] from Western Electric, the old American techno-telephone monopolist. It's called 'Circuits for Victory' and its 40 glossy, slickly produced pages are dedicated to one thing: celebrating all the ways that the company's telecommunication technology helps the United States government fight and win wars. The pamphlet is a historical document, but if you squint at it right and replace 'Western Electric' with, say, 'Facebook' or 'Google' or 'Amazon,' you actually get an accurate sense of what Silicon Valley monopolies are today: privatized extensions of American Empire. Since the dot com boom, Silicon Valley has been selling itself to the world as a new breed of global corporation \u2014neutral platforms that sit on top of the world, unconcerned with and totally removed from American geopolitical and national security interests. The public believed it. Even Silicon Valley people believed it. It was the dawn of a new depoliticized corporate internationalism. It was all about a utopian technological revolution that would connect and empower people, regardless of their nationality or language. Indeed, Silicon Valley was supposed to make 'the nation' obsolete. Of course, this was always a transparent sham. And perhaps the one positive thing that's come out of RussiaGate \u2014 and the ridiculous mainstream belief that Russia attacked American democracy with Internet memes \u2014is that no one believes this Silicon Valley global utopianism anymore. RussiaGate forced Silicon Valley to publicly admit something that I've been saying for years \u2014something that is at the core of the thesis of my book,[4] Surveillance Valley[5]: American Internet companies are not abstract global platforms, but privatized instruments of American geopolitical power. It's out in the open now. Even Google CEO Sundar Pichai admits it \u2014and Donald Trump blasts it out to the world:These days, the industry's corporate utopian internationalism is being gradually replaced with something much closer to the politics that have always been in the background: a politics of patriotism and militarism. And our political and media class is right along with them, and driving this change: Democrats, Republican, diplomats, intelligence officials, journalists, and thinktankers[6] of all types are now in full agreement: the Internet is a dangerous weapon that needs to be restricted. It is too dangerous to not be regulated under a National Security regime. Not that long ago, Senator Dianne Feinstein berated attorneys from Google, Facebook and Twitter[7] for allowing 'the Russian' to turn the Internet into an anti-American weapon: 'What we're talking about is a cataclysmic change. What we'retalking about is a major foreign power with the sophistication andability to involvethemselves in a presidential election You bear this responsibility.You've created these platformsand you have to be the ones to do something about it.' And she followed up with a threat: either Silicon Valley finds a solution voluntarily, or the government will. Or, as Fred Kaplan \u2014Slate's national security man \u2014put it[8]: 'Openness allows the free exchange of ideas and expression of dissent but also leaves the system, and everyone in it, prey to criminals, terrorists, and, in this case, foreign spies and propagandists: all of them shrouded in anonymity It may be time to impose some regulations on this system.' Censoring the Internet because it's too free and doesn't protect us from 'the Russians' \u2014this is the acceptable elite opinion in American politics today. And Silicon Valley has done exactly that. On top of racking up military contracts[9], they've started opaquely self-regulating and policing their platforms like the geopolitical tools that they are. They've increased cooperation with intelligence agencies and are now partnering with all sorts of shady national security thinktanks and outfits \u2014including New Knowledge, Atlantic Council[10], and the German Marshall Fund. They censoring and 'moderating' their platforms[11] in defense of American 'national security' \u2014which, in today's political reality, means going after 'the Russians' and silencing voices that oppose America's corporate and military power. That includes American anti-fascist groups:So that's where we are today. It's pretty clear that the way things are trending, it won't be long until Facebook and Google start putting out public relation materials filled more and more with the proud militarism on display in Western Electric's 'Circuits of Victory.' And they should. It would be the honest thing to do.Today, in the full tide of victory, men and women of Western Electric are engaged in their greatest job\u2014producing the communications weapons of war, the radios, radar, the switchboards, telephones and cable that help our fighting men win battles, help save American lives and help maintain the vital home front communication network. This book tells you something of what we of Western Electric have contributed toward victory in this war. \u2014Western Electric's President, Clarance G. Still.Check it out: 'Communications \u2014 One of the Foremost Military Tools'Replace 'COMMUNICATIONS' with 'THE INTERNET' \u2014and you basically get Google, Amazon and Facebook. 'The Telephone \u2014Basic Communications Weapon of War'When I interviewed former ARPA Director Stephen J. Lukasik, who oversaw the build-out of the ARPANET in the 1970s, he explained to me the meaning of a military command and control system: 'Command means you will do what I say. Control means don't do what I don't want you to do.' And you can't do either of those without a telephone! Now, you can't do any of that without the Internet. 'How Military Communications Works'This is actually all about radio and telephone communication, but it might as well be a chart of the secure Internet that the Pentagon uses today to link up into a single fighting force. Looking at this chart, you could see why the military began to develop digital networks not long after WWII and why the Internet was ultimately built and deployed. How else you gonna run a complex modern fighting force? 'Cable \u2014Heavy-duty Word Carriers of War'Today, it's Internet backbones and satellites. 'Switchboards \u2014Nerve Centers for War Messages'This is what a pre-Internet router looked like. Two shirtless recruits punching cables. 'Radio \u2014 In the Air On Land At Sea'A hint at why the U.S. is fighting China on 5G tech deployment.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2019/04/yasha-levine-silicon-valley-and-communication-weapons-of-war.html?utm_source=feedburner..._medium=feed..._campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#\">https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2019/04/yasha-levine-silicon-valley-and-communication-weapons-of-war.html?utm_source=feedburner..._medium=feed..._campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#</url> This entry was posted in Banana republic[12], Guest Post[13], Media watch[14], Surveillance state[15], Technology and innovation[16] on April 2, 2019[17] by Yves Smith[18].

Altman says YC - which has backed Airbnb, Dropbox, Stripe and boasts of a portfolio of companies valued at $85 billion - has no doubt that India will support a number of important and huge tech startups in the long term.</p><p><br/> He spoke to TOI about why he's bullish on India, the ever-increasing power of big tech companies, regulation around cryptocurrency and his involvement in bridging the gap between Silicon Valley and the rest of America. Edited excerpts: YC's 2017 India intake numbers are the highest in any year. How's that happened?<br/> We have been going to India for the last few years. We've been fortunate enough to be an investor in a few of the successful companies in India. These founders talk to the startup community there about us. We see this in all the markets across the world: Once we can get the first few wins in a new geography, that perpetuates in the local community and then people say, 'Oh, we've heard of them, founders said they were great'<br/> Will you look at setting up an India outpost?<br/> Our goal is to take the 18 intakes in 2017 and keep increasing that number. We have no current plan to open an outpost, but I bet someday we would. That may be a few years off though.<br/> Why are you bullish on the Indian startup ecosystem amid uncertainties?<br/> I like to be bullish when everyone else is bearish. There are very few long-term investors, I think it is a big advantage for us that we are one. Most are chasing fashion or trying to make their LPs (limited partners) happy.<br/> So what's wrong with the tech investing class?<br/> It is not only about the way funds are structured but also about what they are expected to do that particular year. So if India is hot, they'd be in India. If India is cold, you don't want to be there. But we are excited and will happily make a lot of money in their absence.<br/> When we met in 2015, a slug of money was coming into India. It's been tougher for startups to raise capital since then...<br/> We try and not get caught up in what other investors do. The way I look at investing is that, on any given day, what the stock market or any other investor is doing is a random number generator. But over time it does converge to reality.<br/> We continue to believe that there is something real happening in India. Like any exciting new thing, there will be ups and downs, there will be bubbles and busts, but we try and take a very long-term view here and not get too distracted by the ups and downs.<br/> You told me during the heady days that you were not as much worried about the eye-popping valuations as you were about the cash-burn across startups. Is it looking different now?<br/> I don't know the current cash-burn situation at Indian startups. But in the US, in general, it feels okay. There are plenty that are burning too much and will die. But on the whole, the burn is relative to the cash on hand, it's reasonable.<br/> So, are we out of the bubble territory?<br/> Bubbles are an interesting phenomenon -for bubbles to happen, there has to be something real for people to get too excited about. So, smart people get tricked by bubbles, very famously Isaac Newton fell for the South Sea bubble.<br/> Similarly, in India, there was something real going on, people got too excited and then they stopped. It's likely they will get excited again and then stop again. What's important here is that, in the next 20 years, is India a country that supports huge and important technology startups? And the answer is definitely 'Yes'. So we will just ride the waves.<br/> In India, e-commerce and some other consumer internet sectors are still cash-guzzling. Fighting Amazon needs capital...<br/> Or, you don't have to fight them. There are plenty of other businesses to start where you don't have to burn $50 million per month. There are people who are experts in these businesses where you burn huge amounts of cash, and I'm not one of them. But there are many good companies that can be started that I understand, I just don't have instincts for e-commerce.<br/> You're betting on a bunch of financial tech startups in India. Why?<br/> Offering consumers much better financial service is clearly something that people will pay for. If you look at the largest companies in the world, they do financial services of some sort. The world is changing very fast, so I expect financial services to change equally fast - so those two things together excite me.<br/> Which companies are you picking from India from the YC batches as the ones becoming big?<br/> It takes 10 years to find that out, so I'll tell you after seven years. One of the things that has really surprised me about this business is that it takes really long to see results. We invested in Dropbox in 2007 -it is 2017 now and it's still a private company.<br/> Away from startup investing, you've been very vocal about tech and politics. Tell us why?<br/> One thing that's clear is how different the Bay Area and the rest of the country are - it's not a unique insight, but one that's extremely striking. So how do we make the tech industry benefit everyone? Politically, I think we need to get a bunch of new candidates.<br/> The approval ratings of the present government is really low and that of career politicians is even lower. My big effort is to find a lot of new candidates with new ideas and support these people because the world has changed so much with technology that we need a government that can act very differently with a different set of laws.<br/> You've also been supporting groups like Tech for Campaigns financially.Would you look to run for office or take up politics yourself?<br/> I expect to fund candidates and organisations but do not want to take an active role. It's a side gig for me, not my main job. However, I did an interesting thought experiment. In the 1900s, Henry Ford created Model T and, say, a million jobs came as a result of it and these employees had enough money to buy a car.<br/> In 2005, Facebook created 10,000 jobs, each of these became millionaires here. In 2010, WhatsApp created 36 jobs and was sold for $19 billion. I believe in 2017, there will be some startup that will create five jobs. You have this effect with technology - we are still building companies that are valuable, but it is concentrated into fewer and fewer jobs. This trend will keep going and our current politicians don't have any good ideas on how to remake the government structure.<br/> The fear is of jobs being taken away Al and ML?<br/> Of course, they are taking away jobs but they are making new ones. Another amazing statistics is that about every 70 years as much as 50% of jobs get eliminated and new jobs get created. So tech eliminating job has been going on for a long time. That doesn't scare me but it will create new and better jobs. This is just a cycle.<br/> YC launched its $700 million Continuity Fund, how's that rolled out and how's growth stage investing been?<br/> One of the most important things for me from the time I took over YC was funding different kinds of companies. I think that startups are such a powerful idea that they can be used for a very wide array of problems. I did not want to do only the software companies but I was also figuring how we could fund energy and cancer breakthroughs along with a whole lot.<br/> It was very unclear how it will go. Everyone thought it was silly. I usually don't get psyched out what other people think but in this case, so many smart people told me it was a bad idea that I was worried about. But the early signs are super promising. We have been able to fund really good companies in very different areas like nuclear fusion and 3D spaceships and anti-cancer companies. People say how much YC changed the early-stage investment ecosystem, I hope someday people says Continuity changed it as much in the later stage.<br/> Talking about late-stage investment, tell us what you think of SoftBank. How's it impacting tech investing?<br/> I expect it will change the dynamics of investing, but I don't know how yet!<br/> What's your take on what happened over at Uber?<br/> That is a mess of a situation and very complicated all around. I think, in general, this idea that there will be these very late-stage investors that will provide liquidity to earlier-stage investors is a good thing and it will happen.<br/> You haven't been a fan of going public. Anything's changed?<br/> I'm not a fan of going public before you're ready as you have the pressure to do these short-term optimisations that are bad. I definitely think you should go public at some point, just not until your business model is mature.<br/> When is a startup mature enough to go public? Is Airbnb good for an IPO?<br/> They could go public. I don't know when they want to but they are at a stage that if they wanted to, they would. They know what they are doing, they have a solid revenue stream. Of course, they will keep innovating, but they have a nice competitive moat built up.<br/> But it's not been too great for Snapchat and Blue Apron?<br/> I don't want to comment specifically but a lot of companies have gone public too early before they are ready. And then you have to report quarterly results, you get into the rhythm of being public company and their business models was still in a flux or had not quite figured how to constrain their market spending.<br/> How much of all this has to do with facing tech giant Amazon, Facebook and Google, is there a big overhang of big tech majors on startups?<br/> That is one of the new and interesting problems in the tech industry - you have these hyper caps that are so powerful. It won't last forever, the ecosystem would shift and new companies will emerge, but at the moment it is tough.<br/> That is something we think about at YC when we are inducting companies: Would this startup get crushed by Facebook? As a general rule, we like companies doing new things and not the ones with a derivative idea which Facebook can copy in one click. It's hard to build a business there. On the other hand, there are times when it's worked, like it did for Snapchat.<br/> But Facebook's got it right with their acquisitions...<br/> You could argue that Facebook has slipped up by letting WhatsApp, Instagram and Snapchat emerge. But on the other hand, you can say it's pretty impressive how right they have been about identifying the really big new social media platforms and buying them. At the time, everyone thought it was crazy. I remember when they were acquiring Instagram for $1 billion, everyone was shocked. But now it looks like the most brilliant move in the history of Facebook.<br/> What are your views on these powerful tech majors being regulated by Washington?<br/> I don't know exactly when Washington should regulate a company, it's a hard question. But at some point, it has to and that's why there are antitrust laws, it's for a reason. So I wouldn't pretend to be an expert on that. It's the job of the company to be as big and successful as it can and it's the job of the government to say, 'Oh, that's too much'.<br/> What about the Russia issue and the heat on Google, Facebook and Twitter?<br/> Who knows what happened but in general there would be more of that. The internet is going to be the central battleground for influencing hearts and minds and cybersecurity so we do regulation there.<br/> You've been talking about cryptocurrencies but have taken the middle ground? How far are we from regulating this space?<br/> Regulation is fundamentally about being in the middle ground, it's important where you draw the line. We should have more than what we have today.<br/> How's it going to help in wealth creation, you've said so?<br/> We haven't seen so many Initial coin Offerings (ICOs) which I'd say are great things to invest in. But I do believe over time there will be more interesting blockchain ideas that happen and one of the cool things is that anyone can buy into it. The bad news is that anyone can end up losing money.<br/> One thing that I worry about for example in the US, if you want to invest in startups, you have to be an accredited investor with $1 million in assets and some high salary. That cuts out a lot of people. As startups take longer and longer to go public, interest rates remain low and public markets see high valuations, it's just hard to make a lot of money until you already have a lot of money and I don't like that. So I like the idea that wealth creation activities can be made more broadly.<br/> You've invested personally?<br/> I've been investing in bitcoins for many years. Friends ask me if they should, I tell them if you are willing to buy it today and have it go down 80% in a few months then go ahead and buy it, that may happen at some point. The world is still figuring it out and it would be very volatile in the meantime.<br/> But is it here to stay or a flash in the pan?<br/> I think a lot of ICOs are flashes in the pan but something real will happen with the idea of decentralised ledger but it is very much possible that the long-term winning cryptocurrency is not been created. I also think it could be bitcoins. I only have bitcoins, I don't mess around with the other cryptos. I believe in network effects and I think the biggest one should win.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-n10250739</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PXS-WJ81-DYDW-72YB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2226\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 FFC Information Solution All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"11\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>November 8, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"/><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DIF8</classCode><className>BUSINESS INCUBATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001624</classCode><className>STARTUPS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST0008X09</classCode><className>LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDFEQjUyNDAyMzQ0NDQyNUE5RjNGOEZEMzNBRDA1RUY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjA4OEVGODBENzY4NDcxM0IyQzA1OTEwQzVDODRBOUE</classCode><className>Limited Partnerships</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DEW4</classCode><className>DIGITAL CURRENCY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DIF8</classCode><className>BUSINESS INCUBATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DN5F</classCode><className>ON DEMAND SERVICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DEW4</classCode><className>DIGITAL CURRENCY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>PE000DKQR</classCode><className>SAM ALTMAN</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000D25Y</classCode><className>SILICON VALLEY, CA, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GX142</classCode><className>NEW DELHI, INDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>GC304</classCode><className>INDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

If anything, it may grow worse as Corporate America faces greater scrutiny from empowered Congressional Democrats while contending with Trump administration trade policies that have disrupted supply chains and curbed profit.The White House's double-digit tariffs on nearly half of U.S. imports from China, levies on steel and aluminum shipments and uncertainty over the future of a key agreement between the U.S., Mexico and China are all dragging on global commerce. And even though manufacturers have already begun replacing Chinese supplies with purchases from countries like Vietnam, South Korea and Mexico, their expenses may still climb, according to Randy Frederick, vice president of trading at Charles Schwab &amp; Co. \u201cAs most of these countries have higher labor costs than China, those higher input costs must be absorbed by a combination of higher prices to the end consumer or lower profit margins \u2014 in most cases, both,\" he told the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Washington Examiner</emphasis>. \"Neither bodes well for earnings growth in 2019.\"The challenges are increasingly priced into U.S. stock markets, which ended 2018 with frenetic fluctuations despite record profits for many companies after a GOP-controlled Congress reduced the top corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent in late 2017. Experts predict earnings growth will dwindle this year as the effect of those cuts wanes.And with Democrats regaining control of the U.S. House of Representatives, drugmakers, big banks, tech giants and other sectors are bracing for not only more oversight but the risk of sweeping legislation that could crimp profits. </p><p>Big Pharma Drug companies appear unfazed so far by the Trump administration\u2019s attempts to lower treatment costs, but the stakes will rise in 2019 with Democrats in control of the House and several sweeping proposals from the administration poised to advance. Among other things, Democrats are seeking to target the patents that allow brand-name drugmakers to profit from blockbuster medications for a decade or longer. It's a fiercely protected part of the industry ecosystem, however, and alterations are unlikely to get the Republican buy-in necessary for passage.Most far-reaching is a bill from Sen. Elizabeth Warren \u2014 the Massachusetts Democrat who recently formed an exploratory committee for a 2020 presidential run \u2014 that would effectively turn the federal government into a generic drug manufacturer. \u201cNo private manufacturer will ever be able to compete with a product that is essentially subsidized in its entirety by the federal government,\u201d one drug lobbyist said. \u201cWhat an expensive, administratively complex, and utterly impractical solution.\u201d In addition to fending off unwanted policy shifts on Capitol Hill, the industry will also be fighting a proposal from the Trump administration to tie reimbursement rates for the sector\u2019s most lucrative medications to international pricing. Opponents argue such a system embraces socialist ideals, given that several countries impose price controls to keep treatment costs down. Big Tech In one of the most consequential years for social media firms in the past decade, 2018 set the stage for new regulations that may force the industry to reconsider how companies gather, utilize and protect user data.In the aftermath of Facebook\u2019s Cambridge Analytica scandal \u2014 in which a consultant linked to Trump's 2016 campaign improperly gained access to personal data of some 87 million users \u2014 Congress set its sights on consumer privacy protection, and companies like Twitter and Apple were caught in its cross-hairs, too. Crafting such a measure, however, has been an historically difficult task. And with a diverse coalition of stakeholders \u2014 many that have conflicting desires \u2014 the effort is expected to be one that fuels significant lobbying this year. Big Banks Large U.S. financial institutions just completed one of their best years ever as the GOP-led tax law fueled record profits, and many will benefit from rising interest rates, which they pass on more quickly to borrowers than depositors. The latest increase \u2014 in December \u2014 also heightened volatility in financial markets, which may benefit the trading desks of Wall Street firms.There are pitfalls ahead, however. Rates that remain relatively low overall may spur banks to extend riskier loans in order to grow, stoking fears that lenders will be caught flat-footed in the event of an economic downturn.Their leaders may have to address such concerns under the lights of a congressional hearing room: House Democrats, led by Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters of California, are expected to conduct more stringent oversight of the industry in 2019 than their GOP colleagues did while holding the majority.Wells Fargo, the third-largest U.S. lender, may face particular scrutiny. The San Francisco-based lender recently agreed to pay $575 million to settle claims from all 50 states that its lending practices harmed customers, the latest in a series of agreements after a 2016 deal with regulators over the creation of millions of unauthorized customer accounts.Congressional interest will likely remain heightened through 2020, with potential presidential campaigns by Democratic financial-industry critics like Warren and Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Sherrod Brown of Ohio. Detroit\u2019s \u201cBig Three\u201d Carmakers were on edge for much of the past year as the Trump administration irked Canada and Mexico with double-digit metals tariffs while forcing renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. While talks yielded a deal, the so-called U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement faces uncertain odds in Congress. And a potential move by the White House to fully withdraw from NAFTA \u2014 to force Democrats to approve the new pact or risk a future without any agreement \u2014 would upend complex supply chains that stretch across the three countries' borders.Equally as consequential, the U.S. and China are working on a broad deal to address a trade imbalance between the two nations and Beijing\u2019s theft of U.S. intellectual property. Should an agreement not be reached, the White House says it's prepared to impose new tariffs on $267 billion in Chinese products and more than double existing levies on $200 billion in shipments. Such an escalation would have dramatic consequences for U.S. carmakers who import many electrical components from China. Compounding concerns, manufacturers are already struggling to revamp operations to address shifting markets for automobiles. Ford Motor Co. previously announced it would lay off workers amid an $11 billion restructuring plan after profits plunged in the three months through June, and General Motors is facing federal pressure over its decision to shutter several North American plants and cut 15 percent of its workforce.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WASHEX-2164663014</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WASHEX2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V53-YT01-JBHT-D2BV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1150\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Clarity Media Group, Inc.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 3, 2019, the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Fortenberry) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. FORTENBERRY. Madam Speaker, there is a twofold goal being sought by many of us right now, and it is this: to keep the government fully open and to secure our border. No one wins in a government shutdown. No one wins if the border is not safe. </p><p>We ought to be able to rise above the momentary difficulty, whether it is a negotiation between the Senate and the House, the President and the House, the President and the Senate, and get to those mutually compatible goals of fully funding an operational government, as well as ensuring that Americans are safe and that we have the right type of assistance to our border personnel, the right type of barriers, the right type of technology, the right type of preventative measures to protect us all, and create the conditions in which America can have a truly just and humanitarian response to those in need. That is what is at issue this moment. With that said, Madam Speaker, though, I think it is important that, as we are at the beginning of a new Congress, as we were all sworn in last week, as this Chamber was filled with Members' children and Members' families coming from such extraordinarily diverse backgrounds, it was a celebratory atmosphere. It always tends to be that way, and then we get into the hard, hard work of governing. As President Kennedy once said, to govern is to choose wisely, and in a society divided by deep cultural and philosophical difficulties, that actually manifests itself here in the people's House. It is incumbent upon those of us who have been given this awesome responsibility to govern to undertake the awesome responsibility of deciding to govern well, to carry forth that spirit of the swearing in day with our families here, and that oath of office, where there is a common narrative around who we are as a people and where we should go as a Nation, reaching back to our most honored-in-time traditions and projecting them forward so America can have confidence that we have [[Page H350]] set up the guardrails for a successful culture, a successful economy, a successful society. That is our job. It is going to take difficult moments of prudential wrestling. It is my hope it will be done in a civil manner and that people will make their firm case and fight for those principles, but do so with an eye toward building consensus. We in Nebraska, I believe, invented the phrase ``get `er done.'' Just get `er done. Fight for what you believe and seek that which is possible. They are not mutually incompatible goals. That is our responsibility as legislators for the good, the well-being of the entire American public. With that said, Madam Speaker, I would like to do something a little bit unique. I would actually like to look back for a moment at the year in review and some important things that were accomplished. We tend to be caught in what I call the tyranny of the urgent, where what is right in front of us completely occupies us. Of course, we have a 24/7, 911 media that heightens all of this intensity. It is what it is. But the reality is, we did some pretty good things last year, last term, and I want to review a few of them. In December, the House and Senate passed a new farm bill with very strong bipartisan support. For a lot of Americans, it is very easy to overlook this accomplishment. Our grocery bills are some of the lowest in the world, our food is readily available, and our safety net for those who are vulnerable is well considered. It comes down to this: it is the vastness of our land and the quality of our soil and the gritty ingenuity of our farmers and ranchers who lay the foundation for America's prosperity, stability, and economic vitality. We tend to forget this because our food comes somewhat easy to us. The farm bill provides risk management tools to maximize this natural gift, allowing farmers and ranchers to provide food security for our country, our nutrition programs, as well as food assistance to millions of others around the world and protect those who are in very vulnerable circumstances. This bill also fosters conservation practices that enhance the protection of our soil and our wildlife habitat. I am pleased by the increase in the number of acres in the Conservation Reserve Program. The farm bill ensures that America continues to lead the world in agricultural innovation, food safety, and renewable fuels. In Nebraska, agriculture is central to our well-being, our way of life, and our culture. Our land-grant universities help ensure that we maintain our tremendous productivity. The farm bill is a once-in-every-5-year piece of legislation. The birth of such legislation is neither smooth nor easy, but we got it done. It is a good lesson for what we are facing now with new challenges ahead of us. We got it done in a very strong, bipartisan vote. For Nebraskans, and many people throughout rural America, the farm bill is not just another Washington accomplishment. Like the rhythms of planting and harvesting, it is an expected rite of legislative passage essential to who we are as a people, as Americans, and to our well- being. One of the things that I am excited about, Madam Speaker, is that beginning farmers and local food producers are big winners in our farm bill. I am very encouraged by the growing interest of young people in seeking agricultural opportunity. We are witnessing a food culture awakening, with local chefs, farmers markets, and a keen interest in eating local. The farm bill helps these next generation farmers and food entrepreneurs through new resources and training, such as the Local Agriculture Market Program, called LAMP, which accelerates the farm-to-fork movement across America, connecting local farmers with families, consumers, and restaurants. This offers a big, big opportunity for us all. I am also happy, Madam Speaker, that the farm bill includes my provisions to enhance the Farmer-to-Farmer Program. For over 30 years, the Farmer-to-Farmer Program has connected volunteer American farmers, agriculture extension experts, and others with deep knowledge of the agriculture industry with the world's farmers abroad. From dairy production to seed selection to entomology, irrigation, and crop yield determination improvement, as well as farm credit, this sharing of America's agricultural expertise dramatically enhances the capacity of people elsewhere to grow their own food, contributing to worldwide food security, community well-being, and human flourishing. Food security is the key. This year, we also passed the Global Food Security Reauthorization Act. I had worked on this important piece of legislation when it first passed. It amends the Global Security Act of 2016 to enable programs that support sustainable agriculture around the world and it extends assistance for international disaster relief and rehabilitation, especially for emergency food programs. Switching topics a bit, Madam Speaker, the fundamental duty that we all have here is to keep America safe. This requires a modern and properly equipped military. In recent years, our force structure has significantly deteriorated. Planes could not fly in certain circumstances and other equipment was not available. This past year in Congress, we passed the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act and the defense appropriations bill. Again, most of the government is open and functioning. We are working toward the rest. This helps rebuild our military after years of budget cuts. Our Active Duty, National Guard, and reserve force personnel will receive a 2.6 percent pay raise, the largest in 9 years. We are going to purchase new aircraft, tanks, ships, and other military hardware to replace and upgrade worn out equipment. These bills also increase across-the-board funding for additional personnel, training, maintenance, and operations to ensure that our military is always ready to defend our Nation. Madam Speaker, while a strong military is vital, America's safety and prosperity also depends upon a skillful mix of diplomacy and development. Building authentic relationships around the world and attacking the root causes of structural poverty are equally important goals that need to work in tandem with a properly sized and prepared military. A race toward technological superiority through ever-larger weapons systems will not unilaterally resolve our most difficult security challenges. The tech gap that we enjoy is closing, and will continue to close rapidly. Then, we have to ask ourselves: Then what? I often use the phrase ``foreign policy realism'' to guide how I believe the United States should engage in global affairs. It is this: strong defense, smart diplomacy, and sustainable development. These are the three pillars. Thanks to the dedication and courage of our troops and our diplomats and the exhaustive work of many others who serve from their heart in faraway places, we ought to be very grateful that our country has been kept safe from attack. There is always a however. However, real risks remain. Northern Iraq and Syria are places where ISIS and other dark forces could regenerate. Iran meddles and frustrates peace throughout the region. The United States' relationship with Saudi Arabia is under severe scrutiny in light of our intelligence findings that implicated the Saudi Crown Prince in the murder of an American-based Saudi journalist. We also face risks from various actors to increasingly powerful, yet more nimble and mobile nuclear capabilities. Madam Speaker, I lead the Nuclear Security Working Group in Congress. We had a very important dialogue with the administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration as we closed out the last Congress to discuss our coordination of nuclear nonproliferation activities. There are two core elements in preventing an attack. The first, of course, is deterrence. The second is threat reduction. Again, the dual work of our military and other government efforts in nuclear threat reduction has been successful in preventing nuclear and radiological terrorism. The challenge is to constantly reassess the changing threat environment. A single failure can lead to catastrophic consequences. These efforts must be matched with an equal effort to halt and reverse nuclear proliferation throughout the world. In a September conference, we gathered with national and nuclear security [[Page H351]] experts and former government officials across four administrations with the singular goal to improve U.S Government oversight and coordination of nuclear counter and nonproliferation efforts. As a result, I am going to propose the creation of a nuclear nonproliferation council to enable a unified U.S Government strategy on nuclear nonproliferation. In the National Defense Authorization Act, which we passed, there is a section also that perhaps has been overlooked, but it is important. It will speed the elimination of cesium chloride that can be used to make dirty bombs. This policy change that we were pleased to work on reduces the risk of a catastrophic radiological attack inside our borders. In the face of expanding Russian and Chinese nuclear arsenals, our defense bill modernizes our nuclear deterrence capability even as we hope to reestablish a more stable and peaceful world. Only through a combination of strength and an openness to dialogue can we avert a nuclear arms race. {time} 1745 Back in June, the first-ever meeting between leaders of the United States and North Korea took place. President Trump met face to face with Kim Jong-un in a preliminary step towards reconciliation and denuclearization. The summit that was held in Singapore was a first step to shift an escalating trajectory of missile launches and hostile rhetoric, reducing anxiety for the region, America, and the world. The summit took a new approach to a long standoff. For the first time, a U.S President reached out directly to a North Korean leader. The meeting would not have happened, though--and this is very important, Madam Speaker--without a unified global community willing to support the preconditions needed to encourage Kim Jong-un to meet. As an initial gesture of goodwill, North Korea returned the remains of U.S service personnel and destroyed at least one nuclear testing facility. Clearly, much more progress is needed, and a joint action plan will require North Korea to continue to earnestly engage in nonproliferation. I believe that congressional leadership should play a role here in policy developments that can help the administration reduce the nuclear threats on the Korean Peninsula. Now, Madam Speaker, where I live, Nebraska, plays a critical role in keeping America safe. Offutt Air Force Base and Strategic Command are essential to America's security, and the steady work of guiding budgets and building the necessary coalitions here in Congress resulted in dramatic improvements to both Strategic Command as well as Offutt. The new USSTRATCOM headquarters building is nearing completion. Its increased capability, beginning this summer, will add to the combatant command's charge as one of the Nation's most vital missions, and that is nuclear deterrence. A major repair of Offutt Air Force Base's runway will soon begin. Again, I am very pleased, working with the Nebraska delegation and our colleagues, to continue to advance the completion of the Strategic Command as well as the enhancement of Offutt Air Force Base. Offutt is home to the Air Force's 55th Wing. The wing conducts intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. This is very important, Madam Speaker, because, again, it is something that is overlooked in our tense times. One of the 55th Wing's important aircraft is the OC-135B. It flies in support of the 34-international-member Treaty on Open Skies, one of the last remaining functional arms control regimes that is operational between the United States and the Russian Federation. I am pleased that, working together, we were able to enhance funding for the OC-135B aircraft, again, vital to one of the last linkages of agreements with the Russians. Madam Speaker, I want to turn to another topic that really ought to be at the forefront of our discussions, but rarely is; if we are going to create a 21st century architecture for international stability, I believe it revolves around two words: human dignity. We traditionally think of diplomacy as between nation-states. Increasingly in our interconnected world, where people can reach people in faraway places in an instant or by travel in a very short period of time, it is this deeper transcendent idea that is still operational in our culture. It underlies our founding here in America. It is in our earliest documents. It is alluded to. This idea of human dignity, this sacred space of personhood from which the free exercise of conscience and right reason and other rights that we tend to take for granted, such as religious freedom, flow. Human dignity, the two words that mark the 21st century architecture for how we ought to conduct international affairs, reaching toward authentic relationships and dialogue with people with whom we may have had tremendous misunderstandings in the past, tremendous tensions, or even the grave consequences of war. Again, as I mentioned earlier, Madam Speaker, the tech gap is closing. We can beat anybody anywhere. We can do that and will continue to be able to do that. And, again, a strong military is absolutely essential to keeping the peace and creating the conditions for stability internationally, which protects us here at home. But what happens when, again, the miniaturization of technology is such that any bad actor or any bad nation has ready access to it; we have to ask ourselves: And then what? It is this idea of being in authentic dialogue around this fundamental principle that is operative in the way in which we conduct our affairs; human dignity, mutual respect for that sacred space of the person and their perspectives and their ability to use reason to think for what is good for themselves, their family, and their country. Human dignity. This is manifesting itself very clearly in something that, again, is really overlooked in our dialogue because we are caught in the urgency of the moment. Let me point this out, Madam Speaker. It is about the country of Iraq. America has given so much. We have lost so much in Iraq that it is hard to understand why engagement is ongoing and necessary. The thought of it is exhausting to the American people. It is exhausting to our process. But I need to point this out. Much is at stake. Iraq once had a mosaic and an ancient tapestry of religious pluralism that existed there. Christians used to total 1.5 million; now only a few hundred thousand remain. The Yazidi community, another ancient faith tradition that lived in peace, in persecution off and on; but, in attempting to live out their faith tradition in northern Iraq, right now there are about 400,000 people from the Yazidi faith tradition trapped in refugee camps. They are internally displaced persons living in tent structures, distant from their northern Iraq homes, and many are children. As of this past summer, we had a statistic--and it is hard to know where this is now, given the dynamics--that about 3,500 Yazidi women remained as slaves of ISIS. In fact, Madam Speaker, we are still working through the logistics, but I am very proud that I reached out to Nadia Murad, who is a Nobel Peace Prize winner, who was captured by someone named Salman, the Iraqi, and held in slavery. She came to my office, and I spoke with her and I said: I would like to hear the fullness of your story, but I recognize that is selfish on my part and that the horror and the pain and the tragedy are very real to you. So if you do not wish to say anything, I completely understand, but I would like to know more if you are willing. And she agreed. And she told us, moment by moment about what happened to her family, about how she was captured, sold, and how she eventually escaped, with the help of a Muslim family, by the way. I reached out to Nadia recently, and I invited her to the State of the Union. And she is going to come. We are working through it, and I am hopeful that works out. Right now she is scheduled to come, and I am proud of that. Because it is not about me giving a speech here about human dignity-- and I think Nadia would agree with me saying this--it is not even about the trauma that she went through and the need to heal. The reason that she is speaking so clearly and so courageously about the horror she went through, in [[Page H352]] the midst of her great pain, is this singular concept right here: human dignity. How can civilizations survive if we do not somehow rally ourselves around this fundamental principle of respecting the sacred space of personhood, of allowing people the liberty to live in peace and exercise their tradition as they see fit, to do good things for their family, to carry forward the wisdom of their tradition and ages, through their family life and the exercise of their faith. If we give up on that principle, where do we go? We can fight it out. We might even be able to win. But the deeper answer lies in the message that Nadia and so many others are telling us, crying out for justice and humanitarian relief and begging for a new way to think, a new way to order ourselves. And because we have the philosophical foundation here in America, because we have been a just and generous society and we have welcomed people who have fled persecution, the world looks at us as this beautiful place of the residual, of the protection of that fundamental value that I believe every heart longs for: to be respected, to be in community, to be loved. Now, here is what I think we ought to do. We have about 5,400 American troops in Iraq. And, with the help of international partners, we have been training Iraqi national forces and nurturing their capacity to lead and finish the work of defeating the dark, twisted horror of ISIS. At the behest of the Vice President, I went to Iraq last summer, and the Iraqi forces that we have trained and the military told me directly they have fought and they have fought well. Again, the irony of the attack of ISIS and the genocide against Christians and Yazidis and other religious minorities and the killing of so many innocent Muslim people is that it has created a nationalism, if you will, among the Iraqi people. And they have fought hard and fought well and taken many, many casualties. But here is the key: An additional security footprint is still required in the Nineveh Plain and Sinjar so that it is possible--these are the areas in northern Iraq proximate to Kurdistan. A new security settlement in that area would allow the return of Christians and allow the return of Yazidis to their traditional homes and to begin to rebuild. Again, as I mentioned, in July, at the request of the Vice President, I joined Administrator Mark Green of the United States Agency for International Development and Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom Sam Brownback, former Governor of Kansas, and we went to Iraq together. We were responding to reports that our initial efforts to help the religious minority communities were not having the intended effect. When we stepped into the dusty alleyways and streets and villages and camps, we gained firsthand knowledge of the broken conditions there. Our trip included intense discussions with Iraqi religious leaders, international aid workers, displaced children, U.N personnel, as well as our military leadership. Despite the situation's fragility, there is certain progress being made, including courageous acts of ecumenical alliance and revitalization, often with international nongovernmental organizations and faith-based entities. My firsthand observation was this: The situation in Iraq can be summarized in three words: possibility, urgency, and security. Multiple levels of challenge remain. Security is weak, and the prospect of permanent refugee camps is real. If Iraq loses its minority communities, the hope for a healthy pluralism in the region will die, and a severe chain of events will occur. Iran will expand its presence. ISIS could regenerate. Out- migration will ensue, and Iraq will forever lose this extraordinary ancient tapestry of multiple faith traditions that are so vital for human dignity, mutual respect, and peace. So, working with the administration, our government, we are expanding and accelerating our humanitarian support for those who suffered genocide, and this is all good. However, the financial assistance must be combined with the proper security settlement that ensures a just return for these beleaguered minorities to the Nineveh Plain and Sinjar. So, Madam Speaker, this is what I have done. I am recently getting ready to reintroduce a resolution in the House of Representatives to develop a multinational security mission to integrate local Christians, Yazidis, and other minorities into the security forces of the central government of Iraq. {time} 1800 Getting this right means justice for the oppressed, stability for Iraq, and the preservations of the principles necessary for civilization itself. By doing so, we will correct a fragile security situation. The religious minorities will have special autonomy for protection of their own areas, but, again, under Central Iraqi authority, under the Iraqi flag. The mission will be international in character under the Iraqi flag. I know, right now, many other nations are very willing to join this effort, to put down a new security footprint that would stabilize permanently that area and allow people to go home. Madam Speaker, there is another issue related critically to human dignity, and while it is not something that we often talk and think about, we are starting to get our mind around how big tech is controlling our lives. We are starting to worry that the surveillance of our habits and our contacts by people who shouldn't be surveilling us, these big tech companies, are creating multiple levels of difficulty. This growing problem here in America is affecting the most vulnerable persons here: our children. The CEO of Google, a few months ago, recently came before Congress, and he did receive an earful. Big tech is controlling our lives. Big tech is concentrated and dominating. Big tech is going to necessarily come under increased policy scrutiny to ensure that individual privacy is protected and competition is not stifled. But one overlooked area, problem, is protecting children online. Now, Google's YouTube is the most popular online platform for children on Earth, and 8 out of 10 U.S children from 6 to 12 use it daily. In April of this past year, 23 child and privacy advocacy groups filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission arguing that Google's YouTube online video and advertising network systematically collected data on the online habits of tens of millions of YouTube- watching children under the age of 13, and that data was sold to marketers. Now, in support of this advocacy, Congressman David Cicilline, who is from Rhode Island, who sits on the other side of the aisle from me, he and I asked Google for answers on its policy regarding protection of children online. The response was weak. So our goal is to continue to try to ensure that the internet's extraordinarily beneficial technological advances square with the time- honored values essential to a humane, decent, and dignified world. We want Google to thoroughly answer our questions. We want Google to be true to its original motto: ``Don't Be Evil.'' Now, Madam Speaker, let me turn to another topic, and touch on it briefly, to talk about what is germane in this moment, given the discussions of border security, some of the things we actually worked on last year that weren't successful but, nonetheless, may provide some answers for the current dilemma that we find ourselves in. America is, again, a kind and generous nation, and we have opened our arms to persons who seek refuge and want to rebuild their own lives and accept and embrace the deeper values of our country. However, charity cannot flow from chaos. No one is entitled to enter America illegally. Law and order create the conditions for justice and compassion. Law and order create the conditions necessary for charity, for justice, and for compassion. Now, the dynamics around immigration are complex and multilayered. A Yale study came out last year that said the number of persons illegally in the United States could be as high as 30 million, but at least 40 percent of those have overstayed a visa. And over the past 30 years-- and this is what we are wrestling with right now--over the past 30 years, incomplete border control, insufficient Federal enforcement, and the cynical exploitation of the poor for economic gain here in America [[Page H353]] has created an attractiveness and led to a failing system. So, in an attempt to meet multiple immigration challenges, to align the various perspectives that are here in Congress about a humane and compassionate response about the need for additional, necessary border resources, about the need to update our immigration laws, this year we voted on legislation that would stiffen internal enforcement, modernize our immigration laws, and significantly increase border resources. The House-led legislation moved more toward a merit-based immigration system, provided new funding for more humane shelters at the border. It accelerated the judicial review process, and it made accommodations to resolve the anxious ambiguity for those who are called the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA kids, children who were brought here through no fault of their own. I supported these initiatives, but, unfortunately, they failed in the House. And moving forward, I think we need to keep certain other priorities at the forefront of the immigration debate, which are, of course, an increase in border security, robust internal enforcement, and this additional priority which is now only coming to light. We have been doing this for a number of years. Of course, the policy needs to be revisited and evaluated in terms of success, but I do think it is an important one: moving the immigration debate off the 1-yard line and working with creative and imaginative foreign policy engagement with the countries in the Northern Triangle of Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. In that way, to help those countries build more just and humane systems both economically and politically, to create the conditions for stability, decreases the intensity of need for out- migration for either economic purposes or fleeing criminal activity. Now, immigration can seem remote and abstract for many of us, but it is important to remember that it has a human face, and I am very proud that we are doing two things at once here. We are, of course, debating the importance of immigration policy and potential changes, but also assisting many people who have gotten tangled in immigration difficulties back home. Madam Speaker, I think there are certain things in this House that transcend disagreement, and one of them is our veterans. Americans often sense what is right and good, and we instinctively recognize the nobility of self-sacrifice for another, for our country, and for our timeless ideals, and our veterans stand above the division and discord--beyond politics--to what is lasting and true. But beyond our applause and admiration, we are also duty-bound in this body to keep our promise to care for them. So, this past year, we did some important things. Back at home, we are in the process, after some long negotiations, of creating a new state-of-the-art VA facility in Lincoln, on the historic veterans' campus there. This is a victory. This is a significant victory for economic regeneration of a unique historic property, and it arrives on the heels of a very successful public-private partnership to expand and improve and innovate the Omaha VA Medical Center. I am so proud that Nebraska continues to inspire the Nation with creative partnerships to assist our veterans. Now, here in Congress, we passed a law called the VA Maintaining Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks, the acronym is the MISSION Act. It was signed into law, and it brought the long-needed reforms in the last Congress to the VA system. It provides a replacement for the VA Choice program and consolidates community care programs for veterans who live far from a VA center or experience long wait times for care. This is going to assist many of our veterans in rural communities and help them receive the quality of care that they deserve in a reasonable amount of time. This act also expanded the veteran caregiver program, making more pre-9/11 veterans and their families eligible for assistance. Now, another bipartisan project that I hope we can pursue shortly, and we have been in dialogue in a bipartisan manner on this, is to work with the international community to create a historic center at the site of our D-day battles in Normandy. A new institute that is being envisioned by some European colleagues could reestablish, for the 21st century, a renewed understanding of the pivotal battle that happened on D-day, its consequences for the war, and the institutions that emerged afterward that have created the conditions for stability and prosperity, many of which are aging and need to be updated and challenged. The United States cannot pull the world's weight alone. We need to be in authentic partnership and in authentic dialogue when we have differences, but in partnership with those who have been given the capacity by our sacrifice, both militarily and economically, to advance their own economies and build out systems of governance. Again, the 21st century architecture of international diplomacy is going to revolve around that central idea: authentic partnerships based on the philosophical principle of human dignity that lead to burden sharing and vision sharing at the same time. Madam Speaker, I had an interesting thing happen this summer. I wasn't at home, and I regret that I wasn't there to receive him, but he stopped in my office. World War II veteran Sidney Walton stopped by, and he has a really fascinating story. You see, he told my staff and some of the young people there, the interns, he has a deep regret that when he was young, he never really took the time to visit with the last few remaining Civil War veterans. So he has taken it upon himself; he has embarked on a national No Regrets Tour, and his goal is to visit all 50 States and give young Americans a chance to meet a World War II veteran. Again, his name is Sidney Walton. We were honored to have him in Nebraska, and he will finish his tour at the White House, as I understand it, this February, on his 100th birthday. Thank you, Sidney. Great, great effort. Madam Speaker, let me also touch upon another area that is so essential to our well-being, our sense of being able to fulfill these deepest longings that we have, our healthy sense of ambition for ourselves and for our family. A lot of times around here we cite economic data, have a bunch of charts that show statistics. We do a lot of that around here. It doesn't really convey, I think, the deeper dynamics of what is happening. But let me go into it just for a bit and talk about the positive outcomes that have occurred. This year, we have seen more jobs, increased wages, and reinvestment in equipment, plants, and research and development. Our gross domestic product, one of the measures of the economy, is climbing, and median household income is rising. Unemployment is at a 50-year low, and many people who have been marginalized or on the sidelines, thankfully, have found access to meaningful work. And if we think about a holistic approach to helping our neighbor, work is dignity. When a person is able to use their gifts and talents, either their two hands or their intellect, to make things, they are not only providing for their own well-being, but they are in solidarity with the community. This benefit of exchange goes beyond just material. It creates the value of relationships. That is the beauty and dignity of work. And when people are sidelined, when entire communities have been decimated through poor planning or poor policies or become overdependent upon one industry that decides it is going to pick up and leave--and we have seen that happen over and over in America--it is not fair to people; it is not fair to communities. But when we can see a return of entrepreneurial momentum, especially in small business--and again, people who have had real difficulty, for whatever reason, finding access to meaningful work restores individuals' vitality, of course, helps them to help themselves and creates solidarity and community. That is what, when we go into all these charts and graphs and economic figures, we really ought to be talking about, what I just said: the dignity and beauty and meaning of work, the gift of work, the ability to create the conditions necessary for societal flourishing. {time} 1815 So last year, we passed an important, what was called Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, [[Page H354]] and we are seeing this enhanced economic growth and more take-home pay for families. In addition to those important benefits, there is another little- known provision in here that I want to touch on for a moment, and it is called Opportunity Zones. It provides powerful tax incentives to encourage revitalization of some of the newest, most economically distressed areas of the country. It has been overlooked in terms of our understanding of that law. This investment opportunity will foster job regeneration and make better use of taxpayer dollars already spent, and it forges stronger communities. Madam Speaker, I used to be on our city council back home, and most of city council works is public works. When you see an area that is no longer functioning well, it is not just a blight on the community; it is not just that buildings are run down. We already made an investment there. We already paid for streets. We already paid for streetlights. We already paid for utilities, and they are being underutilized. That minimizes the return on an investment already made. We also have to provide police and fire protection for these areas. Again, those are real costs to the taxpayer. They are not on an accounting balance sheet, but they are real costs. It is called opportunity cost and underutilized investment. It is already there. So this idea of regenerating places across America that have the infrastructure already creates the conditions in which we get a better return on the tax dollar for money already spent. We are not chewing up additional land and resources. We are recycling, regenerating, rethinking possibility in some of the hardest hit areas of our country. I am excited. In my own congressional district, there are 14 of these Opportunity Zones that have been designated. Now, here are some hard realities, and I should point them out because they are real. Let's just be honest. Our deficit is high, and it is stubbornly high, and there are real disparities between those at the top and those who struggle to make a living. And while we hear policymakers tend to take too much credit for economic booms and too little blame for the crashes, most analysts do conclude that the actions taken by Congress over the last year have improved our economic outlook--again, a good accomplishment. We got the farm bill done. We got the right type of tax reform done. We strengthened our military, and we are looking forward to the debates around where we go as a nation now. Something that continues to be difficult for all of us, though, is the right type of healthcare reform. And I am going to venture out here and say that I would assume that everybody in this body holds to these same three principles. I don't mean to speak for anyone else, but this is what I believe. I think we ought to be striving for three things in the right type of healthcare reform: lower cost, improved well-being, and the protection of vulnerable persons. So let's just start there. Let's not create another proxy fight over the Affordable Care Act. Let's just start there. How do we get to lower cost, particularly for people in rural communities who are priced out of the individual market and have incomes that they don't get a subsidy? Some of the farmers in my community are paying as high as $40,000 for healthcare. You can't do it unless you are very wealthy. So what happens? A member of the family has to leave and go get a job in order to get the benefit. We don't even know how to calculate the economic lost potential of forcing somebody to go do a job they don't want to do simply to get health insurance. We don't even know how to calculate that. So I proposed something in the farm bill. Unfortunately, the Senate didn't take it up, but it is the Rural Health Insurance Act, which would have subsidized the startup of new risk pools to provide for better health insurance options in areas of rural communities, primarily, where this market has been decimated, where people have had to change the way they reorder their economic lives in order to have some access to health insurance. I thought it was a good idea. The startup costs for risk pool sharing, the sharing burden that is necessary to create an insurance product for smaller businesses, are high, so I wanted to provide, just like we do in markets that don't function efficiently, like crop insurance, a subsidy that would help the startup of these new risk pools in order to give more competition to the health insurance market in rural communities. That is one idea I had. We didn't get it all the way through, but I am glad it passed the House. I look forward to working with colleagues on the other side of the aisle again who are looking toward those three goals. How do we think creatively and imaginatively about reducing costs, improving well- being? We are right around the corner from amazing breakthroughs in innovation and technology in both managing and preventing and curing disease, and we have significantly increased our funding on a bipartisan basis for the National Institutes of Health for disease research. So we have done a number of things that are important for the American people. Of course, it tends to get overshadowed by some of the more philosophical fights that have occurred, but I would ask my colleagues, let's embrace the concept that we might be able to find some policies that everybody could potentially agree on around three goals: reducing cost, improving well-being, and protecting vulnerable persons. I think that is pretty reasonable. There is another idea out there that I will be introducing this year. I already have a cosponsor from the other side of the aisle. Here is the problem: For 3 years in a row now, America's life expectancy has declined. We are consuming more healthcare and dying younger. Rates of asthma and diabetes have skyrocketed in some populations, and it is really hard to see whether or not we are making progress on certain preventable illnesses. We can do better than that. That is not a necessary condition that we have to settle on. So, to start an effective new conversation, I am introducing the Community Health Improvement Leadership and Development Act. It is called the CHILD Act. My cosponsor is from a large urban area, and this allows communities across America to fully participate in improving their own health. How does it work? When community members find an innovative way to improve health and save money in their State Medicaid program, the legislation allows the verified savings to be shared back to that very community and State. It is a virtual cycle of assuring access to care and more creative prevention. I like it. It is a win-win for taxpayers and people in communities and towns across Nebraska and America. As we go on, I hope this is one of those ideas that fits into the three sets of principles as to how we are going to reduce cost, improve outcomes, and protect vulnerable persons. Madam Speaker, I know our time is getting ready to run short, and can you give me an idea of how much time is left. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Nebraska has 7 minutes remaining. Mr. FORTENBERRY. Madam Speaker, I want to introduce a new topic in the time that we have remaining, again speaking to that which might be able to unite us in a very divided time, that which is a fundamental principle that is operative in most of our hearts, that which, again, transcends these temporary and urgent moments of policy division. It is what I call natural security. We talked about national security. We talked about economic security. We talked about human dignity, family security. Now I want to talk about natural security, and here is an example. Nebraska is one of the only States where you can find three distinct subspecies of the turkey. Madam Speaker, are you with me on this? It is really very fascinating. In the southeast corner of Nebraska, you can find the Eastern turkey. In the southwest corner, you can see a Rio, and out west, you can find a Merriam. This unique trifecta exists right there in my home. Now, why am I raising this? Why would you be raising this? Of course, I [[Page H355]] find it interesting, and I hope you do as well, Madam Speaker. This newfound abundance of turkeys is an amazing story because, due to urban pressures and habitat loss and improperly regulated hunting, not too long ago, wild turkeys were in decline across the Nation. But they have since rebounded through basic conservation efforts. With innovative thinking and proactive policy, we can conserve and restore other wildlife and natural habitats, while bringing social, cultural, and economic multipliers to our rural communities. Nebraska has been at the forefront of such conservation efforts, and we will continue to lead this charge at home as well as here, so I have introduced the Recovering America's Wildlife Act. Now, Madam Speaker, we weren't able to get it through Congress last year, but I think by the end of the session, we had 120--it was probably a little bit higher--bipartisan cosponsors. So what does it do? It takes an upstream approach to habitat protection through robust funding of State wildlife action plans so that we don't have the downstream effect of habitat loss. In Nebraska, we do this through means of voluntary landowner agreements. This is why this is important. As we approach the renewal of the Endangered Species Act, RAWA, the Recovering America's Wildlife Act, actually gets in front of the problem by preventing wildlife from becoming endangered in the first place, and it moves us from costly regulation and litigation to collaboration. I am very excited about this because I think it is another way in which we can use moneys from lands in Federal trust and plow it back into another form of trust that creates a widespread benefit for those interested in environmental policy, those interested in conservation policy, and those interested in enhanced recreational sporting and hunting opportunity. That is why so many people have gotten on this bill. It transcends our divide. It is a creative mechanism by which we use certain moneys that are already being gathered into the Treasury and apply them in innovative and creative ways. Madam Speaker, I, again, am grateful for the opportunity to have had time to present to this body an overview of last year's work. It is important because, ultimately, it is not just about policy; it is about persons. A woman named Mary came into my office this past year, and she was with two men who had made their living as truckers. Their pensions were in danger. Mary just began to tear up as she explained the dire circumstances in which they found themselves, because multiemployer pension plans--this is a little bit in the weeds, but multiemployer pension plans, some are in dire condition. So what does that mean? Somebody who said, ``I am going to work for this set of benefits and, in turn, I am going to be guaranteed an income of this level in my older years,'' all of that promise, all that work and those promises are now under real threat. So, again, working in a bipartisan fashion, that is an area which is in severe need that we worked to try to fix last year and will do so again, working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Madam Speaker, my intention tonight was to give an overview of the last year because so often, again, in the dynamics of the moment, we lose sight of the good things that were accomplished for our economic security, for our national security, for family security, for the well- being of our land and water. By taking a little bit of a look back, maybe this gives us some prospect for unity, consensus, while fighting on principle, but unity and consensus for good. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS1327688I</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T4K-PM11-JDG9-Y27P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7910\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 10, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 3, 2019, the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Fortenberry) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. FORTENBERRY. Madam Speaker, there is a twofold goal being sought by many of us right now, and it is this: to keep the government fully open and to secure our border. No one wins in a government shutdown. No one wins if the border is not safe. </p><p>We ought to be able to rise above the momentary difficulty, whether it is a negotiation between the Senate and the House, the President and the House, the President and the Senate, and get to those mutually compatible goals of fully funding an operational government, as well as ensuring that Americans are safe and that we have the right type of assistance to our border personnel, the right type of barriers, the right type of technology, the right type of preventative measures to protect us all, and create the conditions in which America can have a truly just and humanitarian response to those in need. That is what is at issue this moment. With that said, Madam Speaker, though, I think it is important that, as we are at the beginning of a new Congress, as we were all sworn in last week, as this Chamber was filled with Members' children and Members' families coming from such extraordinarily diverse backgrounds, it was a celebratory atmosphere. It always tends to be that way, and then we get into the hard, hard work of governing. As President Kennedy once said, to govern is to choose wisely, and in a society divided by deep cultural and philosophical difficulties, that actually manifests itself here in the people's House. It is incumbent upon those of us who have been given this awesome responsibility to govern to undertake the awesome responsibility of deciding to govern well, to carry forth that spirit of the swearing in day with our families here, and that oath of office, where there is a common narrative around who we are as a people and where we should go as a Nation, reaching back to our most honored-in-time traditions and projecting them forward so America can have confidence that we have [[Page H350]] set up the guardrails for a successful culture, a successful economy, a successful society. That is our job. It is going to take difficult moments of prudential wrestling. It is my hope it will be done in a civil manner and that people will make their firm case and fight for those principles, but do so with an eye toward building consensus. We in Nebraska, I believe, invented the phrase ``get `er done.'' Just get `er done. Fight for what you believe and seek that which is possible. They are not mutually incompatible goals. That is our responsibility as legislators for the good, the well-being of the entire American public. With that said, Madam Speaker, I would like to do something a little bit unique. I would actually like to look back for a moment at the year in review and some important things that were accomplished. We tend to be caught in what I call the tyranny of the urgent, where what is right in front of us completely occupies us. Of course, we have a 24/7, 911 media that heightens all of this intensity. It is what it is. But the reality is, we did some pretty good things last year, last term, and I want to review a few of them. In December, the House and Senate passed a new farm bill with very strong bipartisan support. For a lot of Americans, it is very easy to overlook this accomplishment. Our grocery bills are some of the lowest in the world, our food is readily available, and our safety net for those who are vulnerable is well considered. It comes down to this: it is the vastness of our land and the quality of our soil and the gritty ingenuity of our farmers and ranchers who lay the foundation for America's prosperity, stability, and economic vitality. We tend to forget this because our food comes somewhat easy to us. The farm bill provides risk management tools to maximize this natural gift, allowing farmers and ranchers to provide food security for our country, our nutrition programs, as well as food assistance to millions of others around the world and protect those who are in very vulnerable circumstances. This bill also fosters conservation practices that enhance the protection of our soil and our wildlife habitat. I am pleased by the increase in the number of acres in the Conservation Reserve Program. The farm bill ensures that America continues to lead the world in agricultural innovation, food safety, and renewable fuels. In Nebraska, agriculture is central to our well-being, our way of life, and our culture. Our land-grant universities help ensure that we maintain our tremendous productivity. The farm bill is a once-in-every-5-year piece of legislation. The birth of such legislation is neither smooth nor easy, but we got it done. It is a good lesson for what we are facing now with new challenges ahead of us. We got it done in a very strong, bipartisan vote. For Nebraskans, and many people throughout rural America, the farm bill is not just another Washington accomplishment. Like the rhythms of planting and harvesting, it is an expected rite of legislative passage essential to who we are as a people, as Americans, and to our well- being. One of the things that I am excited about, Madam Speaker, is that beginning farmers and local food producers are big winners in our farm bill. I am very encouraged by the growing interest of young people in seeking agricultural opportunity. We are witnessing a food culture awakening, with local chefs, farmers markets, and a keen interest in eating local. The farm bill helps these next generation farmers and food entrepreneurs through new resources and training, such as the Local Agriculture Market Program, called LAMP, which accelerates the farm-to-fork movement across America, connecting local farmers with families, consumers, and restaurants. This offers a big, big opportunity for us all. I am also happy, Madam Speaker, that the farm bill includes my provisions to enhance the Farmer-to-Farmer Program. For over 30 years, the Farmer-to-Farmer Program has connected volunteer American farmers, agriculture extension experts, and others with deep knowledge of the agriculture industry with the world's farmers abroad. From dairy production to seed selection to entomology, irrigation, and crop yield determination improvement, as well as farm credit, this sharing of America's agricultural expertise dramatically enhances the capacity of people elsewhere to grow their own food, contributing to worldwide food security, community well-being, and human flourishing. Food security is the key. This year, we also passed the Global Food Security Reauthorization Act. I had worked on this important piece of legislation when it first passed. It amends the Global Security Act of 2016 to enable programs that support sustainable agriculture around the world and it extends assistance for international disaster relief and rehabilitation, especially for emergency food programs. Switching topics a bit, Madam Speaker, the fundamental duty that we all have here is to keep America safe. This requires a modern and properly equipped military. In recent years, our force structure has significantly deteriorated. Planes could not fly in certain circumstances and other equipment was not available. This past year in Congress, we passed the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act and the defense appropriations bill. Again, most of the government is open and functioning. We are working toward the rest. This helps rebuild our military after years of budget cuts. Our Active Duty, National Guard, and reserve force personnel will receive a 2.6 percent pay raise, the largest in 9 years. We are going to purchase new aircraft, tanks, ships, and other military hardware to replace and upgrade worn out equipment. These bills also increase across-the-board funding for additional personnel, training, maintenance, and operations to ensure that our military is always ready to defend our Nation. Madam Speaker, while a strong military is vital, America's safety and prosperity also depends upon a skillful mix of diplomacy and development. Building authentic relationships around the world and attacking the root causes of structural poverty are equally important goals that need to work in tandem with a properly sized and prepared military. A race toward technological superiority through ever-larger weapons systems will not unilaterally resolve our most difficult security challenges. The tech gap that we enjoy is closing, and will continue to close rapidly. Then, we have to ask ourselves: Then what? I often use the phrase ``foreign policy realism'' to guide how I believe the United States should engage in global affairs. It is this: strong defense, smart diplomacy, and sustainable development. These are the three pillars. Thanks to the dedication and courage of our troops and our diplomats and the exhaustive work of many others who serve from their heart in faraway places, we ought to be very grateful that our country has been kept safe from attack. There is always a however. However, real risks remain. Northern Iraq and Syria are places where ISIS and other dark forces could regenerate. Iran meddles and frustrates peace throughout the region. The United States' relationship with Saudi Arabia is under severe scrutiny in light of our intelligence findings that implicated the Saudi Crown Prince in the murder of an American-based Saudi journalist. We also face risks from various actors to increasingly powerful, yet more nimble and mobile nuclear capabilities. Madam Speaker, I lead the Nuclear Security Working Group in Congress. We had a very important dialogue with the administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration as we closed out the last Congress to discuss our coordination of nuclear nonproliferation activities. There are two core elements in preventing an attack. The first, of course, is deterrence. The second is threat reduction. Again, the dual work of our military and other government efforts in nuclear threat reduction has been successful in preventing nuclear and radiological terrorism. The challenge is to constantly reassess the changing threat environment. A single failure can lead to catastrophic consequences. These efforts must be matched with an equal effort to halt and reverse nuclear proliferation throughout the world. In a September conference, we gathered with national and nuclear security [[Page H351]] experts and former government officials across four administrations with the singular goal to improve U.S. Government oversight and coordination of nuclear counter and nonproliferation efforts. As a result, I am going to propose the creation of a nuclear nonproliferation council to enable a unified U.S. Government strategy on nuclear nonproliferation. In the National Defense Authorization Act, which we passed, there is a section also that perhaps has been overlooked, but it is important. It will speed the elimination of cesium chloride that can be used to make dirty bombs. This policy change that we were pleased to work on reduces the risk of a catastrophic radiological attack inside our borders. In the face of expanding Russian and Chinese nuclear arsenals, our defense bill modernizes our nuclear deterrence capability even as we hope to reestablish a more stable and peaceful world. Only through a combination of strength and an openness to dialogue can we avert a nuclear arms race. {time} 1745 Back in June, the first-ever meeting between leaders of the United States and North Korea took place. President Trump met face to face with Kim Jong-un in a preliminary step towards reconciliation and denuclearization. The summit that was held in Singapore was a first step to shift an escalating trajectory of missile launches and hostile rhetoric, reducing anxiety for the region, America, and the world. The summit took a new approach to a long standoff. For the first time, a U.S. President reached out directly to a North Korean leader. The meeting would not have happened, though--and this is very important, Madam Speaker--without a unified global community willing to support the preconditions needed to encourage Kim Jong-un to meet. As an initial gesture of goodwill, North Korea returned the remains of U.S. service personnel and destroyed at least one nuclear testing facility. Clearly, much more progress is needed, and a joint action plan will require North Korea to continue to earnestly engage in nonproliferation. I believe that congressional leadership should play a role here in policy developments that can help the administration reduce the nuclear threats on the Korean Peninsula. Now, Madam Speaker, where I live, Nebraska, plays a critical role in keeping America safe. Offutt Air Force Base and Strategic Command are essential to America's security, and the steady work of guiding budgets and building the necessary coalitions here in Congress resulted in dramatic improvements to both Strategic Command as well as Offutt. The new USSTRATCOM headquarters building is nearing completion. Its increased capability, beginning this summer, will add to the combatant command's charge as one of the Nation's most vital missions, and that is nuclear deterrence. A major repair of Offutt Air Force Base's runway will soon begin. Again, I am very pleased, working with the Nebraska delegation and our colleagues, to continue to advance the completion of the Strategic Command as well as the enhancement of Offutt Air Force Base. Offutt is home to the Air Force's 55th Wing. The wing conducts intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. This is very important, Madam Speaker, because, again, it is something that is overlooked in our tense times. One of the 55th Wing's important aircraft is the OC-135B. It flies in support of the 34-international-member Treaty on Open Skies, one of the last remaining functional arms control regimes that is operational between the United States and the Russian Federation. I am pleased that, working together, we were able to enhance funding for the OC-135B aircraft, again, vital to one of the last linkages of agreements with the Russians. Madam Speaker, I want to turn to another topic that really ought to be at the forefront of our discussions, but rarely is; if we are going to create a 21st century architecture for international stability, I believe it revolves around two words: human dignity. We traditionally think of diplomacy as between nation-states. Increasingly in our interconnected world, where people can reach people in faraway places in an instant or by travel in a very short period of time, it is this deeper transcendent idea that is still operational in our culture. It underlies our founding here in America. It is in our earliest documents. It is alluded to. This idea of human dignity, this sacred space of personhood from which the free exercise of conscience and right reason and other rights that we tend to take for granted, such as religious freedom, flow. Human dignity, the two words that mark the 21st century architecture for how we ought to conduct international affairs, reaching toward authentic relationships and dialogue with people with whom we may have had tremendous misunderstandings in the past, tremendous tensions, or even the grave consequences of war. Again, as I mentioned earlier, Madam Speaker, the tech gap is closing. We can beat anybody anywhere. We can do that and will continue to be able to do that. And, again, a strong military is absolutely essential to keeping the peace and creating the conditions for stability internationally, which protects us here at home. But what happens when, again, the miniaturization of technology is such that any bad actor or any bad nation has ready access to it; we have to ask ourselves: And then what? It is this idea of being in authentic dialogue around this fundamental principle that is operative in the way in which we conduct our affairs; human dignity, mutual respect for that sacred space of the person and their perspectives and their ability to use reason to think for what is good for themselves, their family, and their country. Human dignity. This is manifesting itself very clearly in something that, again, is really overlooked in our dialogue because we are caught in the urgency of the moment. Let me point this out, Madam Speaker. It is about the country of Iraq. America has given so much. We have lost so much in Iraq that it is hard to understand why engagement is ongoing and necessary. The thought of it is exhausting to the American people. It is exhausting to our process. But I need to point this out. Much is at stake. Iraq once had a mosaic and an ancient tapestry of religious pluralism that existed there. Christians used to total 1.5 million; now only a few hundred thousand remain. The Yazidi community, another ancient faith tradition that lived in peace, in persecution off and on; but, in attempting to live out their faith tradition in northern Iraq, right now there are about 400,000 people from the Yazidi faith tradition trapped in refugee camps. They are internally displaced persons living in tent structures, distant from their northern Iraq homes, and many are children. As of this past summer, we had a statistic--and it is hard to know where this is now, given the dynamics--that about 3,500 Yazidi women remained as slaves of ISIS. In fact, Madam Speaker, we are still working through the logistics, but I am very proud that I reached out to Nadia Murad, who is a Nobel Peace Prize winner, who was captured by someone named Salman, the Iraqi, and held in slavery. She came to my office, and I spoke with her and I said: I would like to hear the fullness of your story, but I recognize that is selfish on my part and that the horror and the pain and the tragedy are very real to you. So if you do not wish to say anything, I completely understand, but I would like to know more if you are willing. And she agreed. And she told us, moment by moment about what happened to her family, about how she was captured, sold, and how she eventually escaped, with the help of a Muslim family, by the way. I reached out to Nadia recently, and I invited her to the State of the Union. And she is going to come. We are working through it, and I am hopeful that works out. Right now she is scheduled to come, and I am proud of that. Because it is not about me giving a speech here about human dignity-- and I think Nadia would agree with me saying this--it is not even about the trauma that she went through and the need to heal. The reason that she is speaking so clearly and so courageously about the horror she went through, in [[Page H352]] the midst of her great pain, is this singular concept right here: human dignity. How can civilizations survive if we do not somehow rally ourselves around this fundamental principle of respecting the sacred space of personhood, of allowing people the liberty to live in peace and exercise their tradition as they see fit, to do good things for their family, to carry forward the wisdom of their tradition and ages, through their family life and the exercise of their faith. If we give up on that principle, where do we go? We can fight it out. We might even be able to win. But the deeper answer lies in the message that Nadia and so many others are telling us, crying out for justice and humanitarian relief and begging for a new way to think, a new way to order ourselves. And because we have the philosophical foundation here in America, because we have been a just and generous society and we have welcomed people who have fled persecution, the world looks at us as this beautiful place of the residual, of the protection of that fundamental value that I believe every heart longs for: to be respected, to be in community, to be loved. Now, here is what I think we ought to do. We have about 5,400 American troops in Iraq. And, with the help of international partners, we have been training Iraqi national forces and nurturing their capacity to lead and finish the work of defeating the dark, twisted horror of ISIS. At the behest of the Vice President, I went to Iraq last summer, and the Iraqi forces that we have trained and the military told me directly they have fought and they have fought well. Again, the irony of the attack of ISIS and the genocide against Christians and Yazidis and other religious minorities and the killing of so many innocent Muslim people is that it has created a nationalism, if you will, among the Iraqi people. And they have fought hard and fought well and taken many, many casualties. But here is the key: An additional security footprint is still required in the Nineveh Plain and Sinjar so that it is possible--these are the areas in northern Iraq proximate to Kurdistan. A new security settlement in that area would allow the return of Christians and allow the return of Yazidis to their traditional homes and to begin to rebuild. Again, as I mentioned, in July, at the request of the Vice President, I joined Administrator Mark Green of the United States Agency for International Development and Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom Sam Brownback, former Governor of Kansas, and we went to Iraq together. We were responding to reports that our initial efforts to help the religious minority communities were not having the intended effect. When we stepped into the dusty alleyways and streets and villages and camps, we gained firsthand knowledge of the broken conditions there. Our trip included intense discussions with Iraqi religious leaders, international aid workers, displaced children, U.N. personnel, as well as our military leadership. Despite the situation's fragility, there is certain progress being made, including courageous acts of ecumenical alliance and revitalization, often with international nongovernmental organizations and faith-based entities. My firsthand observation was this: The situation in Iraq can be summarized in three words: possibility, urgency, and security. Multiple levels of challenge remain. Security is weak, and the prospect of permanent refugee camps is real. If Iraq loses its minority communities, the hope for a healthy pluralism in the region will die, and a severe chain of events will occur. Iran will expand its presence. ISIS could regenerate. Out- migration will ensue, and Iraq will forever lose this extraordinary ancient tapestry of multiple faith traditions that are so vital for human dignity, mutual respect, and peace. So, working with the administration, our government, we are expanding and accelerating our humanitarian support for those who suffered genocide, and this is all good. However, the financial assistance must be combined with the proper security settlement that ensures a just return for these beleaguered minorities to the Nineveh Plain and Sinjar. So, Madam Speaker, this is what I have done. I am recently getting ready to reintroduce a resolution in the House of Representatives to develop a multinational security mission to integrate local Christians, Yazidis, and other minorities into the security forces of the central government of Iraq. {time} 1800 Getting this right means justice for the oppressed, stability for Iraq, and the preservations of the principles necessary for civilization itself. By doing so, we will correct a fragile security situation. The religious minorities will have special autonomy for protection of their own areas, but, again, under Central Iraqi authority, under the Iraqi flag. The mission will be international in character under the Iraqi flag. I know, right now, many other nations are very willing to join this effort, to put down a new security footprint that would stabilize permanently that area and allow people to go home. Madam Speaker, there is another issue related critically to human dignity, and while it is not something that we often talk and think about, we are starting to get our mind around how big tech is controlling our lives. We are starting to worry that the surveillance of our habits and our contacts by people who shouldn't be surveilling us, these big tech companies, are creating multiple levels of difficulty. This growing problem here in America is affecting the most vulnerable persons here: our children. The CEO of Google, a few months ago, recently came before Congress, and he did receive an earful. Big tech is controlling our lives. Big tech is concentrated and dominating. Big tech is going to necessarily come under increased policy scrutiny to ensure that individual privacy is protected and competition is not stifled. But one overlooked area, problem, is protecting children online. Now, Google's YouTube is the most popular online platform for children on Earth, and 8 out of 10 U.S. children from 6 to 12 use it daily. In April of this past year, 23 child and privacy advocacy groups filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission arguing that Google's YouTube online video and advertising network systematically collected data on the online habits of tens of millions of YouTube- watching children under the age of 13, and that data was sold to marketers. Now, in support of this advocacy, Congressman David Cicilline, who is from Rhode Island, who sits on the other side of the aisle from me, he and I asked Google for answers on its policy regarding protection of children online. The response was weak. So our goal is to continue to try to ensure that the internet's extraordinarily beneficial technological advances square with the time- honored values essential to a humane, decent, and dignified world. We want Google to thoroughly answer our questions. We want Google to be true to its original motto: ``Don't Be Evil.'' Now, Madam Speaker, let me turn to another topic, and touch on it briefly, to talk about what is germane in this moment, given the discussions of border security, some of the things we actually worked on last year that weren't successful but, nonetheless, may provide some answers for the current dilemma that we find ourselves in. America is, again, a kind and generous nation, and we have opened our arms to persons who seek refuge and want to rebuild their own lives and accept and embrace the deeper values of our country. However, charity cannot flow from chaos. No one is entitled to enter America illegally. Law and order create the conditions for justice and compassion. Law and order create the conditions necessary for charity, for justice, and for compassion. Now, the dynamics around immigration are complex and multilayered. A Yale study came out last year that said the number of persons illegally in the United States could be as high as 30 million, but at least 40 percent of those have overstayed a visa. And over the past 30 years-- and this is what we are wrestling with right now--over the past 30 years, incomplete border control, insufficient Federal enforcement, and the cynical exploitation of the poor for economic gain here in America [[Page H353]] has created an attractiveness and led to a failing system. So, in an attempt to meet multiple immigration challenges, to align the various perspectives that are here in Congress about a humane and compassionate response about the need for additional, necessary border resources, about the need to update our immigration laws, this year we voted on legislation that would stiffen internal enforcement, modernize our immigration laws, and significantly increase border resources. The House-led legislation moved more toward a merit-based immigration system, provided new funding for more humane shelters at the border. It accelerated the judicial review process, and it made accommodations to resolve the anxious ambiguity for those who are called the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA kids, children who were brought here through no fault of their own. I supported these initiatives, but, unfortunately, they failed in the House. And moving forward, I think we need to keep certain other priorities at the forefront of the immigration debate, which are, of course, an increase in border security, robust internal enforcement, and this additional priority which is now only coming to light. We have been doing this for a number of years. Of course, the policy needs to be revisited and evaluated in terms of success, but I do think it is an important one: moving the immigration debate off the 1-yard line and working with creative and imaginative foreign policy engagement with the countries in the Northern Triangle of Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. In that way, to help those countries build more just and humane systems both economically and politically, to create the conditions for stability, decreases the intensity of need for out- migration for either economic purposes or fleeing criminal activity. Now, immigration can seem remote and abstract for many of us, but it is important to remember that it has a human face, and I am very proud that we are doing two things at once here. We are, of course, debating the importance of immigration policy and potential changes, but also assisting many people who have gotten tangled in immigration difficulties back home. Madam Speaker, I think there are certain things in this House that transcend disagreement, and one of them is our veterans. Americans often sense what is right and good, and we instinctively recognize the nobility of self-sacrifice for another, for our country, and for our timeless ideals, and our veterans stand above the division and discord--beyond politics--to what is lasting and true. But beyond our applause and admiration, we are also duty-bound in this body to keep our promise to care for them. So, this past year, we did some important things. Back at home, we are in the process, after some long negotiations, of creating a new state-of-the-art VA facility in Lincoln, on the historic veterans' campus there. This is a victory. This is a significant victory for economic regeneration of a unique historic property, and it arrives on the heels of a very successful public-private partnership to expand and improve and innovate the Omaha VA Medical Center. I am so proud that Nebraska continues to inspire the Nation with creative partnerships to assist our veterans. Now, here in Congress, we passed a law called the VA Maintaining Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks, the acronym is the MISSION Act. It was signed into law, and it brought the long-needed reforms in the last Congress to the VA system. It provides a replacement for the VA Choice program and consolidates community care programs for veterans who live far from a VA center or experience long wait times for care. This is going to assist many of our veterans in rural communities and help them receive the quality of care that they deserve in a reasonable amount of time. This act also expanded the veteran caregiver program, making more pre-9/11 veterans and their families eligible for assistance. Now, another bipartisan project that I hope we can pursue shortly, and we have been in dialogue in a bipartisan manner on this, is to work with the international community to create a historic center at the site of our D-day battles in Normandy. A new institute that is being envisioned by some European colleagues could reestablish, for the 21st century, a renewed understanding of the pivotal battle that happened on D-day, its consequences for the war, and the institutions that emerged afterward that have created the conditions for stability and prosperity, many of which are aging and need to be updated and challenged. The United States cannot pull the world's weight alone. We need to be in authentic partnership and in authentic dialogue when we have differences, but in partnership with those who have been given the capacity by our sacrifice, both militarily and economically, to advance their own economies and build out systems of governance. Again, the 21st century architecture of international diplomacy is going to revolve around that central idea: authentic partnerships based on the philosophical principle of human dignity that lead to burden sharing and vision sharing at the same time. Madam Speaker, I had an interesting thing happen this summer. I wasn't at home, and I regret that I wasn't there to receive him, but he stopped in my office. World War II veteran Sidney Walton stopped by, and he has a really fascinating story. You see, he told my staff and some of the young people there, the interns, he has a deep regret that when he was young, he never really took the time to visit with the last few remaining Civil War veterans. So he has taken it upon himself; he has embarked on a national No Regrets Tour, and his goal is to visit all 50 States and give young Americans a chance to meet a World War II veteran. Again, his name is Sidney Walton. We were honored to have him in Nebraska, and he will finish his tour at the White House, as I understand it, this February, on his 100th birthday. Thank you, Sidney. Great, great effort. Madam Speaker, let me also touch upon another area that is so essential to our well-being, our sense of being able to fulfill these deepest longings that we have, our healthy sense of ambition for ourselves and for our family. A lot of times around here we cite economic data, have a bunch of charts that show statistics. We do a lot of that around here. It doesn't really convey, I think, the deeper dynamics of what is happening. But let me go into it just for a bit and talk about the positive outcomes that have occurred. This year, we have seen more jobs, increased wages, and reinvestment in equipment, plants, and research and development. Our gross domestic product, one of the measures of the economy, is climbing, and median household income is rising. Unemployment is at a 50-year low, and many people who have been marginalized or on the sidelines, thankfully, have found access to meaningful work. And if we think about a holistic approach to helping our neighbor, work is dignity. When a person is able to use their gifts and talents, either their two hands or their intellect, to make things, they are not only providing for their own well-being, but they are in solidarity with the community. This benefit of exchange goes beyond just material. It creates the value of relationships. That is the beauty and dignity of work. And when people are sidelined, when entire communities have been decimated through poor planning or poor policies or become overdependent upon one industry that decides it is going to pick up and leave--and we have seen that happen over and over in America--it is not fair to people; it is not fair to communities. But when we can see a return of entrepreneurial momentum, especially in small business--and again, people who have had real difficulty, for whatever reason, finding access to meaningful work restores individuals' vitality, of course, helps them to help themselves and creates solidarity and community. That is what, when we go into all these charts and graphs and economic figures, we really ought to be talking about, what I just said: the dignity and beauty and meaning of work, the gift of work, the ability to create the conditions necessary for societal flourishing. {time} 1815 So last year, we passed an important, what was called Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, [[Page H354]] and we are seeing this enhanced economic growth and more take-home pay for families. In addition to those important benefits, there is another little- known provision in here that I want to touch on for a moment, and it is called Opportunity Zones. It provides powerful tax incentives to encourage revitalization of some of the newest, most economically distressed areas of the country. It has been overlooked in terms of our understanding of that law. This investment opportunity will foster job regeneration and make better use of taxpayer dollars already spent, and it forges stronger communities. Madam Speaker, I used to be on our city council back home, and most of city council works is public works. When you see an area that is no longer functioning well, it is not just a blight on the community; it is not just that buildings are run down. We already made an investment there. We already paid for streets. We already paid for streetlights. We already paid for utilities, and they are being underutilized. That minimizes the return on an investment already made. We also have to provide police and fire protection for these areas. Again, those are real costs to the taxpayer. They are not on an accounting balance sheet, but they are real costs. It is called opportunity cost and underutilized investment. It is already there. So this idea of regenerating places across America that have the infrastructure already creates the conditions in which we get a better return on the tax dollar for money already spent. We are not chewing up additional land and resources. We are recycling, regenerating, rethinking possibility in some of the hardest hit areas of our country. I am excited. In my own congressional district, there are 14 of these Opportunity Zones that have been designated. Now, here are some hard realities, and I should point them out because they are real. Let's just be honest. Our deficit is high, and it is stubbornly high, and there are real disparities between those at the top and those who struggle to make a living. And while we hear policymakers tend to take too much credit for economic booms and too little blame for the crashes, most analysts do conclude that the actions taken by Congress over the last year have improved our economic outlook--again, a good accomplishment. We got the farm bill done. We got the right type of tax reform done. We strengthened our military, and we are looking forward to the debates around where we go as a nation now. Something that continues to be difficult for all of us, though, is the right type of healthcare reform. And I am going to venture out here and say that I would assume that everybody in this body holds to these same three principles. I don't mean to speak for anyone else, but this is what I believe. I think we ought to be striving for three things in the right type of healthcare reform: lower cost, improved well-being, and the protection of vulnerable persons. So let's just start there. Let's not create another proxy fight over the Affordable Care Act. Let's just start there. How do we get to lower cost, particularly for people in rural communities who are priced out of the individual market and have incomes that they don't get a subsidy? Some of the farmers in my community are paying as high as $40,000 for healthcare. You can't do it unless you are very wealthy. So what happens? A member of the family has to leave and go get a job in order to get the benefit. We don't even know how to calculate the economic lost potential of forcing somebody to go do a job they don't want to do simply to get health insurance. We don't even know how to calculate that. So I proposed something in the farm bill. Unfortunately, the Senate didn't take it up, but it is the Rural Health Insurance Act, which would have subsidized the startup of new risk pools to provide for better health insurance options in areas of rural communities, primarily, where this market has been decimated, where people have had to change the way they reorder their economic lives in order to have some access to health insurance. I thought it was a good idea. The startup costs for risk pool sharing, the sharing burden that is necessary to create an insurance product for smaller businesses, are high, so I wanted to provide, just like we do in markets that don't function efficiently, like crop insurance, a subsidy that would help the startup of these new risk pools in order to give more competition to the health insurance market in rural communities. That is one idea I had. We didn't get it all the way through, but I am glad it passed the House. I look forward to working with colleagues on the other side of the aisle again who are looking toward those three goals. How do we think creatively and imaginatively about reducing costs, improving well- being? We are right around the corner from amazing breakthroughs in innovation and technology in both managing and preventing and curing disease, and we have significantly increased our funding on a bipartisan basis for the National Institutes of Health for disease research. So we have done a number of things that are important for the American people. Of course, it tends to get overshadowed by some of the more philosophical fights that have occurred, but I would ask my colleagues, let's embrace the concept that we might be able to find some policies that everybody could potentially agree on around three goals: reducing cost, improving well-being, and protecting vulnerable persons. I think that is pretty reasonable. There is another idea out there that I will be introducing this year. I already have a cosponsor from the other side of the aisle. Here is the problem: For 3 years in a row now, America's life expectancy has declined. We are consuming more healthcare and dying younger. Rates of asthma and diabetes have skyrocketed in some populations, and it is really hard to see whether or not we are making progress on certain preventable illnesses. We can do better than that. That is not a necessary condition that we have to settle on. So, to start an effective new conversation, I am introducing the Community Health Improvement Leadership and Development Act. It is called the CHILD Act. My cosponsor is from a large urban area, and this allows communities across America to fully participate in improving their own health. How does it work? When community members find an innovative way to improve health and save money in their State Medicaid program, the legislation allows the verified savings to be shared back to that very community and State. It is a virtual cycle of assuring access to care and more creative prevention. I like it. It is a win-win for taxpayers and people in communities and towns across Nebraska and America. As we go on, I hope this is one of those ideas that fits into the three sets of principles as to how we are going to reduce cost, improve outcomes, and protect vulnerable persons. Madam Speaker, I know our time is getting ready to run short, and can you give me an idea of how much time is left. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Nebraska has 7 minutes remaining. Mr. FORTENBERRY. Madam Speaker, I want to introduce a new topic in the time that we have remaining, again speaking to that which might be able to unite us in a very divided time, that which is a fundamental principle that is operative in most of our hearts, that which, again, transcends these temporary and urgent moments of policy division. It is what I call natural security. We talked about national security. We talked about economic security. We talked about human dignity, family security. Now I want to talk about natural security, and here is an example. Nebraska is one of the only States where you can find three distinct subspecies of the turkey. Madam Speaker, are you with me on this? It is really very fascinating. In the southeast corner of Nebraska, you can find the Eastern turkey. In the southwest corner, you can see a Rio, and out west, you can find a Merriam. This unique trifecta exists right there in my home. Now, why am I raising this? Why would you be raising this? Of course, I [[Page H355]] find it interesting, and I hope you do as well, Madam Speaker. This newfound abundance of turkeys is an amazing story because, due to urban pressures and habitat loss and improperly regulated hunting, not too long ago, wild turkeys were in decline across the Nation. But they have since rebounded through basic conservation efforts. With innovative thinking and proactive policy, we can conserve and restore other wildlife and natural habitats, while bringing social, cultural, and economic multipliers to our rural communities. Nebraska has been at the forefront of such conservation efforts, and we will continue to lead this charge at home as well as here, so I have introduced the Recovering America's Wildlife Act. Now, Madam Speaker, we weren't able to get it through Congress last year, but I think by the end of the session, we had 120--it was probably a little bit higher--bipartisan cosponsors. So what does it do? It takes an upstream approach to habitat protection through robust funding of State wildlife action plans so that we don't have the downstream effect of habitat loss. In Nebraska, we do this through means of voluntary landowner agreements. This is why this is important. As we approach the renewal of the Endangered Species Act, RAWA, the Recovering America's Wildlife Act, actually gets in front of the problem by preventing wildlife from becoming endangered in the first place, and it moves us from costly regulation and litigation to collaboration. I am very excited about this because I think it is another way in which we can use moneys from lands in Federal trust and plow it back into another form of trust that creates a widespread benefit for those interested in environmental policy, those interested in conservation policy, and those interested in enhanced recreational sporting and hunting opportunity. That is why so many people have gotten on this bill. It transcends our divide. It is a creative mechanism by which we use certain moneys that are already being gathered into the Treasury and apply them in innovative and creative ways. Madam Speaker, I, again, am grateful for the opportunity to have had time to present to this body an overview of last year's work. It is important because, ultimately, it is not just about policy; it is about persons. A woman named Mary came into my office this past year, and she was with two men who had made their living as truckers. Their pensions were in danger. Mary just began to tear up as she explained the dire circumstances in which they found themselves, because multiemployer pension plans--this is a little bit in the weeds, but multiemployer pension plans, some are in dire condition. So what does that mean? Somebody who said, ``I am going to work for this set of benefits and, in turn, I am going to be guaranteed an income of this level in my older years,'' all of that promise, all that work and those promises are now under real threat. So, again, working in a bipartisan fashion, that is an area which is in severe need that we worked to try to fix last year and will do so again, working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Madam Speaker, my intention tonight was to give an overview of the last year because so often, again, in the dynamics of the moment, we lose sight of the good things that were accomplished for our economic security, for our national security, for family security, for the well- being of our land and water. By taking a little bit of a look back, maybe this gives us some prospect for unity, consensus, while fighting on principle, but unity and consensus for good. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USOFFN-RLPMN741539020190110</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USOFFN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V5J-9TJ1-J9XT-P1SP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400469</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7911\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>US Official News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"610\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 10, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Immigration Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUI4OEMwN0ExMjQ4NDFBQjkyQTU0NzQzNkM0QUZGRTk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjM2MTM2NTU4NkUyNDk3RjhEOTUwOThDQkYwMzg4ODI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MThGRjk5N0E2MTI4NEJGQjkwMDBCRjc5NkZDQUE4NzU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Tax Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTNEM0E2OEE0RkQyNEY1MDhBQzdGMkQ4ODI4QTJDODE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Corporations Engaged in Farming</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0I4QkEzOTVFOEMwNDBCMThDRDgyMkM5MzAzQUQ0RDg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjU1QUYzRTdGNkU2NDkwMkE4MjM2MzI1Q0MwNDM1Njg</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp;

This week on the show, NPR reporter Elise Hu and Wall Street Journal reporter Erich Schwartzel. All right. Let's start the show. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF FLEETWOOD MAC SONG, \"RHIANNON\")        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Hey, y'all. From NPR, I'm Sam Sanders. IT'S BEEN A MINUTE. Today, we are bringing you a very, very special year-end episode of the show. Usually, every weekend, we help you catch up on the week that was. This time, we're going to catch up on the year that was. And to do that, I needed two very good friends of the show, two heavy hitters. As Aunt Betty said, two guests here today - Elise Hu, correspondent for NPR News, covering the future at NPR West. </p><p>ELISE HU: The future. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: I want that beat. </p><p>ELISE HU: I wanted the title future correspondent, but then it looks like I was an intern. Like, one day, I was going to be a correspondent. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Oh, right. Right. Right. Aspiring correspondent. </p><p>ELISE HU: So on my card, I'm going to switch it to correspondent, comma, the future. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: I love it. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Oh, nice. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: And Erich Schwartzel covering the film industry at The Wall Street Journal. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Hey. Thank you for having me. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Thanks for being here. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Me, Elise and Stevie wrapping up the year here. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. We're also joined by Stevie Nicks here in studio. I'm playing \"Rhiannon\" by Fleetwood Mac. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: One of my favorites. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Apparently there's actually been some reporting this year that this has been the year of Fleetwood Mac. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"RHIANNON\")        </p><p>FLEETWOOD MAC: (Singing) Rhiannon. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Steve Russo, this reporter at Digg, he felt like a bunch of his friends - young people - were talking about Fleetwood Mac. So he called up Spotify. Spotify told him that over the past three years, adjusted for user growth, the under-35 crowd is now playing Fleetwood Mac 58 percent more than they did two years ago. And the increase in listenership with young fans is bigger than that with older fans. The kids love Fleetwood Mac. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: That's so interesting because it wasn't in, like, a movie or anything like that, right? </p><p>ELISE HU: That's what I was going to say. Was it driven by some sort of movie? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: I think that, one, every cohort of young people has a moment in which they discover Fleetwood Mac and how great they are. And this is just like the crest of that wave. I also think that the weirdness and awfulness of our current news cycles increases the nostalgia that we all have just to hear the stuff that our parents liked and that is soothing like this song. And I also think that, like, when you peel back the layers, Fleetwood Mac as a band and what they represent is really 2018 - this polished, veneered display, but underneath it, pure chaos. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Resentment, tensions. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Make-ups to break-ups. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Yes, exactly. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Drama. </p><p>ELISE HU: And lots of tamborine. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: It's really aspirational, though, because they do come together and create brilliant art... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: In spite of the chaos. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: ...Even though they hate each other while they're doing it, right? </p><p>ELISE HU: I think the art that comes out of this era is going to be really interesting, too. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Oh, yeah. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Oh, for sure. </p><p>ELISE HU: Because of the chaos. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Exactly. And especially next year because of a lag time, right? It takes a while for these things to be made, right? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: For the chaos to catch up. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Next year, I think it will really come into focus. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"RHIANNON\")        </p><p>FLEETWOOD MAC: (Singing) Taken by, taken by the sky. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: All right. Here's how this episode is going to go. Usually, we describe our week of news in just three words, but today, the stakes are higher. You must each describe your year of news in only three words. And then in a bit, we'll check in with Lilliana Mason. She's a political scientist and author who will attempt to make sense of our weird, strange, wacky year in politics. After that, we'll play a very special game, a year-end game, deluxe edition of Who Said That. Sound good? </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Sounds great. </p><p>ELISE HU: So excited. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: So, Elise Hu, who actually has just been back in the States from South Korea for a few months, what are your three words to describe your year in 2018? </p><p>ELISE HU: Yeah. So my perspective is a little bit different because I've only been a resident of America since about Labor Day. And before that, I was living abroad as the Seoul correspondent. And... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: S-O-U-L or S-E-O-U-L? </p><p>ELISE HU: That's right. I was the sole Seoul correspondent, so S-O-L-E S-E-O-U-L. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: The sole Seoul correspondent with a lot of soul. </p><p>ELISE HU: Yes. I'm Seoul excited to talk to you today. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: I'm sold. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>ELISE HU: So my three words are globalism in crisis. I wanted it to be globalism on the ropes, but that was four words. But this notion that, you know, Brexit and the Trump election kicked off a tough time for Western liberalism and this idea that countries are interdependent, and foreign exchange was good and importing and exporting was good. That idea started getting challenged - at least in the Western world in a big way - in 2016. But those trends have really continued in 2018. We've seen Donald Trump call himself a nationalist. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>ELISE HU: But we've also seen across the world - Putin in Russia consolidating his power, Xi Jinping in China becoming a ruler for life. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>ELISE HU: We've seen the election of Bolsonaro in Brazil, who is a right-wing populist... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>ELISE HU: ...Authoritarian nationalist who says that he supports torture. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>ELISE HU: But also, we're seeing authoritarianism on the rise in Hungary and Poland. People just - especially in states like that, like former Soviet states, really challenging the institutions like courts that would challenge them. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: When I hear you go through this list of countries becoming more authoritarianistic (ph) - not the right word - becoming more... </p><p>ELISE HU: Authoritarian-ish (ph). </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...Authoritarian-ish, yeah. </p><p>ELISE HU: Right. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: It almost seems to challenge the entire post-World War II world order. I mean, like, there was this moment we got taught about in grade school; like, after the war, all the countries came together. Democracy would win. Capitalism would win. Globalism would win. And now you have world leaders challenging some of those fundamentals and also voters, when they approve things like Brexit, challenging that, too. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Yeah. And I think that one thing that's super interesting is that there was always this assumption that liberal democracy would be the preferred method, right? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: And the eternal method. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: And the eternal method, right? Like, the end of history, right? - like, this is what we're all going to accept. But you have countries like China exporting this kind of new brand of governance - right? - that's a mix of capitalism and authoritarianism... </p><p>ELISE HU: And nationalism especially. Right. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: ...And nationalism at a time when America's model doesn't look the most stable. </p><p>ELISE HU: Yeah. And the old idea was, hey, let's break down walls. And that will lead to an unprecedented transfer of information and goods and services and ideas. And that is true. But the rising tide didn't lift all ships, right? It created a lot of economic inequality and winners and losers. And that allows for populist leaders who are charismatic to come in and say us versus them. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: In the midst of all of this, though, like, there have been these larger, bigger questions about - in this moment of flux for the entire world, like, who's in charge? Some of the things that an American president would customarily do to show that they are leader of the free world, Trump doesn't like to do those things. And you've seen an ascendant China. Am I weird to ask, Elise, right now, like, who is really in charge? And is it harder to know that now as opposed to - I don't know - 10, 20 years ago? </p><p>ELISE HU: I do think China is worth watching. We are seeing a rise of Asia and just a rise of the East in a way that's unchecked in the way that it was under the Obama administration and a stronger NATO and a stronger UN just a couple of years ago. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: You know what's - coincidentally, I went on a double date yesterday to the Nixon Library, which... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: OK. Pause right there. We got to absorb that for a second. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: ...Which was - I mean, I know. I know. I don't mean to brag, but I did. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: And it was fascinating. And there was this whole exhibit on Nixon and China... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: ...And Kissinger and China. And it was in the mid-70s. And one thing that really conveyed was how crazy it was to think about a U.S. president going to China, right? </p><p>ELISE HU: Right. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Like, it was so closed off to the world. It had 750 million people, but it was almost like the black hole of the globe, right? </p><p>ELISE HU: Speaking of authoritarian nationalists, right? - Mao Zedong. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Exactly. And here we are now - what? - a little over 40 years later. And suddenly, China seems like it has a place on the world stage that the U.S. once did. I mean, its pivot in 40 years is remarkable. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: This trend of globalism in crisis, of creeping authoritarianism, is there any end in sight to it, Elise? </p><p>ELISE HU: I think there's going to have to be a reckoning. I mean... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Whoa, sounds dark. </p><p>ELISE HU: ...Because what we're watching is manufacturing jobs - right? - which used to be helpful in lifting the developing world into the middle class. Those are going to go away because they're getting replaced by automation and technological innovation, right? And unless there is more of an evening out - right? There needs to be less economic inequality in a lot of these countries. Unless that happens, we are headed for some sort of reckoning. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: All right. Erich, are you going to cheer us up with your three words? </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: I was going to say... </p><p>ELISE HU: Please do. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: I wish I brought some more optimism... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: (Laughter). </p><p>ELISE HU: Uh oh. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: ...To the proceedings. But... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: It's OK. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: My three words are terms of service because I think if you look at the past year, we've really seen a referendum on tech companies... </p><p>ELISE HU: Yeah. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: ...And it - when it comes to how everyday users think about their relationship with tech companies. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: And we should ID those companies. They're the FANGs, right? </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Well, there's the FANGs. Right. There's Facebook, Amazon - would that be Netflix? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Netflix. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: ...And Google. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: But there's also - I think Twitter's in there for sure. I mean, like, it's really almost overwhelming when you think about in the past 12 months, the number of scandals and the amount of drama we've had around these FANG companies. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: And they've all had them. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: They've all had them, whether it's, how does Twitter handle the president - right? - or Amazon announces they're building a second headquarters in New York City. And the conversation immediately shifts to, how much public money should they get? - and whether or not that's unfair. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: It almost feels like how - you know, like, there was a moment in the '80s where, like, the captains of finance and stock market were, like, revered in the superheroes of Wall Street. And then all of a sudden, we were like, oh, they're actually doing some bad things. </p><p>ELISE HU: (Laughter). </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Is Silicon Valley having that reckoning where the boys who were ascendant kind of have to deal with the fallout now? And if so, what does that fallout look like? - because in spite of all of the stories about how they're behaving badly, Congress doesn't want to regulate them just yet. I mean, who is in charge? Who's going to keep tabs? </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Well, I think there has been some fallout because for a long time, traditionally, the Democrats were on the tech companies' side, right? Now it seems like both sides are mad at them for different reasons. The Republicans are mad for a number of reasons. The Democrats are also mad, in large part because of all of the news that's broken since the election and... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: ...Facebook's role in it, right? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: But, like, can Congress come together to regulate them? </p><p>ELISE HU: Absolutely. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: 'Cause right now they haven't. </p><p>ELISE HU: I mean... </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Oh, yeah. </p><p>ELISE HU: But in Europe they're... </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: The EU did. </p><p>ELISE HU: Yeah, the EU is already regulating these tech companies and being far more - or they're applying a lot more scrutiny to Facebook than the United States has. The United States Congress is problematic largely because of the demographics of Congress. I don't know if y'all saw Mark Zuckerberg get questioned, but it was painful. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF HEARING)        </p><p>ORRIN HATCH: How do you sustain a business model in which users don't pay for your service? </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG: Senator, we run ads. </p><p>ELISE HU: And I think (laughter) people who understand and are more digitally native might be able to better regulate and better look at these issues and care about them. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: But, like, there's not this wave of people turning off geolocation on their phones. I haven't seen people stop using Google or stop buying stuff on Amazon. </p><p>ELISE HU: We... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: In some ways, these things are part of our lives. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Not yet. I do think it's getting very loud, though. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Really? </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: I think it's getting very loud. And I think people's sort of perception and understanding of data and how they are the product is - it's definitely... </p><p>ELISE HU: More savvy, for sure. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: It's more savvy, for sure. I don't think the dam has burst yet, right? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: But it seems like we're getting there. </p><p>ELISE HU: Though - haven't you noticed, though, even among your friends and peers, that Facebook use has declined? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: I use Facebook less. I - like... </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Oh, for sure. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...This year compared to last year... </p><p>ELISE HU: Yeah. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...I use Facebook maybe 25 percent as much. </p><p>ELISE HU: And now I have a creep-out factor. I have that creep factor when I get reminders about, hey, this is what you were doing seven years ago because it's a constant reminder to me that they know everything about me and on the dates that I posted what. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: I mean - but also, it's like I spend less time on Facebook now, but I spend more time on Instagram... </p><p>ELISE HU: Right, and Instagram... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...Which is owned by Facebook. </p><p>ELISE HU: ...Is owned by Facebook. And it does the same thing now. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>ELISE HU: Instagram is sending you your memories, too. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. I will say there's some weird stuff that I'm getting, like, that is just freaking me out even more. One thing that Google Maps does now on my smartphone that I never asked it to do - it makes note of where I park my car and it'll say, you parked here. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: You know what? I find it quite helpful, actually... </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: ...As someone who has lost his car before. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: All right, you guys. I have three words to sum up my year of news. And it would be time has stopped because I think you felt this coming on in 2016. It got worse in 2017, but now we've reached a point in our never-ending news cycles where you can never actually tell how much time has gone by, what time it actually is. The days bleed into each other. The weeks bleed into different months. My news biological clock has stopped... </p><p>ELISE HU: Yeah. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...'Cause it can't keep up anymore. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: And the metabolism... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>ELISE HU: There's... </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: ...That we take things in and receive them and discard them is crazy. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>ELISE HU: Well, time is elastic, too, right? There's parts of the year that feel super long and then parts that feel like they rush by. But we have been in this chaos mode, I think, for a couple of years now. You know, when I was living in - abroad, for example, we were either 12 or 13 hours ahead of U.S. East Coast time. And I would have to sleep with a phone in a different room because there are so many news cycles in the United States in a given day. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: (Laughter) Yes. </p><p>ELISE HU: Had I kept my phone in my room, it'd just be, like, dinging all night. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Oh, yeah. And, like, all of the data that we see about how news consumers feel about this - they are stressed. So Pew asks folks a lot of the time how they feel about their news consumption trends. And earlier this year, they found that about 7 in 10 Americans feel worn out by the amount of news there is these days. That is pretty much in line with 2016 and 2017, as well. It's, like, people are tired, and they're newsed out. And I don't know. What is the fix? </p><p>ELISE HU: We're just sitting here in silence. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: (Laughter). I would say read a newspaper. </p><p>ELISE HU: Please note silence. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: I would say read a newspaper. Honestly, like, when I take time to read a... </p><p>ELISE HU: You mean a hard copy of a newspaper. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: A hard copy of a newspaper - when I take time to read a physical paper that is not my phone and doesn't give me the option to scroll through seven different screens at once, I feel like I can put my phone down more throughout the day 'cause I feel like I already have a baseline of knowledge to start my day with. I also think that newsrooms have to do a really good job of, in every story that we tell, giving our readers and listeners kind of context. </p><p>ELISE HU: Context. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: There's so much, like, this thing just happened and not, how did we get here? But, you know... </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Yeah, and I think - to rush to the defense of the news industry - I think that there have been a couple of examples of that this year where the context has broken through, and the story has slowed down a little bit. One, I think, was the reports on climate change. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: I think in others - I think for the most part, coverage of immigration has been very methodical and responsible. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: So I think that there are definitely examples where people have resisted the urge to rush on to the next thing. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. I will say there have been a few times this year where I've just forgotten my phone at home. And I end the day feeling better about the world. So... </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: That's the other thing, too. It's like - you know, Elise, you mentioned, like, the - a million alerts that you wake up to. Like, those moments where you do step away for whatever reason, whether you're on vacation or you leave your phone at home - and you come back at the end of the day and you realize that there have been, like, seven miniscandals that you've not seen or digested. And it's... </p><p>ELISE HU: And it's fine. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Yeah, you're - like, you haven't missed much of anything. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: We're going to take a little break. When we come back, we'll play my favorite game, Who Said That. I'm Sam Sanders. You're listening to IT'S BEEN A MINUTE from NPR. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF FLEVANS' \"FLICKER\")        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: You're listening to IT'S BEEN A MINUTE from NPR. This is a special year-end edition of the show. I'm Sam Sanders, here with Elise Hu, correspondent at NPR West, covering the future. </p><p>ELISE HU: Oh, hi. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Also here with Eric Schwartzel. He covers the film industry for The Wall Street Journal. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Hello. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Before we get back into the news-news of the year, do either of you have any New Year's resolutions? </p><p>ELISE HU: I have one. I would like to reconnect with my friends in person. So we were just talking... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: You're doing it right now. </p><p>ELISE HU: Like, right - as in right now, I'm already getting started on my 2019 resolution. </p><p>No. I mean, I think we do a lot of communication by Slack and by various messaging apps, right? But one thing I'm going to really work on in 2019 is actually trying to see my friends who are here in the United States and that I can get to pretty easily and spend some quality time with them, not electronically. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: I think that's a - I think that's a great resolution. I have a little bit of a variation on that, which is being better at staying in touch - right? - which is harder - right? - because you're not going to be seeing people in person as much. But I think trying to do a better job of staying in touch is one of my resolutions. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. I think my resolution will be, one, to cook more. It is so easy, when you live alone, to just be like 10 bucks for pad thai... </p><p>ELISE HU: Right. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Yeah. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...Is actually worth it. </p><p>ELISE HU: Right. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: It's actually worth it. But... </p><p>ELISE HU: Don't have to clean up. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. Cooking - one, it brings you down after a stressful day. It is very meditative and calming. You eat better when you do it, so I want to do more of that. </p><p>ELISE HU: Oh, good. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: One of my resolutions, also, next year is to not get into any arguments over politics with anyone that I know. </p><p>ELISE HU: Oh. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: And this is a season in which it feels like fights about politics are everywhere. </p><p>ELISE HU: Is that necessarily a good thing, though, because isn't collision actually helpful? </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Yeah. I was going to say, how do you delineate arguments and debates? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: If anyone raises their voice, I got to stop. I can't do it. That's my bar. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: OK. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: That's my bar. But it's harder and harder to not raise your voice when you talk about politics today because our politics has been, as we know, more divided and seemingly more high-stakes with everyone hating the other side more than ever before. </p><p>Turns out there's actually data to back this up. Research shows that for the first time in more than 20 years, members of both parties hold strongly unfavorable views of their opponents. One political scientist who is an expert in this current season of political animus is Lilliana Mason. She has a book out this year. It's called \"Uncivil Agreement,\" and it's all about just how and why we got this divided and this angry, and what it might take to change that. </p><p>I called up Professor Mason and said, how did we get so bad? How do we fix it? She talked me off the ledge. </p><p>Professor Mason, hello. </p><p>LILLIANA MASON: Hello. Thank you for having me on. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: I guess before we start, you cover politics very closely. On a scale of 1 to 10, how crazy was this year in politics for you? </p><p>LILLIANA MASON: I don't want to - I don't want to outrule there being a worse, crazier year next year, so I'm going to go with, like, a 9.75. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: That is very specific. </p><p>LILLIANA MASON: Yeah. There's always room. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. So the title of your book is \"Uncivil Agreement: How Politics Became Our Identity.\" First and foremost, tell me what you mean when you say that our politics is our identity. </p><p>LILLIANA MASON: So a couple of things. One is that partisanship is increasingly behaving like a social identity. And social identity is any group that you feel identified with. And we used to think that party was something that we thought through, we were very rational. </p><p>And then, in the last few decades, it's really started behaving more like a religion, where, you know, we feel like we're associated with the other people in the group. We defend them whenever they're being insulted or threatened. And we don't convert. We don't leave the group without huge amounts of pressure. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. How did it get this way? And why did it get this way? </p><p>LILLIANA MASON: The story that I tell really starts after the Civil Rights Act of 1964... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>LILLIANA MASON: ...When the Democrats passed the Civil Rights Act, and then a lot of Southern Democrats were disaffected because of that. And so what we saw was a couple decades of conservative Southern Democrats gradually leaving the Democratic Party. And that generation of people, I think, ultimately became independents. And then their children were able to move to be Republicans. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: So race was that dividing line. </p><p>LILLIANA MASON: Yes, racial attitudes and race. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Got you. </p><p>LILLIANA MASON: And then, also, in the 1980s and 1990s, the religious right became politically active. And so it wasn't just the party of white people, it was the party of white Christian people or white evangelicals, very specifically. </p><p>So the parties started to really become different socially. And when that happens, then people get very clear cues about which party they're supposed to be in, and those cues are very social. And so people become committed to the party in a way that they hadn't been able to during the '70s and '80s, when all of these things were sort of in flux. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: So then what does it mean if we're now in this political era where our parties are our identity? What does that do for the discourse? </p><p>LILLIANA MASON: So one of the major problems is that when a social identity is really strong, the content of it becomes less important. So if you think about two teams playing in the Super Bowl, one of them you're really, really rooting for, if they win, you feel fantastic, but you don't really care what they do after they win. </p><p>And so when you turn these partisan identities into much more of a kind of, you know, sports-type competition, accountability is reduced because we watch our party win. We feel very, very excited. But then, if they do something we don't like, we're not going to leave them. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>LILLIANA MASON: And so... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Because it's your team. It's your family. </p><p>LILLIANA MASON: Right. Because having them lose is actually more painful to us than seeing them do something that's bad for the nation as a whole. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: So then if this - it seems as if, like, some of this tribalization in identity politics is specific to this era and this time in our politics. But it's also just, like, human nature. </p><p>LILLIANA MASON: Yeah. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Like, has this always been with us? Has there been - have there been times like this before in our history where it was just as bad? </p><p>LILLIANA MASON: So the important thing is that, yes, this is totally human nature, and every single person is going to do this, no matter what. I mean, there is - you know, it is kind of inevitable. And not only is it inevitable, but it's actually kind of good because that's how we make society. You know, we wouldn't have - we wouldn't have society or civilization without a sense of who is us and who is them and, you know, who gets the resources from the group. You know, sort of on an evolutionary level, this makes sense. </p><p>The problem is that some of our earliest, you know, scholars of American politics, and even sociologists, and going all the way back, actually, to James Madison, observed that our society is going to be stable as long as all of our social divisions are sort of crisscrossing. So another person might be in your in-group religiously but in your out-group politically. And what we've seen over the last few decades is that these crosscutting identities have been disappearing. So... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Give me an example. </p><p>LILLIANA MASON: So if you take two random Republicans right now, the chance that they're both white and Christian is quite high. Now, the same is not true of Democrats. If you take two random Democrats, the chance that they're both the same race and the same religion is actually pretty low. </p><p>But the fact that we have, effectively, these two socially separate parties means that there are very few opportunities for partisans to either think of each other as human beings or to spend social time with each other or... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: To see commonality, I guess, is what you're saying. </p><p>LILLIANA MASON: Yeah. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Given the crazy, crazy partisanship and identity politics and anger and hatred that we see right now in this political moment, what is the fix? You have laid out very clearly what the problems are. Is there any way out of this moment? </p><p>LILLIANA MASON: Yeah. So the classic sort of cure for intergroup conflict is - one of them is contact. And we don't have a lot of social contact between Democrats and Republicans. We tend to, you know, shop at different grocery stores and, you know, wear different brands of clothing, even. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Send our kids to different schools. </p><p>LILLIANA MASON: Exactly. Drive different cars. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>LILLIANA MASON: And so one thing that we could do is try to get people together. And what, you know, sort of a grand solution to this would be some sort of national service, right? In the military, racial animosity tends to be suppressed because everyone's working towards the same goal. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: You all go through basic training together. </p><p>LILLIANA MASON: Right. And you're all on the same side. And you're all cooperating. And you have to have each other's backs all the time. And so there's just no room for distrust and dehumanization of your fellow soldiers. </p><p>But it doesn't have to be a war that does that, right? We could have any major project or any collaborative situation in which you have people from both sides working together. That could help to make us understand each other as human beings in another way. </p><p>Another thing would be, you know, something that we did. If you think about when we were sort of trying to - after the Civil Rights Act - right? - trying to make it so that our society as a whole was less racist, we kind of set up some rules about, you know, what kind of portrayals of in- and out-group members you're allowed to have on TV, even in, like, a sitcom level, you know, the words people are allowed to use in public to describe in-groups and out-groups. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: And to at least pretend to have a civil discourse, kind of. </p><p>LILLIANA MASON: And to - yeah - and to be tolerant. You know, just the difference between the language that my dad grew up hearing and the language that I grew up hearing, you know, as relates to race, is massively different. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>LILLIANA MASON: And so if there were to be some, you know, new sense of impropriety of treating our fellow Americans, who are our partisan opponents, but they're still our fellow Americans - and treating them in this derogatory way. You know, that could become more - less socially acceptable through some means that I actually don't - I'm not - I don't know. I don't know how to do it. But maybe the media can help. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Professor Mason, thank you so much. Your book \"Uncivil Agreement: How Politics Became Our Identity\" is out now. And I got to say, I love the cover - two boxing gloves right there on the front. </p><p>LILLIANA MASON: And they're tied together. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yes. As we all are... </p><p>LILLIANA MASON: As we all are. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...In this great American experiment. Thank you so much. </p><p>LILLIANA MASON: Thank you so much for having me on. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: That's kind of sad. </p><p>ELISE HU: Yeah, I mean, especially this notion that we treat policy ideas and political parties like sports teams. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>ELISE HU: Because what we see with sports teams is you're so loyal that you're willing to forgive their cheating, aka Patriots - Deflategate, Bill Belichick. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Also, if you're a Boston sports fan, you'll torch a car whether your team wins or loses. </p><p>ELISE HU: That's the thing. And so if you think of it that way, you forget - like, you really dehumanize the opponents. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Right. And you have these situations where the same news event is received as two different realities, right? Like the Kavanaugh hearings was, I think... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Oh, yeah. Yeah. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: ...Probably the best example of that. The thing that struck me about the interview is when she said that, you know, a lot of these groups now, it's - you face enormous pressure if you leave. It almost - she's describing, like, a cult. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: (Laughter). </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: And it was so interesting because I was thinking about the primaries and how that's going to be a real issue for both parties, right? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Oh, my God. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Like, Democrats are - I mean, any Democrat that's... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Have you been watching Dem primary Twitter already? It's - oh, God, it's... </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: No, I can't say I have. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Like, there's already this squabbling over, like, liberal purity amongst the 27,000... </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Exactly, and it's to this... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...Candidates for president. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Exactly, Sam. To this point - right? - like, what is a Democrat? And I think on the Republican side, you'll probably have this question about whether Trump-ism is Republicanism, right? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. All right. It's time for a break. When we come back, we'll play my favorite game Who Said That, special year-end edition. </p><p>ELISE HU: I'm so excited. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: I'm a little nervous. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: We'll be right back. </p><p>Hey, y'all. Sam here once again asking for your money. Even a few dollars helps out your local public radio station, which in turn helps out this show. Give now at donate.npr.org/sam - donate.npr.org/sam. Thank you. </p><p>You're listening to IT'S BEEN A MINUTE from NPR. This is a special year-end edition of the show. Instead of catching up on the week that was, we're catching up on all of 2018. I'm Sam Sanders here with two guests - Elise Hu, correspondent for NPR West, and her beat is the future. </p><p>ELISE HU: Hello. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Also here with Erich Schwartzel. He covers the film industry for The Wall Street Journal. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Hey, Sam. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: All right. It is time for a very special year-end edition of my favorite game Who Said That. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"REAL HOUSEWIVES OF ATLANTA\")        </p><p>KANDI BURRUSS: Who had been saying that? </p><p>PORSHA WILLIAMS: Who said that? </p><p>KENYA MOORE: Who said that? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: So I'm going to read a quote from the news in 2018. It could come from anywhere in 2018. You have to guess who uttered that quote or at least get the story it comes from - get a few key words. The winner gets - I guess you can say that you won the year-end edition of Who Said That. </p><p>ELISE HU: That's... </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: OK, I'll take that. </p><p>ELISE HU: Bragging rights. </p><p>                (CROSSTALK)        </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I can update my resume. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: And we made these kind of easy 'cause I want to help y'all out. </p><p>ELISE HU: OK, great. Great. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: The last - I think the... </p><p>ELISE HU: I never get any Who Said Thats correct, but I just love this game. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Elise, I think the first time I was on this show, one of my guesses was Steve Harvey. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: It was, like, so embarrassing. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: I do think about him a lot. </p><p>ELISE HU: I'm just going to say France. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Yeah. </p><p>ELISE HU: I'm going to say France for all my answers. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: France, France. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: I do think about Steve Harvey a lot. </p><p>ELISE HU: France, 1872. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Yeah, right. The Strait of Gibraltar. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: What is the... </p><p>ELISE HU: The Treaty of Utrecht, the treaty... </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: What is the Strait of Gibraltar? </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Daily double. Ready? First quote, \"I really don't care. Do you?\" </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Melania Trump's jacket. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)        </p><p>ELISE HU: Oh, jacket (laughter). </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yes, yes. </p><p>ELISE HU: Zara (laughter). </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yes. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Zara designer. </p><p>ELISE HU: No, my answer... </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Zara designer. </p><p>ELISE HU: ...Is correct. I feel (laughter)... </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: I might actually have to give that to her. The Zara... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: OK. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: The Zara designer - that's inspired. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: The Zara designer I'll give you. All right. So this quote comes from a Zara jacket that first lady Melania Trump wore earlier this year in June. She was heading to New Hope Children's Shelter in McAllen, Texas, to visit immigrant children, including some of those who were separated from their parents this year as part of a Trump policy. But the back of her jacket, which came from Zara, read... </p><p>ELISE HU: Thank you. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...I really don't care. Do you? Queue a thousand think pieces saying that the first lady was being extremely callous to these children, to the viewing public, et cetera. But a few months later, she came out and said, actually, that was meant for the press. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)        </p><p>MELANIA TRUMP: It was for the people and for the left-wing media who are criticizing me. And I want to show them that I don't care. You could criticize - whatever you want to say, you can say. But it will not stop me to do what I feel is right. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Should we give half of a point to each of you because one got Zara... </p><p>ELISE HU: Sure (laughter). </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...And one got... </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: I think that's fair. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...Got Melania? </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: This could end in a tie. And that would be a disaster, though. </p><p>ELISE HU: (Laughter). </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah, yeah. So you both have .5 of a point. </p><p>ELISE HU: Oh, amazing. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Ready for the second quote? These are really easy, you guys. You're going to get this. Here's the quote. \"Beyonce's at the bar. So I said to Beyonce, did she really bite you?\" Y'all forgot this story? </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Oh, was this Tiffany Haddish telling that story? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yes. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)        </p><p>ELISE HU: Oh. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Yes, yes. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Tiffany Haddish, the ascendant comic and actress of the moment... </p><p>ELISE HU: Yep. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: She was profiled by GQ earlier this year, and she talked about being at a party that Beyonce was also at. And she talked about seeing this moment where some other celebrity, an unnamed actress, bit Beyonce. </p><p>ELISE HU: So crazy. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Tiffany saw it, went over to Beyonce and said, if you want me to, I will fight this woman for you. Beyonce, because she is the queen... </p><p>ELISE HU: Right. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...Said, no, don't do that; we're good. But after this profile ran, the entire universe stopped for a good week or two to figure out who bit Beyonce. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Stars are just like us. </p><p>ELISE HU: Was it Becky? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: I've never bitten (laughter)... </p><p>ELISE HU: Was it Becky? </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: I've never gotten bitten at a party. I don't know why I said that. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: All that to say, I'm pretty sure that Tiffany Haddish will be getting no top-secret party invites from Beyonce 'cause if you - I mean, the first rule about Beyonce is... </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Loose lips sink ships. </p><p>ELISE HU: Right. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: There you go. Snitches get stitches. </p><p>ELISE HU: Yeah. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: You - we'll give you a full point for that, Erich. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Thank you. </p><p>ELISE HU: Good work. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: So you have 1.5 now. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: I have the lead. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Let's say that this last quote will be worth 1.5 points. </p><p>ELISE HU: Oh (laughter). </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Oh, no. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: So if Elise gets it... </p><p>ELISE HU: OK. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...We'll go to a tie-breaker. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Stakes are being raised. </p><p>ELISE HU: OK. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: The stakes are high. The third one, we're just going to play you some audio, actually. OK. </p><p>ELISE HU: Oh, awesome. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)        </p><p>COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE: Laurel. Laurel. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Remember that? </p><p>ELISE HU: No. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)        </p><p>COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE: Laurel. Laurel. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Oh, my God (laughter). It sounds like we're, like, Jodie Foster in \"Contact.\" We're, like... </p><p>ELISE HU: Yeah, is this (laughter)... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: (Laughter). </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: We're, like, getting radio signals from, like, some distant star. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: How did y'all totally forget this story? </p><p>ELISE HU: WALL-E. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Is this - but I think I do know it. I think I do know it. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: OK. </p><p>ELISE HU: OK. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: It's the audio test, right? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yes. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: That, like, sounds different to different... </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF ORGAN)        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: That's it. You got it, Erich. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Thank you. Thank you. </p><p>ELISE HU: Oh, look at you, the grand - yeah. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: So Laurel versus Yanny was the... </p><p>ELISE HU: That's right. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: ...Blue dress, white dress challenge of 2018. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Right. Right. </p><p>ELISE HU: And it was the audio version, yes. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yes. So there was... </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: I heard Laurel. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: I heard Laurel too. </p><p>ELISE HU: Me too. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: So there was this audio that hit Reddit earlier this year. Some high school students put it up from a vocabulary website that they heard on speakers on a computer at their school. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Oh, I didn't know that was the - I love how industrious they are. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: I know. So they were like, half the class hears Yanny. Half the class hears Laurel. Internet, help us decide. </p><p>ELISE HU: (Laughter). </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: That's great. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Took the internet by storm to the point where major newsrooms were, like, manipulating the audio to help you hear both Yanny and Laurel. </p><p>ELISE HU: (Laughter). </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Wow. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: It was - it's - honestly, it was a nice way to not think about the news. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: And you know what? Those kids all got an easy college application essay. </p><p>ELISE HU: That time I (laughter)... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: How does that essay start? Remember that time I broke the internet? </p><p>ELISE HU: Right (laughter). </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: We heard different things, but we came together. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: (Laughter). </p><p>ELISE HU: Look at you. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: You could wrap it up... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: As I will do with... </p><p>ELISE HU: You went to college (laughter). </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: You could wrap it really nicely. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: You really could. You really could. Erich... </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Thank you. </p><p>                (APPLAUSE)        </p><p>SAM SANDERS: I'm happy to say, the special year-end edition of Who Said That, you've won. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Wow, that's a... </p><p>ELISE HU: This is major. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: This is awesome. Thank you. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: How will you use your crown? </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Well, I'm going to ask for the LinkedIn endorsements from both of you... </p><p>SAM SANDERS: OK. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: ...Yes - on this. </p><p>ELISE HU: This'll be the only LinkedIn endorsement I will have ever written, but I'm proud to do it. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: (Laughter) Thank you. That's all I need. </p><p>ELISE HU: I'm also going to do a testimonial on your Friendster. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: (Laughter). </p><p>ELISE HU: Yeah. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: I'm going to poke you on Facebook. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Oh, sweet. All right. </p><p>ELISE HU: No. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: All right. Erich, congrats. </p><p>ELISE HU: Thank you. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Let's go out the way that we started, with some music from Fleetwood Mac, 2018's hottest, newest, oldest band. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF FLEETWOOD MAC SONG, \"RHIANNON\")        </p><p>ELISE HU: Congrats. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: I'm so excited to know that the youth are discovering Fleetwood Mac all for themselves. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Oh, yeah. They're our hope for the future. </p><p>ELISE HU: Did you go see them? They were here in LA last week. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: No, I'm going to see them in Atlanta with my boyfriend in March. </p><p>ELISE HU: OK, so you're on it. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: It's a whole big thing. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Take me with you (laughter). </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: I have seen them, though. I have seen them. And what I really appreciate is their self-awareness. They know why people come to see them. Stevie gets her tambourine out. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: She has that, like, cape (laughter). Yeah. </p><p>ELISE HU: Yep. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: She twirls. I mean, they're like, we know exactly why you're here. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: And you're here to see Stevie... </p><p>ELISE HU: And some... </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: ...Dress like a witch and twirl. </p><p>ELISE HU: Don't play that out. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Came for the hits. Yeah. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Oh, yeah. Oh, for sure. Yeah. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Yeah, yeah. That is Fleetwood Mac with \"Rhiannon.\" Fleetwood Mac has seen a near 60 percent increase in streams this year and last from young people, 2018. Who knew? All right. Thank you both for doing this special year-end edition of our show. Elise Hu, correspondent for NPR West, covering the future. I appreciate you. Here's to a happy 2019. </p><p>ELISE HU: Happy 2019 to all of you. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Oh, yeah. Eric Schwartzel, covering the film industry for the Wall Street Journal. Thank you so much as well. </p><p>ERICH SCHWARTZEL: Hey, thank you, Sam. Happy New Year. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"RHIANNON\")        </p><p>FLEETWOOD MAC: (Singing) ....The wind. Would you stay if she promised you heaven? Will you ever win? </p><p>SAM SANDERS: All right. Now it's time in the show, as we always do - every week, we ask our listeners to share with us the best thing that happened to them all week. This week, we went big. We asked you to tell us the best things that happened to you all year. I was very impressed. Let's take a listen. </p><p>MARGARET: Hi, Sam. The best thing that happened to me this year was buying my girlfriend's engagement ring. It's coming next week. I can't wait. </p><p>JOSHUA: Hi, Sam. This is Joshua (ph). And the best thing that happened to me this year was getting to roam around my beautiful partner Nina's (ph) home country of Switzerland. </p><p>RACHEL: I went to Ireland this summer. </p><p>SUSAN: I went to Iceland. </p><p>EMILY: My best friend and I went on our big bucket list trip to Australia, and it was amazing. </p><p>RACHEL: The best thing that happened to me all year was being the first person on my mom's side of the family to graduate from college. </p><p>SUSAN: The best thing that happened to me all year was I moved back to Pittsburgh with my husband to start law school. </p><p>MARK: I got married to the love of my life. </p><p>KELSEY: I got married at the end of September. </p><p>MARK: I also voted in my very first election. </p><p>ANDREW: This is Andrew in Portland, Ore. The best thing that happened to me this year was that my parents and my little brother drove 1,437 miles to come visit me and my partner for Thanksgiving. My parents got to meet their grand-dog (ph). We made all the family recipes. And at the end of it all, my parents said they understand why I like it here. </p><p>KATIE: Hi, Sam. This is Katie (ph) from Raleigh, N.C. And the best thing that happened to me this year was reconnecting with a student of mine from 10 years ago. When he was in my class, he'd been struggling. He slept a lot. And he came to school hungry every day. When I realized what was happening, I made sure that he always had food in my classroom. But eventually, he dropped out. I never knew what happened to him, but I thought about him all the time. </p><p>And then earlier this year, out of nowhere, I got an email from what turned out to be his wife, who he met in my class. And they came to visit me and introduced me to their beautiful daughter. It was an incredible experience to see how they found each other, how they helped each other and how happy they were, most importantly. Happy new year. </p><p>RACHEL: Have a great holiday season, Sam. And thanks for your show. </p><p>ANDREW: Thanks. </p><p>KATIE: Bye. </p><p>SAM SANDERS: Thanks to all those listeners - Margaret (ph), Joshua, Rachel (ph), Susan (ph), Emily (ph), Julie (ph), Mark (ph), Kelsey (ph), Andrew (ph) and Katie. And I want to take one quick second to thank one of the best parts of my year, our listeners. Thank you all for hanging on with this show for all 2018. I'm looking forward to going even further and higher in 2019. </p><p>OK. We're back with a regular weekly wrap next Friday. And on Tuesday, we're going to bring you an encore episode of my conversation with the esteemed Broadway actress and television star Jenifer Lewis. You know her from \"Black-ish.\" It was one of my favorite chats from last year. Enjoy that, and happy new year. Talk to you in 2019. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SAMSAN-201812281501</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SAMSAN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V2N-K5M1-DY1J-T487-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">461093</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8489\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 National Public Radio \u00ae All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>It's Been a Minute with Sam Sanders</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 28, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>Complaints</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjE5NkU3QTg0MjkzNEE2QUIxMkQ0Qjk2N0JGREFDNUE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUVEMjA3RkFDQTBGNDA5Njg2MjA2QjZBQjlBMjUxQTg</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009UHV</classCode><className>MUSIC</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST0008WTA</classCode><className>SPACE EXPLORATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001424</classCode><className>PUBLIC BROADCASTING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001432</classCode><className>PUBLIC RADIO</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DPKP</classCode><className>BIG TECH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST0008WTA</classCode><className>SPACE EXPLORATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>ST000A28M</classCode><className>MARS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Here are the issues we're watching in the year ahead and their potential impact on local business.<br/></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GE's ripple effect: Almost as soon as General Electric revealed last January that it was moving its headquarters to Boston, talk started about the \"next GE.\" Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh and others said that GE's arrival is a big deal - and that the up to $145 million in state and city incentives are worthwhile - in part because of the other businesses it would help to attract here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Check out the Business Journal's <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2016/12/15/the-smoke-clears-on-2016.html\">Year in Review</url> for Greater Boston's biggest business stories of 2016.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Some of the same ingredients that wooed GE to Boston are still present. GE CEO Jeff Immelt was wowed by the bipartisan cooperation exhibited by Walsh and <person><nameText>Gov. Charlie Baker. </nameText></person>Walsh appears on his way to re-election in 2017, and Baker, still enjoying high approval ratings, has half of his term to go. The state now has more powerful financial incentives at its disposal to appeal to out-of-state companies, part of the economic development bill passed last summer. Certainly the region's technology and higher-education sectors are still going strong.<br/></p><p>If the next GE is mulling a move here, it will have to move quickly to get into Boston's hottest neighborhoods, though. Kendall Square is booked solid real estate-wise, and GE's future neighborhood, the Seaport District, is filling up quickly. Tech giant Red Hat has announced plans to move in next to GE, and Reebok said in December it's taking 220,000 square feet there for a new headquarters. - Greg Ryan</p><p>Regulation redux: Like companies across the country, Massachusetts businesses are eager to see just how much President-elect <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>will slash regulation. But some of the changes will likely play out differently in Massachusetts than in other parts of the country.</p><p>Local businesses are likely to embrace Trump's proposal for massive infrastructure spending, as well as the corporate tax cuts that he's touted. His stance against the Dodd-Frank financial services law is welcomed by the state's banks. Businesses are holding their breath to see what the new administration will do with the Obama rule expanding overtime pay, which is already in limbo thanks to a Texas judge's temporary blocking of the rule in November.</p><p>Other elements of the Trump platform present more of a mixed bag. If Trump's railing against free trade agreements leads to a weakening of NAFTA, Massachusetts businesses could be especially affected, since Canada and Mexico are the state's two top destinations for exports. And if Obamacare is repealed and the state's 2006 health care law goes back into full force, no one knows yet whether the changes made to the state law to comply with the federal one will remain in place if federal funding dries up. - Greg Ryan</p><p>Noncompete reform isn't dead yet: Massachusetts Speaker of the House Robert A. DeLeo laid the first planks across the yawning divide in the Massachusetts tech community when he came out in support of reforming noncompete agreements during a speech this past March. For a while, the bridge-building seemed to be going well between big tech companies like EMC - which has relied on the agreements to keep employees from jumping to competitors - and the startup community, which believes those agreements kill innovation.</p><p>Both the House and the Senate passed versions of a reform bill, but negotiations between the two chambers stretched into the final hours of the legislative session on July 31 and ultimately failed.</p><p>Don't expect the debate to disappear in 2017, though. Two key negotiators in the legislature, Rep. John Scibak and Sen. Dan Wolf, attended a White House discussion on noncompetes in October that \"re-jumpstarted\" talks between the two chambers.</p><p>Still, there are sticking points that will have to be worked out in the next session, including how long noncompetes can be enforced.</p><p>As for players in the business community, startups are likely to remain vocal in support of noncompete limits, but it remains to be seen whether EMC's recent merger with Dell will change that company's stance on the issue. - Kelly O'Brien</p><p>All eyes on cybersecurity: Like an umbrella salesman in Seattle, the cybersecurity industry should have an easy time arguing for the value of their wares in 2017. Hacking headlines are all around us - from ransomware attacks launched against corporations to foreign actors meddling with American politics - and are likely to continue in 2017.</p><p>The Boston area is well-positioned to take advantage of increased attention around cybersecurity. IBM Security unveiled its new Cambridge office in late 2016 and next year will begin training corporate teams in its X-Force Command Center \"cyber range\" - a room specially designed for real-time simulations of cyberattacks.</p><p>Established private companies, like Carbon Black and Veracode, are on the short list for IPOs or acquisitions in 2017. And smaller companies continue to arrive, ensuring that the industry remains competitive. <person><nameText>Gov. Charlie Baker </nameText></person>recently traveled to Israel to persuade startups there to establish their first U.S. headquarters in Boston.</p><p>The Advanced Cyber Security Center, a Massachusetts-based trade organization, will expand its focus beyond simple knowledge sharing in the next year. The center plans to put effort into getting more workers into the cybersecurity talent pipeline and toward organizing industry positions on public policy matters, a skill that will become more crucial as talk of hacking permeates our politics. - Kelly O'Brien</p><p>A rebound for drug approvals? The dearth of FDA approvals in 2016 - just 21 new drugs after the agency greenlighted more than 40 in each of the two previous years - could be short-lived, as the agency implements new legislation designed to get innovative medicines to patients faster, while potentially welcoming a new leader.</p><p>Approvals may tick back up as a result of the recently-passed 21st Century Cures Act, which aims to make trials smaller and more efficient, while giving greater weight to the views of patients and \"real world\" efficacy data, rather than just clinical data.</p><p>The bill could lead to more biotech success stories like that of Cambridge biotech Sarepta Therapeutics, which won a controversial FDA approval in September for its Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug despite limited trial data.</p><p>The 21st Century Cures Act is expected to help make the next generation of treatments possible, a sentiment shared by the Duchenne patient community which believes that every person with DMD, even those with the rarest mutations, deserves treatment.</p><p>President-elect <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>has also vowed to speed approvals as part of an effort to cut bureaucratic red tape, although he hasn't offered much in the way of detail. He could try to radically reshape the FDA's approach through his pick of a commissioner. - Max Stendahl</p><p>Luxury condo boom ... or bust: Luxury home sales hit record highs across several Boston neighborhoods this year, with citywide median sales prices for luxury condos hitting $913,500 in the third quarter of this year. Nowhere was that increase clearer than in the \"midtown\" area (encompassing Downtown Crossing and the Theater District), which saw Millennium Tower's 442 luxury units come online in July. Just 18 units are left to sell in the high-rise skyscraper, sales rep Patrick Cutter told the Business Journal in mid-December, which housing experts say is an unprecedented sales velocity.</p><p>Notably, the rush to sell Millennium Tower's 442 units is resulting in some significant flips. As one example, Unit 3703, a three-bedroom unit on the 37th floor, sold on Aug. 2 for $4.475 million; it was put back on the market on Dec. 12 with a listing price of $5.5 million, according to data from LINK Boston. Patrick Cutter, a sales executive with Millennium, told the Business Journal that several owners bought lower-floor units but decided to trade up to higher floors. Just 18 units were available for sale as of mid-December.</p><p>The question, of course, is whether that momentum can continue. Some developers are whispering about a slowdown in the luxury residential market - it's too hot, too overpriced, and too many units are going after the same clientele, they say. - Catherine Carlock</p><p>Trump, trade and tech: Given his campaign rhetoric against free trade deals, <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>election brings with it the specter of tariffs and trade wars, but the Massachusetts industries most likely to be affected by those developments are largely taking a wait-and-see approach.</p><p>Medical and surgical instruments are among the most heavily exported commodities in Massachusetts, with $5.8 billion worth of exports in 2014, according to the Massachusetts Office of International Trade and Investment. Electric machinery and industrial machinery, including computers, come in second and third, with $5 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, in exports in 2014.</p><p>The MassachusettsMedical Device Industry Council hasn't issued any statements on Trump's election or positions, but the national Medical Device Manufacturers Association applauded the nomination of Congressman Tom Price for Secretary of Health and Human Services. The other looming question in the tech world is how Trump will impact the macroeconomic landscape in a way that trickles down to investment trends and possible exits for startups. The stock markets have surged since Trump's election, but future uncertainty could make investors shy away from risky bets, making it harder for companies to IPO successfully, and possibly more difficult for them to negotiation acquisitions at the right price as well. - Kelly O'Brien</p><p>Towers on the horizon: Boston's tallest skyscraper - the 790-foot former John Hancock Tower - was built in 1976. The second-tallest - the 749-foot Prudential Tower - was built in 1964. So when crews wrapped up construction this summer on the 685-foot Millennium Tower, it was something of a novelty indeed, becoming the third-tallest tower in Boston.</p><p>But the future awaits - and the future is tall.</p><p>Foundation work continued this year at the Four Seasons Hotel &amp; Private Residences, a project developed by Cambridge's Carpenter &amp; Co. that will reach 740 feet when complete in 2018 - officially knocking Millennium Tower out of the No. 3 tallest tower spot.</p><p>Millennium Partners will get its chance to build what could eventually be Boston's second-tallest tower. Millennium won development rights of the 115 Winthrop Square site over five other development teams this year. Millennium has proposed a 775-foot tower, but the plan has one rub: a tower of that height would require a change in state shadow legislation.</p><p>Height also awaits at South Station: Texas development firm Hines this year successfully locked in capital from Chinese investment giant Gemdale Properties, and got city approval for its long-delayed 2.5 million-square-foot mixed-use project. Included in that project: a 677-foot tower. - Catherine Carlock</p><p>Figuring out marijuana: Those involved in the budding recreational marijuana industry will have a fire lit under them in the coming year. Adult use was approved by ballot in November, yet the regulations around the industry have yet to be spelled out, and the regulators that will oversee the industry and develop those guidelines have yet to be put in place.</p><p>The state is also figuring out how it will develop the technology that will manage dispensary applications and track weed from seed to sale.</p><p>Also yet to be determined is whether the edibles market should be allowed, and exactly how public safety officials will monitor drugged driving.</p><p>And then there's the federal government, where - in case you've forgotten - smoking pot for fun is still illegal. Appointees to Trump's administration have been staunchly opposed to marijuana in the past, and a seizure of one dispensary's assets could put a sudden stop to the industry as a whole. - Jessica Bartlett</p><p>Did you find this article useful?

The year, filled with churn and tumult and change, took an eternity to finish. He started the year grappling with a House suddenly in enemy hands, was forced to postpone his State of the Union and end a 35-day walkout without much to show for it. He had to make eight changes in his Cabinet, twice walked out angrily from meetings with Democratic leaders, absorbed criticism in the final report by Robert Mueller, saw foreign allies mock him, and watched his second North Korean summit go bad. And those were the good old days before a whistle-blower cried foul over his July phone call with the president of Ukraine. That dominated the final months of the year, resulting in his impeachment on Dec. 18. Any Christmastime review of President Trump's year would not be complete without mentioning one of his big disappointments his failure to buy Greenland. That would have made him the proud owner of 100,000 reindeer.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> George E.

Cory Booker (N.J.) said. \"We have seen it in the '16 election practices being used that have not been corrected now. We need regulation and reform.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) - who last week bought a Facebook ad claiming, in jest, that the platform had endorsed President Trump - reiterated her call Tuesday to break up what she called \"monopolists\" in Silicon Valley and pressed her rivals in Tuesday's debate to forgo donations from \"the big tech executives.\" Even former tech executive Andrew Yang expressed a desire to find \"the best way we can fight back against big tech companies.\"</p><p>The unanimity of criticism of Big Tech marked a sharp turnabout from 2008, when a then-young social media platform, Facebook, was skillfully deployed to help elect Barack Obama president. Those warm feelings are long past, damaged by Facebook's role in spreading disinformation against Democrat Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election campaign and its refusal to act more aggressively against viral falsehoods in this election season.</p><p>The growing frustration with Facebook and its Silicon Valley peers threatens to put the industry in the crosshairs of a future Democratic White House should the party prevail in 2020. Warren's call for the breakup of Facebook, Google and Amazon has generated backlash within the industry, most visibly when Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, told employees in July that he would \"go to the mat ... and fight\" such an effort in court.</p><p>\"Facebook was a company that was incredibly popular among the public writ large, and particularly liberals, prior to 2016. It now ranks with tobacco companies, oil companies and the NRA in driving Democratic anger,\" said Dan Pfeiffer, a White House communications director under Obama, whose use of Facebook in the 2008 campaign gave early hints of its power as a political organizing tool.</p><p>Facebook, Google and Twitter declined to comment on the growing Democratic disaffection with Silicon Valley. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>Democrats' animosity has only grown in response to Zuckerberg's recent courtship of conservatives, including dinners and other private meetings with right-leaning pundits and lawmakers - all at a time when some of Facebook's most visible leaders in Washington are conservatives, too.</p><p>Katie Harbath, a former Republican strategist, including for Rudolph W. Giuliani, Trump's personal attorney, is the company's public policy director for global elections. Facebook's vice president for global public policy is Joel Kaplan, a veteran of the George W. Bush White House who, last year, sat two rows behind then-U.S. Appeals Court Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh as he denied allegations of sexual misconduct before Congress and battled successfully for a seat on the Supreme Court.</p><p>Over the past few months, Zuckerberg has huddled with prominent conservatives, including Tucker Carlson, the Fox News host, and Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.), who oversees tech issues as chairman of his chamber's Judiciary Committee. The dinners, confirmed by a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about the private conversations, marked Facebook's latest efforts to try to shore up support with influential political figures on the right who at times have criticized Silicon Valley for targeting Republicans unfairly.</p><p>But the meetings, first reported by Politico, sparked immediate Democratic outrage, including a campaign on Twitter to get users to quit Facebook, under the hashtag #deletefacebook. The report also drew a rare, testy response from Zuckerberg himself, who posted on his Facebook profile that he has dinners with officials on all sides of the political spectrum. \"Meeting new people and hearing from a wide range of viewpoints is part of learning,\" he wrote. \"If you haven't tried it, I suggest you do!\"</p><p>Polls this year have found that large swaths of the American public are skeptical of leading technology companies. A Fox News poll in June asking whether Facebook had \"too much power\" found agreement from roughly three out of five Americans, with little variation based on race, income level, age, gender, region or party affiliation.</p><p>Distaste for major technology companies among conservatives has been obvious for years, with many Republicans - and especially Trump - bashing the industry for unproven allegations of liberal bias in moderating their platforms. They began voicing this critique forcefully ahead of the 2016 vote, leading to a summit in which top executives hosted prominent conservatives at Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif.</p><p>For Democrats, though, the shift in opinion followed the 2016 election, when Russian operatives used the platform and other social media to spread viral falsehoods, exposing major weaknesses at Facebook that domestic and foreign sources continue to exploit to this day.</p><p>\"I think that these companies have accomplished something that no one else has been able to accomplish, and that is a bipartisan, bad mood, with the word 'antitrust' being thrown around,\" said Rep. Anna G. Eshoo (D-Calif.), whose district includes part of Silicon Valley.</p><p>Just how deeply major technology companies have fallen out of favor with Democrats was evident Tuesday as 12 of the party's presidential aspirants took the stage outside of Columbus, Ohio. That a section of the three-hour dialogue was devoted to technology was on its own a sign of the shifting views of a party that once used Facebook and Google's YouTube video service to elevate the country's \"first social media president,\" as Obama was known.</p><p>Eric Schmidt, a top Google executive, was a visible supporter of Obama, and the company's alumni filled key roles in his White House. The industry also was a major source of money for Democrats. Donors in the communications and electronics sectors overwhelmingly backed Clinton in 2016, contributing roughly $62 million to her campaign and outside groups compared with roughly $7 million for Trump, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics.          </p><p>During a town hall at Facebook's headquarters in the spring of 2011, Obama extolled Facebook for fostering \"dialogue,\" creating the conditions for a \"healthy democracy.\" The Obama-era optimism about social media was reflected globally, with \"Facebook revolutions\" unfolding from the Arab Spring to Occupy Wall Street, from Tehran to Bucharest to Lower Manhattan.</p><p>No longer do Democrats cast Internet dwellers as engaged, enlightened citizens, however. Rather, in the words of Beto O'Rourke, the former congressman from Texas, they represent the \"product\" for social media platforms, which \"abuse that public trust ... at extraordinary profits.\"</p><p>For Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.), the problem stems from the current occupant of the Oval Office, who commands a massive online following, with more than 65 million users tracking the president's comments - many of them attacks on real and perceived rivals - on Twitter. Harris has asked Twitter to suspend Trump's account for violations of its policies against harassment and hateful conduct. The platform has declined to do so, but on Tuesday clarified the rare instances in which it would take action against world leaders.</p><p>Twitter also joined Facebook and Google in refusing a request by the campaign of Joe Biden, the former vice president, to stop airing an advertisement that made false claims about him and his son's actions in Ukraine.</p><p>That refusal - in contrast with CNN's decision not to air the ad, and NBCUniversal's move to stop airing it - has enraged Democrats and fueled calls for more regulation of campaign speech, putting the party starkly at odds with most of Silicon Valley. Facebook officials explicitly exempt the ads and other \"direct speech\" by politicians from their system of fact-checking, the creation of which was a key reform after Russians and others flooded Facebook, its subsidiary Instagram and other social media platforms with disinformation in 2016.</p><p>Warren's call on Democrats to forgo fundraising in Silicon Valley has not yet caught on. The San Francisco Bay area has been a frequent fundraising stop for Harris as well as for Biden and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, both of whom remained quiet during the exchange during the debate on the power of Silicon Valley.</p><p>Even the candidates who don't take contributions from Silicon Valley have still poured money into the companies based there, in the form of digital advertising. The Democratic presidential contenders have spent roughly $5 million on Facebook ads alone during a three-week period ending Oct. 5, according to data compiled by Bully Pulpit Interactive, a Democratic consultancy.</p><p>The action on the debate stage echoed complaints heard on Capitol Hill, where Democrats say Facebook, Google and other leading companies should be doing more - not just about disinformation but a range of other issues as well.</p><p>\"Before 2016, Silicon Valley was seen by Democrats as unambiguously good,\" said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), whose district includes part of Silicon Valley. \"Now some people in the Democratic Party and perhaps some in Silicon Valley have realized there's too much concentration of wealth ... there are issues of privacy that are unaddressed. There is a need for thoughtful regulation, there's a need for Silicon Valley to think more broadly about job creation and opportunity.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-617dbb7ca89b4043a1e08475a7013f71</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X91-KST1-DXKP-J1YH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1680\"/><timeReceived>7:57 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 16, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The area's commercial building boom continued, as did its swift development of residential properties.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There were, however, some shakeups here and there to Austin's economic engine. While the metro area remained among the nation's top job markets and saw its jobless rate continue to drop, job growth slowed toward the end of the year, falling to a 2 percent annual rate in November, the lowest in six years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Austin's housing market remained healthy - but also showed a few signs of cooling from its torrid pace.</p><p>The area's technology sector, meanwhile, underwent perhaps the biggest change of any part of the market, with huge buyout deals shaking up the status quo in the hardware and semiconductor industries.</p><p>And on the retail side of things, longtime Austin superstar Whole Foods Market had an up-and-down year as it continues to remake itself in the face of tougher competition.</p><p>Here's a look back at some of the Austin metro area's biggest business and technology stories from the year that was:</p><p>TECHNOLOGY</p><p>Dell buys EMC for $58B, becomes IT powerhouse</p><p>Some of the biggest news stories of 2016 involved major takeover deals in the technology sector. None of those was bigger than Round Rock-based Dell Inc. completing its $58 billion takeover of EMC Corp., the largest IT deal in history. Dell finalized the acquisition in September, and upon doing so changed its name from Dell Inc. to Dell Technologies. At the time of the merger, Dell officials said the newly combined company would have $74 billion in annual revenue and 140,000 employees, making it the largest privately owned tech company in the world.</p><p>Acquiring Hopkinton, Mass.-based EMCis key to Dell's ongoing transformation from a PC maker to an IT powerhouse that sells computers, servers, storage and software primarily to corporate and government customers. In the months since the merger was completed, Dell Technologies has laid off some employees. \"As is common with mergers of this size, there is a need to manage some overlapping job functions. We hope to minimize the impact on jobs and expect that revenue gains will outweigh resulting cost savings, with revenue growth driving future employment,\" the company said in October.</p><p>During his October keynote speech at the Dell EMC World conference in Austin, Dell founder and CEO Michael Dell that his company is well-positioned among its competitors because of its size and the breadth of its products and services.</p><p>\"We are best placed to serve you, whether you are in a small and growing business, or one of the largest companies or a government,\" Dell said.</p><p>He also reiterated that Dell is better off being a private company and not publicly traded.</p><p>\"We love being a privately controlled company and I haven't found any downside to it,\" Dell said. \"We are focused on long-term success, not quarterly earnings-per-share and the short-term thinking that plagues many companies. We can think in a time horizon that is measured in decades.\"</p><p>Qualcomm's buy of NXP is 2nd chip shop shakeup</p><p>For the second time in two years, Austin workers at NXP Semiconductors in 2016 learned they are getting new ownership.</p><p>In October, San Diego-based smartphone chipmaker Qualcomm announced it would buy NXP for $38 billion in the biggest-ever deal in the semiconductor industry. The acquisition is part of a wave of consolidation rippling through the industry, which is facing tepid growth in once-strong markets such as smartphones and personal computers.</p><p>In Austin, the deal meant whiplash for NXP employees, who only became part of NXP in late 2015. The company has about 5,000 workers in Central Texas, and they had been working for Austin-based Freescale Semiconductor before Freescale was acquired by Netherlands-based NXP in an $11.8 billion deal.</p><p>An NXP engineer - who asked that his name not be used for fear of reprisal - told the American-Statesman that he didn't think his job would substantially change on a day-to-day basis due to the Qualcomm deal.</p><p>\"It's a little unsettling maybe. There is a lot of uncertainty whenever there is a merger and acquisition,\" he said, adding that people are \"resigned\" to changes in ownership. \"We'll be Freescale, we'll be NXP, we'll be Qualcomm, who's going to buy us next?\"</p><p>VR now for-real industry as Austin tries to cash in</p><p>It seems 2016 was the year when virtual and augmented reality went from technology buzzwords to a more concrete industry in Austin, with software companies, game developers, filmmakers and marketers all taking serious steps to get in on a business segment expected to be worth $162 billion by 2020.</p><p>While products such as Oculus Rift, PlayStation VR and HTC Vive finally hit the market, companies including Owlchemy Labs, Thrillbox, WaveVR and Viewer Ready developed software while tech giants including AMD and Dell made sure PC hardware kept up with the high demands of VR gear.</p><p>Austin techies kept their eye on developing mixed-reality technology from companies such as Microsoft, with HoloLens, and any word from Magic Leap, a mysterious Florida-based startup with hundreds of millions in funding that opened an office in town this year.</p><p>But VR was probably most visible at South by Southwest, where the tech was part of its own expo that took place after SXSW Interactive, and which included live demos, screenings and even a virtual roller coaster simulator from Samsung.</p><p>SXSW's tech power impresses president</p><p>As it celebrated its 30th year, South by Southwest continued to evolve, recognizing that the technology part of the conference continues to grow and permeate itself through the Music and Film legs of SXSW. There was no greater evidence of the importance of SXSW Interactive than March's opening keynote featuring President Barack Obama, who spoke about the promise and pitfalls technology offers us and the challenges of deploying it in government. \"I want to make sure the next president and the federal government from here on out is in constant improvement mode,\" he said at a March 11 presentation at Dell Hall in The Long Center. \"It can be done.\"</p><p>Obama was apparently so impressed with what he saw at SXSW that a few months later, the White House hosted a SXSW-assisted \"South by South Lawn\" event in Washington, D.C. featuring techies, filmmakers and musicians.</p><p>SXSW itself began to move toward a more unified conference experience, which will continue in 2017 as the lines between SXSW Interactive, Film and Music continue to blur and integrate with other parts of the conference, including programming related to sports, government, fashion, gaming and DIY culture.</p><p>It will also continue to address current culture head-on; it already is planning a two-day set of talks around how a Donald Trump presidency could impact the tech industry.</p><p>JOB MARKET</p><p>Job growth strong, then loses steam</p><p>For most of 2016, the Austin metro area's job market looked much like it did in 2015 - strong annual job growth rates, low unemployment and a steady influx of eager workers.</p><p>However, data from the Texas Workforce Commission showed a definite slowing of the region's job growth rate in both October and November. In fact, the region's annual job growth rate of 2 percent in November was its lowest since June 2010, when the rate was 1.3 percent as Central Texas was recovering from the worst of the recession.</p><p>A slowdown in the manufacturing sector helped pull down the area's job growth rate in November, as manufacturers reported a year-over-year net loss of 3,700 jobs for a negative growth rate of -6.4 percent.</p><p>Still, the region's unemployment rate dropped to 3 percent in November, tied for the lowest of any Texas metro area and well below the national rate of 4.9 percent.</p><p>Drew Scheberle, senior vice president at the Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce, said the region's slower job growth rate in November \"may be a blip.\"</p><p>\"The good news is we have a dramatic drop in the ranks of the unemployed - 7,000 in the last 60 days. Part of that is seasonal. But 3 percent unemployment is very good news,\" Scheberle said. \"Our semiconductor folks are reporting they are busting at the seams and Samsung has added headcount. The software companies are still aggressively hiring, though things do slow at year end traditionally.\"</p><p>HOUSING MARKET</p><p>Residential sales still hot despite slumps</p><p>Despite a slowdown in the fall, Austin's housing market remained among the nation's hottest throughout most of 2016. Through the end of November, the metro area remained on pace to top last year's 29,068 transactions, which marked the fifth year in a row of record sales in Central Texas, according to data from the Austin Board of Realtors.</p><p>The region's median home price continued to go up, as well, hitting $294,245 in November, according to the board.</p><p>However, the region saw sales flatten in September and actually decline in October compared to the same month the previous year. At that time, Jonathan Smoke, chief economist for Realtor.com, said: \"The Austin market is showing signs of slowing down to a more normal pace of activity and appreciation from the incredibly hot pace it has been on for the last few years.\"</p><p>Still, Smoke said that \"the fundamentals for growth - job growth and population growth - continue to be very strong for Austin, and that should ensure continued strong demand.\"</p><p>RETAIL</p><p>Whole Foods Market endures a wild ride</p><p>It's fair to say that 2016 was highly eventful for Whole Foods Market, one of Austin's biggest and highest-profile companies with 87,000 workers in 464 stores worldwide and about 2,500 employees in Central Texas. After tougher competition cut into its earnings, the organic foods retailer began 2016 with a plan to lower prices, trim its workforce, cut $300 million in expenses, boost its digital reach with consumers and better manage its growth.</p><p>That plan included the launch of the 365 by Whole Foods Market line of smaller, value-driven stores. The 25,000- to 35,000-square-foot stores compete directly with the likes of Trader Joe's, Sprouts and other smaller format, value-focused brands.</p><p>Whole Foods has opened three of the stores so far, one in the Los Angeles suburb of Silver Lake, Calif., one in the Portland suburb of Lake Oswego, Ore., and one in Bellevue, Wash., outside Seattle.</p><p>In November, Whole Foods announced that it was doing away with its tradition of co-CEOs. After sharing CEO duties for six years with Walter Robb, Whole Foods co-founder John Mackey will become the company's solo CEO. Robb will transition to a new role on the company's board of directors, among other responsibilities, the company said.</p><p>Also in November, various media outlets reported that a major Whole Foods shareholder met with potential activist investors to discuss making changes to the company, including replacing management and exploring a sale of the company. The shareholder, among the company's 10 biggest, raised concerns in recent meetings with activist investment funds after losing patience with the company's direction, Bloomberg News reported. Whole Foods declined to address the reports directly, with spokeswoman Brooke Buchanan saying: \"Whole Foods Market values the strong and open relationships we have with our shareholders... we are focused on pursuing the right strategies to position the company to produce strong results and returns for our shareholders over the long term.\"</p><p>In early December, the Nasdaq stock exchange said it is dropping Whole Foods from its Nasdaq-100 index - a reminder of the organic food giant's continued battle against growing competition. The Nasdaq-100 index, which was created in 1985, is composed of the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq based on market capitalization, or the value of the company's shares, according to the Nasdaq.</p><p>Whole Foods' market cap has declined from more than $22 billion in 2013 to about $9.9 billion currently, according to data from Yahoo Finance.</p><p>Despite the challenges faced in 2016, during Whole Foods most recent earnings call in November, Mackey said he remains confident in the company's direction.</p><p>\"Food retailing is evolving at an incredibly fast pace, and consumers have many more options for how and where they buy their food than ever before,\" Mackey said in a conference call with investors. But \"where our company is today is just a shadow of where we think we will be in the future.\"</p><p>TRANSPORTATION</p><p>City alters position on ride-hailing rules</p><p>One of the most hotly debated topics in Austin in the past year was the city's stance on ride-hailing services.</p><p>In May, ride-hailing companies Uber and Lyft pulled up stakes in Austin after a contentious proposition vote. Uber and Lyft were unsuccessful in overturning a measure passed by the Austin City Council that stiffened regulations on ride-hailing services in Austin. This was despite a political action committee funded by the companies, Ridesharing Works of Austin, spending $10.3 million on the campaign.</p><p>After Uber and Lyft left the city, some predicted it would be a transportation disaster. The city had become accustomed to a certain level of on-demand ride hailing, and with the two biggest players in the market abandoning Austin, there has been a fierce debate about how badly Austin's reputation as a tourist hub and a tech center would be damaged without these services.</p><p>However, within a few months later more than a half-dozen ride-hailing companies began service in Austin, operating as successors to Lyft and Uber.</p><p>The city's stance on the ride-hailing services has continued to evolve. In December, the Austin City Council backed away from its initial stance on background checks for perspective ride-hailing drivers.</p><p>The council in June drew a firm line, approving a measure that listed various criminal convictions that, no matter when they occurred, disqualified a driver from getting a city permit. Another list of crimes barred a driver if the offense had occurred within the past seven years.</p><p>This month, the council reversed field and approved a measure that allows applicants to appeal to the city's Transportation Department if their permit was denied based on their criminal record.</p><p>The council in the next few months will consider whether to stick with that approach or develop some other alternative appeals process.</p><p>Other developments in a chock-full year</p><p>And a reminder about some other stories that made news in Austin in 2016:</p><p>Samsung Austin Semiconductor announced plans to invest $1 billion in its Austin chip manufacturing facility, adding as many as 500 engineering and manufacturing jobs in Central Texas.</p><p>Construction began on the Independent, a 58-story tower that will help reshape Austin's skyline at West Third Street and West Avenue downtown. The project has been dubbed the \"Jenga tower\" because of its distinctive stacked design.</p><p>The Domain development in North Austin continued its growth, opening its Domain Northside development and announcing plans for two more office towers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AUSTIN-3561501</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AUSTIN2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5MJC-J261-DY7P-S3P3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147871</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2516\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The Austin American-Statesman All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Austin American-Statesman (Texas)</publicationName><edition>State Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"12\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>December 25, 2016 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002BYW</classCode><className>DELL INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0001V67</classCode><className>EMC CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00021TX</classCode><className>WHOLE FOODS MARKET INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>EMC (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>WFM (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Securities Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Stock Exchanges</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0ZDMDg5MEQ3OTlGNEJCMkI0M0EyM0MwN0E1Njk1MEQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDBGREFBMDgyNTQ0NERFRUI3MEUwNDBFOTM5NDExREI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000123</classCode><className>POPULATION GROWTH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000971D</classCode><className>POPULATION SIZE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>STX001668</classCode><className>TAKEOVERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00096KO</classCode><className>HOUSING MARKET</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000608</classCode><className>EMPLOYMENT GROWTH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001772</classCode><className>UNEMPLOYMENT RATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009SQW</classCode><className>PRIVATELY HELD COMPANIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DI3L</classCode><className>ELECTRONICS SECTOR PERFORMANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX002023</classCode><className>LABOR SECTOR PERFORMANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0008XKP</classCode><className>COMPANY NAME CHANGES</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUY3MDVDRDRCNkNGNEU5NEJBQ0ZCNDk2QTA0MEVFNUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTVCMEIxNDNCRDhENDA2OUEwRTczQTc4MjdGOUJBNEE</classCode><className>Name Changes</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX000365</classCode><className>CONFERENCES &amp;

By his own admission, chief executive officer Marcos Lopez says Solium, founded by two stock brokers from Dominion Securities, went public too early - in 2001 with $94,000 in revenue. By 2002 it was needing to be refinanced, restructured and repositioned.</p><p>Since then, Solium has become a global, Calgary-based enterprise software firm with one million people using its platform and with offices in the United States, the United Kingdom, Europe and Australia.</p><p>It has signed on 46 of the TSX 60, and won mandates from companies the likes of Adidas, Shopify, Uber, Google, Barclays and Morgan Stanley; Heineken is a recent addition to its client roster.</p><p>What it does well is manage the complex issues associated with stock compensation plans for both private and publicly-traded companies. These are the issues that always seem to come with indecipherable acronyms in multiple jurisdictions, in a variety of currencies, and in the middle of a maze of compliance and tax rules that differ from country to country.</p><p>In some respects, Solium hit its sweet spot as regulations and scrutiny on equity compensation plans have increased around the globe.</p><p>It does this through a combination of its sophisticated software platforms - Shareworks and Transcentive - and an old-fashioned commitment to customer service.</p><p>One of the secrets to its \"overnight\" success, Lopez says, is the fact it did get its start in Calgary.</p><p>\"Solium couldn't have started in Toronto. We wouldn't have gotten any traction,\" he says.</p><p>AEC (Alberta Energy Company) was Solium's first client and word has it Big Rock Brewery, also an early client, paid part of its bill in beer.</p><p>\"They (AEC) took a flier on us. . . but that is the magic of Calgary; it's in the DNA. AEC took that risk, so did CP Rail,\" said Lopez. \"We evolved in the safe petri dish of Calgary. In many ways, it's a great 'Canada bet on itself' story.\"</p><p>And that petri dish had the perfect conditions that pushed Solium to expand its horizons and develop a product and skill set that can address complex issues arising for companies operating in multiple jurisdictions.</p><p>Not only is Solium Calgary's best kept secret, having been around as long as it has. Lopez is also in a unique position to offer a few observations on the skills needed to achieve that seemingly elusive goal of economic diversification.</p><p>\"It can't just be about cheap office space. . . and the vacancy rate,\" he says. \"Companies that we want to attract here don't care about the cost of office space - they want skill sets.\"</p><p>Lopez says that while Calgary has tech talent, it's not the kind of place that builds tech products; his observation is that we're better at project management.</p><p>The product life cycle for technology is much different than what it is for the energy sector - and that means a different skill set.</p><p>Calgary also lacks what Lopez calls an \"anchor tenant\" - in this case, a big tech company that acts as a magnet and draws talent to wherever it is.</p><p>But, Calgary did have that for a time - in the form of Nortel. When Nortel imploded, however, some talent stayed, but not enough. Unlike the demise of Dome Petroleum, which caused a starburst of its own as former employees went on to create billions of dollars in value in the energy sector, the end of Nortel didn't result in the creation of the same kind of critical mass in Calgary's sector.</p><p>For Solium, managing the stock-based elements of compensation systems is not exactly as sexy as being a visible disruptor. But as compensation plans have become increasingly complex, solutions offered through companies like Solium ensure they are managed properly.</p><p>But there aren't too many Soliums out there. So, while Lopez doesn't exactly see Solium as a disruptor, others might take issue with that. This is the domain of companies like E-Trade, Fidelity and Computershare - and Solium is competing on the same field.</p><p>And, the company is about to get bigger.</p><p>Solium recently struck \"white label\" deals with Morgan Stanley and UBS; it already has one with U.K. banking giant Barclays. What this means is that Morgan Stanley and UBS take Solium's product, put their brand on it and market it to their client networks. In return for a licensing fee, it's a way for Solium to access new distribution channels.</p><p>But Lopez knows Solium has to continue to evolve.</p><p>That means looking for new markets and possible new business lines.</p><p>Lopez and his team are still trying to find people to meet their immediate needs. Solium hired 50 software developers last year - and is still looking for more.</p><p>Solium's story isn't the kind of tale that's been heard much in the last two years, but having a Calgary-based software firm succeed on the international stage is a great example for other companies thinking about setting up shop here.</p><p>It shows that the raw ingredients do exist to diversify the economy and should be seen as a calling card for the city in terms of what is possible.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:dyedlin@postmedia.com\">dyedlin@postmedia.com</email>( <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:dyedlin@postmedia.com\">dyedlin@postmedia.com</email> ) !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2017 Postmedia Network Inc.

But he was on the right path.</p><p>Yellen's comments came just days after the Nasdaq Composite and the S&amp;P 500, two broad indexes of US share prices, hit their highest levels in 15 years.</p><p>Much of the action has been in the tech stocks, with Apple quoted on the New York Stock Exchange valued at \u00a3654bn, or almost half the total size of the British economy. But it has not been alone.</p><p>Older, established tech stocks such as Microsoft have also been roaring ahead, as has Amazon, despite its policy of ploughing almost everything it earns back into the enterprise.</p><p>The big tech stocks have dragged up the smaller Silicon Valley start-ups in much the same pattern as occurred prior to 2000. So one suspects some of the valuations are built on a wing and a prayer.</p><p>There are deep-seated reasons why we should listen to the Yellen wisdom. Having successfully navigated the taper' - the end of quantitative easing in the US - without triggering a market meltdown, the next big step for the <person><nameText>Federal Reserve </nameText></person>is the normalisation of interest rates.</p><p>A decision this spring was postponed because of America's weak first quarter, largely weather and oil-related. Nevertheless, the first interest rate increase of the post-crisis cycle gets ever closer.</p><p>Yellen observed that when the Fed does move, long-term rates could move dramatically, and she is trying to ease the passage to the new regime. When share markets are in their recent buoyant mood, as we learned in the period 1996 to 2000, it can be difficult to throw them off-course.</p><p>However, bond rates have come off the bottom with the yield on the ten-year German bund climbing despite earlier concerns that eurozone QE could send them in the opposite direction. Whatever the final outcome of UK elections, there are choppy waters ahead.</p><p>IN THE run-up to the 2000 tech boom, BT was seen as a likely British champion, with its domination of domestic telecoms, mobile offshoot O2, Yell, broadband roll-out and the rest.</p><p>It never happened, as the company lurched into financial difficulties, O2 and Yell (luckily) were sold and the share price was decimated.</p><p>Some 15 years on, largely due to the efforts of Lord (Ian) Livingston, it is a different kettle of fish and shares are at a 14-year high.</p><p>It is not surprising now that every part of the business looks to be performing above expectations.</p><p>BT's assault on the sports TV market means it now has 5.2m customers (including Virgin subscribers) and with the help of Lionel Messi, the Champions League and a small surcharge it is aiming even higher. It also counting on Britain's most celebrated yachtsman Ben Ainslie and the America's Cup to bring some extra excitement.</p><p>It is forging ahead with broadband, transferring 266,000 customers to faster internet which means that some 39pc of households now have fibre access.</p><p>And it is pushing on with the testing of ultra-fast broadband. BT's own mobile operation already has gathered 50,000 customers before it gets its hands on EE's network - regulators willing.</p><p>It has been quite a journey from the mess left behind by the failed post-privatisation management.</p><p>CLYDESDALE and Yorkshire, two venerable names in British banking, are starting to look like the new Co-op Bank.</p><p>Parent National Australia Bank has been seeking to offload them for years, with no success, and is now proposing to dump the banks on the stock market.</p><p>But unlike the dusted-off TSB and the shiny new Metro Bank, the Yorkshire and Clydesdale have been misbehaving and the Bank of England is demanding they find \u00a31.7bn in new funds - to cover future fines and penalties - before the apron strings can be cut.</p><p>And we thought Scots and Yorkshire people were meant to be careful.</p><p>\u00a9 Daily Mail</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAIL-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAIL2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5FXX-KRV1-DYTG-40WP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138794</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-08-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"759\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

There are three hearings looking at how much power Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google have. One company that has been pushing for this kind of oversight for years is Yelp. The review service has been saying that Google is trampling competitors, and Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman joins us now.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                Welcome to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.             </p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN:                 Thanks for having me.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 To start just briefly, why do you believe that Google is a monopoly?             </p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN:                 Oh, well, I think it's obvious that Google is a monopoly. You really can't search the Web without turning to them. You know, they have the dominant browser, Chrome, which a lot of people search through. Of course, people go to Google directly. And then if you go on your iPhone, you even end up on Google when you type into that search box in Safari.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 And what does that mean for you, Yelp, a company that offers reviews of local businesses, restaurants, et cetera?             </p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN:                 Well, over the years, Google has built out a similar property to Yelp, which is in Google Maps these days. And they actually bias their Web search such that their property, Google Maps, shows up first. And it makes it really hard to find Yelp these days in search results.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 But Google says that it is just giving users what they want, which is results to the question without having to go to another page - Yelp - and ask the question again.             </p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN:                 That's a great point. And I think, you know, if a consumer is typing in 2 plus 2, they should absolutely see the answer is 4. But when you're looking for a pediatrician and your child is sick, you want the best results. You want to know, where is there a trusted doctor? And Google might not be able to provide that. That's dependent on the content that they've collected versus the content that other sites, like Yelp, might have.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 You were on Capitol Hill last week talking with lawmakers. Tell me about the kind of responses you got.             </p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN:                 The mood in Washington is quite different from when we first started on this issue. You know, I began down the path of talking to regulators back in 2011, and there does seem to be a lot more political on both sides to really scrutinize Google, as well as other big tech firms.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 What do you think has changed?             </p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN:                 I think, you know, in the wake of 2016...             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 You mean the election interference.             </p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN:                 Yeah. I mean, I just think people realize that just a couple companies control a massive amount of human attention. And the decisions that they're making - the algorithm decisions - actually affect what people think and what they see. And I think that's troubling to both sides.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 You've been focusing on Google, but presumably, anything Washington does would apply to the tech industry as a whole. Broadly speaking, what do you think a more fair world would look like in this arena?             </p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN:                 You know, I think it's about creating a level playing field - making sure that if you're a monopoly, you can't block startups, you can't block innovative competitors and protect your monopoly. So in the case of Google, you know, it's actually come out in documents that they were fearful of Yelp in the local space. And so they actually degraded their search results knowingly to push their own product and make sure that that competitor, you know, stayed in its cage.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 Tell me about what regulation that you would be comfortable with would look like. I mean, what would the law actually do?             </p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN:                 I mean, in our specific vertical, when you're searching for a pediatrician when a child is sick, we just think you should get the best of what's on the Web. And so if Google doesn't have the best answer - which, by the way, it often doesn't in local - it should be willing to surface, you know, other resources with the same prominence it surfaces its own content.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 That seems kind of subjective. I mean, it's hard to imagine Congress writing that into a law.             </p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN:                 I don't think so. I mean, you know, Google itself has supported things like net neutrality. And so we simply ask the question, what about search neutrality?             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 When you started this fight, you were kind of a lone wolf in Silicon Valley complaining about Google. Do you sense that other tech companies have started to join you in criticizing the big guys?             </p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN:                 Well, we have been the lone wolf when it comes to speaking out on this issue. There is no shortage of companies that have issues with Google and its behavior. It's just that Google is so powerful and so many companies are reliant on Google in various ways that they simply can't speak out. Many of them come to me privately to talk about their issues.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 Europe has been far ahead of the U.S. in this movement. I mean, Europe has already fined Google for monopolistic behavior. Do you think the U.S. is likely to catch up with the Europeans?             </p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN:                 I certainly hope so. Vestager in Europe, the competition chief there, has done a great job leading the way in identifying some of these issues far before U.S. regulators really took it seriously. And so that's great, but Europe still has more work to do. And you know, we are encouraged that U.S. regulators are finally paying attention.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 Jeremy Stoppelman is the CEO of Yelp.             </p><p>                Thank you very much.             </p><p>JEREMY STOPPELMAN:                 Thank you.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 And NPR also reached out to Google today. The company said they have no comment.             </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NPRATC-2019071617</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NPRATC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKF-KCB1-DY1J-T0X0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1081\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 National Public Radio (R) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NPR All Things Considered</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 16, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman has been vocal for years about the problem with Google's dominant market share in maps, local search, and reviews.</p><p><br/>\"I've been working on it for over a decade and it's great to see that more people have jumped on board,\" Stoppelman says. \"When we started out criticizing Google and highlighting some of their abuses, we got - especially from Silicon Valley - so many eye rolls.\"<br/>The Verge's Nilay Patel and Casey Newton recently caught up with Stoppelman to discuss the evolving view of the media and the public on tech monopolies, as well as how Yelp is handling problems with its own competition and what possible changes can arise from government regulation.<br/>Nilay Patel: Yelp has been pushing on Google in terms of antitrust forever. There's more scrutiny now than ever. It seems to be working. What's your view of it? Is it having the results you want?<br/>Jeremy Stoppelman: I mean, I've been working on it for over a decade and it's great to see that more people have jumped on board. When we started out criticizing Google and highlighting some of their abuses, we got - especially from Silicon Valley - so many eye rolls and, \"Oh, you're just a bunch of whiners.\" And I think the conversation has really shifted to a more productive place where more and more business leaders, entrepreneurs, consumers, just everyday people, are understanding, \"Hey, we have a massive consolidation problem.\"<br/>These businesses are the gateway to information, period. And they're essentially completely unregulated. They're running amok, essentially they're tuning their algorithms - in a lot of cases - to highlight the most engaging content, which might not be the best content, might not be the most useful, might not be the most truthful. And who's pushing back against that? And I think that's become a real problem. I think everyone's woken up to this consolidation issue.<br/>And so now the question is, how fast can we move on it? Of course, there's multiple companies to talk about. We're talking about Google. Which one gets the majority of the attention and focus? I think, obviously, Google is a great one to focus on. But there is a wider antitrust conversation. I think it's very healthy. I think it could have come earlier, but I'm not complaining. There's no point in complaining. We're here and we've got a lot of people now on Team Antitrust. And that's a good thing.<br/>NP: Have you talked to the other companies that are pushing? Like, have you played Fortnite with Tim Sweeney? Do you and Daniel Ek hang out in a Discord? There is some conversation about these companies actually teaming up to provide some consolidated market power of their own.<br/>I mean, if you go back to the Microsoft case, the way you as a company want it to work - because taking on these behemoths is extremely expensive, very difficult. Ultimately, there's a political component to it. So ideally, you want the government to act because they have way more resources than any one company, certainly a company like Yelp. And if the regulators act, then they start to uncover things and emails come out, information comes out. The pressure and the scrutiny also just helps the competitive dynamics sometimes.<br/>And so, our strategy has always been to help, support, aid, encourage the regulators to do their job, and push back on Google as an abusive monopoly power. And then depending on what information comes out of that, then maybe you decide that you have an individual antitrust case that you want to bring. But historically, that's been the winning strategy rather than you - a much smaller, less powerful company - individually bringing a legal case before the government even acts against someone like Google. So that's kind of our position.<br/>Casey Newton: But we're still sort of talking about Google as if it's the only possible entry point to Yelp. And the thing that happened since your company was founded was the rise of mobile phones; the app stores exist, right? There's a world in which the Yelp app is just so freaking good that everybody has to run out and download it and this is how they access all their local information. So even just to play devil's advocate, what is the answer to, \"Come on, Yelp, can you just actually compete a little bit harder? You have other tools to get customers' attention that are not antitrust cases.\"<br/>Yeah, I would say that you could look at our traffic makeup. We still get a huge portion of our traffic from Google. So while I feel better about our market position, and we are more diversified traffic-wise and without the mobile app ecosystem emerging, we would be in a far worse position - who knows where we would be, frankly, if that didn't exist. So I would call that a lifeline rather than, \"Oh, you're totally fine. Nothing to worry about. You're a bunch of whiners, so stop complaining and get back to work.\"<br/>I think the other thing to remember is, think of the enormous resources a monopoly power has and can put against you. You look at mapping technology, not many people can afford to play in the mapping space period anymore. What happened to Navteq and some of these big maps players? Google entered the market, they gave away a free product essentially, although they now charge for it, and some of the independent mapping players fell over as a result. So these big monopolies bring in insane amounts of resources to fight.<br/>So I would say it's a minor miracle that we're still standing. I'm very proud of the fact that we've competed successfully. But I think in my mind there was no question we would be a significantly bigger company with more resources to invest if Google had played fair and not tipped the scales in their favor to make sure that their content, their local results are always at the top and increasingly taking up more and more of the page. When it comes to local, if you do a local search on Google - especially mobile - it's a chore to find organic results anymore.<br/>NP: What's your preferred outcome? Is it Google has to pay you for scraping your data? Is it that they have some minimum amount of traffic they have to redistribute? They can't do local search? What do you want?<br/>We, in collaboration with some other companies like TripAdvisor, worked on a demo of what could exist, it's called focusontheuser.com. You can kind of see what it is, but it's essentially taking that local box and making it interoperable. I think a pretty good example is actually if you look in the recipe category. It's interesting because I don't think there's a lot of money in recipes. So as a result, Google has done what Google used to do, which is it organizes the world's recipes. And instead of keeping you on the site just to see a recipe, they're happy to send you along onto somebody's independent blog. And so there's a whole vibrant ecosystem of players within the recipe space. So why can't they do that in local? Seems pretty straightforward.<br/>NP: Do you think Google should not be allowed to enter local search? Should they not be allowed to enter any other category where they have a structured enough dataset to just deliver the result?<br/>Certainly they can compete, but they should compete on a level playing field. And in fact, when they tried to, they were losing. There are conversations that are now public that were over email, where they're like, \"Oh yeah, Yelp is coming up so much. We have to do something. Okay. Whenever Yelp is going to show high-end results, we should trigger our map box and make sure that our results are above it.\" They literally had an \"if\" statement in their code that said, \"If Yelp, then show us our stuff above it.\" If you occupy a monopoly position, you should not be able to basically jam everybody off the page just because you want that revenue to yourself. You built up this trust with consumers, they all learned to rely on you. You bought up all the search box market share so anyone that types in a search - whether it's Safari or Firefox - is going straight to your site and then you're burying objectively better content. I'm sorry, that's not playing the game fairly.<br/>NP: One of the challenges that every competitor Google has - Yelp certainly, but also Bing or Alta Vista or whatever - is that the amount of incoming user data to Google is so high. How do you break that from a regulatory perspective? I can't just make everybody in America use Bing for two months to be able to catch up to Google, right? How do you solve that feedback loop, which seems like the heart of a lot of the data monopolies that we see?<br/>I think you ideally make it so that Google can't take all of the lucrative areas that it doesn't currently occupy, and then jam a product into that space and then absorb all of the market share. Look at what they did at travel search. They went and they bought a critical component of travel search, which is this company, ITA, that had all of the data on where the flights are coming and going and how much they cost and so forth that all of the major players relied on. And they did a little, \"Oh yeah, we're definitely not going to use it for nefarious purposes.\" And now if you do a travel search or airline search, all of a sudden, instead of seeing all the major players for airline search, you're getting a Google box, which doesn't necessarily cover all the best flights, all the best prices - there's been some studies on that. I think that's a real problem.<br/>Why were they allowed to do that? That was a moment where regulators could have said, \"Whoa, okay. You already have a monopoly in web search. We're going to stop this.\" And in fact, there have been lots of times in American history where regulators cared about this stuff, where they didn't allow this to happen. I think Obama's a great guy. He's a very nice guy. He's a very cool guy. But on antitrust, the White House was very aligned with Google. And if you look at who spent the most time at the White House, it's by a mile Google lobbyists.<br/>And to go on another rant, why has Google evaded a lot of scrutiny on this issue? I think it's because Eric Schmidt's a freaking super genius on this topic because he went through it. He was the Jeremy Stoppelman of the Microsoft era. He was at Novell. He saw it from my shoes. He learned the playbook. He saw all the mistakes that Microsoft made. And so then Google, as it got into a monopoly position, he was extremely strategic and laid all the groundwork to make sure that Google was going to be protected for as long as possible. And it's worked remarkably well.<br/>In 2011, when I testified, I was like shaking in my boots. Eric Schmidt testified as well. And Chuck Schumer came out and all he said on the topic - even though Google at that point already had a monopoly, it was like 70 percent or so web share, mobile was looking a lot worse - he just came out and said, \"Oh, good. Eric, it's so great to have you here. Thank you for putting an office in my district.\" And then he left the meeting.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-M1395455</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60P2-FY91-DYDW-7476-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1855\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 26, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

He said Yelp viewed the issue as not only one of \"competitive harm\" when Google \"self-deals and siphons all this traffic to itself\" but also one of consumer harm through lack of choice.</p><p>\"We have empirical evidence of consumer harm (which shows) consumers \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 would rather be using third-party services,\" Mr Lowe told The Australian.</p><p>Yelp's evidence, which is central to the ACCC's investigation, details the way Google channels local searches into their own businesses or to businesses that advertise with Google. This forces an overwhelming majority of people to both use those businesses and rely on the likes of Google Review ratings and Google Maps at the expense of other competitors.</p><p>\"Local search is the most common thing humans do on Google. Today, two billion people, most of them with their smartphones, will pull out their phones and look for information about \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 small businesses \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and make some kind of decision about whether to transact with that business,\" Mr Lowe said. \"So that's why I get personally very fired up about this issue. Because, you know, if I get matched with a bad slice of pizza, that's not the end of the world. But if I'm unwittingly siphoned into a low-quality corpus of Google content when I'm searching for a paediatrician, the results can be tragic.\" In its report into digital platforms and their effect on traditional media, the ACCC found \"Google has substantial market power in the supply of search advertising services and Facebook has substantial market power in the supply of display advertising services\".</p><p>\"To the extent self-preferencing prevents or handicaps rival businesses from competing with Google or Facebook on their merits, it will impede the efficient operation of the markets in which they compete,\" the report says. \"The scope for anti-competitive self-preferencing is particularly acute in the ad tech supply chain where Google operates businesses at multiple levels.\" Mr Sims told The Australian two weeks ago the watchdog was conducting more than 10 investigations as a result of its long-running review into digital platforms and was hoping to introduce more general laws to deal with unfair practices by the tech giants.</p><p>This newspaper recently revealed that a Melbourne lawyer had been planning a class action against Google after a series of cases involving vicious anonymous reviews against businesses.</p><p>Mr Lowe said he wouldn't be surprised to see similar cases launched in the US, especially with recent revelations in The Wall Street Journal that Google Maps is full of fake businesses with dodgy operators setting up shell companies to maximise business.</p><p>\"Literally tens of millions of listings on Google Maps are fake businesses. And the way it works is a locksmith or, you know, maybe with their own licence, an auto mechanic or whatever they get on and there's all these apps where you can create sort of your burner phone numbers, they build fake listings, and they just overwhelm Google Maps with these shell fake listings,\" Mr Lowe said.</p><p>He said he was extremely impressed with the tenor of discussions with Mr Sims, regarding him as one of the most well-informed regulators in the world.</p><p>\"I've been working on the Google issue for almost a decade. And it's fair to say that ACCC staff and in the chair, I've never been more impressed by an authority.</p><p>\"I've been just truly impressed by their savvy and I've been speaking with competition authorities all over the world \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 you can just tell the level of sophistication is a lot higher here.\" Unlike regulators around the world, who have fined Google and Facebook billions of dollars in recent years, the ACCC will aim to take the tech giants to court, an approach Mr Lowe approves of.</p><p>\"FTC fined Facebook $5bn, but I don't think fines work (because) $5bn for one of these companies is pocket change,\" Mr Lowe said.\"Even the $10bn and counting that (the EU) has fined Google \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 is sitting in escrow, as Google will appeal this stuff for probably north of a decade. So ultimately, where enforcers can have an impact is by bringing cases. I would be surprised if we don't see US versus Google before the end of the year.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-4077f7d060c411ea83a173c556f52b3c2b8017bd51749416e148374a40a7cb65</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YCK-YY11-JD3N-51ST-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"918\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 9, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Speakers included Google critics such as Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine.  <br/>\u201cIt\u2019s a timely conversation to look at the 20th anniversary of the initiation of the last seminal enforcement action by the federal government against a large consumer tech firm, as people raise questions about whether companies like Google are abusing their dominance,\u201d Luther Lowe, senior vice president of public policy at Yelp, a Google competitor, told Bloomberg Law.  <br/>Both Blumenthal and Racine have called on the Federal Trade Commission to reopen an antitrust investigation into Google\u2019s search practices.  <br/>\u201cWe\u2019re truly entering into a new era with innovative companies that do appear to have a lot of market power,\u201d Racine told Bloomberg Law, following remarks at the event. \u201cI think all of us as regulators and law enforcers are trying to understand whether this can continue in the same way without injuring consumers or harming competition.\u201d  <br/>Policymakers can benefit from the knowledge of lawyers and others who \u201cwent through the Microsoft battles,\u201d he said.<br/> Evidence Decides  <br/>Several speakers said the Microsoft case shows that antitrust law can be applied to tech giants, but only if regulators are willing to prosecute.  <br/>The case \u201cgave way to the realities of evidence and law,\u201d said Blumenthal, a former state attorney general of Connecticut who partnered with the Justice Department on the Microsoft suit.  <br/>Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) welcomed the debate, saying \u201cwe simply cannot afford to ignore the most pressing questions in this space.\u201d But he warned that the Microsoft case shouldn\u2019t be used as a \u201cpermission slip to ramp up enforcement of entities, or markets, that bear superficial similarity to the Microsoft story.\u201d  <br/>The FTC has a new slate of leaders who have pledged to hold big tech firms accountable to antitrust laws in response to growing concerns about their dominance from lawmakers and public interest advocates. But antitrust enforcement in this area would be cutting-edge and tough to prove, according to analysts.  <br/>In 2013, the FTC decided not to bring an antitrust case against Google after an investigation into whether the internet giant had a practice of skewing search results to favor its own services. Instead, the agency entered into an agreement with Google in which the search giant promised to distribute search results in a nonbiased way.  <br/>Lowe said that a lot has changed since then. One significant development is that Google has faced intense antitrust scrutiny in the European Union, where formal charges are pending.  <br/>\u201cThat potentially puts pressure on U.S. policymakers,\u201d Lowe said. \u201cEuropean consumers are poised to get better protections than U.S. consumers.\u201d  <br/>In addition, he said Yelp has grown as a company and is in a much better position to make a strong case against Google.  <br/>\u201cWe were a pretty tiny start up during the period when the FTC was investigating Google,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t even have a full-time government affairs department, let alone economists and lawyers who specialize in antitrust. I think that our ability to tell the story and make the argument is far more robust.\u201d  <br/>The company\u2019s new Washington location is primarily intended to be a sales and marketing office, and there are no immediate plans to increase the public policy team, which currently consists of just a few people. Still, Lowe said the space will facilitate \u201cimportant public policy conversations related to issues that Yelp cares about such as open data, free speech, and fair competition online.\u201d  <br/>Yelp reported spending a total of $70,000 in the first quarter of 2018 to lobby Washington policymakers on issues such as online competition. By comparison, Google spent more than $5 million during the same period.  <br/>To contact the reporter on this story: Alexei Alexis in Washington at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:aalexis@bloomberglaw.com\">aalexis@bloomberglaw.com</email><br/>To contact the editor responsible for this story: Fawn Johnson at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:fjohnson@bloomberglaw.com\">fjohnson@bloomberglaw.com</email><br/>Copyright  169; 2018 The Bureau of National Affairs, Inc.

He is author of the forthcoming book \"                             Beyond the Valley                          .\"          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Conservatives have made it their mission lately to paint tech companies as liberal opponents whose mission is to secretly thwart Republicans online. This includes President Trump, who tweeted this week that Google had \"manipulated from 2.6 million to 16 million votes for Hillary Clinton in 2016 Election.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The president, here, is wrong. Not only is he inaccurately summing up research on the effects of bias in Google's search engine; he is also ignoring some key flaws in that research. But there's a troubling kernel of truth here: Online companies wield powerful technology that shapes our beliefs, how we work and how we live. Their technologies act on all of us, regardless of our gender, race, age or political persuasion.</p><p>So while it's wrong to characterize Google as part of the Democratic Party machine, there's plenty of room to question how it's affecting our democracy and society.</p><p>Trump's tweet refers to research by Robert Epstein, an academic psychologist who testified in Congress in June that Google helped Hillary Clinton win at least 2.6 million votes in 2016 by serving undecided voters with politically biased search results. Epstein, who describes himself as \"center-left,\" claims that his research from the 2018 midterms shows that big tech companies hold the power to control 15 million votes, effectively making \"free and fair election(s) meaningless.\"</p><p>I have been studying the Internet's impact on our political, cultural and economic lives across the world for 20 years, and Epstein is a respected colleague of mine. We both agree that the digital systems we use every day are dangerous to democracy. This is because the voices that create and monetize them are extremely limited - paving the way for a few tech billionaires to create the empires that monitor us daily, giving them the potential to manipulate our behavior.</p><p>But if we narrow the scope of tech's influence to partisan politics, we miss the larger issue - that the influence of these systems is profoundly undemocratic. Big tech's reach permeates every aspect of our lives, all the while remaining invisible and unaccountable.</p><p>The allegations against Google ignore real complexities in the voting process. For example, Epstein testified that Google shifted millions of votes from \"undecided\" to the Clinton ledger, but could any of us know for sure that a mere search result is sufficient to determine a person's vote? A liberal skew in search results around health care might make a voter more sympathetic to a Democrat, but it might be the candidates' stances on abortion that determine the person's actual vote. Epstein's research didn't take this into account.</p><p>In addition, how we word our searches might influence the visibility of conservative vs. liberal information sources. One person might search for \"terrorist attack\"; another might search for \"Islamic terror.\" Wouldn't this affect what each person sees?</p><p>And of course, not all activity online promotes the Democratic cause. As Trump so often ignores, several entities - from Cambridge Analytica to the Russian government - gamed platforms such as Facebook to support his candidacy. Yes, Facebook labels certain \"news\" stories differently when they come from sponsors on our feeds, but is there any evidence that we really noticed the difference?</p><p>In truth, the pernicious effect of private, corporate technology platforms on our political lives is complex. They are not cheerleaders for a political party; their goal is to keep us glued to their sites and services, all while surveilling us 24/7. They don't do this for fun, or necessarily for political power; they do it because it makes them billions of dollars.</p><p>It's time to demand transparency and accountability on our tech platforms, specifically on what data they collect, why we see the content we see and how we can navigate through the morass of information they claim to make available to us. We think we are searching when we go onto Google, but in fact, the company is searching us. It is surveilling our interests for its own purposes, and we have no control over how these technologies influence our behavior or thinking.</p><p>Ultimately, we should remember that at its infancy, the Internet was funded by taxpayer money. As private corporations reap the spoils of this technological marvel, they owe a debt to the public - they should open themselves up to regulation, audit and competition. Google, Facebook, Amazon and other companies can support democracy by entering into a new social contract, both to serve the public interest and to support our own sovereignty as users.</p><p>Google poses a problem, but not because it's a phantom organ of the Democratic Party. The real issue is that its mysterious workings - as well as those of its fellow tech companies - are hidden far from sight and controlled by a few.

He is author of the forthcoming book \"                             Beyond the Valley                          .\"          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Conservatives have made it their mission lately to paint tech companies as liberal opponents whose mission is to secretly thwart Republicans online. This includes President Trump, who tweeted this week that Google had \"manipulated from 2.6 million to 16 million votes for Hillary Clinton in 2016 Election.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The president, here, is wrong. Not only is he inaccurately summing up research on the effects of bias in Google's search engine; he is also ignoring some key flaws in that research. But there's a troubling kernel of truth here: Online companies wield powerful technology that shapes our beliefs, how we work and how we live. Their technologies act on all of us, regardless of our gender, race, age or political persuasion.</p><p>So while it's wrong to characterize Google as part of the Democratic Party machine, there's plenty of room to question how it's affecting our democracy and society.</p><p>Trump's tweet refers to research by Robert Epstein, an academic psychologist who testified in Congress in June that Google helped Hillary Clinton win at least 2.6 million votes in 2016 by serving undecided voters with politically biased search results. Epstein, who describes himself as \"center-left,\" claims that his research from the 2018 midterms shows that big tech companies hold the power to control 15 million votes, effectively making \"free and fair election(s) meaningless.\"</p><p>I have been studying the Internet's impact on our political, cultural and economic lives across the world for 20 years, and Epstein is a respected colleague of mine. We both agree that the digital systems we use every day are dangerous to democracy. This is because the voices that create and monetize them are extremely limited - paving the way for a few tech billionaires to create the empires that monitor us daily, giving them the potential to manipulate our behavior.</p><p>But if we narrow the scope of tech's influence to partisan politics, we miss the larger issue - that the influence of these systems is profoundly undemocratic. Big tech's reach permeates every aspect of our lives, all the while remaining invisible and unaccountable.</p><p>The allegations against Google ignore real complexities in the voting process. For example, Epstein testified that Google shifted millions of votes from \"undecided\" to the Clinton ledger, but could any of us know for sure that a mere search result is sufficient to determine a person's vote? A liberal skew in search results around health care might make a voter more sympathetic to a Democrat, but it might be the candidates' stances on abortion that determine the person's actual vote. Epstein's research didn't take this into account.</p><p>In addition, how we word our searches might influence the visibility of conservative vs. liberal information sources. One person might search for \"terrorist attack\"; another might search for \"Islamic terror.\" Wouldn't this affect what each person sees?</p><p>And of course, not all activity online promotes the Democratic cause. As Trump so often ignores, several entities - from Cambridge Analytica to the Russian government - gamed platforms such as Facebook to support his candidacy. Yes, Facebook labels certain \"news\" stories differently when they come from sponsors on our feeds, but is there any evidence that we really noticed the difference?</p><p>In truth, the pernicious effect of private, corporate technology platforms on our political lives is complex. They are not cheerleaders for a political party; their goal is to keep us glued to their sites and services, all while surveilling us 24/7. They don't do this for fun, or necessarily for political power; they do it because it makes them billions of dollars.</p><p>It's time to demand transparency and accountability on our tech platforms, specifically on what data they collect, why we see the content we see and how we can navigate through the morass of information they claim to make available to us. We think we are searching when we go onto Google, but in fact, the company is searching us. It is surveilling our interests for its own purposes, and we have no control over how these technologies influence our behavior or thinking.</p><p>Ultimately, we should remember that at its infancy, the Internet was funded by taxpayer money. As private corporations reap the spoils of this technological marvel, they owe a debt to the public - they should open themselves up to regulation, audit and competition. Google, Facebook, Amazon and other companies can support democracy by entering into a new social contract, both to serve the public interest and to support our own sovereignty as users. (Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos also owns The Post.)</p><p>Google poses a problem, but not because it's a phantom organ of the Democratic Party. The real issue is that its mysterious workings - as well as those of its fellow tech companies - are hidden far from sight and controlled by a few. It's time for a digital bill of rights - one that ensures that the rest of us and our interests are part of the Internet's DNA, as well.</p><p>             Read more:</p><p>             Hugh Hewitt: To regulate 'Big Tech,' we need prudence, not politics          </p><p>             Charlie Kirk: It's time to treat tech platforms like publishers          </p><p>             John A.

This includes President Trump, who tweeted this week that Google had \"manipulated from 2.6 million to 16 million votes for Hillary Clinton in 2016 Election.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The president, here, is wrong. Not only is he inaccurately summing up research on the effects of bias in Google's search engine; he is also ignoring some key flaws in that research. But there's a troubling kernel of truth here: Online companies wield powerful technology that shapes our beliefs, how we work and how we live. Their technologies act on all of us, regardless of our gender, race, age or political persuasion.</p><p>So while it's wrong to characterize Google as part of the Democratic Party machine, there's plenty of room to question how it's affecting our democracy and society.</p><p>Trump's tweet refers to research by Robert Epstein, an academic psychologist who testified in Congress in June that Google helped Hillary Clinton win at least 2.6 million votes in 2016 by serving undecided voters with politically biased search results. Epstein, who describes himself as \"center-left,\" claims that his research from the 2018 midterms shows that big tech companies hold the power to control 15 million votes, effectively making \"free and fair election(s) meaningless.\"</p><p>I have been studying the Internet's impact on our political, cultural and economic lives across the world for 20 years, and Epstein is a respected colleague of mine. We both agree that the digital systems we use every day are dangerous to democracy. This is because the voices that create and monetize them are extremely limited - paving the way for a few tech billionaires to create the empires that monitor us daily, giving them the potential to manipulate our behavior.</p><p>But if we narrow the scope of tech's influence to partisan politics, we miss the larger issue - that the influence of these systems is profoundly undemocratic. Big tech's reach permeates every aspect of our lives, all the while remaining invisible and unaccountable.</p><p>The allegations against Google ignore real complexities in the voting process. For example, Epstein testified that Google shifted millions of votes from \"undecided\" to the Clinton ledger, but could any of us know for sure that a mere search result is sufficient to determine a person's vote? A liberal skew in search results around health care might make a voter more sympathetic toward a Democrat, but it might be the candidates' stances on abortion that determine the person's actual vote. Epstein's research didn't take this into account.</p><p>In addition, how we word our searches might influence the visibility of conservative vs. liberal information sources. One person might search for \"terrorist attack\"; another might search for \"Islamic terror.\" Wouldn't this affect what each person sees?</p><p>And, of course, not all activity online promotes the Democratic cause. As Trump so often ignores, several entities - from Cambridge Analytica to the Russian government - gamed platforms such as Facebook to  support  his candidacy. Yes, Facebook labels certain \"news\" stories differently when they come from sponsors on our feeds, but is there any evidence that we really noticed the difference?</p><p>In truth, the pernicious effect of private, corporate technology platforms on our political lives is complex. They are not cheerleaders for a political party; their goal is to keep us glued to their sites and services, all while surveilling us 24/7. They don't do this for fun, or necessarily for political power; they do it because it makes them billions of dollars.</p><p>It's time to demand transparency and accountability on our tech platforms, specifically on what data they collect, why we see the content we see and how we can navigate through the morass of information they claim to make available to us. We think we are searching when we log on to Google, but in fact, the company is searching us. It is surveilling our interests for its own purposes, and we have no control over how these technologies influence our behavior or thinking.</p><p>Ultimately, we should remember that at its infancy, the Internet was funded by taxpayer money. As private corporations reap the spoils of this technological marvel, they owe a debt to the public - they should open themselves up to regulation, audit and competition. Google, Facebook, Amazon and other companies can support democracy by entering into a new social contract, both to serve the public interest and to support our own sovereignty as users. (Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos also owns The Post.)</p><p>Google poses a problem, but not because it's a phantom organ of the Democratic Party. The real issue is that its mysterious workings - as well as those of its fellow tech companies - are hidden far from sight and controlled by a few. It's time for a digital bill of rights - one that ensures that the rest of us and our interests are part of the Internet's DNA, as well.</p><p>Ramesh Srinivasan is a professor at the University of California at Los Angeles in the department of information studies and director of the UC Digital Cultures Lab.

This includes President Trump, who tweeted this week that Google had \"manipulated from 2.6 million to 16 million votes for Hillary Clinton in 2016 Election.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The president, here, is wrong. Not only is he inaccurately summing up research on the effects of bias in Google's search engine; he is also ignoring some key flaws in that research. But there's a troubling kernel of truth here: Online companies wield powerful technology that shapes our beliefs, how we work and how we live. Their technologies act on all of us, regardless of our gender, race, age or political persuasion.</p><p>So while it's wrong to characterize Google as part of the Democratic Party machine, there's plenty of room to question how it's affecting our democracy and society.</p><p>Trump's tweet refers to research by Robert Epstein, an academic psychologist who testified in Congress in June that Google helped Hillary Clinton win at least 2.6 million votes in 2016 by serving undecided voters with politically biased search results. Epstein, who describes himself as \"center-left,\" claims that his research from the 2018 midterms shows that big tech companies hold the power to control 15 million votes, effectively making \"free and fair election(s) meaningless.\"</p><p>I have been studying the internet's impact on our political, cultural and economic lives across the world for 20 years, and Epstein is a respected colleague of mine. We both agree that the digital systems we use every day are dangerous to democracy. This is because the voices that create and monetize them are extremely limited - paving the way for a few tech billionaires to create the empires that monitor us daily, giving them the potential to manipulate our behavior.</p><p>But if we narrow the scope of tech's influence to partisan politics, we miss the larger issue - that the influence of diese systems is profoundly undemocratic. Big tech's reach permeates every aspect of our lives, all the while remaining invisible and unaccountable.</p><p>The allegations against Google ignore real complexities in the voting process. For example, Epstein testified that Google shifted millions of votes from \"undecided\" to the Clinton ledger, but could any of us know for sure that a mere search result is sufficient to determine a person's vote? A liberal skew in search results around health care might make a voter more sympathetic to a Democrat, but it might be the candidates' stances on abortion that determine the person's actual vote. Epstein's research didn't take this into account.</p><p>In addition, how we word our searches might influence the visibility of conservative vs. liberal information sources. One person might search for \"terrorist attack\"; another might search for\" Islamic terror.\" Wouldn't this affect what each person sees?</p><p>And of course, not all activity online promotes the Democratic cause. As Trump so often ignores, several entities -from Cambridge Analytica to the Russian government -gamed platforms such as Facebook to support his candidacy. Yes, Facebooklabels certain \"news\" stories differently when they come from sponsors on our feeds, but is there any evidence that we really noticed the difference?</p><p>In truth, the pernicious effect of private, corporate technology platforms on our political lives is complex. They are not cheerleaders for a political party; their goal is to keep us glued to their sites and services, all while surveilling us 24/7. They don't do this for fun, or necessarily for political power; they do it because it makes them billions of dollars.</p><p>It's time to demand transparency and accountability on our tech platforms, specifically on what data they collect, why we see the content we see and how we can navigate through the morass of information they claim to make available to us. We think we are searching when we go onto Google, but in fact, the company is searching us. It is surveilling our interests for its own purposes, and we have no control over how these technologies influence our behavior or thinking.</p><p>Ultimately, we should remember that at its infancy, the Internet was funded by taxpayer money. As private corporations reap the spoils of this technological marvel, they owe a debt to the public - they should open themselves up to regulation, audit and competition. Google, Facebook, Amazon and other companies can support democracy by entering into a new social contract, both to serve the public interest and to support our own sovereignty as users.</p><p>Google poses a problem, but not because it's a phantom organ of the Democratic Party. The real issue is that its mysterious workings - as well as those of its fellow tech companies - are hidden far from sight and controlled by a few. It's time for a digital bill of rights - one that ensures that the rest of us and our interests are part of the Internet's DNA, as well.</p><p>-SPECIAL TO THE WASHINGTON POST</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENW-2290103677</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">25301ENW</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X2G-TRY1-DYR7-8183-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11341</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"831\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 News - India Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>News India - Times</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 10710248</issn><volume>Vol. 50</volume><issueNumber>No. 35</issueNumber><aggregationName>Ethnic NewsWatch</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 30, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Others</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Commentary</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It has undertaken a 16-month public relations spectacle, designed to convince us that we want what it's selling for Quayside and the Port Lands district of Toronto. But cities aren't products, they're political constructs built in the public interest.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now - in the face of global threats such as climate change and ever-growing numbers of displaced people - it is vital that we bolster the power of local government to address these challenges, not diminish it, disrespect it or cede it.</p><p>The Port Lands are enormous; the last major parcel of undeveloped land in the city's core. There has long been global interest in the area, but it requires environmental remediation and lacks basic infrastructure; the governments' priorities have slowed the development process down.</p><p>In the wake of the recent Toronto Star expos#233; about Sidewalk Labs' plans and its ideas for financing infrastructure - plans that may include the company collecting a share of municipal tax revenue in the future - some residents are saying: Well, why not? If government isn't building transit or funding infrastructure fast enough, why shouldn't this company be given the chance to do so?</p><p>While frustration with government may be legitimately acute, the answer is not to sign off on corporate capture of government and the people it is designed to serve. Though we live in an era of political cynicism, city governments enjoy the highest level of public trust. The Sidewalk Toronto project reflects contempt for civic engagement, urban planning and democratic rights when we need exactly the opposite.</p><p>Sidewalk Labs isn't just relying on utopian architectural renderings of new construction to entice us: they are selling us fear. Fear that our government will fail us yet again. Fear that if this company doesn't do it, nobody will.</p><p>But this is smoke and mirrors. Canadians just committed $1.2 billion to rehabilitate the mouth of the Don River and protect the Port Lands from flooding - a big hurdle to building new neighbourhoods there. And there are hundreds of firms, both locally and globally, that would bid on a range of the projects that are being considered in the Port Lands if they were given the chance.</p><p>Why were discussions about Quayside, which should only happen between government and residents, up for sale to Sidewalk Labs? And why was it decided that Quayside could be used as a keystone to indirectly access much larger legacy lands?</p><p>Yes, there are reasons that certain technologies and infrastructure must be considered at scale, but this process weaponized ambiguity to the detriment of a clear and accessible public narrative about what this project was about, including the business model and the actors involved. Corporations shouldn't run public consultations.</p><p>There are rules around lobbying to protect influence in government. Where are the rules to prevent this confusion of democratic process? It's the same approach that Google uses in technology markets: identify areas where there aren't strong regulatory regimes and exploit them. This is called regulatory capture, a specialty of big tech.</p><p>Torontonians never asked to become part of a high-tech test bed, to house an experiment where corporations have a blanket capacity to collect significant amounts of data as a matter of course.</p><p>Due to a poorly structured RFP, a proposal for one was accepted, adding a whole new kind of risk. Toronto lacks policies to ensure democratic fairness where digital and physical spaces converge. We're vulnerable.</p><p>Sidewalk's CEO, Daniel Doctoroff, is fond of saying that the company will be a \"catalyst\" for developing the Port Lands. But it is residents and government that are the catalysts.</p><p>If we want tall timber buildings and other low-carbon features for the precinct, include them in the next procurement. Sidewalk Labs isn't presenting us with a bold vision; it's making a bold power grab.</p><p>We don't need Sidewalk Labs. We need to believe in local government and in its role in democratic society. Once it's gone we won't get it back. Normalizing this project is setting a dangerous precedent for democracy, one that should end and end now.</p><p>Bianca Wylie is a</p><p>data governance advocate and the co-founder of</p><p>Tech Reset Canada.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2019022653600122</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VHC-RRY1-DY91-K20J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"710\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 26, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000297</classCode><className>CITIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000300</classCode><className>CITY LIFE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009G89</classCode><className>REGIONAL &amp;

The vote was 89-10[1]. Only one presidential contender in the Senate opposed it, Bernie. Like MoscowMitch, Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar and, obviously, Colorado neolib Michael Bennet, voted for it. </p><p>Nine Democrats and one Republican opposed Trump on this: \u2022 Bernie (I-USA) \u2022 Chuck Schumer (D-NY) \u2022 Cory Booker (D-NJ) \u2022 Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) \u2022 Kamala Harris (D-CA) \u2022 Ed Markey (D-MA) \u2022 Brian Schatz (D-HI) \u2022 Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) \u2022 Jack Reed (D-RI) \u2022 Pat Toomey (R-PA) Erica Werner and Rachel Siegel wrote the vote up from an establishment perspective[2] for the Washington Post, noting it is \"delivering on President Trump's promise of a new and better North American trade deal just ahead of his impeachment trial,\" although why they decided to lead by deciding it is \"better\" is anyone's guess.Only 41 members of the House[3] had opposed it last month, 38 Democrats, 2 Republicans + Michigan independent Justin Amash. Among the Democrats voting no in the House were outstanding progressives like AOC (NY), Pramila Jayapal (WA), Ilhan Omar (MN), Jamie Raskin (MD), Ted Lieu (CA), Rashida Tlaib (MI), Mark Pocan (WI), Barbara Lee (CA), Andy Levin )MI), Jim McGovern (MA) and Ayanna Pressley (MA).Werner and Siegel reported that \"months of negotiations between Democrats and the White House produced pro-labor revisions and jettisoned drug exclusivity language sought by the pharmaceutical industry. The 12-million-strong AFL-CIO was closely involved in negotiating the changes and backed the agreement, along with some other major unions... Senate Republicans had little influence in the process because Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) held a make-or-break role in deciding whether to bring the deal up on the floor of the House, which by law had to act first on the agreement. The outsized role played by House Democrats and their allies in labor angered some Republicans, including Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA), the deal's most outspoken opponent, who complained that the Senate got 'rolled' in the process.\"Bernie voiced his opposition on the floor of the Senate on Wednesday during the debate. \"This agreement is opposed by labor unions like the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers and the United Food and Commercial Workers. It is opposed by the Sunrise Movement, the Sierra Club, Friends of the Earth, the League of Conservation Voters and every major environmental group in America. \"And it is opposed by the National Family Farm Coalition, which believes it will lock in rules that have devastated family farms and expanded corporate control over agriculture in North America.\"I am proud to stand with these labor unions, environmental groups and family farmers against Trump's NAFTA 2.0.\"I not only voted against NAFTA in 1993, but marched against it. In 2000, I voted against Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China. I opposed the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement and DR-CAFTA. And I helped lead the effort in Congress and with the grassroots across this country against the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\"There is no doubt in my mind that we need to fundamentally rewrite our disastrous trade agreements and create and protect good-paying American jobs, to improve the environment and combat climate change, and to stop the destructive race to the bottom.\"Unfortunately, this revised trade agreement with Mexico and Canada does none of those things.It must be re-written.\"While NAFTA has led to the loss of nearly one million American jobs, this agreement does virtually nothing to stop the outsourcing of jobs to Mexico.Under this agreement, large, multi-national corporations will still be able to shut down factories in America where workers are paid $28 an hour and move to Mexico where they are paid less than $2 an hour.\"When Trump was a candidate for president he promised that he would stop the outsourcing of American jobs to Mexico, China and other low-wage countries. It hasn't happened.\"The truth is, since Trump took office, over 170,000 American jobs have been shipped overseas.In 2018, we had a record-breaking $891 billion trade deficit in goods, a $419 billion trade deficit with China and an $81 billion trade deficit with Mexico.In 2018, for the first time in history, manufacturing workers began getting paid less than workers overall. Today, manufacturing workers get $28.15 an hour while the average worker makes 15 cents more.\"Last month alone, we lost 12,000 factory jobs and despite Trump's rhetoric we are in a manufacturing recession.\"Mr. President, there is a reason why virtually every major environmental group is opposed to Trump's NAFTA 2.0. This agreement does nothing to stop fossil fuel companies like Exxon Mobil and Chevron from dumping their waste and pollution into Mexico and destroying the environment. In fact, it makes it easier for fossil fuel companies to bring tar sands oil into the United States through dangerous pipelines like the Keystone XL.It does not even mention the words 'climate change'-- the most existential threat facing our planet.\"The deal preserves the disastrous Investor-State Dispute Settlement system for oil and gas companies, allowing them to continue to put corporate profits ahead of our air, water, climate and health.\"Mr. President, at this pivotal moment in American history, it is not good enough to tinker around the edges.The scientific community has been very clear-- if we do not act boldly and aggressively to transform our economy to sustainable sources of power, there will be irreparable harm done to our planet.\"In my view, we need to re-write this trade agreement to stop the outsourcing of American jobs, to combat climate change, to protect the environment, and stop the destructive race to the bottom.\"We have got to stop large, profitable corporations that are outsourcing American jobs overseas from receiving lucrative federal contracts.\"And we have got to repeal Trump's tax giveaway to the wealthy that have provided huge tax breaks to companies that shut down manufacturing plants in the U.S. and move abroad.\"Trade is a good thing, but it has got to be fair.\"Let us defeat NAFTA 2.0 and go back to the drawing board to protect American workers, to protect the environment and to lift the living standards of all workers.\" I asked some of the 2020 congressional candidates how they feel about this trade bill. Many answered the same way Brianna Wu, running in the Boston area against areactionary New Dem, who said she understands \"why people would support this, but it's clear this is not a long-term solution for American workers. And I agree with Senator Sanders that this does not go far enough on raising wages or addressing climate change. When I am serving in Congress we won't settle for half-measures that pad corporate profits. We will stand unapologetically with working class Americans.\"Werner and Stein also noted that \"The deal created divisions in the Democratic presidential primary field. In a debate Tuesday night, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) predicted that the agreement would lead to the continued outsourcing of U.S. jobs and said, 'We could do much better than a Trump-led trade deal.' But other leading candidates, including Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), support the deal. Warren called it a 'modest improvement' that will deliver needed relief to farmers and workers hurt by Trump's trade policies. Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-NY) voted against USMCA, saying that while the deal does include labor provisions, 'it does not address climate change, the greatest threat facing the planet.' In a statement, Schumer said that the Trump administration is giving incentives for manufacturers to move businesses and jobs from the U.S. to Mexico, which has weaker clean air and water regulations.'The Trump administration also included handouts for the oil and gas industry, such as lifting tariffs on tar sands, and refused to include any mention of the climate crisis in the agreement,\" Schumer said. <url normalizedValue=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_mPGIqACCsw/XiCxpiWr_yI/AAAAAAABtx8/ZwQE7BINSoQKNA06U3WnZh-5h-UM_mAjgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2020-01-16%2Bat%2B9.43.50%2BAM.png...USMCA\">https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_mPGIqACCsw/XiCxpiWr_yI/AAAAAAABtx8/ZwQE7BINSoQKNA06U3WnZh-5h-UM_mAjgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2020-01-16%2Bat%2B9.43.50%2BAM.png...USMCA</url> also includes new rules for digital trade, something that barely existed when the original NAFTA was written. Among these, however, is a provision that provides protections to big tech companies by giving legal immunity to internet platforms over content posted by users. Pelosi opposed the provision but was unsuccessful in keeping it out of the deal in the final throes of talks last month. She cited it as her one disappointment in how the deal turned out.Economists also worry that USMCA will spur a spike in car prices, especially on smaller cars that used to be produced in Mexico but may be subject to duties at the border. U.S. tariffs on Canadian steel are also still in place. Our progressive hero in Arizona, Eva Putzova, was very clear she won't be voting for this kind of trade agreement when she replaces Blue Dog Tom O'Halleran. \"Like Bernie Sanders and AOC,\" she said after the Senate vote, \"I oppose the USMCA, also known as NAFTA 2.0.We need trade agreements that protect workers and the environment and address climate change, not to enhance corporate profits. We have to retool the global economy and those agreements can be part the climate crisis solution. When I am in Congress that is the lens I will use when considering any future trade agreements. There won't be any trade on a dead planet.\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/primaryabluedog?refcode=thermometer...dembox=showMark\">https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/primaryabluedog?refcode=thermometer...dembox=showMark</url> Gamba, mayor of Milwaukie, Oregon, is running for a congressional seat occupied by a another reactionary Blue Dog, the notorious Kurt Schrader. Gamba told us that \"The childishly named USMCA is only nominally better than NAFTA. Both allow for environmental destruction to leak to other countries, dramatically reducing the effectiveness of our own environmental laws. At a time when we should be taxing oil companies to pay for the damage they've caused this agreement does the opposite. Thousands of good American jobs will continue to be killed so that millionaires can make even more, by paying mexican workers 1/10 of what Americans make. At a time when we should be helping small family farms that grow our food sustainably, this does the opposite and guarantees more giant aggribusiness takeover of food production.

To add to Marshall's tally of ticking time bombs in finance-land: another source of systemic risk is central counterparties for derivatives. They were supposed to reduce risk by shifting clearing and settlement of many types of derivatives out of banks and over to entities that would be well capitalized and at arm's length to the banks. We've written how the central counterparties are new TBTF entities, since charging high enough margin and other loss reserves to provide for enough liquidity to handle a serious shock would make many derivatives uneconomical. </p><p>We summarized some of the failings in a 2018 post[1], which included key points from a recent Bloomberg op-ed by derivative maven Satyajit Das[2]:First, oversight is fragmented. Second, the system assumes traders can meet margin calls at short noticeIn practice, volatile market conditions require higher margins, which exacerbate systemic cash needs, force mass liquidation of positions and increase the central counterparty's risk. Third, initial margin-setting relies on risk models \u2014 based on assumed price behaviors and historical volatility and correlation data \u2014 that have repeatedly failed in the real world.the ability of non-defaulting members to bear losses may be lower than expected. Even single counterparty limits, designed to avoid concentrated exposure, are imperfect, as Norway's case highlights. Fourth, central counterparties have adverse incentives. To gain market share, they might undercut each other on margins or default fund contributions, thus undermining the stability of the system itself. The default waterfall also entails moral hazard: Strong firms, forced to bear the liabilities of the weak, have little motivation to become clearing members.By Marshall Auerback, a market analyst and commentator. Produced by Economy for All[3], a project of the Independent Media Institute Judging from the public conversation we're having as we head into the early stages of the 2020 presidential election, bankers no longer appear to be public enemy number one. Big tech appears to have that title. Still, let's not forget that the actions of several large financial institutions in the run-up to 2008 were largely responsible for catastrophic job losses of millions of households, the repossession of their houses, the destruction of their retirement savings, the collapse of a multitude of businesses, an ongoing stranglehold into myriad forms of debt, and a relentless lobbying machine that exonerates it from any kind of oversight with real teeth. The legislative response to this fiasco, the Dodd-Frank Act, is being undermined every which way, and wasn't all that strong to start with. It was passed in order 'to 'promote financial stability,' 'lift our economy,' and 'end too big to fail,'' argued financial observer Tyler O'Neil[4], 'and the bill has achieved none of those goals.' In fact, it created a host of perverse incentives that have likely made our problems a whole lot worse. Financial reform might be yesterday's news, but we are inching closer to another economic crisis, in which the 'old news' might very well become new and relevant again. Why is that? For one thing, Dodd-Frank did not structurally alter the banking system (in contrast to the aftermath of the Great Depression via Glass-Steagall). The big 'too big to fail' (TBTF) banks got bigger. And by bigger, we're talking about a sizable ownership stake over 60 percent of GDP. One prominent example is the newly established Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB\u2014an Elizabeth Warren proposal that actually initially proved to be one of the few effective reforms introduced by the new banking legislation). The CFPB has been largely gutted by 'acting' head, Mick Mulvaney[5]. Likewise, the oversight provisions for big banks have been watered down by the appropriately named Crapo Bill[6], and Dodd-Frank's detailed rule-making injunctions have largely been left to the discretion of bank-friendly executive agencies, such as the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), all of which have historically shown themselves to be prone to regulatory capture. Even one of Dodd's contributing architects, Lawrence Summers, in a piece co-authored with Harvard Ph.D. candidate Natasha Sarin, found[7] no evidence 'that markets regard banks as substantially safer today than they were in the pre-crisis period.' Many of the same practices that led to the collapse of the financial system in 2008 are as prevalent today as they were in 2007[8]. These include the revival of some of the most toxic products that contributed to the last crash[9], such as the synthetic collateralized debt obligation (CDO) and the related collateralized loan obligation[10] (CLO), along with an ongoing regulatory culture that still expresses itself in policy preferences that favor industry interests over those of ordinary citizens. Given the Democrats' renewed enthusiasm for antitrust (at least as it applies to big tech), the question is whether 'break 'em up' to foster greater competition is the way to go with banks, or whether a more 'function-centric' approach to regulation makes more sense going forward. On big tech, I've written before[11]that size per se may not be the best benchmark to establish optimal regulation. The same might be true for banks. Simply mandating a breakup in the sector, married to 'free market' competition and other market-based reforms, is unlikely to do the trick (that criticism applies as much to GOPers[12] as it does to Democrats). As professors Marc Lavoie and Mario Seccareccia have observed[13], 'greater competition could be a good thing in industries producing, say, 'widgets,' since the lower the price that could potentially ensue as a result of lower profits and greater productivity that would be impacted by the competition would have positive welfare benefits for the community at large.' But Lavoie and Seccareccia also recognize that banking is not only about profit for profit's sake or competitive free markets; therefore, 'applying these principles of competition to the banking sector, where there exists tremendous externalities, could be disastrous.' One of those 'externalities' arises from the fact that the banking sector has a unique social dimension that in many respects does not readily lend itself to all of the dictates of a competitive free market system. There is a reason why our government made a conscious policy decision after the Great Depression to guarantee the liabilities of the banking system via the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). It was to protect the integrity of the payments system, the lifeblood of an economy, as well as the businesses and consumers who relied on the provision of credit provided by the banks. A controlled oligopoly that disincentivizes banks from embracing risky speculation is one way to go (it works reasonably well in Canada, for example) because it focuses the regulatory thrust on function and outcome, rather than size alone. However, the U.S. banks are much bigger in asset size. 'Too big to fail' (TBTF) is relevant here because Dodd-Frank has done nothing to stop the banks from getting bigger, even though they pursue many of the same reckless policies that caused their banks to blow up in the last cycle. In fact, the implicit TBTF safety net has virtually guaranteed that bankers would continue to take on excessive 'tail risk' (i.e., too high a risk of ruin), argues Professor Edward Kane.[14] It is in that sense that size matters: much as the costs of a massive environmental cleanup increase in proportion to size, so too are the social and economic externalities much higher when associated with a big bank. But at the core, it is function married to TBTF that creates the root problem; simply using antitrust to foster competition is unhelpful if all such competition does is to drive banks, regardless of size, to embrace increasingly reckless activities that augment their respective bottom lines, and do so in a way that ultimately compromises the integrity of the payments system. There are some things banks should not be allowed to do, period[15]. So what's the right approach: do high levels of concentration in the banking sector promote greater financial instability, or is it a question of function? In truth, they are interrelated, but function matters more. Ask any neutral observer today whether Goldman Sachs or the Japan Post Bank (the world's biggest deposit holder[16]) poses a greater threat to financial stability and virtually all will agree that it is the former. That is because systemic risk is largely engendered via function, and 'interconnectedness[17],' rather than asset size. In contrast to Goldman Sachs (or virtually any large American commercial or investment bank), the range of activities of the Japan Post Bank is limited to a fairly mundane roster of traditional banking functions\u2014it is primarily a savings institution. As its Wikipedia page notes[18], 'its only loan products are overdraft[19] lines secured by time deposits and Japanese government bonds on deposit with the bank.' This makes it highly stable, despite its massive size. Nobody is realistically suggesting that we restrict our banks' functionality to the degree of the Japan Post Bank. We can't turn back the clock that far. But the Japan Post Bank example is an important illustration that a simplistic focus on size isn't enough. The corollary also applies: a group of relatively small institutions that act in a correlated fashion can be just as dangerous to the payments system as one large entity if the underlying activity in which they engage collectively is unsafe. Lehman Brothers' activities were being replicated elsewhere (the 'interconnectedness' problem), by others. Had it just been one small bank, the problem could have been better contained. Again, function supersedes size in terms of regulatory priority. By the same token, it's too pat a conclusion to argue that the collapse of a small institution such as Lehman Brothers somehow absolves the big banks. The root cause of Lehman's failure was that it was a relatively small institution struggling to compete with the TBTF banks, whose massive balance sheets gave them a built-in advantage over the smaller competitor. Working to match the returns of the bigger banks, Lehman's smaller balance sheet forced management to undertake further riskier activities (as well deploying dangerous levels of leverage). The resultant toxicity of their balance sheet made Lehman unsalvageable, leading the government to let it go bust. 'Let it go bust' is harder to do with a bigger bank. The externalities can be catastrophic. At the same time, the public instinctively understands the benefits of the implicit TBTF backstop accorded to big banks and hence continues to 'vote' with its deposits. Which is to say that banking customers have increasingly migrated to these very same behemoth institutions precisely because the government has repeatedly shown that it will not let them go under (in contrast to smaller institutions like Lehman). America's three largest banks by assets\u2014JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo\u2014'have added more than $2.4 trillion in domestic deposits[20] over the past 10 years, a 180% increase,' according to an analysis of the regulatory data conducted by the Wall Street Journal in 2018[21]. (In the case of Wells Fargo, this ongoing deposit growth is truly incredible, given that the bank has seen its already low reputation decline further, in light of the scandals[22]that have recently been uncovered.) The same WSJ report goes on to note[23] that this deposit growth represents 'an increase from 20% of the country's total deposit base in 2007 to 32%, an amount [that] exceeds what the top eight banks had in such deposits combined in 2007.' Add Citi to this group, and you have four banks holding almost half of America's total deposit base.[24] The WSJ article also points out that[25] '45% of new checking accounts were opened at the three national banks, even though those lenders had only 24% of U.S. branches [whereas] regional and community banks had 76% of branches but got only 48% of new accounts.' That matters because 'new checking customers, who tend to be younger, are valuable to banks because they often provide more business later on by, for instance, taking out a mortgage or opening a brokerage account.'Rapid, unchecked business expansion, combined with regulatory laxity and TBTF bailouts, has therefore given banks an enormous incentive to get as big as possible. Dodd-Frank hasn't changed that. In fact, a working paper commissioned by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia[26] by authors Elijah Brewer III and Julapa Jagtiani has furnished multiple examples of banks paying significant premiums to ensure that they would be over the asset sizes commonly viewed as the requisite thresholds to become too big to fail. But TBTF is even worse than that, because in many cases, it can actually sustain the lifespan of an otherwise insolvent bank, what Professor Ed Kane calls 'zombie' banks[27]: 'Insolvent Living-Dead firms whose creditors would force them into bankruptcy were it not for various governments' implicit TBTF guarantees' (Deutsche Bank is one example that immediately springs to mind[28]). That matters because if you're a bank CEO and you know that in reality your bank is already insolvent, what's the disincentive from continuing to speculate with the bank's balance sheet? TBTF enhances reckless moral hazard. Although banks consistently lobby the government when an attack is made on their 'profit-making activities,' the focus of those lobbying efforts obviously shifts to bailouts, the minute they are about to blow up. All of a sudden 'government-led socialism' doesn't seem so pernicious. It is not unreasonable to restrict the banks' activities, especially when deposit-taking institutions are in a position unique to virtually any other business. The government underwrites their main liabilities\u2014i.e., their deposit base\u2014via the FDIC. No other business is afforded this level of protection. Likewise, regulation has become increasingly complex and cumbersome in direct proportion to the complexity of the activities undertaken by the banks themselves. That's often used as an excuse to minimize regulation, when in fact it should provoke a different response: namely, restricting the range of systemically dangerous activities/financial innovations, so that the regulation accordingly can be simplified, and easier to enforce. (Parenthetically, a function-centric approach is better here than simply focusing on boosting capital buffers, which many bank reformers have advocated[29]. To be sure, capital buffers do constitute an important insurance policy for a bank in the event of a financial calamity, but regulation optimally should tackle the activities that give rise to the need for the 'insurance policy' in the first place.) If banks persist in undertaking a proscribed activity via regulatory arbitrage, or some other form of legerdemain, the challenge for policy makers/regulators is to contain the resultant fallout so that it does not endanger the financial system as a whole (as well as jailing the offending bankers so that 'too big to fail' doesn't morph into 'too big to jail,' as clearly occurred in the 2008 crisis aftermath). At a bare minimum, the goal should be, as Keynes argued in Chapter 12 of the[30] General Theory[31], for finance to act as a handmaiden of industry (or productive 'enterprise') rather than the other way around, since the latter condition results in an overly financialized system that is dominated by largely unfettered rentier speculative activity. Unfortunately, Keynes' aspirations remain unfulfilled. Banks dominate industry and work in ways that derogate from broader public purpose. The tolerance of TBTF doctrine illustrates that we don't yet have the political will to curb the speculative activities of the large deposit-taking institutions (again, another byproduct of their size, as it gives the banks more lobbying muscle to resist such changes). But if we don't come to grips with this problem, there will inevitably be another crisis. In fact, it's almost certainly too late to avoid that eventuality. But at a minimum, let's hope we do better when the next banking crisis hits, as it surely will, much as night follows day.<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2019/05/yes-the-tech-giants-are-a-big-problem-but-its-the-untamed-finance-industry-that-could-still-blow-up-the-economy-in-a-flash.html?utm_source=feedburner..._medium=feed..._campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#\">https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2019/05/yes-the-tech-giants-are-a-big-problem-but-its-the-untamed-finance-industry-that-could-still-blow-up-the-economy-in-a-flash.html?utm_source=feedburner..._medium=feed..._campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#</url> This entry was posted in Banana republic[32], Doomsday scenarios[33], Economic fundamentals[34], Guest Post[35], Payment system[36], Politics[37], Regulations and regulators[38], Risk and risk management[39] on May 4, 2019[40] by Yves Smith[41].

He is leading a five-year Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council-funded project looking at the dynamics of these techno-economic transformations.</p><p>The ongoing Competition Bureau investigation follows a recent US Congressional Hearing (<url normalizedValue=\"https://judiciary.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=3113\">https://judiciary.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=3113</url>) on July 29 in which American politicians grilled the CEOs of Amazon, Apple, Google, and Facebook for more than five hours about their market strategies and practices.</p><p>\"The Hearing raised numerous issues with the way that these so-called 'Big Tech' firms shape and dominate markets, thereby reducing competition or side-lining potential competitors,\" says Kean.</p><p>There have been other hearings prior to this, not only in the U.S. but also across several countries, including the International Grand Committee on Big Data, Privacy and Democracy established in November 2018 by four Canadian and British MPs.</p><p>\"It is an apt time for the Competition Bureau to launch such an investigation. Amazon has done very well since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, as people have had to turn to the internet to buy most of their daily necessities,\" says Kean. Amazon reached a market capitalization of US$1 trillion at the start of 2020 - alongside Apple, Microsoft, and Google - and has since then put on another US$600 billion in market value.</p><p>See the graph for an illustration of how Big Tech has grown significantly faster than the rest of the stock market (S&amp;P500) during the pandemic.</p><p>See the chart here <url normalizedValue=\"https://news.yorku.ca/2020/08/18/do-big-tech-firms-like-amazon-have-too-much-market-power/\">https://news.yorku.ca/2020/08/18/do-big-tech-firms-like-amazon-have-too-much-market-power/</url></p><p>GOOG = Google; AMZN = Amazon; AAPL = Apple; FB = Facebook; MSFT = Microsoft; source of data, Yahoo Finance.

At McDonald's, the convenience store, even at mom-and-pop restaurants, his friends in Shanghai used mobile payments. Cash, Liu could see, had been largely replaced by two smartphone apps: Alipay and WeChat Pay. One day, at a vegetable market, he watched a woman his mother's age pull out her phone to pay for her groceries. He decided to sign up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To get an Alipay ID, Liu had to enter his cell phone number and scan his national ID card. He did so reflexively. Alipay had built a reputation for reliability, and compared to going to a bank managed with slothlike indifference and zero attention to customer service, signing up for Alipay was almost fun. With just a few clicks he was in. Alipay's slogan summed up the experience: \"Trust makes it simple.\"</p><p>Alipay turned out to be so convenient that Liu began using it multiple times a day, starting first thing in the morning, when he ordered breakfast through a food delivery app. He realized that he could pay for parking through Alipay's My Car feature, so he added his driver's license and license plate numbers, as well as the engine number of his Audi. He started making his car insurance payments with the app. He booked doctors' appointments there, skipping the chaotic lines for which Chinese hospitals are famous. He added friends in Alipay's built-in social network. When Liu went on vacation with his fianc\u00e9e (now his wife) to Thailand, they paid at restaurants and bought trinkets with Alipay. He stored whatever money was left over, which wasn't much once the vacation and car were paid for, in an Alipay money market account. He could have paid his electricity, gas, and internet bills in Alipay's City Service section. Like many young Chinese who had become enamored of the mobile payment services offered by Alipay and WeChat, Liu stopped bringing his wallet when he left the house.</p><p>If you live in the United States, you are by now accustomed to relinquishing your data to corporations. Credit card companies know when you run up bar tabs or buy sex toys. Facebook knows if you like Tasty cooking videos or Breitbart News. Uber knows where you go and how you behave en route. But Alipay knows all of these things about its users and more. Owned by Ant Financial, an affiliate of the massive Alibaba corporation, Alipay is sometimes called a super app. Its main competitor, WeChat, belongs to the social and gaming giant Tencent. Alipay and WeChat are less like individual apps than entire ecosystems. Whenever Liu opened Alipay on his phone, he saw a neat grid of icons that vaguely resembled the home screen on his Samsung. Some of the icons were themselves full-blown third-party apps. If he wanted to, he could access Airbnb, Uber, or Uber's Chinese rival Didi, entirely from inside Alipay. It was as if Amazon had swallowed eBay, Apple News, Groupon, American Express, Citibank, and YouTube-and could siphon up data from all of them.</p><p>One day a new icon appeared on Liu's Alipay home screen. It was labeled Zhima Credit (or Sesame Credit). The name, like that of Alipay's parent company, evoked the story of Ali Baba and the 40 thieves, in which the words <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">open sesame</emphasis> magically unseal a cave full of treasure. When Liu touched the icon, he was greeted by an image of the Earth. \"Zhima Credit is the embodiment of personal credit,\" the text underneath read. \"It uses big data to conduct an objective assessment. The higher the score, the better your credit.\" Further down was a button that read, in clean white characters, \"Start my credit journey.\" He tapped.</p><p>In 1956 an electrical engineer named bill fair and a mathematician named Earl Isaac started a small tech company out of a San Francisco apartment. They named it Fair, Isaac and Co., but the business eventually came to be known, for short, as FICO. Their chief innovation was using computer-driven statistical analysis to translate people's personal details and financial history into a simple score, predicting how likely they were to pay back loans. Before FICO, credit bureaus relied in part on gossip culled from people's landlords, neighbors, and local grocers. Applicants' race could be counted against them, as could messiness, poor morals, and \"effeminate gestures.\" Algorithmic scoring, Fair and Isaac argued, was a more equitable, scientific alternative to this unfair reality. FICO's approach eventually caught on among the credit bureaus-TransUnion, Experian, and Equifax-and in 1989 FICO introduced the credit score we know today, enabling millions of Americans to take out mortgages and rack up credit card bills.</p><p>During the past 30 years, by contrast, China has grown to become the world's second largest economy without much of a functioning credit system at all. The People's Bank of China, the country's central banking regulator, maintains records on millions of consumers, but they often contain little or no information. Until recently, it was difficult to get a credit card with any bank other than your own. Consumers mainly used cash. As housing prices spiked, this became increasingly untenable. \"Now you need two suitcases to buy a house, not just one,\" says Zennon Kapron, who heads the financial tech consultancy Kapronasia. Still, efforts to establish a reliable credit system foundered because China lacked a third-party credit scoring entity. What it did have by the end of 2011 were 356 million smartphone users.</p><p>That year, Ant Financial launched a version of Alipay with a built-in scanner for reading QR codes-square, machine-readable labels that can hold over 100 times more information than a standard bar code. (WeChat Pay, which launched in 2013, has a similar built-in scanner.) Scanning a QR code can bring you to a website, or pull up an app, or connect you to a person's social media profile. Codes started showing up on graves (scan to learn more about the deceased) and the shirts of waiters (scan to tip). Beggars printed out QR codes and set them out on the street. The codes linked the online and offline realms on a scale not seen anywhere else in the world. That first year with the QR scanner, Alipay mobile payments reached nearly $70 billion.</p><p>ON THE SCREEN WAS A BUTTON THAT READ, \"START MY CREDIT JOURNEY.\" LIU TAPPED.</p><p>In 2013, Ant Financial executives retreated to the mountains outside Hangzhou to discuss creating a slew of new products; one of them was Zhima Credit. The executives realized that they could use the data-collecting powers of Alipay to calculate a credit score based on an individual's activities. \"It was a very natural process,\" says You Xi, a Chinese business reporter who detailed this pivotal meeting in a recent book, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ant Financial</emphasis>. \"If you have payment data, you can assess the credit of a person.\" And so the tech company began the process of creating a score that would be \"credit for everything in your life,\" as You explains it.</p><p>Ant Financial wasn't the only entity keen on using data to measure people's worth. Coincidentally or not, in 2014 the Chinese government announced it was developing what it called a system of \"social credit.\" In 2014, the State Council, China's governing cabinet, publicly called for the establishment of a nationwide tracking system to rate the reputations of individuals, businesses, and even government officials. The aim is for every Chinese citizen to be trailed by a file compiling data from public and private sources by 2020, and for those files to be searchable by fingerprints and other biometric characteristics. The State Council calls it a \"credit system that covers the whole society.\"</p><p>For the Chinese Communist Party, social credit is an attempt at a softer, more invisible authoritarianism. The goal is to nudge people toward behaviors ranging from energy conservation to obedience to the Party. Samantha Hoffman, a consultant with the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London who is researching social credit, says that the government wants to preempt instability that might threaten the Party. \"That's why social credit ideally requires both coercive aspects and nicer aspects, like providing social services and solving real problems. It's all under the same Orwellian umbrella.\"</p><p>In 2015 Ant Financial was one of eight tech companies granted approval from the People's Bank of China to develop their own private credit scoring platforms. Zhima Credit appeared in the Alipay app shortly after that. The service tracks your behavior on the app to arrive at a score between 350 and 950, and offers perks and rewards to those with good scores. Zhima Credit's algorithm considers not only whether you repay your bills but also what you buy, what degrees you hold, and the scores of your friends. Like Fair and Isaac decades earlier, Ant Financial executives talked publicly about how a data-driven approach would open up the financial system to people who had been locked out, like students and rural Chinese. For the more than 200 million Alipay users who have opted in to Zhima Credit, the sell is clear: Your data will magically open doors for you.</p><p>Participating in Zhima Credit is voluntary, and it's unclear whether or how signing up for it could affect an individual's rating in the government system. Ant Financial declined to let me interview anyone from the company, but did provide a statement from Hu Tao, the general manager of Zhima Credit. \"Zhima Credit is dedicated to creating trust in a commercial setting and independent of any government-initiated social credit system,\" the statement reads. \"Zhima Credit does not share user scores or underlying data with any third party including the government without the user's prior consent.\"</p><p>Ant Financial did state, however, in a 2015 press release that the company plans \"to help build a social integrity system.\" And the company has already cooperated with the Chinese government in one important way: It has integrated a blacklist of more than 6 million people who have defaulted on court fines into Zhima Credit's database. According to Xinhua, the state news agency, this union of big tech and big government has helped courts punish more than 1.21 million defaulters, who opened their Zhima Credit one day to find their scores plunging.</p><p>The State Council has signaled that under the national social credit system people will be penalized for the crime of spreading online rumors, among other offenses, and that those deemed \"seriously untrustworthy\" can expect to receive substandard services. Ant Financial appears to be aiming for a society divided along moral lines as well. As Lucy Peng, the company's chief executive, was quoted as saying in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ant Financial</emphasis>, Zhima Credit \"will ensure that the bad people in society don't have a place to go, while good people can move freely and without obstruction.\"</p><p>THE SERVICE \"WILL ENSURE THAT THE BAD PEOPLE IN SOCIETY DON'T HAVE A PLACE TO GO.\"</p><p>I lived in China for the better part of a decade but left in 2014, before mobile payments had fully taken hold. Today $5.5 trillion in mobile payments are made every year in China. (In contrast, the US mobile payments market in 2016 was worth roughly $112 billion.) When I returned for a visit in August, I was determined to be a part of the new cashless China. So I signed up for Alipay and Zhima Credit a few hours after emerging bleary-eyed from the plane. Because I lacked a transaction history, I immediately faced what felt like an embarrassing judgment: a score of 550.</p><p>On my first day in Shanghai, I opened Zhima Credit to scan a yellow bike that I found parked at an angle on the sidewalk. China's bike-sharing culture had, like mobile payments, emerged out of nowhere, and Shanghai's streets were littered with brightly colored bikes, deposited wherever the riders pleased. A scan of a bike's QR code revealed a four-digit number that unlocked the back wheel, and a ride across town cost roughly 15 cents. Because of my middling score, however, I had to pay a $30 deposit before I could scan my first bike. Nor could I get deposit-free hotel stays or GoPro rentals, or free umbrella rentals. I belonged to the digital underclass.</p><p>In China, anxiety about <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">pianzi</emphasis>, or swindlers, runs deep. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">How do I know you're not a pianzi?</emphasis> is a question people often ask when salespeople call on the phone or repairmen show up at the door. While my score likely didn't put me in the ranks of pianzi, one promise of Zhima Credit was identifying those who were. Companies can buy risk assessments for users that detail whether they have paid their rent or utilities or appear on the court blacklist. For businesses, such products are billed as time-savers. On the site Tencent Video, I stumbled across an ad for Zhima Credit in which a businessman scrutinizes strangers as he rides the subway. \"Everybody looks like a pianzi,\" he despairs. His employees, trying to guard against shady customers, cover the office conference room walls with photos of lowlifes and criminals. But then-tada!-the boss discovers Zhima Credit, and all of their problems are solved. The staff celebrate by tearing the photos off the wall.</p><p>For those with good behavior, Zhima Credit offers perks through cooperation agreements that Ant Financial has signed with hundreds of companies and institutions. Shenzhou Zuche, a car rental company, allows people with credit scores over 650 to rent a car without a deposit. In exchange for this vetting, Shenzhou Zuche shares data, so that if a Zhima Credit user crashes one of the rental company's cars and refuses to pay up, that detail is fed back into his or her credit score. For a while people with scores over 750 could even skip the security check line at Beijing Capital Airport.</p><p>Two years after signing up for Zhima Credit, Lazarus Liu was trending up to that number. I met Liu, who is 27 and works at a large corporation, one Saturday afternoon at a mall in central Shanghai, outside a Forever 21. He wore a black shirt, black sneakers, and black Air Jordan shorts, and his face was framed by a fresh fade, with a jolt of black hair that flopped to one side. We walked to a Starbucks filled with young people hunched over their phones, sipping peach iced teas and green tea Frappuccinos. Liu claimed the last open table.</p><p>Liu told me that he chose his English name, Lazarus, after converting to Catholicism three years ago, but that his religion was mostly a private affair. He saw his Zhima Credit score the same way; it revealed something about him, but he kept those insights mostly to himself. He rarely checked his score-it just lurked in the background of the Alipay app on his Samsung-and because it was good, he didn't have to. After starting at 600 out of a possible 950 points, he had reached 722, a score that entitled him to favorable terms on loans and apartment rentals, as well as showcasing on several dating apps should he and his wife ever split up. With a few dozen more points, he could get a streamlined visa to Luxembourg, not that he was planning such a trip.</p><p>As Liu amassed a favorable transaction and payment history on Alipay, his score naturally improved. But it could go down if he neglected to pay a traffic fine, for example. And the privileges that come with a high score might someday be revoked for behaviors that have nothing to do with consumer etiquette. In June 2015, as 9.4 million Chinese teenagers took the grueling national college entrance examination, Hu Tao, the Zhima Credit general manager, told reporters that Ant Financial hoped to obtain a list of students who cheated, so that the fraud could become a blight on their Zhima Credit records. \"There should be consequences for dishonest behavior,\" she avowed. The good were moving without obstruction. A threat hung over the rest.</p><p>\"IF YOUR FRIENDS ARE ALL HIGH-SCORE PEOPLE, IT'S GOOD FOR YOU. IF YOU HAVE SOME BAD-CREDIT PEOPLE AS FRIENDS, IT'S NOT NICE.\"</p><p>Alipay knows that at 1 pm on the afternoon of August 26, I rented an Ofo brand bike outside Shanghai's former French Concession and rode north, parking it across from Jing'an Temple. It knows that at 1:24 pm I bought a snack in the mall next to the temple. It knows that afterward I got in a Didi car bound for a neighborhood to the northwest. It knows that at 3:11 pm I disembarked and entered a supermarket, and it knows (because Alibaba owns the supermarket, which accepts only Alipay at checkout) that at 3:36 pm I bought bananas, cheese, and crackers. It knows that I then got in a taxi, and that I arrived at my destination at 4:01 pm. It knows the identification number of the taxi that drove me there. It knows that at 4:19 pm I paid $8 for an Amazon delivery. For three sweet hours-one of which I spent in the swimming pool-it does not know my whereabouts. Then it knows that I rented another Ofo bike outside a hotel in central Shanghai, cycled 10 minutes, and at 7:11 pm parked it outside a popular restaurant. Because Ant Financial is a strategic investor in Ofo, Alipay might know the route I took.</p><p>The algorithm behind my Zhima Credit score is a corporate secret. Ant Financial officially lists five broad categories of information that feed into the score, but the company provides only the barest of details about how these ingredients are cooked together. Like any conventional credit scoring system, Zhima Credit monitors my spending history and whether I have repaid my loans. But elsewhere the algorithm veers into voodoo, or worse. A category called Connections considers the credit of my contacts in Alipay's social network. Characteristics takes into consideration what kind of car I drive, where I work, and where I went to school. A category called Behavior, meanwhile, scrutinizes the nuances of my consumer life, zeroing in on actions that purportedly correlate with good credit. Shortly after Zhima Credit's launch, the company's technology director, Li Yingyun, told the Chinese magazine <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Caixin</emphasis> that spending behavior like buying diapers, say, could boost one's score, while playing videogames for hours on end could lower it. Online speculation held that donating to charity, presumably through Alipay's built-in donation service, was good. But I'm not sure whether the $3 I gave for feeding brown bear cubs qualifies me as a philanthropist or a cheapskate.</p><p>I began to check my score obsessively, but because scores are only reevaluated monthly, the number didn't budge. Each time I opened the app, I encountered an alarming orange screen. In the foreground was a gauge in the shape of a half-circle, with a dial showing that I had reached only a quarter of my potential. An article on the portal Sohu.com explained that my score put me in the category of \"common folk.\" The page read: \"Cultural level is not high. Retired or nearly retired.\" In China, where many elderly lost out on years of education during the Cultural Revolution, this was not a compliment. According to Sohu, only 5 percent of the population had scores worse than mine.</p><p>To see if I could do anything to pull my score up, I took a taxi one morning to a chic open-air shopping center outside Shanghai's city center to meet with Chen Chen, a 30-year-old illustrator. Chen told a mutual friend on WeChat that she had an \"excellent\" rating on Zhima Credit, and I wanted to ask her counsel. We bought coffee and walked to an outdoor seating area. Chen wore a button-down shirt open over a white T-shirt and skinny jeans. Her hair was bleached to a straw yellow, and a line of sparkly eye shadow was swept under each eye. On Zhima Credit she clocked in at 710, and her background color was a calming sky blue.</p><p>She explained how to boost my score. \"They will check what kind of friends you have,\" she said. \"If your friends are all high-score people, it's good for you. If you have some bad-credit people as friends, it's not nice.\" After signing up for Alipay, I sent friend requests to all of my phone contacts. Only six people accepted. One of my new Alipay friends was a man I used to tutor in English and probably my wealthiest friend in Shanghai. He owned several businesses, a fleet of cars, and a spacious villa in a posh neighborhood. But another was my old tailor, who lived with her family in a single room in a dilapidated house, with piles of cloth obscuring the thin windows. Did the tailor's impact on my score cancel out the businessman's? And was I dragging both of them down?</p><p>Chen said she knew the scores of her close friends but not those of acquaintances or work colleagues. There are chat rooms where people with decent scores seek out other high scorers, presumably to boost their ratings. But in general, people simply make assumptions about which contacts have good credit and which are better left unfriended. Users like Chen hadn't yet taken the step of shutting low scorers like me out of their network, she assured me. Zhima Credit was still fairly new, and an acquaintance's low score might still be charitably explained, she said: \"Maybe they just haven't used it long enough.\"</p><p>To understand the allure that social engineering holds for Chinese leaders, you have to go back decades, to long before apps and big data. In the years after the 1949 Communist Revolution, the government assigned everyone to local work units, which became the locus of surveillance and control. Individuals spied on their neighbors while also doing everything they could to avoid black marks on their own <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">dang'an</emphasis>, or government files. But maintaining the system required massive state effort and oversight. As economic reforms in the 1980s led millions of people to leave their villages and migrate to cities, the work unit system fell apart. Migration also had a secondary effect: Cities filled up with strangers and pianzi.</p><p>It didn't take long for the central government to start thinking about gamifying good behavior. \"If we are going to have a market system that is supposed to be self-guiding, we also need to have self-guiding credit systems,\" says Rogier Creemers, a scholar of Chinese law at the Leiden Institute for Area Studies in the Netherlands. In the late 1990s, a working group at a Chinese Academy of Sciences institute developed the basic concepts behind the social credit systems. But the technology wasn't advanced enough to support the Communist Party's broader political designs.</p><p>Nearly a decade ago, I spent a few weeks in Suining, a mostly rural county in Jiangsu province, near Shanghai. Back then, local governance was not subtle. When officials decided to clamp down on people running red lights, they urged citizens to take pictures of offenders, whose images would later be featured on the local television channel.</p><p>Then, in 2010, Suining became one of the first areas in China to pilot a social credit system. Officials there began assessing residents on a range of criteria, including education level, online behavior, and how well they followed traffic laws. Each of Suining's 1.1 million citizens older than 14 started out with 1,000 points, and points were added or deducted based on behavior. Taking care of elderly family members earned you 50 points. Helping the poor merited 10 points. Helping the poor in a way that was reported by the media: 15. A drunk driving conviction meant the loss of 50 points, as did bribing an official. After the points were tallied up, citizens were assigned grades of A, B, C, or D. Grade A citizens would be given priority for school admissions and employment, while D citizens would be denied licenses, permits, and access to some social services.</p><p>The Suining system was rudimentary, and it briefly sparked a national debate over what criteria should be included in a social credit score. But it provided a testing ground for what could work nationally. And however crude the letter grades were, they were less crude than what they replaced. Social credit in Suining was accompanied by a shift to subtler government messaging.</p><p>Since the Suining pilot, dozens of cities have developed their own systems. The power of technology had caught up. Eventually, these systems will be integrated into the nationwide government social credit system, which entails a significant logistical headache. To aid in the task, the government has enlisted Baidu, a big tech company, to help develop the social credit database by the 2020 deadline.</p><p>The Chinese tech companies have, in their way, helped to shift the Party's attitude toward digital technologies. When the internet first came to China, bursting into people's lives in the form of blogs and chat rooms, the Party saw it as a threat. Here was a place where people might speak their minds, join together, dissent. Leaders responded to these impulses through censorship and other aggressive tactics. But companies like Ant Financial have shown just how useful digital technologies can be in gathering and deploying information. Instead of merely reacting to content by banning search terms or shutting down websites, the government now collaborates with the private sector on facial and voice recognition technologies, along with artificial intelligence research.</p><p>In 2015, a few months after Zhima Credit debuted, Alibaba founder Jack Ma and 14 other executives traveled to the US with President Xi Jinping for his first state visit. Ma, along with leaders at Tencent and Baidu, also sits on the board of the Internet Society of China, a quasi-governmental organization under the direction of the Party.</p><p>This strategic nexus is a delicate one, though. In recent months Chinese regulators have taken steps to exert more control over tech companies. Last August, the People's Bank of China ordered mobile and online payment companies to connect to a central government clearinghouse, giving regulators access to transaction data. Two months later, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Wall Street Journal</emphasis> reported that Chinese internet regulators were considering taking a 1 percent stake in the major tech companies.</p><p>One possible scenario for a social credit partnership is that the central bank will oversee the development of a broader metric, like a FICO score, while letting companies like Ant Financial collect data to feed into that score. Whatever its eventual structure, the larger social credit system \"will definitely be under the government's control,\" says You Xi, the reporter who wrote the book about Ant Financial. \"The government doesn't want this very important infrastructure of the people's credit in one big company's hands.\"</p><p>Chinese people who have been branded untrustworthy are getting the first glimpse of what a unified system might mean. One day last May, Liu Hu, a 42-year-old journalist, opened a travel app to book a flight. But when he entered his name and national ID number, the app informed him that the transaction wouldn't go through because he was on the Supreme People's Court blacklist. This list-literally, the List of Dishonest People-is the same one that is integrated into Zhima Credit. In 2015 Liu had been sued for defamation by the subject of a story he'd written, and a court had ordered him to pay $1,350. He paid the fine, and even photographed the bank transfer slip and messaged the photo to the judge in the case. Perplexed as to why he was still on the list, he contacted the judge and learned that, while transferring his fine, he had entered the wrong account number. He hurried to transfer the money again, following up to make sure the court had received it. This time the judge did not reply.</p><p>Although Liu hadn't signed up for Zhima Credit, the blacklist caught up with him in other ways. He became, effectively, a second-class citizen. He was banned from most forms of travel; he could only book the lowest classes of seat on the slowest trains. He could not buy certain consumer goods or stay at luxury hotels, and he was ineligible for large bank loans. Worse still, the blacklist was public. Liu had already spent a year in jail once before on charges of \"fabricating and spreading rumors\" after reporting on the shady dealings of a vice-mayor of Chongqing. The memory of imprisonment left him stoic about this new, more invisible punishment. At least he was still with his wife and daughter.</p><p>Still, Liu took to his blog to stir up sympathy and convince the judge to take him off the list. As of October he was still on it. \"There is almost no oversight of the court executors\" who maintain the blacklist, he told me. \"There are many mistakes in implementation that go uncorrected.\" If Liu had a Zhima Credit score, his troubles would have been compounded by other worries. The way Zhima Credit is designed, being blacklisted sends you on a rapid downward spiral. First your score drops. Then your friends hear you are on the blacklist and, fearful that their scores might be affected, quietly drop you as a contact. The algorithm notices, and your score plummets further.</p><p>THE DIAL SHOWED THAT I HAD REACHED ONLY A QUARTER OF MY POTENTIAL. MY SCORE PUT ME IN THE CATEGORY OF \"COMMON FOLK.\"</p><p>Soon after I returned to the us from my visit to China, Equifax, the US credit-reporting agency, announced that it had been hacked. The breach exposed the credit records of some 145 million people. Like many Americans, I got a quick and hard lesson. My credit card number had been stolen a few weeks earlier, but because I had been traveling overseas I hadn't bothered to freeze my credit. When I tried to do so after the hack, I found that an already difficult process had become nearly impossible. Equifax's site was only partly operational, and its phone lines were jammed. Desperate, I signed up for a credit-monitoring service called Credit Karma, which, in exchange for the very same information that I was trying to protect, showed me my score with two of the three major bureaus.</p><p>These numbers were communicated to me through a credit gauge similar to Zhima Credit's, down to the color coding of scores. I learned that my credit score had dipped by a few dozen points. There were four or five attempts to take out credit in my name that I didn't recognize.</p><p>Now I had two tracking systems scoring me, on opposite sides of the globe. But these were only the scores that I knew about. Most Americans have dozens of scores, many of them drawn from behavioral and demographic metrics similar to those used by Zhima Credit, and most of them held by companies that give us no chance to opt out. Others we enter into voluntarily. The US government can't legally compel me to participate in some massive data-driven social experiment, but I give up my data to private companies every day. I trust these corporations enough to participate in their vast scoring experiments. I post my thoughts and feelings on Facebook and leave long trails of purchases on Amazon and eBay. I rate others in Airbnb and Uber and care a little too much about how others rate me. There is not yet a great American super app, and the scores compiled by data brokers are mainly used to better target ads, not to exert social control. But through a process called identity resolution, data aggregators can use the clues I leave behind to merge my data from various sources.</p><p>Do you take antidepressants? Frequently return clothes to retailers? Write your name in all caps when filling out online forms? Data brokers collect all of this information and more. As in China, you may even be penalized for who your friends are. In 2012, Facebook patented a method of credit assessment that could consider the credit scores of people in your network. The patent describes a tool that arrives at an average credit score for your friends and rejects a loan application if that average is below a certain minimum. The company has since revised its platform policies to prohibit outside lenders from using Facebook data to determine credit eligibility. The company could still decide to get into the credit business itself, though. (\"We often seek patents for technology we never implement, and patents should not be taken as an indication of future plans,\" a Facebook spokesperson said in response to questions about the credit patent.) \"You could imagine a future where people are watching to see if their friends' credit is dropping and then dropping their friends if that affects them,\" says Frank Pasquale, a big-data expert at University of Maryland Carey School of Law. \"That's terrifying.\"</p><p>Often, data brokers are flat-out wrong. The data broker Acxiom, which provides some information about what it collects on a site called AboutTheData.com, has me pegged as a single woman with a high school education and a \"likely Las Vegas gambler,\" when in fact I'm married, have a master's degree, and have never even bought a lottery ticket. But it is impossible to challenge these assessments, since we're never told that they exist. I know more about Zhima Credit's algorithm than I do about how US data brokers rate me. This is, as Pasquale points out in his book <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Black Box Society</emphasis>, essentially a \"one-way mirror.\"</p><p>After I left China, I checked back in with Lazarus Liu on WeChat. He sent me a screenshot of his Zhima Credit score, which had increased by eight points since we met. His screen read \"Fantastic,\" and the font had shifted to soft italics.</p><p>We talked about a new facial recognition feature called Smile to Pay that Ant Financial had introduced at a concept restaurant in Hangzhou owned by KFC. The walls of the restaurant were adorned with gigantic white phones. To order, you simply tapped a picture of what you wanted and then showed the phone your face, typing in your cell phone number to confirm payment. First smartphones had eliminated the need for a wallet; now Smile to Pay eliminated the need for a phone. All you needed was your face.</p><p>Liu wasn't eager to try Smile to Pay. The \"government affairs\" page on Zhima Credit's website suggests that Ant Financial partners with local governments throughout China to use its facial recognition capabilities, but that wasn't what made Liu uneasy. While studying abroad, he had played around with Android's Face Unlock feature. His roommate, who shared his square jaw, had been able to unlock his phone a few times. \"I feel that it could be unsafe,\" he messaged me. \"I would want to see that it's the real thing.\" He wrote real thing in English, for emphasis.</p><p>While chatting with Liu, I, too, had opened up Zhima Credit. My score had increased by four points. \"You still have room to improve,\" the app informed me delicately. But next to my new score, 554, was a small green arrow. I was on my way up.</p><p>MOST AMERICANS HAVE DOZENS OF SCORES, AND MOST OF THEM ARE HELD BY COMPANIES THAT GIVE US NO CHANCE TO OPT OUT.</p><h>SECRET SCORES</h><p>In the US, your FICO credit score isn't the only number that follows you around.

Tech industry executives \u201cargued that they were capable of regulating themselves and that government intervention would be costly and counterproductive.\u201d Civil libertarians warned that the companies\u2019 data capabilities posed \u201can unprecedented threat to individual freedom.\u201d One observed, \u201cWe have to decide what human beings are in the electronic age. Are we just going to be chattel for commerce?\u201d A commissioner asked, \u2018\u2018Where should we draw the line?\u201d The year was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/11/us/ftc-opens-hearings-on-computers-threat-to-privacy-and-liberty.html?searchResultPosition=34\">1997</url>.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The line was never drawn, and the executives got their way. Twenty-three years later the evidence is in. The fruit of that victory was a new economic logic that I call \u201csurveillance capitalism.\u201d Its success depends upon one-way-mirror operations engineered for our ignorance and wrapped in a fog of misdirection, euphemism and mendacity. It rooted and flourished in the new spaces of the internet, once celebrated by surveillance capitalists as \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/11/us/ftc-opens-hearings-on-computers-threat-to-privacy-and-liberty.html?searchResultPosition=34\">the world\u2019s largest ungoverned space.</url>\u201d But power fills a void, and those once wild spaces are no longer ungoverned. Instead, they are owned and operated by private surveillance capital and governed by its iron laws.</p><p>The rise of surveillance capitalism over the last two decades went largely unchallenged. \u201cDigital\u201d was fast, we were told, and stragglers would be left behind. It\u2019s not surprising that so many of us rushed to follow the bustling White Rabbit down his tunnel into a promised digital Wonderland where, like Alice, we fell prey to delusion. In Wonderland, we celebrated the new digital services as free, but now we see that the surveillance capitalists behind those services regard us as the free commodity. We thought that we search Google, but now we understand that Google searches us. We assumed that we use social media to connect, but we learned that connection is how social media uses us. We barely questioned why our new TV or mattress had a privacy policy, but we\u2019ve begun to understand that \u201cprivacy\u201d policies are actually surveillance policies.</p><p>And like our forebears who named the automobile \u201chorseless carriage\u201d because they could not reckon with its true dimension, we regarded the internet platforms as \u201cbulletin boards\u201d where anyone could pin a note. Congress cemented this delusion in a statute, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/11/us/ftc-opens-hearings-on-computers-threat-to-privacy-and-liberty.html?searchResultPosition=34\">Section 230</url> of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, absolving those companies of the obligations that adhere to \u201cpublishers\u201d or even to \u201cspeakers.\u201d</p><p>Only repeated crises have taught us that these platforms are not bulletin boards but hyper-velocity global bloodstreams into which anyone may introduce a dangerous virus without a vaccine. This is how Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, could legally <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/11/us/ftc-opens-hearings-on-computers-threat-to-privacy-and-liberty.html?searchResultPosition=34\">refuse</url> to remove a faked video of Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and later       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/11/us/ftc-opens-hearings-on-computers-threat-to-privacy-and-liberty.html?searchResultPosition=34\">double down</url> on this decision, announcing that political advertising would not be subject to fact-checking.</p><p>All of these delusions rest on the most treacherous hallucination of them all: the belief that privacy is private. We have imagined that we can choose our degree of privacy with an individual calculation in which a bit of personal information is traded for valued services \u2014 a reasonable quid pro quo. For example, when Delta Air Lines piloted a biometric data system at the Atlanta airport, the company <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/11/us/ftc-opens-hearings-on-computers-threat-to-privacy-and-liberty.html?searchResultPosition=34\">reported</url> that of nearly 25,000 customers who traveled there each week, 98 percent opted into the process, noting that \u201cthe facial recognition option is saving an average of two seconds for each customer at boarding, or nine minutes when boarding a wide body aircraft.\u201d</p><p>In fact the rapid development of facial recognition systems reveals the public consequences of this supposedly private choice. Surveillance capitalists have demanded the right to take our faces wherever they appear \u2014 on a city street or a Facebook page. The Financial Times <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/11/us/ftc-opens-hearings-on-computers-threat-to-privacy-and-liberty.html?searchResultPosition=34\">reported</url> that a Microsoft facial recognition training database of 10 million images plucked from the internet without anyone\u2019s knowledge and supposedly limited to academic research was employed by companies like IBM and state agencies that included the United States and Chinese military. Among these were two Chinese suppliers of equipment to officials in Xinjiang, where members of the Uighur community live in open-air prisons under perpetual surveillance by facial recognition systems.</p><p>Privacy is not private, because the effectiveness of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/11/us/ftc-opens-hearings-on-computers-threat-to-privacy-and-liberty.html?searchResultPosition=34\">these</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/11/us/ftc-opens-hearings-on-computers-threat-to-privacy-and-liberty.html?searchResultPosition=34\">other</url> private or public surveillance and control systems depends upon the pieces of ourselves that we give up \u2014 or that are secretly stolen from us.</p><p>Our digital century was to have been democracy\u2019s Golden Age. Instead, we enter its third decade marked by a stark new form of social inequality best understood as \u201cepistemic inequality.\u201d It recalls a pre-Gutenberg era of extreme asymmetries of knowledge and the power that accrues to such knowledge, as the tech giants seize control of information and learning itself. The delusion of \u201cprivacy as private\u201d was crafted to breed and feed this unanticipated social divide. Surveillance capitalists exploit the widening inequity of knowledge for the sake of profits. They manipulate the economy, our society and even our lives with impunity, endangering not just individual privacy but democracy itself. Distracted by our delusions, we failed to notice this bloodless coup from above.</p><p>The belief that privacy is private has left us careening toward a future that we did not choose, because it failed to reckon with the profound distinction between a society that insists upon sovereign individual rights and one that lives by the social relations of the one-way mirror. The lesson is that privacy is public \u2014 it is a collective good that is logically and morally inseparable from the values of human autonomy and self-determination upon which privacy depends and without which a democratic society is unimaginable.</p><p>Still, the winds appear to have finally shifted. A fragile new awareness is dawning as we claw our way back up the rabbit hole toward home. Surveillance capitalists are fast because they seek neither genuine consent nor consensus. They rely on psychic numbing and messages of inevitability to conjure the helplessness, resignation and confusion that paralyze their prey. Democracy is slow, and that\u2019s a good thing. Its pace reflects the tens of millions of conversations that occur in families, among neighbors, co-workers and friends, within communities, cities and states, gradually stirring the sleeping giant of democracy to action.</p><p>These conversations are occurring now, and there are many indications that lawmakers are ready to join and to lead. This third decade is likely to decide our fate. Will we make the digital future better, or will it make us worse? Will it be a place that we can call home?</p><p>Epistemic inequality is not based on what we can earn but rather on what we can learn. It is defined as unequal access to learning imposed by private commercial mechanisms of information capture, production, analysis and sales. It is best exemplified in the fast-growing abyss between what we know and what is known about us.</p><p>Twentieth-century industrial society was organized around the \u201cdivision of labor,\u201d and it followed that the struggle for economic equality would shape the politics of that time. Our digital century shifts society\u2019s coordinates from a division of labor to a \u201cdivision of learning,\u201d and it follows that the struggle over access to knowledge and the power conferred by such knowledge will shape the politics of our time.</p><p>The new centrality of epistemic inequality signals a power shift from the ownership of the means of production, which defined the politics of the 20th century, to the ownership of the production of meaning. The challenges of epistemic justice and epistemic rights in this new era are summarized in three essential questions about knowledge, authority and power: Who knows? Who decides who knows? Who decides who decides who knows?</p><p>During the last two decades, the leading surveillance capitalists \u2014 Google, later followed by Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft \u2014 helped to drive this societal transformation while simultaneously ensuring their ascendance to the pinnacle of the epistemic hierarchy. They operated in the shadows to amass huge knowledge monopolies by taking without asking, a maneuver that every child recognizes as theft. Surveillance capitalism begins by unilaterally staking a claim to private human experience as free raw material for translation into behavioral data. Our lives are rendered as data flows.</p><p>Early on, it was discovered that, unknown to users, even data freely given harbors rich predictive signals, a surplus that is more than what is required for service improvement. It isn\u2019t only what you post online, but whether you use exclamation points or the color saturation of your photos; not just where you walk but the stoop of your shoulders; not just the identity of your face but the emotional states conveyed by your \u201cmicroexpressions\u201d; not just what you like but the pattern of likes across engagements. Soon this behavioral surplus was secretly hunted and captured, claimed as proprietary data.</p><p>The data are conveyed through complex supply chains of devices, tracking and monitoring software, and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/11/us/ftc-opens-hearings-on-computers-threat-to-privacy-and-liberty.html?searchResultPosition=34\">ecosystems of apps</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/11/us/ftc-opens-hearings-on-computers-threat-to-privacy-and-liberty.html?searchResultPosition=34\">companies</url> that specialize in niche data flows captured in secret. For example,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/11/us/ftc-opens-hearings-on-computers-threat-to-privacy-and-liberty.html?searchResultPosition=34\">testing by The Wall Street Journal showed</url> that Facebook receives heart rate data from the Instant Heart Rate: HR Monitor, menstrual cycle data from the Flo Period &amp;amp; Ovulation Tracker, and data that reveal interest in real estate properties from Realtor.com \u2014 all of it without the user\u2019s knowledge.</p><p>These data flows empty into surveillance capitalists\u2019 computational factories, called \u201cartificial intelligence,\u201d where they are manufactured into behavioral predictions that are about us, but they are not for us. Instead, they are sold to business customers in a new kind of market that trades exclusively in human futures. Certainty in human affairs is the lifeblood of these markets, where surveillance capitalists compete on the quality of their predictions.

Between 2000, when the new economic logic was just emerging, and 2004, when the company went public, revenues increased by 3,590 percent. This startling number represents the \u201csurveillance dividend.\u201d It quickly reset the bar for investors, eventually driving start-ups, apps developers and established companies to shift their business models toward surveillance capitalism. The promise of a fast track to outsized revenues from selling human futures drove this migration first to Facebook, then through the tech sector and now throughout the rest of the economy to industries as disparate as insurance, retail, finance, education, health care, real estate, entertainment and every product that begins with the word \u201csmart\u201d or service touted as \u201cpersonalized.\u201d</p><p>Even Ford, the birthplace of the 20th-century mass production economy, is on the trail of the surveillance dividend, proposing to meet the challenge of slumping car sales by reimagining Ford vehicles as a \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/11/us/ftc-opens-hearings-on-computers-threat-to-privacy-and-liberty.html?searchResultPosition=34\">transportation operating system</url>.\u201d       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/11/us/ftc-opens-hearings-on-computers-threat-to-privacy-and-liberty.html?searchResultPosition=34\">As one analyst put it,</url>Ford \u201ccould make a fortune monetizing data.

Early on it was clear that machine intelligence must feed on volumes of data, compelling economies of scale in data extraction. Eventually it was understood that volume is necessary but not sufficient. The best algorithms also require varieties of data \u2014 economies of scope.

Data scientists describe this as the shift from monitoring to actuation, in which a critical mass of knowledge about a machine system enables the remote control of that system. Now people have become targets for remote control, as surveillance capitalists discovered that the most predictive data come from intervening in behavior to tune, herd and modify action in the direction of commercial objectives. This third imperative, \u201ceconomies of action,\u201d has become an arena of intense experimentation. \u201cWe are learning how to write the music,\u201d one scientist said, \u201cand then we let the music make them dance.\u201d</p><p>This new power \u201cto make them dance\u201d does not employ soldiers to threaten terror and murder. It arrives carrying a cappuccino, not a gun. It is a new \u201cinstrumentarian\u201d power that works its will through the medium of ubiquitous digital instrumentation to manipulate subliminal cues, psychologically target communications, impose default choice architectures, trigger social comparison dynamics and levy rewards and punishments \u2014 all of it aimed at remotely tuning, herding and modifying human behavior in the direction of profitable outcomes and always engineered to preserve users\u2019 ignorance.</p><p>We saw predictive knowledge morphing into instrumentarian power in Facebook\u2019s contagion experiments <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/11/us/ftc-opens-hearings-on-computers-threat-to-privacy-and-liberty.html?searchResultPosition=34\">published in 2012</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/11/us/ftc-opens-hearings-on-computers-threat-to-privacy-and-liberty.html?searchResultPosition=34\">2014</url>, when it planted subliminal cues and manipulated social comparisons on its pages, first to influence users to vote in midterm elections and later to make people feel sadder or happier. Facebook researchers celebrated the success of these experiments noting two key findings: that it was possible to manipulate online cues to influence real world behavior and feelings, and that this could be accomplished while successfully bypassing users\u2019 awareness.</p><p>In 2016, the Google-incubated augmented reality game, Pok\u00e9mon Go, tested economies of action on the streets. Game players did not know that they were pawns in the real game of behavior modification for profit, as the rewards and punishments of hunting imaginary creatures were used to herd people to the McDonald\u2019s, Starbucks and local pizza joints that were <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/11/us/ftc-opens-hearings-on-computers-threat-to-privacy-and-liberty.html?searchResultPosition=34\">paying the company for \u201cfootfall,</url>\u201d in exactly the same way that online advertisers pay for \u201cclick through\u201d to their websites.</p><p>In 2017, a leaked Facebook<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/11/us/ftc-opens-hearings-on-computers-threat-to-privacy-and-liberty.html?searchResultPosition=34\">document</url> acquired by The Australian exposed the corporation\u2019s interest in applying \u201cpsychological insights\u201d from \u201cinternal Facebook data\u201d to modify user behavior.

They know. They decide who knows. They decide who decides.</p><p>The public\u2019s intolerable knowledge disadvantage is deepened by surveillance capitalists\u2019 perfection of mass communications as gaslighting. Two examples are illustrative. On April 30, 2019 Mark Zuckerberg made a dramatic <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/11/us/ftc-opens-hearings-on-computers-threat-to-privacy-and-liberty.html?searchResultPosition=34\">announcement</url> at the company\u2019s annual developer conference, declaring, \u201cThe future is private.\u201d A few weeks later, a Facebook litigator       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/11/us/ftc-opens-hearings-on-computers-threat-to-privacy-and-liberty.html?searchResultPosition=34\">appeared</url> before a federal district judge in California to thwart a user lawsuit over privacy invasion, arguing that the very act of using Facebook negates any reasonable expectation of privacy \u201cas a matter of law.\u201d In May 2019 Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Google, wrote in The Times of his corporations\u2019s commitment to the principle that \u201c      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/11/us/ftc-opens-hearings-on-computers-threat-to-privacy-and-liberty.html?searchResultPosition=34\">privacy cannot be a luxury good</url>.\u201d Five months later       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/11/us/ftc-opens-hearings-on-computers-threat-to-privacy-and-liberty.html?searchResultPosition=34\">Google contractors were found offering $5 gift cards</url> to homeless people of color in an Atlanta park in return for a facial scan.</p><p>Facebook\u2019s denial invites even more scrutiny in light of another <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/11/us/ftc-opens-hearings-on-computers-threat-to-privacy-and-liberty.html?searchResultPosition=34\">leaked company document appearing in 2018</url>. The confidential report offers rare insight into the heart of Facebook\u2019s computational factory, where a \u201cprediction engine\u201d runs on a machine intelligence platform that \u201cingests trillions of data points every day, trains thousands of models\u201d and then \u201cdeploys them to the server fleet for live predictions.\u201d Facebook notes that its \u201cprediction service\u201d produces \u201cmore than 6 million predictions per second.\u201d But to what purpose?</p><p>In its report, the company makes clear that these extraordinary capabilities are dedicated to meeting its corporate customers\u2019 \u201ccore business challenges\u201d with procedures that link prediction, microtargeting, intervention and behavior modification. For example, a Facebook service called \u201cloyalty prediction\u201d is touted for its ability to plumb proprietary behavioral surplus to predict individuals who are \u201cat risk\u201d of shifting their brand allegiance and alerting advertisers to intervene promptly with targeted messages designed to stabilize loyalty just in time to alter the course of the future.</p><p>That year a young man named Christopher Wylie turned whistle-blower on his former employer, a political consultancy known as Cambridge Analytica. \u201cWe exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people\u2019s profiles,\u201d <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/11/us/ftc-opens-hearings-on-computers-threat-to-privacy-and-liberty.html?searchResultPosition=34\">Wylie admitted</url>, \u201cand built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons.\u201d Mr. Wylie characterized those techniques as \u201c      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/11/us/ftc-opens-hearings-on-computers-threat-to-privacy-and-liberty.html?searchResultPosition=34\">information warfare</url>,\u201d correctly assessing that such shadow wars are built on asymmetries of knowledge and the power it affords. Less clear to the public or lawmakers was that the political firm\u2019s strategies of secret invasion and conquest employed surveillance capitalism\u2019s standard operating procedures to which billions of innocent \u201cusers\u201d are routinely subjected each day. Mr. Wylie       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/11/us/ftc-opens-hearings-on-computers-threat-to-privacy-and-liberty.html?searchResultPosition=34\">described</url> this mirroring process, as he followed a trail that was already cut and marked. Cambridge Analytica\u2019s real innovation was to pivot the whole undertaking from commercial to political objectives.</p><p>In other words, Cambridge Analytica was the parasite, and surveillance capitalism was the host. Thanks to its epistemic dominance, surveillance capitalism provided the behavioral data that exposed the targets for assault. Its methods of behavioral microtargeting and behavioral modification became the weapons. And it was surveillance capitalism\u2019s lack of accountability for content on its platform afforded by Section 230 that provided the opportunity for the stealth attacks designed to trigger the inner demons of unsuspecting citizens.</p><p>It\u2019s not just that epistemic inequality leaves us utterly vulnerable to the attacks of actors like Cambridge Analytica. The larger and more disturbing point is that surveillance capitalism has turned epistemic inequality into a defining condition of our societies, normalizing information warfare as a chronic feature of our daily reality prosecuted by the very corporations upon which we depend for effective social participation. They have the knowledge, the machines, the science and the scientists, the secrets and the lies. All privacy now rests with them, leaving us with few means of defense from these marauding data invaders. Without law, we scramble to hide in our own lives, while our children debate encryption strategies around the dinner table and students wear masks to public protests as protection from facial recognition systems built with our family photos.</p><p>In the absence of new declarations of epistemic rights and legislation, surveillance capitalism threatens to remake society as it unmakes democracy. From below, it undermines human agency, usurping privacy, diminishing autonomy and depriving individuals of the right to combat. From above, epistemic inequality and injustice are fundamentally incompatible with the aspirations of a democratic people.</p><p>We know that surveillance capitalists work in the shadows, but what they do there and the knowledge they accrue are unknown to us. They have the means to know everything about us, but we can know little about them. Their knowledge of us is not for us. Instead, our futures are sold for others\u2019 profits. Since that Federal Trade Commission meeting in 1997, the line was never drawn, and people did become chattel for commerce. Another destructive delusion is that this outcome was inevitable \u2014 an unavoidable consequence of convenience-enhancing digital technologies. The truth is that surveillance capitalism hijacked the digital medium. There was nothing inevitable about it.</p><p>American lawmakers have been reluctant to take on these challenges for many reasons. One is an unwritten policy of \u201csurveillance exceptionalism\u201d forged in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, when the government\u2019s concerns shifted from online privacy protections to a new zeal for \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/11/us/ftc-opens-hearings-on-computers-threat-to-privacy-and-liberty.html?searchResultPosition=34\">total information awareness</url>.\u201d In that political environment the fledgling surveillance capabilities emerging from Silicon Valley appeared to hold great promise.</p><p>Surveillance capitalists have also defended themselves with lobbying and forms of propaganda intended to undermine and intimidate lawmakers, confounding judgment and freezing action. These have received relatively little scrutiny compared to the damage they do. Consider two examples:</p><p>The first is the assertion that democracy threatens prosperity and innovation. Former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/11/us/ftc-opens-hearings-on-computers-threat-to-privacy-and-liberty.html?searchResultPosition=34\">explained</url> in 2011, \u201cwe took the position of \u2018hands off the internet.\u2019 You know, leave us alone \u2026 The government can make regulatory mistakes that can slow this whole thing down, and we see that and we worry about it.\u201d This propaganda is recycled from the Gilded Age barons, whom we now call \u201crobbers.\u201d They insisted that there was no need for law when one had the \u201claw of survival of the fittest,\u201d the \u201claws of capital\u201d and the \u201claw of supply and demand.\u201d</p><p>Paradoxically, surveillance capital does not appear to drive innovation. A promising new era of economic research <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/11/us/ftc-opens-hearings-on-computers-threat-to-privacy-and-liberty.html?searchResultPosition=34\">shows</url> the critical role that government and democratic governance have played in innovation and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/11/us/ftc-opens-hearings-on-computers-threat-to-privacy-and-liberty.html?searchResultPosition=34\">suggests</url> a lack of innovation in big tech companies like Google. Surveillance capitalism\u2019s information dominance is not dedicated to the urgent challenges of carbon-free energy, eliminating hunger, curing cancers, ridding the oceans of plastic or flooding the world with well paid, smart, loving teachers and doctors. Instead, we see a frontier operation run by geniuses with vast capital and computational power that is furiously dedicated to the lucrative science and economics of human prediction for profit.</p><p>The second form of propaganda is the argument that the success of the leading surveillance capitalist firms reflects the real value they bring to people. But data from the demand side suggest that surveillance capitalism is better understood as a market failure. Instead of a close alignment of supply and demand, people use these services because they have no comparable alternatives and because they are ignorant of surveillance capitalism\u2019s shadow operations and their consequences. Pew Research Center recently <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/11/us/ftc-opens-hearings-on-computers-threat-to-privacy-and-liberty.html?searchResultPosition=34\">reported</url> that 81 percent of Americans believe the potential risks of companies\u2019 data collection outweigh the benefits, suggesting that corporate success depends upon coercion and obfuscation rather than meeting people\u2019s real needs.</p><p>In his prizewinning history of regulation, the historian Thomas McCraw delivers a warning. Across the centuries regulators failed when they did not frame \u201cstrategies appropriate to the particular industries they were regulating.\u201d Existing privacy and antitrust laws are vital but neither will be wholly adequate to the new challenges of reversing epistemic inequality.</p><p>These contests of the 21st century demand a framework of epistemic rights enshrined in law and subject to democratic governance. Such rights would interrupt data supply chains by safeguarding the boundaries of human experience before they come under assault from the forces of datafication. The choice to turn any aspect of one\u2019s life into data must belong to individuals by virtue of their rights in a democratic society. This means, for example, that companies cannot claim the right to your face, or use your face as free raw material for analysis, or own and sell any computational products that derive from your face. The conversation on epistemic rights has already begun, reflected in a pathbreaking <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/11/us/ftc-opens-hearings-on-computers-threat-to-privacy-and-liberty.html?searchResultPosition=34\">report</url> from Amnesty International.</p><p>On the demand side, we can outlaw human futures markets and thus eliminate the financial incentives that sustain the surveillance dividend. This is not a radical prospect. For example, societies outlaw markets that trade in human organs, babies and slaves. In each case, we recognize that such markets are both morally repugnant and produce predictably violent consequences. Human futures markets can be shown to produce equally predictable outcomes that challenge human freedom and undermine democracy. Like subprime mortgages and fossil fuel investments, surveillance assets will become the new toxic assets.</p><p>In support of a new competitive landscape, lawmakers will need to champion new forms of collective action, just as nearly a century ago legal protections for the rights to organize, to strike and to bargain collectively united lawmakers and workers in curbing the powers of monopoly capitalists. Lawmakers must seek alliances with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/11/us/ftc-opens-hearings-on-computers-threat-to-privacy-and-liberty.html?searchResultPosition=34\">citizens who are deeply concerned</url> over the unchecked power of the surveillance capitalists and with workers who seek fair wages and reasonable security in defiance of the precarious employment conditions that define the surveillance economy.</p><p>Anything made by humans can be unmade by humans. Surveillance capitalism is young, barely 20 years in the making, but democracy is old, rooted in generations of hope and contest.</p><p>Surveillance capitalists are rich and powerful, but they are not invulnerable. They have an Achilles heel: fear. They fear lawmakers who do not fear them. They fear citizens who demand a new road forward as they insist on new answers to old questions: Who will know? Who will decide who knows? Who will decide who decides? Who will write the music, and who will dance?</p><p>Shoshana Zuboff (@ShoshanaZuboff) is professor emerita at Harvard Business School and the author of \u201cThe Age of Surveillance Capitalism.\u201d</p><p>The Times is committed to publishing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/11/us/ftc-opens-hearings-on-computers-threat-to-privacy-and-liberty.html?searchResultPosition=34\">a diversity of letters</url> to the editor.
