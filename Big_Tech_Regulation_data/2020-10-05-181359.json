From business to the social sector to farming to environmentalists, there's been an outpouring of Big Ideas about how we could embrace that goal. The Government has a $20 billion fund to spend on the post-Covid rebuild but will it take on any big new ideas? When the whole world shut down this year, the projected annual fall in greenhouse gas emissions turned out to be only 5.5 per cent. But if we want to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees, it has to be at least 7.3 per cent, every year from now until 2030. The time is now. Here are three of those big ideas. All they need is Government support, imagination and courage, writes Simon Wilson</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Farmers stop ploughing, so carbon stays in the ground. They stop irrigating, so the plants send down deeper roots. Instead of fertiliser and pesticides, they grow a wide range of nitrogen-fixing cover crops, many of them leafy legumes. Paddocks are never grazed out, so the plants still growing regenerate quickly and what gets trodden in enriches the soil.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Does it help? Evidence overseas and locally suggests that production may drop, but not nearly as much as costs. Farm profits rise, often within two or three years. On some farms, production actually rises. There's less nitrate run-off. Much more biodiversity. Nutrient-rich food. Valuable carbon sequestration. A cleaner and healthier environment.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And more resilience against drought: with every 1 per cent increase in organic matter in the soil, a paddock can retain about 150,000 litres more water per hectare.  </p><p>The animals are healthier too, and so are the humans who tend them, because of the pleasure to be found in this kind of farming. It's good for mental health.  </p><p>Welcome to regenerative agriculture, or regen ag: think of it as \"farming in a way that mimics nature\".  </p><p>Regen ag is already happening - though still on a small scale - all over this country, in all kinds of agricultural land use. It has its detractors and a small but growing army of enthusiasts.  </p><p>It's all about the soil. As American \"grazing coach\" Siobhan Griffin, who now farms in Southland, says: \"I define regenerative farming as building topsoil. Simple as that.\"  </p><p>Conventional farming leaches goodness from the soil, so it's replaced by fertiliser. Over time, as the soil gets more distressed, it becomes ever more dependent on the fertiliser. The land is the casualty of the process. Regen ag reverses that. Help the soil be healthy, and it will provide.  </p><p>Not everyone agrees. The sceptics include two plant scientists associated with Lincoln University, Professor Derrick Moot and retired senior lecturer Warwick Scott, who have written to Agriculture Minister Damien O'Connor to warn of the \"mythology\" of regen ag. They say New Zealand agriculture is already world-leading and uses some of the techniques of regen ag anyway.  </p><p>\"We recognise that there are practices and practitioners in conventional agriculture that can be improved but consider these are minor compared with most international production systems.\"  </p><p>They say they \"strongly reject\" the idea that \"conventional agriculture, as practised in New Zealand, is degenerative\".REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE overlaps with organic farming and other holistic approaches to land management, but it's not prescriptive in the same way. Organic farming requires an exacting and expensive process of certification. Regen ag is an approach: farmers do what works for their land and their stock.  </p><p>That makes it easier to implement but harder to define, a problem also criticised by Moot and Scott.  </p><p>The support infrastructure is expanding. Consultants hold fieldays, standing in lush fields of leafy, flowering plants. There are tutorials online. Pure Advantage, a group of progressive businesses, is actively promoting the idea with research and webinars. A company called Calm the Farm offers sophisticated data analysis to create farm-management plans and match farmers with potential investors.  </p><p>Regen ag has implications for trade, as global consumers ramp up their demand for \"green\" and \"ethical\" foods. One clear indicator of that: by 2025, the giant French dairy company Danone - a major rival to Fonterra - says 100 per cent of its ingredients produced in France will come from regenerative farming.  </p><p>Imagine how things could change when there's a phone app that tells you the nutrient density of the fruit and vegetables in the supermarket.  </p><p>Fonterra has not made a Danone-style commitment. New Zealand farming, in general, is not keeping up. In July last year, 11 leading sector groups published a document called He Waka Eke Noa: Our Future in Our Hands. It's the \"primary sector climate change commitment\" and it doesn't contain a single mention of regenerative agriculture. There's nothing on the Federated Farmers' website either.  </p><p>Since that report, though, the Primary Sector Council, representing those same groups, has made some progress with a Fit for a Better World initiative. Beef + Lamb NZ, a member of the council, is doing a global study into regen ag, hoping to identify its potential here.THE GOVERNMENT is also moving, although not at pace. Manaaki Whenua (Landcare Research), Lincoln and Pamu (Landcorp) all have research projects under way.  </p><p>O'Connor told the Otago Daily Times recently that farmers have always been free to choose their own practices and \"curiosity is one of the drivers of innovation\".  </p><p>He noted that much of the information about regen ag comes from overseas. \"There is a real opportunity for our science and research community to work with farmers to build a robust, evidence-based understanding of the benefits of regenerative agriculture practices in a New Zealand context.\"  </p><p>Well, yes. But the Government also has to take the lead. Regen ag proponents report getting the banks to listen. And farming has some powerful and very wary vested interests, including the fertiliser companies and big corporate farms with massive investments in new irrigation.  </p><p>The Budget in May allocated just $34 million to the wider field of agricultural emissions research. More is needed. Greenpeace has proposed a $1 billion transition fund - that could easily come from the Government's $20b rebuild fund.  </p><p>Beyond the money, though, the key to progress is not to change agriculture one farmer at a time. It takes whole communities. Fed Farmers and others could play an exciting role in this.  </p><p>There's already strong evidence regenerative agriculture is a viable option for New Zealand. We need to know because if it is, it's hard to think of an initiative more in tune with the task of building greater prosperity in a better world. A model for how to integrate economic, environmental and social goals, with greater resilience for the uncertain times ahead. And, as a terrific bonus, with the potential to narrow the town and country cultural divide.  </p><p>Jono Frew, regen ag farm consultant: \"It's more profitable, more resilient and you have a whole lot more fun in doing this.\" Also, that billion-dollar fund would help.  </p><p>Value to NZ: Probably immense.  </p><p>Likelihood of major progress in next five years: Low.  </p><p>Microsoft is coming. Avatar is already here. How do we make the most of this?  </p><p>Tech companies, along with companies that take a high-tech approach to their work, have been interested in New Zealand for a long time. Often, at our expense. They don't pay enough tax, they demand financial incentives and special employment laws, they strip resources from local industry. But does it have to be like that?  </p><p>We're New Zealand. That means something different now. We're the country that beat the virus. Most of our energy comes from renewables. Most of our workforce is well educated and readily trainable. And did you hear? We Beat The Virus.  </p><p>Who wouldn't want to do business from here?  </p><p>Corporate interest in being based in New Zealand is only going to grow. So maybe it's time to set some new rules. Hire local and use local suppliers. Invest locally. Obviously, we'll need an equitable tax regime.  </p><p>If we can set good new rules for tech-related companies, the rewards could be immense. Health, agriculture, screen industries, education, the media and more, all stand to benefit from a supercharged tech sector. Importantly, every small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) in the country does too.  </p><p>Microsoft will build a new data centre in Auckland: that's Cloud-based computing services, based here. Kris Faafoi, the Minister for Government Digital Services, says this means \"the Government, and New Zealand businesses and people, will be able to access the scale and security of Cloud services offered by a major global provider in ways we haven't been able to before\".ARE WE going to make the most of this? The dream is for every retailer, every tradie, every manufacturer and service provider, every authorised person working for any of them, to have immediate access to the data they need.  </p><p>It might be supply chain activity in real-time, financial records and calculations, work schedules, risk analysis, customer profiles, you name it. All without SMEs having to buy and run expensive servers and the security systems to look after them.  </p><p>Business commentator Rod Oram calls the productivity benefits that would follow \"the number one global business lesson from the Covid crisis so far\".  </p><p>Craig Hudson, chief executive at Xero, agrees. He's pointed out that New Zealand's GDP per capita is about 30 per cent below the average of the top half of the OECD, and it's been stuck like that for 25 years. Cloud-based computing services for SMEs, he says, offer the best chance we have to increase productivity and will be essential to rebuilding the economy.  </p><p>Xero commissioned a report on cloud-based computing from NZIER, just before the pandemic hit us. In its modelling, a 20 per cent increased take-up raised GDP by 1.2 to 2.1 per cent, with household spending up by $2.6 to $4.6b a year, business output by $4.1 to $7.3b, real wages by $1.8 to $1.9b and exports up too.  </p><p>There are issues to resolve: Hudson lists skills gaps, concerns over privacy, internet infrastructure and cost. But they're resolvable. Singapore's on to it, with a Digital Economy Framework that includes services and grants paid directly to SMEs.  </p><p>Now that Microsoft is coming, what about the other big tech companies?  </p><p>We'd want them on our terms, of course, and those terms can go a lot further than tax and local contracts. Microsoft will need power for its servers and, as Faafoi has noted, the company has carbon-neutral commitments that fit very well with what he calls our \"reliable, almost entirely renewable power supply\".  </p><p>In fact, it's not almost entirely renewable: 15 per cent of electricity is not generated from renewables, and progress with wind and solar remains slow even as demand for electricity instead of fossil fuels is rising. We're going to need a lot more renewable energy very soon (see transport, below).HOW DO we jump-start that? Sir Stephen Tindall says the answer is to invite corporates to set up the Southern Hemisphere's leading tech centre, for communications, service industries and manufacturing. As part of the deal, we get them to help build a new generation of geothermal, hydro, wind and solar energy capacity to power their massive server farms. Hundreds of millions of dollars of new infrastructure and thousands of jobs.  </p><p>\"I've been looking at this through two overlapping lenses: investing in the infrastructure that will catapult us into 21st-century ways of working and see us thrive at the same time; and decarbonising the economy to help us meet our commitments under the Paris Agreement.\"  </p><p>Valuable in its own terms, he says, and also to \"position our country as the leading provider of green data centres to the Asia-Pacific region, much like Scandinavia has done for Europe\".  </p><p>It's our competitive advantage, because the competitors, in Australia and Asia, tend to rely on dirty old coal.  </p><p>Michael Lee, an associate professor at the University of Auckland Business School, has applied a similar idea to the screen industry. He wants us to invite large screen companies here and encourage them to create a massive research fund. Matched dollar for dollar by the Government, it would enable New Zealand \"to lead the world in tidal energy and aquatic-based biofuels, as well as information and digital technology\".  </p><p>There's another element to be fitted in. If we do this, how about we ask them to pay a levy to support the local film industry? We've got a local culture to nourish while we do all this.  </p><p>Is this a real prospect for New Zealand? Climate Change Minister James Shaw wants New Zealand to sign up to a Sustainable Recovery Alliance. You'd think we should be leading it, really.  </p><p>But no. There was very little in the May Budget earmarked for climate change. As for doing business in the Cloud, only $10m was allocated to e-commerce and another $12.5m for transtasman e-invoicing.  </p><p>Meanwhile, Germany and France have proposed a (EURO)500b fund for Europe, with an explicit focus on digital and green options. Germany has dedicated 40 per cent of its own fund to that purpose.  </p><p>\"We need to think bigger,\" says Xero's Hudson. Perhaps we will. With this one, if we get the regulations right, it's hard to think why any major vested interests would stand in the way.  </p><p>Value to NZ: High.  </p><p>Likelihood of major progress in next five years: Medium.  </p><p>Ports of Auckland has bought the world's first full-size e-tugboat. They're asking for help naming it, and yes, they've probably already heard about Boaty McBoatface.  </p><p>Some waste disposal companies use electric trucks; some freight companies also use e-trucks, especially for short-haul work. But despite our renewable energy advantage, New Zealand has not yet seriously embraced e-transport. A proposal to have electric ferries in action in time for the America's Cup, as a showcase, has gone nowhere.  </p><p>Fraser Whineray, formerly at Mercury Energy and now Fonterra's chief operating officer, says this has to change. He calls transport electrification our \"biggest green growth opportunity\". Fonterra uses e-trucks for some of its short-haul work.  </p><p>New Zealand is nowhere near being able to meet its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions targets, including a 30 per cent reduction on 2005 levels by 2030. At the current rate, not counting the pandemic period, we could be producing 15 million tonnes more emissions per year than we should.  </p><p>We're heading in the wrong direction. Mainly in our cars and trucks. Transport, with 20 per cent of all our emissions, is the biggest GHG problem confronting our cities.  </p><p>Electrification is a wide field: personal EVs (electric vehicles), mass transit (light rail and buses), heavy rail for freight and commuters, e-trucks, e-bikes and e-scooters. Those electric tugs, ferries and other boats; and aeroplanes too, for domestic routes at least.  </p><p>Naturally, all of them have to be powered by renewable energy, from diverse sources.  </p><p>There's been some official progress. January's $6.8b infrastructure announcement included electrification of the remaining 19km of Auckland's rail network, from Papakura to Pukekohe. A third track on part of the Southern Line will make the network more efficient for freight and commuters, and there will be two new stations in fast-growing Drury.  </p><p>But that's about it. Strangely, there was nothing for Paerata Rise, down the line from Drury, where 4500 homes will be built. That's more than in any other new residential development in Auckland.  </p><p>As local board chairman Andy Baker has asked, how is it acceptable to build big new subdivisions in greenfields Auckland, very near the rail line, and not put in a stop?  </p><p>Worse, the bulk of the January announcement, $5.3b, went to new roads that undermine the very idea of a carbon-reduction strategy. It was a colossal walk-back on the Government's previously stated intentions.  </p><p>Rail received another $1.2b in the May Budget, but $400m of that was for new Interislander ferries, with no mention of whether they'd be electric or perhaps hydrogen-powered.  </p><p>Rail improvements are under way in Northland, Waikato and the Bay of Plenty, but little of it is tied to electrification.  </p><p>It's not the front-and-centre goal.BACK ON the roads, the record is dreary. No end date for importing vehicles that burn fossil fuels, despite the Productivity Commission saying all new vehicles should be electric by 2030.  </p><p>No \"feebate\" to levy high-emitting vehicles and subsidise the purchase of low emitters. That scheme was abandoned in February, with both National and NZ First gleefully claiming the credit.  </p><p>High-emitting double-cab utes, the most popular class of new vehicle in the country, are exempt from fringe benefits tax. That's right, we're encouraged to buy them. Electric vehicles are not exempt.  </p><p>The Government does exempt EVs from road user charges and has allocated $6m a year for charging stations. But it hardly compensates for the rest.  </p><p>Even the plan to make government vehicles emissions-free by 2025 has been dropped, despite Labour having persuaded NZ First to sign up to it in their coalition agreement.  </p><p>Auckland Council has followed suit, putting its plans to buy e-buses on hold and making other cuts to public transport and active transport.  </p><p>Many councils introduced wider footpaths and cycle lanes during levels 3 and 2 of the Covid crisis. Now they're disappearing, casualties of a failure to commit to any larger purpose for new road configurations. It's as if those councils haven't even heard of the climate crisis.  </p><p>As for e-bikes, they hold the key for a great many people wanting to leave the car at home for short trips. Maybe your commute, or incidental shopping, or meeting up with the kids on their own bikes. But they're too expensive. Where's the subsidy?  </p><p>Meanwhile, where's Auckland's rapid transit network? \"Light rail\" has the potential to be the biggest single game-changer for reducing transport emissions - as well as road congestion - especially if it becomes a network that includes the North Shore. A new harbour crossing, perhaps a tunnel, dedicated to mass transit, is easily the best option for helping Shore commuters meet emissions and congestion goals.  </p><p>There is some good news: rapid busway work is proceeding in Auckland's east and south. But the first light-rail line, from downtown to Mangere, has been held up at ministerial level since before the lockdown. In early May, Transport Minister Phil Twyford said it was \"on pause at the moment\"; by late May he was forlornly promising \"spades in the ground soon\".  </p><p>NZ First leader Winston Peters said: \"It is not going to happen in the immediate term.\"  </p><p>And there's the problem. NZ First doesn't support light rail.HOW BIG is that battle inside the coalition? It's even derailed the infrastructure rebuild plans, which were supposed to be a quick way to create jobs.  </p><p>The Government set aside $3b for \"shovel ready\" infrastructure projects, probably with more to come. A high-powered reference group received 1924 project submissions from all around the country, totalling $136b in value.  </p><p>Tough to cull. But Mark Binns, chairman of the reference group with the job of doing it, said in early April, \"We will have projects available for the Government to consider early in May.\" NZ First's Shane Jones, the Infrastructure Minister, said in mid-May that ministerial decisions would be made \"soon\".  </p><p>Sources say those decisions are not expected before the end of July.  </p><p>Why? One clue is in comments Binns made in mid-April.  </p><p>\"If a region like Northland is about 3.6 per cent of the population,\" he told an industry webinar, \"we'll look at having around about 3 or 3.6 per cent of the pie in terms of projects available. But then we're going to provide a lens over the top of that in terms of what the Government's objectives are socially and what other objectives they have around clean energy, etc.\"  </p><p>Two red flags for NZ First, right there. Jones has said many times this whole exercise will not have green goals. Binns believed it would. For some reason, he also thought NZ First would accept Northland getting a mere 3.6 per cent of the money.  </p><p>The biggest casualty of the politicking is the report of the Upper North Island Supply Chain strategy group (UNISC). It proposed 80 per cent of freight haulage be transitioned to rail, with a new inland port at Kumeu, while Auckland port's car imports and container operations be moved to Northport and Tauranga. Most of that is not shovel ready, but some of it is.  </p><p>UNISC didn't argue for full electrification now but assumed it would happen at some point. If it does, that project would become the cornerstone of a far-  </p><p>sighted, super-efficient, low-carbon freight strategy. As important in industry and commerce as mass rapid transit will be to commuting. But will either happen?  </p><p>Value to NZ: Very high.  </p><p>Likelihood of major progress in next five years: Low.BUT WAIT!  </p><p>The way many public service and private sector leaders talk, you'd think we were already doing a lot of this.  </p><p>At a webinar this week hosted by the high-powered Aotearoa Circle, some of those leaders talked inspirationally about \"natural capital\", the economy being \"a subset of the environment\" and the opportunities of transitional planning. But the words aren't yet turning into nearly enough action.  </p><p>The optimist in all this is Climate Change Minister and Green Party co-leader James Shaw. His revised Emissions Trading Scheme is close to becoming law: a stronger market for trading in emissions credits, finally about to play a useful role in reducing those emissions.  </p><p>But the market won't do it all. Much still rides on the Government's billions, still to be announced.  </p><p>Shaw: \"One of the things I think a lot of people have missed about the structure of the economic recovery is there are three phases, right?\"  </p><p>The first was to help businesses and employees cope with the lockdown. The second is recovery, with short-term work programmes.  </p><p>And the third is the rebuild. The investment to come.  </p><p>How much imagination and courage are we going to see in those announcements?      </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WANCHR-WIC,wgpDNswbigidea13</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WANCHR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6043-10P1-F12B-J113-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459378</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3571\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 NZME Publishing Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Whanganui Chronicle</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 13, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

From business to the social sector to farming to environmentalists, there's been an outpouring of Big Ideas about how we could embrace that goal. The Government has a $20 billion fund to spend on the post-Covid rebuild but will it take on any big new ideas? When the whole world shut down this year, the projected annual fall in greenhouse gas emissions turned out to be only 5.5 per cent. But if we want to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees, it has to be at least 7.3 per cent, every year from now until 2030. The time is now. Here are three of those big ideas. All they need is Government support, imagination and courage, writes Simon Wilson</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Farmers stop ploughing, so carbon stays in the ground. They stop irrigating, so the plants send down deeper roots. Instead of fertiliser and pesticides, they grow a wide range of nitrogen-fixing cover crops, many of them leafy legumes. Paddocks are never grazed out, so the plants still growing regenerate quickly and what gets trodden in enriches the soil.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Does it help? Evidence overseas and locally suggests that production may drop, but not nearly as much as costs. Farm profits rise, often within two or three years. On some farms, production actually rises. There's less nitrate run-off. Much more biodiversity. Nutrient-rich food. Valuable carbon sequestration. A cleaner and healthier environment.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And more resilience against drought: with every 1 per cent increase in organic matter in the soil, a paddock can retain about 150,000 litres more water per hectare.  </p><p>The animals are healthier too, and so are the humans who tend them, because of the pleasure to be found in this kind of farming. It's good for mental health.  </p><p>Welcome to regenerative agriculture, or regen ag: think of it as \"farming in a way that mimics nature\".  </p><p>Regen ag is already happening - though still on a small scale - all over this country, in all kinds of agricultural land use. It has its detractors and a small but growing army of enthusiasts.  </p><p>It's all about the soil. As American \"grazing coach\" Siobhan Griffin, who now farms in Southland, says: \"I define regenerative farming as building topsoil. Simple as that.\"  </p><p>Conventional farming leaches goodness from the soil, so it's replaced by fertiliser. Over time, as the soil gets more distressed, it becomes ever more dependent on the fertiliser. The land is the casualty of the process. Regen ag reverses that. Help the soil be healthy, and it will provide.  </p><p>Not everyone agrees. The sceptics include two plant scientists associated with Lincoln University, Professor Derrick Moot and retired senior lecturer Warwick Scott, who have written to Agriculture Minister Damien O'Connor to warn of the \"mythology\" of regen ag. They say New Zealand agriculture is already world-leading and uses some of the techniques of regen ag anyway.  </p><p>\"We recognise that there are practices and practitioners in conventional agriculture that can be improved but consider these are minor compared with most international production systems.\"  </p><p>They say they \"strongly reject\" the idea that \"conventional agriculture, as practised in New Zealand, is degenerative\".REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE overlaps with organic farming and other holistic approaches to land management, but it's not prescriptive in the same way. Organic farming requires an exacting and expensive process of certification. Regen ag is an approach: farmers do what works for their land and their stock.  </p><p>That makes it easier to implement but harder to define, a problem also criticised by Moot and Scott.  </p><p>The support infrastructure is expanding. Consultants hold fieldays, standing in lush fields of leafy, flowering plants. There are tutorials online. Pure Advantage, a group of progressive businesses, is actively promoting the idea with research and webinars. A company called Calm the Farm offers sophisticated data analysis to create farm-management plans and match farmers with potential investors.  </p><p>Regen ag has implications for trade, as global consumers ramp up their demand for \"green\" and \"ethical\" foods. One clear indicator of that: by 2025, the giant French dairy company Danone - a major rival to Fonterra - says 100 per cent of its ingredients produced in France will come from regenerative farming.  </p><p>Imagine how things could change when there's a phone app that tells you the nutrient density of the fruit and vegetables in the supermarket.  </p><p>Fonterra has not made a Danone-style commitment. New Zealand farming, in general, is not keeping up. In July last year, 11 leading sector groups published a document called He Waka Eke Noa: Our Future in Our Hands. It's the \"primary sector climate change commitment\" and it doesn't contain a single mention of regenerative agriculture. There's nothing on the Federated Farmers' website either.  </p><p>Since that report, though, the Primary Sector Council, representing those same groups, has made some progress with a Fit for a Better World initiative. Beef + Lamb NZ, a member of the council, is doing a global study into regen ag, hoping to identify its potential here.THE GOVERNMENT is also moving, although not at pace. Manaaki Whenua (Landcare Research), Lincoln and Pamu (Landcorp) all have research projects under way.  </p><p>O'Connor told the Otago Daily Times recently that farmers have always been free to choose their own practices and \"curiosity is one of the drivers of innovation\".  </p><p>He noted that much of the information about regen ag comes from overseas. \"There is a real opportunity for our science and research community to work with farmers to build a robust, evidence-based understanding of the benefits of regenerative agriculture practices in a New Zealand context.\"  </p><p>Well, yes. But the Government also has to take the lead. Regen ag proponents report getting the banks to listen. And farming has some powerful and very wary vested interests, including the fertiliser companies and big corporate farms with massive investments in new irrigation.  </p><p>The Budget in May allocated just $34 million to the wider field of agricultural emissions research. More is needed. Greenpeace has proposed a $1 billion transition fund - that could easily come from the Government's $20b rebuild fund.  </p><p>Beyond the money, though, the key to progress is not to change agriculture one farmer at a time. It takes whole communities. Fed Farmers and others could play an exciting role in this.  </p><p>There's already strong evidence regenerative agriculture is a viable option for New Zealand. We need to know because if it is, it's hard to think of an initiative more in tune with the task of building greater prosperity in a better world. A model for how to integrate economic, environmental and social goals, with greater resilience for the uncertain times ahead. And, as a terrific bonus, with the potential to narrow the town and country cultural divide.  </p><p>Jono Frew, regen ag farm consultant: \"It's more profitable, more resilient and you have a whole lot more fun in doing this.\" Also, that billion-dollar fund would help.  </p><p>Value to NZ: Probably immense.  </p><p>Likelihood of major progress in next five years: Low.  </p><p>Microsoft is coming. Avatar is already here. How do we make the most of this?  </p><p>Tech companies, along with companies that take a high-tech approach to their work, have been interested in New Zealand for a long time. Often, at our expense. They don't pay enough tax, they demand financial incentives and special employment laws, they strip resources from local industry. But does it have to be like that?  </p><p>We're New Zealand. That means something different now. We're the country that beat the virus. Most of our energy comes from renewables. Most of our workforce is well educated and readily trainable. And did you hear? We Beat The Virus.  </p><p>Who wouldn't want to do business from here?  </p><p>Corporate interest in being based in New Zealand is only going to grow. So maybe it's time to set some new rules. Hire local and use local suppliers. Invest locally. Obviously, we'll need an equitable tax regime.  </p><p>If we can set good new rules for tech-related companies, the rewards could be immense. Health, agriculture, screen industries, education, the media and more, all stand to benefit from a supercharged tech sector. Importantly, every small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) in the country does too.  </p><p>Microsoft will build a new data centre in Auckland: that's Cloud-based computing services, based here. Kris Faafoi, the Minister for Government Digital Services, says this means \"the Government, and New Zealand businesses and people, will be able to access the scale and security of Cloud services offered by a major global provider in ways we haven't been able to before\".ARE WE going to make the most of this? The dream is for every retailer, every tradie, every manufacturer and service provider, every authorised person working for any of them, to have immediate access to the data they need.  </p><p>It might be supply chain activity in real-time, financial records and calculations, work schedules, risk analysis, customer profiles, you name it. All without SMEs having to buy and run expensive servers and the security systems to look after them.  </p><p>Business commentator Rod Oram calls the productivity benefits that would follow \"the number one global business lesson from the Covid crisis so far\".  </p><p>Craig Hudson, chief executive at Xero, agrees. He's pointed out that New Zealand's GDP per capita is about 30 per cent below the average of the top half of the OECD, and it's been stuck like that for 25 years. Cloud-based computing services for SMEs, he says, offer the best chance we have to increase productivity and will be essential to rebuilding the economy.  </p><p>Xero commissioned a report on cloud-based computing from NZIER, just before the pandemic hit us. In its modelling, a 20 per cent increased take-up raised GDP by 1.2 to 2.1 per cent, with household spending up by $2.6 to $4.6b a year, business output by $4.1 to $7.3b, real wages by $1.8 to $1.9b and exports up too.  </p><p>There are issues to resolve: Hudson lists skills gaps, concerns over privacy, internet infrastructure and cost. But they're resolvable. Singapore's on to it, with a Digital Economy Framework that includes services and grants paid directly to SMEs.  </p><p>Now that Microsoft is coming, what about the other big tech companies?  </p><p>We'd want them on our terms, of course, and those terms can go a lot further than tax and local contracts. Microsoft will need power for its servers and, as Faafoi has noted, the company has carbon-neutral commitments that fit very well with what he calls our \"reliable, almost entirely renewable power supply\".  </p><p>In fact, it's not almost entirely renewable: 15 per cent of electricity is not generated from renewables, and progress with wind and solar remains slow even as demand for electricity instead of fossil fuels is rising. We're going to need a lot more renewable energy very soon (see transport, below).HOW DO we jump-start that? Sir Stephen Tindall says the answer is to invite corporates to set up the Southern Hemisphere's leading tech centre, for communications, service industries and manufacturing. As part of the deal, we get them to help build a new generation of geothermal, hydro, wind and solar energy capacity to power their massive server farms. Hundreds of millions of dollars of new infrastructure and thousands of jobs.  </p><p>\"I've been looking at this through two overlapping lenses: investing in the infrastructure that will catapult us into 21st-century ways of working and see us thrive at the same time; and decarbonising the economy to help us meet our commitments under the Paris Agreement.\"  </p><p>Valuable in its own terms, he says, and also to \"position our country as the leading provider of green data centres to the Asia-Pacific region, much like Scandinavia has done for Europe\".  </p><p>It's our competitive advantage, because the competitors, in Australia and Asia, tend to rely on dirty old coal.  </p><p>Michael Lee, an associate professor at the University of Auckland Business School, has applied a similar idea to the screen industry. He wants us to invite large screen companies here and encourage them to create a massive research fund. Matched dollar for dollar by the Government, it would enable New Zealand \"to lead the world in tidal energy and aquatic-based biofuels, as well as information and digital technology\".  </p><p>There's another element to be fitted in. If we do this, how about we ask them to pay a levy to support the local film industry? We've got a local culture to nourish while we do all this.  </p><p>Is this a real prospect for New Zealand? Climate Change Minister James Shaw wants New Zealand to sign up to a Sustainable Recovery Alliance. You'd think we should be leading it, really.  </p><p>But no. There was very little in the May Budget earmarked for climate change. As for doing business in the Cloud, only $10m was allocated to e-commerce and another $12.5m for transtasman e-invoicing.  </p><p>Meanwhile, Germany and France have proposed a (EURO)500b fund for Europe, with an explicit focus on digital and green options. Germany has dedicated 40 per cent of its own fund to that purpose.  </p><p>\"We need to think bigger,\" says Xero's Hudson. Perhaps we will. With this one, if we get the regulations right, it's hard to think why any major vested interests would stand in the way.  </p><p>Value to NZ: High.  </p><p>Likelihood of major progress in next five years: Medium.  </p><p>Ports of Auckland has bought the world's first full-size e-tugboat. They're asking for help naming it, and yes, they've probably already heard about Boaty McBoatface.  </p><p>Some waste disposal companies use electric trucks; some freight companies also use e-trucks, especially for short-haul work. But despite our renewable energy advantage, New Zealand has not yet seriously embraced e-transport. A proposal to have electric ferries in action in time for the America's Cup, as a showcase, has gone nowhere.  </p><p>Fraser Whineray, formerly at Mercury Energy and now Fonterra's chief operating officer, says this has to change. He calls transport electrification our \"biggest green growth opportunity\". Fonterra uses e-trucks for some of its short-haul work.  </p><p>New Zealand is nowhere near being able to meet its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions targets, including a 30 per cent reduction on 2005 levels by 2030. At the current rate, not counting the pandemic period, we could be producing 15 million tonnes more emissions per year than we should.  </p><p>We're heading in the wrong direction. Mainly in our cars and trucks. Transport, with 20 per cent of all our emissions, is the biggest GHG problem confronting our cities.  </p><p>Electrification is a wide field: personal EVs (electric vehicles), mass transit (light rail and buses), heavy rail for freight and commuters, e-trucks, e-bikes and e-scooters. Those electric tugs, ferries and other boats; and aeroplanes too, for domestic routes at least.  </p><p>Naturally, all of them have to be powered by renewable energy, from diverse sources.  </p><p>There's been some official progress. January's $6.8b infrastructure announcement included electrification of the remaining 19km of Auckland's rail network, from Papakura to Pukekohe. A third track on part of the Southern Line will make the network more efficient for freight and commuters, and there will be two new stations in fast-growing Drury.  </p><p>But that's about it. Strangely, there was nothing for Paerata Rise, down the line from Drury, where 4500 homes will be built. That's more than in any other new residential development in Auckland.  </p><p>As local board chairman Andy Baker has asked, how is it acceptable to build big new subdivisions in greenfields Auckland, very near the rail line, and not put in a stop?  </p><p>Worse, the bulk of the January announcement, $5.3b, went to new roads that undermine the very idea of a carbon-reduction strategy. It was a colossal walk-back on the Government's previously stated intentions.  </p><p>Rail received another $1.2b in the May Budget, but $400m of that was for new Interislander ferries, with no mention of whether they'd be electric or perhaps hydrogen-powered.  </p><p>Rail improvements are under way in Northland, Waikato and the Bay of Plenty, but little of it is tied to electrification.  </p><p>It's not the front-and-centre goal.BACK ON the roads, the record is dreary. No end date for importing vehicles that burn fossil fuels, despite the Productivity Commission saying all new vehicles should be electric by 2030.  </p><p>No \"feebate\" to levy high-emitting vehicles and subsidise the purchase of low emitters. That scheme was abandoned in February, with both National and NZ First gleefully claiming the credit.  </p><p>High-emitting double-cab utes, the most popular class of new vehicle in the country, are exempt from fringe benefits tax. That's right, we're encouraged to buy them. Electric vehicles are not exempt.  </p><p>The Government does exempt EVs from road user charges and has allocated $6m a year for charging stations. But it hardly compensates for the rest.  </p><p>Even the plan to make government vehicles emissions-free by 2025 has been dropped, despite Labour having persuaded NZ First to sign up to it in their coalition agreement.  </p><p>Auckland Council has followed suit, halting plans to buy e-buses for general use - although a new fleet of e-buses will operate the Airport Link to Manukau from mid-2021.  </p><p>Many councils introduced wider footpaths and cycle lanes during levels 3 and 2 of the Covid crisis. Now they're disappearing, casualties of a failure to commit to any larger purpose for new road configurations. It's as if those councils haven't even heard of the climate crisis.  </p><p>As for e-bikes, they hold the key for a great many people wanting to leave the car at home for short trips. Maybe your commute, or incidental shopping, or meeting up with the kids on their own bikes. But they're too expensive. Where's the subsidy?  </p><p>Meanwhile, where's Auckland's rapid transit network? \"Light rail\" has the potential to be the biggest single game-changer for reducing transport emissions - as well as road congestion - especially if it becomes a network that includes the North Shore. A new harbour crossing, perhaps a tunnel, dedicated to mass transit, is easily the best option for helping Shore commuters meet emissions and congestion goals.  </p><p>There is some good news: rapid busway work is proceeding in Auckland's east and south. But the first light-rail line, from downtown to Mangere, has been held up at ministerial level since before the lockdown. In early May, Transport Minister Phil Twyford said it was \"on pause at the moment\"; by late May he was forlornly promising \"spades in the ground soon\".  </p><p>NZ First leader Winston Peters said: \"It is not going to happen in the immediate term.\"  </p><p>And there's the problem. NZ First doesn't support light rail.HOW BIG is that battle inside the coalition? It's even derailed the infrastructure rebuild plans, which were supposed to be a quick way to create jobs.  </p><p>The Government set aside $3b for \"shovel ready\" infrastructure projects, probably with more to come. A high-powered reference group received 1924 project submissions from all around the country, totalling $136b in value.  </p><p>Tough to cull. But Mark Binns, chairman of the reference group with the job of doing it, said in early April, \"We will have projects available for the Government to consider early in May.\" NZ First's Shane Jones, the Infrastructure Minister, said in mid-May that ministerial decisions would be made \"soon\".  </p><p>Sources say those decisions are not expected before the end of July.  </p><p>Why? One clue is in comments Binns made in mid-April.  </p><p>\"If a region like Northland is about 3.6 per cent of the population,\" he told an industry webinar, \"we'll look at having around about 3 or 3.6 per cent of the pie in terms of projects available. But then we're going to provide a lens over the top of that in terms of what the Government's objectives are socially and what other objectives they have around clean energy, etc.\"  </p><p>Two red flags for NZ First, right there. Jones has said many times this whole exercise will not have green goals. Binns believed it would. For some reason, he also thought NZ First would accept Northland getting a mere 3.6 per cent of the money.  </p><p>The biggest casualty of the politicking is the report of the Upper North Island Supply Chain strategy group (UNISC). It proposed 80 per cent of freight haulage be transitioned to rail, with a new inland port at Kumeu, while Auckland port's car imports and container operations be moved to Northport and Tauranga. Most of that is not shovel ready, but some of it is.  </p><p>UNISC didn't argue for full electrification now but assumed it would happen at some point. If it does, that project would become the cornerstone of a far-  </p><p>sighted, super-efficient, low-carbon freight strategy. As important in industry and commerce as mass rapid transit will be to commuting. But will either happen?  </p><p>Value to NZ: Very high.  </p><p>Likelihood of major progress in next five years: Low.BUT WAIT!  </p><p>The way many public service and private sector leaders talk, you'd think we were already doing a lot of this.  </p><p>At a webinar this week hosted by the high-powered Aotearoa Circle, some of those leaders talked inspirationally about \"natural capital\", the economy being \"a subset of the environment\" and the opportunities of transitional planning. But the words aren't yet turning into nearly enough action.  </p><p>The optimist in all this is Climate Change Minister and Green Party co-leader James Shaw. His revised Emissions Trading Scheme is close to becoming law: a stronger market for trading in emissions credits, finally about to play a useful role in reducing those emissions.  </p><p>But the market won't do it all.

Click. The door unlocks, responding to a command from software powering the camera that recognized Vance's face and confirmed his identity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Vance, a senior director of product management at the Seattle tech company, leads the team that created Secure, Accurate Facial Recognition\u00a0- or SAFR, pronounced \"safer\"\u00a0- a technology that the company began offering free to K-12 schools this summer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It took three years, 8 million faces and more than 8 billion data points to develop the technology, which can identify a face with near perfect accuracy. The short-term goal, RealNetworks executives say, is increased school safety.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"There's a lot of benefit for schools understanding who's coming and going,\" Vance said.</p><p>The software is already in use at one Seattle school, and RealNetworks is in talks to expand it to several others across the country. Looking ahead, RealNetworks - known for video- and music-streaming software introduced in the early 2000s - plans to sell SAFR to various industries, though the company is staying completely mum on the details for now.</p><p>The introduction of the technology has thrust RealNetworks into the center of a field that is growing quickly as software gets better at identifying faces. But growing along with it are privacy concerns and rising calls for regulation - even from the technology companies that are inventing the biometric software.</p><p>Facial-recognition technology is already common, used in everything from photo apps that sort pictures of people, to unlocking an iPhone, to law-enforcement agencies searching databases of driver's license\u00a0photos.</p><p>Facial recognition is used, broadly, in two ways, said Oren Etzioni, CEO of Seattle's Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence,\u00a0the sister organization to Paul Allen's brain science institute. One is consumer convenience, such as grouping photos, and the other is for surveillance and tracking.</p><p>The big tech players have been involved for years: Microsoft markets Face API for companies to identify and group similar faces for apps and other products, while Amazon has Rekognition, which came under fire earlier this year when the ACLU asked the company to stop selling it to law-enforcement agencies. Google, Apple and Facebook are also in the game, as tagging and grouping photos on smartphones illustrate.</p><p>But now, as RealNetworks' SAFR shows, the technology has been moving further into public spaces. And with that, privacy advocates wonder if people fully realize how often their faces are being scanned, and advocates and the industry alike question where the line is between the benefits to the public and the cost to privacy.</p><p>Facial-recognition technology functions much like fingerprinting - each face has its own unique signature, and companies teach machines to recognize and match people's unique features.</p><p>RealNetworks' technology maps 1,600 data points on each face it sees. The team has been \"training\" its machine for about two years, since the launch of RealTimes, its free app that lets people build photo slideshows. Baked into the 3,300-word user agreement for that app is language that allows RealNetworks to use customer photos to train its facial-recognition system.</p><p>SAFR doesn't know the identity of people in the RealTimes photos, Vance said - there are no names, addresses or other identifying information in the massive database of 8 million faces. But what it can do is tell if two faces are the same person. It's gotten so accurate that it can tell identical twins apart and match family photos of the same person even if they were taken decades apart.</p><p>SAFR relies on being able to identify people \"in the wild,\" or acting candidly, not posing.</p><p>\"The great things about those kinds of faces is that they're people doing things that they naturally do in life,\" Vance said. \"They're not mug shots or canned shots. You can overtrain a system for people looking squarely into the camera. But when you're walking around here, when you're walking around a school, you're not always looking squarely at the camera.\"</p><p>Many face-recognition technologies can also identify basic demographics of a person. Microsoft's Face API, for instance, can guess your age with just one photo - a feature that has gotten more accurate since it was first released in 2015 to middling user reviews.</p><p>That has led to concerns of bias, though, especially since a study at MIT's Media Lab found some big tech companies' facial-recognition apps had error rates up to 35 percent higher when identifying women with darker skin compared to men with lighter skin. Some feared that could lead to misidentifying women and people of color, a troubling issue especially if the systems are used by law enforcement.</p><p>Microsoft has acknowledged the bias issues and is taking steps to better identify diverse faces, broadening the database it uses to train its system by adding photos of more diverse people.</p><p>RealNetworks, however, hasn't trained its software to identify someone based on race. You couldn't, for example, ask SAFR to alert you when a white man walks in a door because it won't know which faces are white.</p><p>The company didn't see any benefit in teaching the machine to recognize race. \"It's loaded,\" Vance said of racial identification.</p><p>SAFR has been watching over the main entrance gate of Seattle's private elementary University Child Development School (UCDS) since this spring, buzzing in parents who come to pick up or drop off their kids. The school, where RealNetworks CEO Rob Glaser's kids were enrolled last year, wanted to try out the system to add to overall security at its University District campus.</p><p>It acts as an automatic doorman for parents and staff members - if a parent's face is recognized by the camera mounted above the front gate, the door opens, reducing the need for someone inside the school to diligently answer a buzzer.</p><p>\"It's very convenient,\" said Ana Hedrick, whose daughter is in second grade at the school. \"It feels safe.\"</p><p>The school sent out information about the system to parents and gave them the option of adding their face to the machine's database - something that Hedrick and about 300 parents and caregivers have done. The SAFR system at the school will identify only adults and rejects the addition of children to the group of identifiable faces (which a few kids have tried to do, unsuccessfully, using the system's self-add feature).\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>The school offered to answer questions about privacy concerns, and explained they use the adults' photos only for their own security system, said another mother, whose kids are in first and third grade at UCDS. \"I trust that the school knows what it's doing,\" she said. \"Feeling like my kids are safe here is huge.\"</p><p>RealNetworks plans to keep giving SAFR to schools for free, even as the company expands it to new industries where it will charge for the system, Vance said.</p><p>The rash of school shootings across the country has thrust school security into the spotlight. RealNetworks executives said they know SAFR isn't a fail-safe system, but they figure each little security component helps, especially one that can recognize if a known, unwanted person has attempted to enter school grounds.</p><p>\"There's no panacea here,\" said the Allen Institute's Etzioni, who is not involved in RealNetworks' project. \"But I do think that trading some degree of privacy is a reasonable trade-off for saving children's lives.\"</p><p>Some critics, however, aren't so sure such systems in schools will be effective enough to outweigh the privacy costs.</p><p>\"There's a general habituation of people to be tolerant of this kind of tracking of their face,\" said Adam Schwartz, a lawyer with digital privacy group Electronic Frontier Foundation. \"This is especially troubling when it comes to schoolchildren. It's getting them used to it.\"</p><p>School security is a serious issue, he agreed, but he said the benefits of facial recognition in this case are largely unknown, and the damage to privacy could be \"exceedingly high.\"</p><p>Privacy issues have become an increasingly common topic as facial recognition gets more accurate. Big tech companies, including Amazon and Google, faced opposition for selling their systems to law-enforcement agencies, which some fear could lead to a police state and unfair profiling.</p><p>But law-enforcement agencies have also used such systems to find missing people and arrest criminals, something that helps public safety.</p><p>Some critics believe tech companies should restrict the use of the technology. But its development and its use by law enforcement agencies has reached the point where the federal government should step in and regulate it, Microsoft President Brad Smith argued in a blog post this summer.</p><p>\"The only effective way to manage the use of technology by a government is for the government proactively to manage this use itself,\" he wrote. \"And if there are concerns about how a technology will be deployed more broadly across society, the only way to regulate this broad use is for the government to do so.\"\u00a0</p><p>RealNetworks is supporting its Redmond neighbor's call for regulation, Vance said.</p><p>Regulations are already in place in Europe, where a recent sweeping privacy law calls for organizations to inform people before collecting their biometric data and tell them what it will be used for, even in stores and businesses.</p><p>A few U.S. states also have consent laws regarding the technology. A Washington law passed last year requires companies, before collecting biometric data, to inform people and tell them what their information will be used for. But most states have no mandates and the federal government has yet to address the topic.</p><p>In China, the technology is so common that it can identify people who are jaywalking and display their photos on public digital billboards.</p><p>The U.S. isn't near that level yet of routinely identifying people in public streets or parks, said Clare Garvie, an associate at the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown Law Center, but she finds the lack of transparency into how the technology is being used and the lack of federal laws troubling.</p><p>Garvie was on a team that conducted a widespread study that found 54 percent of U.S. residents are in a facial-recognition database accessible by law enforcement - usually in the form of a driver's license photo. \"It is unprecedented to have a biometric database that is composed primarily of law-abiding citizens,\" Garvie said.</p><p>\"The current trajectory might fundamentally change the relationship between police and the public,\" she said. \"It could change the degree to which we feel comfortable going about our daily lives in public spaces.\"</p><p>But proper regulation could prevent that, and there's reason to be optimistic, Garvie said, pointing to Microsoft's call for such laws.</p><p>Use of the technology has been slowed to some extent because it's still limited in some ways: It isn't as accurate identifying faces in different lights or in motion, and it takes a tremendous amount of computing power to quickly match faces among billions of photos. But these hurdles are surmountable, said Alessandro Acquisti, a professor of information technology and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University.</p><p>He pointed out that facial recognition can be used for good - to combat child trafficking - and for bad - to track law-abiding citizens anywhere they go.</p><p>That doesn't mean it's neutral, he said. Anonymity is becoming more scare with the proliferation of photos on social media and the technology that can recognize faces.</p><p>\"Those with unfettered access to your data, and especially those whose usage of your own data you cannot inquire about or limit, have power over you,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SEATTM-a05e1e46c42011e8a5dd47a9b518d46c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SEATTM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TCM-CW41-DY2P-44B6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8206</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1959\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Seattle Times Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Seattle Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 28, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Canada moves up to No. 2, and Japan is No. 3. Rounding out the top 5 are Germany and Australia. The U.K. comes in at No. 6, and the U.S. rose one spot to No. 7.<br/><br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-- Respondents paint a bleak picture when asked about nations' trustworthiness (       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2690580-1&amp;h=3740970979&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fusnews.com%2Fnews%2Fbest-countries%2Farticles%2F2020-01-15%2Fus-trustworthiness-rating-dives-in-2020-best-countries-report&amp;a=trustworthiness\">https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2690580-1&amp;h=3740970979&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fusnews.com%2Fnews%2Fbest-countries%2Farticles%2F2020-01-15%2Fus-trustworthiness-rating-dives-in-2020-best-countries-report&amp;a=trustworthiness</url> ). While the U.S. is perceived as the most powerful country in the world, data shows it is not perceived as very trustworthy. Canada is perceived as the most trustworthy country, and has been since the first Best Countries report in 2016. During that same time, perceptions of the U.S. as being trustworthy have steadily dropped to a record-low of 16.3 on a 100-point scale. The U.K. also fell in this attribute, while Greece, South Korea and Spain improved.<br/><br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-- There is a global consensus about the effect of climate change. Most respondents (87%) agree that climate change is real. Of the 36 countries surveyed, people in Russia agreed about climate change the least (71%), and Indonesia agreed the most (97%) along with African nations including Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa. But only 60% of respondents agree their country is effectively addressing its effects.<br/><br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-- Global anxiety about technology persists. Nearly three out of four people (74%) think large technology companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon should be limited, and about the same number agree that technology is displacing jobs. The UK, Canada and Australia agree most with limiting large technology corporations. In Japan, which is perceived as a technology powerhouse, just 31.5% agree that technology is displacing jobs and 55% agree that big tech should be limited.<br/><br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-- Gender equality is viewed favorably, but there is a gap between perception and reality. Ninety percent of respondents agree that women should be entitled to the same rights as men. However, when asked whether women actually do have the same economic opportunities as men in their countries, only 64% of respondents agreed. A little more than two out of three people (69%) said they view traditional gender roles as important to a functioning society, and that perception is similar between men (73%) and women (66%).<br/><br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"This year's Best Countries rankings continue to show us human rights, diversity, sustainability and free trade are all top of mind for many worldwide, connecting us together.

From federal regulators to Congress to state attorneys general, everyone seems to be trying to figure out whether major tech companies have gotten too big, too powerful and maybe broken antitrust laws. For clues about what Google and Facebook and Amazon and Apple might face, we're going to take a look back at one of the biggest antitrust cases of the past few decades.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)                </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PERSON:                 After weeks of mounting tension, today the Justice Department and a coalition of 20 states filed a pair of broad antitrust lawsuits against the world's leading software company Microsoft.             </p><p>MARY LOUISE KELLY:                 Now, that is from our show on May 18, 1998. The case had actually started to take shape almost a decade earlier, and the end of it wouldn't come until years later. Well, here to explain the lessons that today's big tech giants can take from the Microsoft case is reporter Adi Robertson of The Verge.             </p><p>                Adi Robertson, welcome.             </p><p>ADI ROBERTSON:                 Hi.             </p><p>MARY LOUISE KELLY:                 Let's start with that moment - 1998. Walk me through the landscape of what was going on in terms of Microsoft and federal regulators starting to think very hard about reining it in then.             </p><p>ADI ROBERTSON:                 Microsoft had been skirmishing with the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission for almost a decade at that point over, how did it achieve massive dominance in operating systems? And then in 1995, Bill Gates realized that he had missed the Internet.             </p><p>MARY LOUISE KELLY:                 What does that mean, he had missed the Internet?             </p><p>ADI ROBERTSON:                 Microsoft had focused so much on making Windows important that it had missed that the Internet could make operating systems almost obsolete. And there was this one company making this one browser, Netscape Navigator, that had achieved a really strong presence already. And Microsoft realized that they needed to stop them.             </p><p>MARY LOUISE KELLY:                 Right around this time, Bill Gates ended up testifying before Congress.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>BILL GATES:                 The products that Microsoft makes have a very short lifetime in terms of their attractiveness to customers. In the span of the term of a senator, we create a product; it becomes a very popular product; and then that product has no demand whatsoever.             </p><p>MARY LOUISE KELLY:                 Adi Robertson, if - when you go back and listen through to all of that testimony, the thrust of it is Bill Gates mounting a vigorous defense of Microsoft, saying it's not a monopoly. Was that a - an argument that regulators and state attorneys general bought?             </p><p>ADI ROBERTSON:                 Ultimately, no. Ultimately, they decided that Microsoft had been incredibly aggressive at trying to drive Netscape out of business, which they ultimately did. They would pressure companies not to work with them, and they were also giving Internet Explorer away for free. So they were just massively undercutting this product that was partially paid by using their incredibly popular operating system and integrating this browser right into it.             </p><p>MARY LOUISE KELLY:                 What do you see as lessons learned, as similarities between how the Microsoft case unfolded and what companies Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook are facing today?             </p><p>ADI ROBERTSON:                 Maybe the clearest point of comparison is between Microsoft and Google. You have a company that controls this whole stack of technology. It runs an incredibly popular operating system. It runs incredibly popular apps on top of that operating system, and it uses those things to push other companies out, arguably.             </p><p>                One of the lessons is that this genuinely is an issue, even if it is sort of giving these things away for free, even if it is saying, oh, well, you can uninstall this; you can go and take your own Chrome alternative and install it. The law has said that these things have an effect, that these things can still be damaging.             </p><p>MARY LOUISE KELLY:                 I suppose - worth pointing out that Microsoft is still around, is actually doing pretty well. Is there a lesson there for these companies facing potential litigation that, you know, they might come out of it and be doing just fine a decade, two decades from now?             </p><p>ADI ROBERTSON:                 Yeah, I think the big argument around Microsoft was that the point was not to kill the company, that the point was to make the company sort of more circumspect about shutting out competition. So when a company like Google shows up and starts working in the Web, Microsoft realizes that it can operate and it can work without mercilessly destroying them.             </p><p>MARY LOUISE KELLY:                 That is reporter Adi Robertson of The Verge. Thanks very much.             </p><p>ADI ROBERTSON:                 Thank you.             </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NPRATC-2019100704</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NPRATC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X75-13Y1-DY2S-N2D3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"888\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 National Public Radio (R) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NPR All Things Considered</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 7, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In Florida, regulation of the industry could become even more lenient, affecting thousands of our elders. SB 402 was recently unanimously passed by the Senate's Committee on Health Policy. Several of the bill's proposed changes are not consistent with residents' rights and basic health and safety requirements. The bill, for example, proposes to remove from the already bare-bones reporting requirements the obligation that facilities report their liability claims (for example, settled lawsuits for a violation of residents' rights or safety) to the Agency for Health Care Administration. It proposes to remove the provision that the agency develop uniform standards to determine facilities' compliance with residents' rights and facility standards. The bill will also reduce the obligation of the facility to provide an environment that is safe, healthy and clean by allowing facilities to \"promote\" rather than \"ensure\" these basic requirements. With regard to maintenance requirements, the bill will no longer hold facilities accountable for plumbing, heating, cooling, lighting, ventilation, and living space as these are struck out in the text of the bill.</p><p>If lawmakers are looking to use regulation to improve quality of care and quality of life, at a minimum, they should aim to reduce the number of persons allowed per bedroom down to 1, require each individual to have their own bathroom, increase minimum staffing levels, strengthen regulation for those ALFs that provide special care for those living with dementia, extend the role of the state's long-term care ombudsman, and increase the frequency of inspection from once every two years to twice a year. When lawmakers look to revise assisted living regulation, they should begin from the perspective of those living in assisted living.</p><p>Dr. Lori Gonzalez, Tallahassee</p><p>The writer is on the research faculty at the Claude Pepper Center, Florida State University.</p><p>Big data's promise and peril</p><p>I cannot recall a more important editorial. After 45 years in medical research, I appreciate both the promise and perils of population-level data analyzed via machine learning. Inductive models using \"big data\" hold high potential, not only in diagnostic and therapeutic options, but also in the organizational and financial determinations of \"what works.\" Facing a future where chronic disease management will be the challenge, this is particularly important. Our endless debates about who and how to insure, should have been always subordinated to answering the core: most health for least dollars.</p><p>On the other hand, nothing is more personal to us than us. Improper use of identifiable information about our health, and use of care, already has had catastrophic effects on many. This is despite the many legal protections that we incorrectly presume to be impenetrable. We have only belatedly realized that we are the product, rather than the consumer, of big tech.</p><p>We still underestimate that algorithms now deployed to define us, are increasingly being used to re-define us. We are already plagued by \"-ists\" and \"-isms\" speciously based on superficial traits. Imagine a scenario in which discrimination can be derived from irrefutable, fundamental, consequential, often immutable, differences among us. This is, in sum, a really big deal, which the Times' editorial highlights for us, good and bad. Here, the clock on remedy is no doubt ticking faster than most of our other concerns, such as climate change. Fortunately, we have some institutional organs, including but not limited to, the National Academy of Sciences. This is not a job for politicians, nor is it one in which regulation is the only or best intervention.</p><p>Pat Byrne, Largo</p><p>Making criminals in prison</p><p>Recently a loved one of mine was sentenced to five years in a Florida prison. A non-violent, first-time offender who made a terrible decision, he has landed at Central Florida Reception Center to attend orientation before he is assigned to his permanent camp.</p><p>As much as our hearts are aching, we fully understand that the magnitude of this crime mandates a sentence. The issue is that such facilities are submerging these offenders into a culture riddled with extortion, drugs and criminal activity that must ensue in order to protect your own life.</p><p>How does this happen? How do those who are sentenced to prison as first-time, non-violent offenders get dumped into a violence-filled, corrupt atmosphere?</p><p>This is introducing this type of criminal to a world where drugs and violence reign supreme - watching others fight, beating other inmates beyond recognition, knowing that they cannot access help from the guards, witnessing those who do not have the capacity to deal with such absurdities take their own life. This is, in turn, creating a criminal rather than rehabilitating.</p><p>How do these acts keep occurring in Florida prisons? How can this continue, this inhumane treatment of human beings? All of this is contributing to creating a criminal, one who will possibly return to jail, or will use the knowledge they gained in jail to deceive the outside population.</p><p>Why are we creating a criminal out of a non-violent first-time offender?

Business, labor, Republicans, Democrats and small parties all concluded: Why limit what candidates can raise when the wealthy can just set up independent campaigns and affect the outcome anyway?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As I read about the brave proposal put forward by Rep. Dan Rayfield, I gather what The Oregonian has decided is to ignore that inconvenient unclosable \u201cloophole\u201d and focus on preventing legislative caucuses and party committees from coordinating the campaign efforts of like-minded candidates (\u201cEditorial: Proposed campaign donation limits only limits who holds the power,\u201d June 9). What a gift to the Koch brothers!</p><p>The Oregonian is correct that the first step is to put forward the needed constitutional amendment so that Oregon can take any action on campaign donations. And more work over time might create a more perfect legislative product. But the bill passed by the House takes a brave step forward by Democratic leaders, given that the Koch brothers, Phil Knight and others are willing to put personal fortunes on the line to get the legislators they want, whether or not they may donate to the candidates directly.</p><p>If Citizens United is reversed or repealed, we can revisit the question of preventing like-minded candidates from working together through party organizations and caucuses. Until then, let\u2019s move on campaign finance reform while taking reasonable steps to keep candidates in control of their messages.</p><p>Jeanne Atkins, Portland Atkins was secretary of state from 2015 to 2017 and served as chair of the Democratic Party of Oregon from 2017 until March.</p><p>Portland needs stronger neighborhood schools</p><p>Portland Public Schools has been stuck in the \u201950s since the \u201990s. Our children are shuttled all over town to get a \u201cgood education\u201d rather than building strong schools in every neighborhood. Every local school and every neighborhood deserves the same \u201cfree\u201d education. Parents are driving all over town to get their children to schools with \u201cbetter\u201d services, and that takes time away from building the best neighborhoods. Our community centers are closing, and we\u2019re losing public spaces to developers and others who profit from our inability to invest in our own neighborhoods. When we allow real estate agents to determine school boundaries, we perpetuate a broken system.</p><p>Motoring children all over town in hopes of achieving a better education is a waste of time and resources, and the privilege of driving to a better future is not helping equity or civic values. I love our city, and as a Northwest native and public-school graduate, I hope other parents will advocate for a fair and decent boundary review and redistricting. Equal distribution of resources will let people have pride in their local school, stay in their neighborhoods and stop contributing to traffic. Rewarding gentrification with destination public schools and choices for the haves/punishment for the systemically oppressed is hurting our city. We need PPS to give our children a future we don\u2019t have to drive to.</p><p>Jenny Lovold, Portland</p><p>Trump, not the FBI director, is wrong</p><p>I can understand when you back President Donald Trump because the economy is good. Or if you agree with his policy on immigration or abortion. Or if you think his tariffs will work. But how can you still support him when he makes a statement that is unethical, immoral, and is against our democratic principles?</p><p>When asked if he would take information about his political opponent from a foreign government such as Russia, China or North Korea, he said that he would take it. When asked if he would report it to the FBI, he said no \u2014 that he has seen many, many things in his career that he didn\u2019t report to the FBI and he wouldn\u2019t do that now. When he was told that the director of the FBI said this type of foreign influence in our elections should be reported to the FBI, President Trump said, \u201cThe FBI director is wrong.\u201d I have not agreed with many things that the president has said, but this is the first time I am literally sick to my stomach. The president of the United States, our United States, encouraged foreign influence in our democratic elections. Does he somehow think that these governments would not want something from him in return? OMG.</p><p>Jerry Kenefick, Ashland</p><p>Pass gun-storage bill</p><p>Writing on behalf of ourselves and three other physicians, we urge the Oregon Legislature to pass safe gun storage. Requiring guns to be locked when not in use would protect the lives of children who get their hands on a firearm and unwittingly shoot others. The consequences of this type of gun violence have a dramatic ripple effect, causing irrevocable damage to victims, survivors, child shooters and their families and communities.</p><p>Furthermore, Oregon loses 14 kids and adolescents every year to gun suicide. We know that if these youth had not had access to a gun, they would likely be alive today. Specifically, most people who try to take their own lives choose to do so about 10 minutes before the attempt. If they use a gun, 90 percent will die. If they use other means, 1 percent to 2 percent will die. And 90 percent of survivors of an attempted suicide do not go on to die by suicide. Preventing access to a gun to people in crisis saves lives.</p><p>Fortunately, our legislators have an excellent bill that would require gun owners to do what most gun owners already do: secure the guns when they are not in use.</p><p>We urge our leaders to pass House Bill 2505. It will save lives the day it goes into effect.</p><p>Lisa Reynolds and Smitha Chadaga, Portland</p><p>Driver card bill won\u2019t legislate safety</p><p>Sarah Rohrs gets it right and gets it wrong in her recent letter (\u201cDriver\u2019s license bill would make Oregon safer,\u201d June 17): She is absolutely correct that the ability to drive legally is a core need for Oregonians. What she doesn\u2019t get, however, is that driving isn\u2019t a fundamental right. It is a privilege. The ability to drive \u201csafely\u201d also isn\u2019t a fundamental right \u2014 it is a fundamental responsibility of all drivers. House Bill 2015 won\u2019t legislate safe or responsible drivers.</p><p>David Carlson, Tigard</p><p>Rosenblum is protecting our privacy</p><p>I am proud that our state attorney general, Ellen Rosenblum, has taken a strong stance against Big Tech in favor of protecting our data privacy (\u201cOregon governor signs bill requiring \u2018reasonable security\u2019 for online gadgets,\u201d June 1). Her leadership led to the passage of House Bill 2395 that requires connected digital devices to adopt adequate security measures to ensure that our privacy and data are protected.</p><p>While there have been many stories about the federal government looking into Big Tech for antitrust violations, it has often been the states and state attorneys general that have led efforts to protect consumer privacy. It is good to see our attorney general continue in this tradition.</p><p>Here is hoping that HB 2395 is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of our attorney general protecting Oregonians against any company that would seek to misuse our private data for their benefit. If the federal government is focused on other aspects of Big Tech abuse, we need state leaders such as Rosenblum to lead the consumer protection and data privacy charge.</p><p>Matt Scott, Portland</p><p>Slow trains could be a hazard</p><p>For the life of me, I can\u2019t understand how Union Pacific gets away with holding up traffic for as long as it does. On a recent Tuesday, we sat while a train slowly came to the Southeast 11th Avenue crossing, then stopped. While it was stopped, another flew by. We sat for 30 minutes! We weren\u2019t in a hurry to get to our destination, but what about someone needing to get to an appointment? Or a medical emergency? It would seem there should be a limit to how long trains can stop traffic, but holding Union Pacific to that is probably wishful thinking. Moving the Brooklyn rail yard seems to be the only answer.</p><p>Donna Stanley, Portland</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><correction appended=\"true\"><correctionDescription><bodyText><p>Lines in kicker: 1 Lines in header: 1 Lines in subheader: 1 Lines in preface: 1 Lines in body: 0 Lines in caption: 0</p></bodyText></correctionDescription><correctionDate day=\"19\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 19, 2019</dateText></correctionDate><correctionStatusText>Correction Appended</correctionStatusText></correction></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OREGNN-MERLIN_86396612</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OREGNN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WCG-N2M1-F08V-60DR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">235910</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1367\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Oregonian All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Oregonian (Portland Oregon)</publicationName><edition>ORE - MAIN EDITION</edition><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 19, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Regulators must also address the unfair competition of tech giants that profit from media's content without investing back into journalism or abiding by advertising regulations that apply to traditional media. The next president should also work to restore net-neutrality protections to ensure a level playing field on the internet, and regulate the internet as an essential public utility.</p><p>Biden is saying good things so far. He favors net neutrality regulations created during the Obama era. His campaign pledges to use antitrust enforcement and other tools to hold big-tech companies accountable, although he's decidedly more moderate\u00a0on this front than Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who wants to break up companies.</p><p>In his foreign policy plan, Biden pledges to restore daily press briefings at the White House and departments of State and Defense. \"Our foreign policy relies on the informed consent of the American public,\" it states. The same goes for domestic policy.</p><p>Although Biden's Obama administration service is generally a selling point, that administration disappointingly did some things to undermine the press and the public's ability to learn about government misconduct. It spied on reporters, seized records from The Associated Press and prosecuted more people for leaking information to the public than all previous administrations combined.</p><p>Biden should clarify how his commitment to transparency has evolved. Perhaps, after journalists' three years of stellar public-service reporting of Trump administration havoc, he's among Democrats with a renewed appreciation of the Fourth Estate.</p><p>Biden was a strong supporter of the free and independent press during his Senate career. When the Federal Communications Commission weakened media-ownership regulations, enabling more consolidation, he co-sponsored the Media Ownership Act of 2007, an attempt to force the FCC to be more transparent and explore ways to increase the representation of women and minorities in broadcast ownership. It did not advance.</p><p>In 2008, Biden co-sponsored a Senate resolution\u00a0disapproving the FCC's media-ownership rules. It passed the Senate but did not advance in the House.</p><p>That issue has as much staying power as Biden's career. The FCC keeps hacking away at bedrock regulations intended to promote diversity, competition and localism in media, and losing court challenges. In the latest ruling, a federal court roasted the FCC in September for shoddy work analyzing the impact its rules would have on ownership diversity.</p><p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit vacated the bulk of the FCC's media-ownership rule-making over the last three years, saying \"its analysis is so insubstantial that we cannot say it provides a reliable foundation for the Commission's conclusions.\"</p><p>Meanwhile Americans are approaching the 2020 vote with a dearth of independent news organizations to counter propaganda and misinformation. That benefits unscrupulous politicos and foreign governments seeking to divide and weaken the U.S. and its democracy.</p><p>Nearly 1,800 local newspapers have been lost since 2004, creating vast news deserts across the nation. Many were shuttered as a result of consolidation that's enriching only a handful of profiteers.</p><p>Saving the free and independent press is essential and should be a priority in the campaign of Biden and every other presidential candidate.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SEATTM-fa4e7f8606ff11eab6289cab4c57cb6f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SEATTM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XH7-S891-DY2P-40GP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8206</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"640\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Seattle Times Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Seattle Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 15, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

All the same, they are launching an investigation into whether companies such as Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon are too big and too poorly regulated. NPR's Kelsey Snell reports on the challenges Congress faces as it prepares to dig deep on big tech.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">KELSEY SNELL:                 Members of Congress say they realize many Americans worry about how powerful tech companies are getting, but when they've tried to bring top executives to Washington to account for their behavior, many lawmakers have revealed just how bad they are at understanding how all of that technology works.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>TED POE:                 Does Google through this phone know that I have moved here and moved over to the left?             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 That's Texas Republican Ted Poe at a hearing last year with Google CEO Sundar Pichai. Pichai had a complicated answer, and, well, Poe was not satisfied.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>SUNDAR PICHAI:                 There may be a Google service which you've opted in to use, and if...             </p><p>TED POE:                 So Google knows that I am moving over there. It's not a trick question.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 Then there was former Utah Senator Orrin Hatch asking Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg how his business stays afloat.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>ORRIN HATCH:                 How do you sustain a business model in which users don't pay for your service?             </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG:                 Senator, we run ads.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 At the time, Poe was in his 60s, and Hatch was over 80. People said their gaffes were, well, because Congress is mostly pretty old. And that may be true, but younger members like Congressman Ro Khanna, a Democrat who represents a lot of Silicon Valley, says the problem goes deeper and can't just be blamed on age.             </p><p>RO KHANNA:                 There has been a dereliction of duty in Congress and a technological illiteracy for many years.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 Khanna is something of a tech expert in Congress in part because they're his constituents and often his donors but also because technology is simply part of the fabric of American life. And he says Congress has a history of turning a blind eye to a virtually unregulated industry.             </p><p>RO KHANNA:                 There's probably been too much of a deference to these companies in the past, but now it's led to an overreaction the other way where there's an urge to act but a lack of understanding and expertise about what is needed.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 Travis Moore is a former congressional staffer who launched an organization called TechCongress. Their goal is to send technology experts to Capitol Hill, where very few congressional staffers have any formal tech training.             </p><p>TRAVIS MOORE:                 Congress doesn't know what it doesn't know on technology. I think that's one of the fundamental challenges here - is that we need people in the building that first and foremost know the right questions to ask.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 Questions like, when does a tech company like Facebook become a dangerous monopoly, or, what does Congress do to stop foreign governments from using social media to interfere in our elections? Kristin Nicholson, the director of the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University, says congressional budget cuts combined with the huge salaries on offer in Silicon Valley make it hard for members and committees to recruit tech experts to come to Washington. And there's more at risk for lawmakers than just an embarrassing video on social media.             </p><p>KRISTIN NICHOLSON:                 We want the staff and the members that are making these billion-dollar decisions about issues that affect every member of the public to be well-informed and educated, to have the time and the resources to dive deeply into these complicated issues.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 Congress has a lot of catching up to do. They're already planning hearings on the massive and complicated task of deciding what, if anything, they should do to break up big tech.

The plan, which includes an independent regulator funded by a levy on internet companies, will be open for public comment for three months before the government publishes draft legislation.</p><p>\"No one in the world has done this before, and it's important that we get it right,\" Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright told the BBC.</p><p>While the United States has largely relied on market forces to regulate content in a country where free speech is revered, governments in Europe have signaled they are willing to take on the tech companies to block harmful content and prevent extremists from using the internet to fan the flames of hatred.</p><p>Britain will consider imposing financial penalties similar to those in the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, which permit fines of up to 4% of a company's annual worldwide revenue, Wright said. In extreme cases, the government may also seek the power to fine individual company directors and prevent companies from operating in the U.K.</p><p>Criticism of social media sites has grown amid concerns that extremists like the so-called Islamic State group or far-right political groups are using them to recruit young people, pedophiles are using the technology to groom victims and young people are sharing dangerous information about self-harm and suicide.</p><p>Australian last week made it a crime for social media platforms not to quickly remove \"abhorrent violent material.\" The crime would be punishable by three years in prison and a fine of 10.5 million Australian dollars ($7.5 million), or 10% of the platform's annual turnover, whichever is larger.</p><p>After the March 15 mosque shootings that killed 50 and wounded of 50 more, New Zealand's Privacy Commissioner wants his country to follow Australia's lead.</p><p>European Union lawmakers are set to vote later Monday on a legislative proposal requiring internet companies to remove terrorist content within one hour of being notified by authorities, or face penalties worth up to 4 percent of revenue if they don't comply.</p><p>The bill has been controversial, with some lawmakers and digital rights groups criticizing the one-hour rule. They say it places a much bigger burden on smaller internet companies than on tech giants like Facebook and Google, which have greater resources.</p><p>British Home Secretary Sajid Javid, whose department collaborated on the U.K. proposal unveiled Monday, criticized tech firms for failing to act despite repeated calls for action against harmful content.</p><p>\"That is why we are forcing these firms to clean up their act once and for all,\" Javid said.</p><p>Critics say the end result could be that Google and Facebook end up becoming the web's censors. Others suggested the rules could stifle innovation and strengthen the dominance of technology giants because smaller firms won't have the money to comply with such regulation.</p><p>\"We worry that this attempt at controlling the Internet will entrench big tech players, stymie innovation, and lead to press censorship through the back door,\" the London-based Adam Smith Institute, a free-market think tank, said in a statement.</p><p>As governments press to have the tech giants take on moral accountability, the challenge for the companies will be to translate that idea into the software, said Mark Skilton, a professor of practice at Warwick Business School. Politicians and technical experts need to work on the \"shared problem\" of providing guidance and control that is not excessively intrusive, he said.</p><p>\"Issuing large fines and hitting companies with bigger legal threats is taking a 20th century bullwhip approach to a problem that requires a nuanced solution,\" he said. \"It needs machine learning tools to manage the 21st century problems of the internet, combined with the courage and foresight to establish independent frameworks that preserve the freedoms societies enjoy in the physical world, as well as the online one.\"</p><p>Facebook's U.K. head of public policy, Rebecca Stimson, said the goal of the new rules should be to protect society while also supporting innovation and freedom of speech.</p><p>\"These are complex issues to get right and we look forward to working with the government and Parliament to ensure new regulations are effective,\" she said.</p><p>Wright insisted the regulator would be expected to take account of freedom of speech while balancing against preventing harm.</p><p>\"What we're talking about here is user-generated content, what people put online, and companies that facilitate access to that kind of material,\" he said. \"So this is not about journalism. This is about an unregulated space that we need to control better to keep people safer.\"</p><p>___</p><p>Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRETOR-109591153</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRETOR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VV9-R4K1-F091-R320-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">312439</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"898\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Independent Newspapers Pty (Ltd) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Pretoria News (South Africa)</publicationName><edition>E1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 09, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Thank you very much, Brit. Be well. Good to see.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So that's THE STORY of Tuesday, March 31st, 2020. But as always, this story goes on and on. So we will be right back here tomorrow night at seven o'clock and we will see you --</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. America's coronavirus death toll has now surpassed that of 9/11, and unfortunately tonight, that number is going up. Just a short time ago, the President warned the country to brace itself for what's about to happen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I want every American to be prepared for the hard days that lie ahead. We're going to go through a very tough two weeks, and then hopefully, as the experts are predicting, as I think a lot of us are predicting after having studied it so hard, we are going to start seeing some real light at the end of the tunnel, but this is going to be a very painful -- a very, very painful two weeks.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Ominous. The key question, of course, though, is after two weeks what happens then? And the short answer is nobody really knows. But we're hoping tonight that the numbers will give us some clear picture of that and to get the latest numbers and an idea of where things are headed, we go now to chief breaking news correspondent, Trace Gallagher. Hey, Trace.</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF BREAKING NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Tucker. As the President's Coronavirus Task Force has repeatedly said, the numbers coming from these projections, models are very fluid and very likely to change, but right now, projections from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington show that the overall U.S. will see the peak of the virus on April 15th, and that COVID- 19 deaths could be as high as 84,000.</p><p>In New York, the hardest hit U.S. state, the peak is projected on April 9th, with the highest death toll of 827 coming on April 10th, and the overall death toll in New York at just under 16,000, but the projected numbers don't show California peaking until April 27th with an overall death toll of just about 5,000.</p><p>But I want to put this on the screen as well. Up until just a few minutes ago, California had just 205 new cases today with four more deaths today. Even Dr. Deborah Birx today noted that California's social distancing appears to be paying dividends with other states. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. DEBORAH BIRX, WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE COORDINATOR: Washington State early, about two weeks before New York or New Jersey, California a week before New York or New Jersey really talked to their communities and decided to mitigate before they started seeing this number of cases, and now we know that that makes a big difference.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GALLAGHER; Yes, you mentioned Washington State. Finally, the Seattle area where 37 of the nation's first 50 deaths happened is also seeing a big payoff because of social distancing. There is now significant evidence that the virus has slowed in recent days and deaths, not nearly as fast as in other states -- Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Finally some good news. Trace Gallagher for us. Thank you so much for that.</p><p>GALLAGHER: You bet.</p><p>CARLSON: Well last night, we showed you the video and it was nauseating of senior World Health Organization official, Bruce Aylward, a Canadian, refusing to answer questions about Taiwan and how it was dealing with coronavirus.</p><p>In fact, Aylward wouldn't even acknowledge the question or acknowledge the existence of Taiwan. It was repulsive. But it wasn't surprising.</p><p>Aylward was just following directions from the very top. Tedros Adhanom, he is the Director General of the World Health Organization got his job with Chinese support after he covered up cholera outbreaks in his home country, a perfect man to lead the World Health Organization and he has subsequently set the standard for corruption there.</p><p>Here he is in January. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEDROS ADHANOM GHEBREYESUS, DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION: The Chinese government is to be congratulated for the extraordinary measures it has taken to contain the outbreak.</p><p>The speed with which China detected the outbreak, isolated the virus, sequenced the genome and shared it with W.H.O. and the world are very impressive and beyond words.</p><p>China is actually setting a new standard for outbreak response, and it's not an exaggeration.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: That's the top public health official in the world and everything you just heard him say there was a lie. A recent \"60 Minutes\" piece from Australia, a piece our media are not playing shows just how deep the lies go.</p><p>In fact, there's nothing speedy about how China detected the outbreak and then warned the world. Indeed, they did the exact opposite.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: From the very beginning throughout December, it was spreading. And we now know it was spreading human to human.</p><p>But the official line of the Chinese government was that this was all related to an animal market, and once they closed the market, it would all go away.</p><p>QUESTION: Did they know differently at that time?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Absolutely. Because they were seeing cases coming into the hospitals that had nothing whatsoever to do with that animal market.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: So the World Health Organization's leadership tells you that China \"set the standard\" for the outbreak to the response. Apparently, that standard includes disappearing doctors who tell the truth about it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: As China now tries to rewrite history and claim it was transparent all along, a final nail in the coffin of their lie.</p><p>Just two weeks ago, the Head of Emergency at Wuhan Central Hospital, Dr. Ai Fen also went public, saying authorities had stopped her and her colleagues from warning the world. She has now disappeared. Whereabouts unknown.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Again, why is it left to Australian media to produce a piece like this? The truth is as \"60 Minutes Australia\" explains, instead of worrying about these developments in early February, the Director of the World Health Organization was still lecturing the public that using terms like Wuhan virus was racist.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ADHANOM GHEBREYESUS: Having a name matters to prevent the use of other names that can be inaccurate or stigmatizing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: You might think that a World Health Organization group that got $58 million of your tax dollars last year might care that a government arrest doctors and lies about deadly new diseases, but no, like so many other organizations, they are lapdogs for the powerful and that means their real job is sucking up to the Chinese government.</p><p>And speaking of the Chinese government, on February 6th, scientists from the South China University of Technology uploaded a paper on the origins of coronavirus. Where did it come from? Well, this offers some clue.</p><p>At the time, the official death toll in China from the coronavirus was 564. The paper made a number of notable observations and claims that are worth knowing about, that's what we're telling you.</p><p>We want to be clear that we're not endorsing any of these conclusions. We haven't independently confirmed them. We can't.</p><p>But you should keep in mind as you hear this that these findings come from Chinese scientists who work for a university that is controlled by the Chinese government.</p><p>So whatever else they are, the views you're about to hear are probably not racist anti-Chinese propaganda. Here's what the paper says.</p><p>First, the scientists confirmed what scientists around the world have said they believe. The virus most likely came from an animal known as the intermediate horseshoe bat.</p><p>Here's the striking thing. There are no known colonies of this bat within 900 kilometers of Wuhan, nor is there any evidence that they were sold in the Wuhan wet market, despite many claims in the American media to the country, including on this show, by the way.</p><p>Last night we did a segment on wet markets, the one in Wuhan included and suggested that this bat was sold there.</p><p>But let's be clear, the only actual analysis of that question that we're aware of is in this paper.</p><p>These scientists interviewed almost 60 people, 59 of them who frequented the Wuhan wet market. They confirm there were no horseshoe bats for sale there. Period.</p><p>So that raises the question, where did the virus carrying bats come from? The paper says this, \"We screened the area around the market and identified two laboratories conducting research on bat coronavirus.\"</p><p>Within a few hundred yards of the wet market was something called the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention. According to public reports, the Center used intermediate horseshoe bats for research.</p><p>Then about seven miles away was another facility. This one was called the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The Virology Institute also conducted research on intermediate horseshoe bats, the ones that were not sold at the wet market.</p><p>South China University scientists concluded that the coronavirus pandemic, the one that people are dying from here, likely came from one of these to government labs in Wuhan.</p><p>They noticed that a scientist at the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention had been exposed to the blood and urine of horseshoe bats. They also suggested that infected tissue samples from research animals may have wound up in the Wuhan wet market.</p><p>And they ended the paper this way, \"The killer coronavirus probably originated from a laboratory in Wuhan. Safety levels may need to be reinforced in high risk biohazardous laboratories. Regulations may be taken to relocate these laboratories, far away from city centers and other densely populated places.\"</p><p>How is that for interesting? Now, this paper has been online for nearly two months and so far it has been virtually ignored in this country. Almost nobody in American journalism has dared to write about it. The few who have were immediately attacked as dangerous conspiracy theorists.</p><p>Instead of assessing what seemed like the rational conclusions presented in the Chinese paper, there was a spate of American news stories and academic research designed to show that the coronavirus absolutely could not have been engineered in a Chinese lab.</p><p>They sounded supremely confident of that. But do they really know it? And the answer is no, they don't.</p><p>As a factual matter, it is impossible for Western scientists to settle the question either way. So instead of doing that or admitting that, they amped up the rhetoric hoping that you wouldn't notice the difference.</p><p>A post on the National Institutes of Health website written by N.I.H. Director Francis Collins himself dismisses any such speculation as, \"outrageous.\"</p><p>Keep in mind, N.I.H. is supposed to be keeping you safe from diseases like this one, not running political interference for hostile foreign governments.</p><p>This is how they're spending their time as Americans die in the middle of a global pandemic, and still no one addressed the substance of the claims.</p><p>The South China University paper concludes it the virus probably escaped accidentally from a lab in Wuhan. It said not one word about bio weapons. Yet the N.I.H. and \"USA Today\" and countless other outlets have devoted thousands of words to scolding you for thinking that virus may have been a form of biological warfare.</p><p>Notice that's a totally different claim than the one made in the paper, and that's not accidental. One of the surest signs that people are lying to you is when they answer questions you didn't ask and that's exactly what the professional class is doing with this story. And they're doing it on many fronts. They're lying to you.</p><p>They're claiming to know things they don't know. They're dismissing the obvious as impossible. They're blaming you for their failures, and the media are helping them do it.</p><p>The stakes are too high to let them continue this way. So no matter what, stay skeptical as you assess the world, remain rational. Gather your own evidence and come to your own conclusions.</p><p>You shouldn't have to do that. You ought to be able to trust the people in charge. But you can't.</p><p>So at this point, you have no choice.</p><p>Dozens of sailors have come down with coronavirus on one of this country's most powerful war vessels. Could that tell us something about how easily the virus spreads? A live report and our own Dr. Marc Siegel, straight ahead.</p><p>CARLSON: Reports tonight that about 200 sailors aboard an American aircraft carrier have been infected with coronavirus. Another Captain is begging for help. Fox's Matt Finn is here live with more on that story. Hey, Matt.</p><p>MATT FINN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Tucker, the USS Theodore Roosevelt will be sidelined in Guam for at least the next couple of weeks to test up to 5,000 crew members on board.</p><p>The U.S. Navy is testing at least 200 of the 5,000 sailors per day. The testing is quickly ramping up. About 700 sailors so far have been tested.</p><p>Our Fox News Pentagon correspondent Lucas Tomlinson reports the spike in cases on board this single aircraft carrier represents up to 30 percent of the U.S. Military's total number of coronavirus cases worldwide.</p><p>Acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly tells Fox News taking the aircraft carrier out of commission will have huge implications in the coming weeks. The vessel has weapons and expensive aircrafts on board, but Modly says, the U.S. has at least 100 ships at sea at any given time and people should feel comfortable that America has other ways to respond to aggression, if needed.</p><p>There are two other aircraft carriers deployed right now, the U.S. Harry S. Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower. Both are currently in the Arabian Sea keeping watch over Iran.</p><p>This is a developing story and we'll bring you the latest numbers from that aircraft carrier -- Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Thanks a lot. Matt Finn for us. And those numbers are big, which leads the question how and why is coronavirus spreading so quickly? And one reason might be that it lingers in the air for some time.</p><p>Now, if that's true, then masks, of course would be a useful way to prevent spreading it. Somehow though our health authorities, and this includes the Surgeon General continue to downplay the effectiveness of masks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. JEROME ADAMS, U.S. SURGEON GENERAL: That World Health Organization and the C.D.C. have reaffirmed in the last few days is that they do not recommend the general public wear mask.</p><p>Wearing a mask improperly can actually increase your risk of getting disease. It can also give you a false sense of security, and you see many of these pictures with people out and about sick closer than six feet to each other, but still wearing a mask.</p><p>So we want to make sure we are reserving PPE for the people who most need it. That's how you're going to get the largest effects because if health care workers get sick, they can't take care of you when you get sick.</p><p>BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Do you want to put that aside for healthcare workers, get that, but if it could actually help us, we would love to know, but --</p><p>ADAMS: But again, the data doesn't show that it helps individuals.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: It'd be interesting to hear someone explain slowly and clearly how exactly wearing a mask \"improperly\" would, \"increase your risk of getting infected.\"</p><p>But it's not an academic question, really. It's a question that could affect millions. So who is right on this?</p><p>Our health authorities or countries like South Korea and Taiwan, where apparently the coronavirus spread is being kept in check, at least in part for the mass wearing of masks.</p><p>Dr. Marc Siegel is a Fox medical contributor. He joins us tonight to help sort this out. Hey, Doctor.</p><p>DR. MARC SIEGEL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR: Hi, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: So this question of how effective masks are for non-experts, and let me just stipulate at the outset, no one would ever, I don't think, no one really want to take masks from healthcare workers who have to be our priority, obviously.</p><p>But all things being equal, why are they telling us that masks don't help non healthcare workers?</p><p>SIEGEL: Well, first of all, I would start with that exact point you made. You have to make sure that healthcare workers have enough masks.</p><p>CARLSON: Of course.</p><p>SIEGEL: That there's enough in the hospitals and I'm not just talking about the N-95 respirators, I'm talking about the surgical masks. If healthcare workers are taken care of, then we have to consider the general public and here's what I would say about that.</p><p>If the mask is used properly, I certainly want anybody that's coughing or sneezing or has any health issues going on to be wearing a mask. I want anyone that's immunocompromised or with chronic health problems to wear a mask.</p><p>What about the general public? Well, here's the answer. The mask has to be fit on Tucker just like this snugly. There can't be any areas where there's any exposure. You have to understand that if you're touching the mass too easily, you then have to wash your hands very thoroughly afterwards and wash your face.</p><p>CARLSON: Okay.</p><p>SIEGEL: So this all has to do with proper use of the mask.</p><p>CARLSON: Okay, I heard one emergency physician say that wearing the mask might remind people not to touch their faces, which I think we've all -- it's been established as one of the main routes of transmission -- face touching. Do you think that's a valid point?</p><p>SIEGEL: Yes, I think that that's a valid point. I think that if you actually have the mask on, you might not use your -- you might not touch your face as often.</p><p>But here's the main point I need to make. That there's a lot more of this virus in the air and on surfaces, and it's a lot more contagious than we realized.</p><p>Before I said not to use a mask, I'm starting to rethink this now because I'm starting to realize that it is way more contagious than we realized.</p><p>So I think that Europe may be heading in the right direction. I think South Korea may have been right. I think if people use the mask properly, then it may be a good idea.</p><p>In closed quarters, when you're close together with people, not walking down the street, but when you're in close quarters, so I'm starting to rethink this.</p><p>CARLSON: So you're -- you've just -- and we'll end with this -- but you're making now a point that you have made from day one, which is, everybody who is following this is learning as we go. None of it was clear at first. The outlines are now becoming clear and it is just important to admit that, I think, always and I mean, I'm stealing a line from you, but I agree with you.</p><p>SIEGEL: And social distancing, is it really working on its own? We need an additional device to use besides social distancing. Here's the most important point of all, Tucker. You may be having this virus and not even know you have it.</p><p>You may find out about it days later, and then you may say, who did I expose to it? If I wear the mask, I would decrease what I'm spewing to other people.</p><p>Since we don't find out until after the fact since the testing is imperfect, we may need to use the mask as an additional device to cause more separation. I think it will decrease spread if it's used properly.</p><p>CARLSON: Dr. Siegel, thanks for that update. Great to see you tonight.</p><p>SIEGEL: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: A story that we've been covering since the beginning because it's important. Local governments have been stepping back law enforcement and releasing criminals from jail.</p><p>Now a Virginia store employee faces decades in prison for defending his store from a robbery. He is now sitting in jail with no bail. His boss is furious and you may be too after you hear him next.</p><p>CARLSON: In the last two weeks, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has become the most high profile Democrat in America. His daily briefings are playing to a national audience on television.</p><p>He's made tough announcements like banning everyone in the state from holding non-essential gatherings. Thanks to Cuomo's skill at press conferences. He is closer to the center of this world changing story than almost anyone in his party. Closer than Nancy Pelosi, closer than Chuck Schumer, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.</p><p>Cuomo is far closer than supposed presumptive nominee Joe Biden. Biden has practically vanished from public view and that's both by design and sadly by necessity.</p><p>Suddenly Andrew Cuomo who has never run for President and would never win a normal primary in a normal year is suddenly being widely talked about as President, and other Democrats are watching this happen. They now all want to be Andrew Cuomo and you can tell.</p><p>Yesterday, Governor Klan robes blackface of Virginia ordered everyone in the state to shelter in place and not go outside except for essential errands.</p><p>That order lasts until June 10th. June 10th is 71 days from now. We have literally no clue what the world will look like in 71 days. And yet Governor Blackface claims he plans to keep his state's population home until then.</p><p>And to show he means it, he is warning that anyone who goes outside improperly or hosts a private gathering of more than 10 people will be fined or jailed. Message: I'm not the sniveling moral coward I appear to be in fact, I am strong and decisive like Andrew Cuomo.</p><p>Meanwhile, other deeply mediocre politicians including Mayor Muriel Bowser of Washington, D.C. are doing the same. Bowser is threatening otherwise law-abiding citizens with jail time if they violate her command to stay inside.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAYOR MURIEL BOWSER (D), WASHINGTON, D.C.: We don't expect that we will have to issue any fines and jail penalties because we expect to the people of the District of Columbia to comply.</p><p>We do of course have penalties at our disposal, but I don't expect that we will have to use them. That's certainly my hope.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, please. She can't even pave the streets. But you're seeing threats like this all of a sudden everywhere.</p><p>In Washington State, Governor Jay Inslee is holding press conferences announcing that people who go outside without permission will be jailed. Businesses that open improperly will have their licenses revoked.</p><p>So think about this for a minute. Democratic leaders are threatening normal people with jail time for going outside. But at the same time, they're letting actual criminals out of prison in very large numbers.</p><p>From Cleveland to Philadelphia to California to Washington, D.C., officials are releasing inmates from jail and also ordering police to scale back radically in some cases any law enforcement.</p><p>In New York, convicted sex offenders are going free. In King County, officials plan release hundreds of inmates. Maybe they'll be resettled in the homes of law-abiding people arrested for going outside. In fact now, that we've mentioned it, they probably will.</p><p>In early March, Bill de Blasio told New Yorkers to hit the movie theaters rather than worry about coronavirus. Now, according to \"The New York Post,\" de Blasio's administration wants to release Jose Gonzalez, a man accused of murdering an EMT by stealing her ambulance and running her over.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Seattle, habitual criminal Francisco Calderon threatened to stab two men with the syringe. Can you imagine? And it was merely the latest in a very long list of crimes. But thanks to coronavirus, police released him almost immediately after arresting him. He is likely to go on to commit more crimes.</p><p>Jason Rantz is a Seattle area radio show host and we're happy to have him tonight. Jason, good to see you. So you're hearing people, notably the mayor of Washington, D.C., widely mocked by people who actually live there, announcing people who violate her orders will be imprisoned, but at the same time, they're letting actual criminals out of prison. What do you make of this?</p><p>JASON RANTZ, SEATTLE RADIO SHOW HOST: It's absurd. It's some news media that is covering a whole lot of stuff having to do with the coronavirus, which means there are some ideologues who are basically able to sneak in some of these social justice causes.</p><p>Remember, you've got politicians from Washington State to Washington, D.C. that believe that the justice system is inherently racist, that it goes after communities of color, that cops are all evil.</p><p>And so now that you have an actual tragedy that's taking place across the country, both from a health perspective, but also an economic perspective, people aren't necessarily paying as close attention to some of these pet projects that a lot of these politicians want to push forward.</p><p>I mean, the case that you mentioned, Francisco Calderon, that's the 75th time he has been convicted about a month ago -- two months ago. Now, he gets caught again and almost immediately re-released out into the public.</p><p>This is a person who is going to commit a murder, and only then will politicians here in Seattle give a damn. And it's the same all across the country and that is a shame.</p><p>CARLSON: It's just a tragedy that America is facing this crisis at exactly the same time the worst people on the planet are in charge of so many places -- the most frivolous, the dumbest, the most narcissistic people ever to lead anything are running our cities. How did that happen?</p><p>RANTZ: Well, and it's worse than that, too, because remember, as we are saying we're going to release some prisoners from jail as we're not going to book most misdemeanor charges, we are also closing down gun shops because we're calling them non-essential.</p><p>We're also closing down offices within different counties for people to apply for a concealed carry permit. So we're not even being allowed to protect ourselves. And we got here because a lot of big cities are run by progressive politicians with a younger demographic that are out there actually voting these people into office. Part of me says we're bringing this on ourselves.</p><p>Now, it's not the fault of the folks who obviously don't back these politicians, but I do think that this should be another wakeup call that elections matter.</p><p>And they are coming into November. They're trying to defeat President Trump. That means a whole bunch of other politicians who are progressives are counting on that anger coming into the ballot box which means we all need to vote. And we need to make sure we're keeping bad politicians out of place. And we need to shine a spotlight on these issues.</p><p>When we tweeted out this story on Francisco Calderon, they quickly started to change their tune on it, and we've got to do that. It's up to us.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, yes, I mean, in many ways, this stuff matters much more. You know, you can be mad about what's happening nationally, but if they are letting rapists in your neighborhood, you know, that really matters.</p><p>Jason, thank you for your updates on this stuff. Appreciate it.</p><p>RANTZ: Thank you for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, in Virginia Governor Klan robes blackface is threatening people with jail time for going outside. But that's not the only offense against justice in his state.</p><p>Early Sunday morning, three men broke into a store in Arlington, Virginia right across the river from Washington. An employee who was living inside the store at the time, partly out of fears of getting infected with coronavirus opened fire on the burglars wounding one of them, non-fatally but wounding him.</p><p>Happy ending, you'd think so? Not in Arlington. Prosecutors there have arrested the man. He is being held without bail. He faces charges that could place them in prison for up to 20 years. Again, he is in jail now without bail.</p><p>Jowan Zuber is that man's boss and we're happy to have him on tonight. Mr. Zuber, thank you so much for coming on. So is there anything -- we just described what happened? Are we missing anything? Your employee was in the store. These guys broke in. He shot one. Correct?</p><p>JOWAN ZUBER, ARLINGTON SMOKE SHOP OWNER: Correct and they had broken into the store, three men would mask on. The neighbor upstairs said when they broke the window, it sound like a car smashing into the store.</p><p>Hamza, the employee, he said it sounded like a shotgun. And when he woke up, he said he just reached for the pistol and opened the door and shot three times to scare them, and one of them hit the suspect.</p><p>And what happened after that, when the police came, we thought we're in the right. Three masked men, 4:30 a.m. on a Sunday morning, how can we -- so I was watching Hamza across the street with boxers on with a tank top in cold weather, 40 degrees. The cops treating us like we're the ones who caused the harm.</p><p>This is very sad for America today as an American citizen practicing Second Amendment to protect the store and the lives and not only that, the people upstairs.</p><p>Do you know what the police officers told him? Why didn't you run out the back door? And guess what?</p><p>CARLSON: That's disgusting.</p><p>ZUBER: When we checked in the back door, there was a book bag with two rocks and a pole -- and the pole, what they were going to do with that?</p><p>And if he would have ran out the back, he would have met up with the three masked men and there, he probably would have shot all three of them. Then what? He would do 60 years in jail?</p><p>I mean, this is absurd, because we went to visit him and tried to get him bond out. $25,000.00 bond out and the prosecutor appealed it, so we've got to go back tomorrow and unfortunately, it's very sad that I heard him coughing very hard in jail, which makes me think you're supposed to keep people safe. Keep people away from jail anywhere in one place so they don't get sick.</p><p>This is very sad practice in your rights in the United States of America. I was born in Arlington. I pay taxes. The gun is registered. Everything is perfect, but I can't believe as an American citizen we are being treated like this and this gets the criminals out there. Hey, we could go rob stuff. Kill people and hurt people.</p><p>And guess what? People have got to run out the back door.</p><p>This is mind boggling. I just can't understand that. I've been stressed. I've been reaching out.</p><p>I've been getting so many support from Arlington community, from the veterans, from people. Many people are just coming to the store. They want to like hug me. They can't believe this is happening.</p><p>What is this? I am honestly still in shock. We need justice and Arlington County could really bring justice and show the American people that you are safe in your house, you could protect your house.</p><p>What are people doing at 4:30 a.m. when everybody know they're supposed to be home, whether -- and plus, we didn't know they were juveniles with masks on? Where are their parents? I don't understand this. The whole thing is unbelievable.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, it is irrelevant. It's totally -- it's totally irrelevant. Let me just ask you, I can't remember a story that has made me this mad as this one and I appreciate you're so clearly describing what happened and by the way, we support cops reflexively on this show.</p><p>ZUBER: I love cops.</p><p>CARLSON: But if the police officer said that, I wish I knew that cop's name because he should be ashamed of what he said. And same with the prosecutor.</p><p>But let me ask you one last question. Does your employee who is rotting in jail with no bail and coughing, does he have a family?</p><p>ZUBER: Yes, he has a five-year-old daughter, a nine-year-old son that he was supposed to see on Sunday because that is his day off and it's very sad. You know, it makes me want to -- and his wife is calling -- all his family is calling. This is a hard time in America.</p><p>And being an American citizen and standing up for your rights, it's -- I can't believe it, he has been in jail for three days already. It's -- I think the judge --</p><p>CARLSON: It's unbelievable. And I hope the prosecutor is watching this and I hope everyone in Arlington is watching this, and I hope justice is done, and I hope you'll come back and tell us what happened. Jowan, thank you for joining us tonight.</p><p>ZUBER: Thank so much. Appreciate it. God bless.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you. God bless. Well, you know that restaurants and retail outlets are being particularly hit hard by the economic contraction, people can't work.</p><p>But there's another industry, one that is absolutely critical to this country, no matter what they tell you, that is suffering as much and it's America's energy sector.</p><p>It really is. And the implications are profound for all of us. Rick Perry joins us after the break to discuss.</p><p>But first, coronavirus is still ravaging New York City and that means the streets are as quiet as they've maybe ever been. Our latest footage comes from Nathan Furniss tonight.</p><p>CARLSON: No show on television I think it is fair to say has mocked CNN anchor Chris Cuomo more often or more gleefully than this one has, but tonight, we're going to take a break from that.</p><p>This morning, Cuomo announced that like so many thousands of other people in New York, he has been infected with the coronavirus.</p><p>Cuomo said he's had a fever and shortness of breath, but that his main worry was infecting his wife and children. Those are the right priorities.</p><p>Coumo said he will continue to do his show for as long as he can in isolation from his basement, and we respect that, too. So Godspeed to the Coumo family. We are rooting for you.</p><p>Coronavirus is hitting America's economy in a bad way, but it's crushing our one thriving energy sector which is in a lot of ways the core of our economy, no matter what they tell you.</p><p>Earlier this month, Saudi Arabia began an oil price war with Russia and that sent the price of oil crashing. Now widespread shutdowns mean fewer cars on the road, fewer flights, less industrial activity.</p><p>All of that means less demand for oil, lower prices and bad news for America's energy producers. It means good news for you if you use gasoline, and we're for that completely.</p><p>But what would happen if our energy sector collapsed? That's something we may need to think about. It's a big question.</p><p>Rick Perry spent close to three years as the President's Secretary of Energy, of course, he was governor for three terms in one of our biggest oil producing states, Texas. We're happy to have him tonight. Governor, thanks so much for coming on.</p><p>RICK PERRY, FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF ENERGY: Good to be with you.</p><p>CARLSON: So it seems pretty clear that the energy sector is really threatened, and almost nobody reflexively supports oil companies, refiners or whatever, but this seems like a real threat. What would happen if that sector collapsed?</p><p>PERRY: Yes, well, Tucker, I think it's important for your viewers to take into account is what does it -- what is the energy industry? Who is the energy industry?</p><p>And it's the union workers in Pennsylvania, it's the union workers down in the Texas Gulf Coast. It's those workers out in the Permian Basin up in the Bakken in North Dakota, Pennsylvania. Again, the pipeline workers out there.</p><p>I mean, there's this host of Americans who, their entire future, taking care of their family, paying their mortgages is tied directly to the energy industry.</p><p>It's a driver of a massive amount of our American economy. Yes, there are some big companies out there, there's independents out there that are the real buffer.</p><p>But here's what you need to keep in mind. If we were to lose those independent operators and we're on the verge, let me tell you, our capacity is full. The Saudis are flooding this market with cheap oil.</p><p>And I'm telling you, we're on the verge of a massive collapse of an industry that we worked awfully hard over the course of the last three or four years to build up to be number one oil and gas producing country in the world, giving Americans some affordable energy resources.</p><p>If we were to lose that, if we woke up a year from now, and there were five big companies, because all of these independents were gone out of business, and then there's a company called Aramco, a company called Rosneft, the Russians; ExxonMobil, and Chevron and maybe BP.</p><p>If that's it, then I would suggest that would make a lot of Americans really nervous that that's the only thing between them --</p><p>CARLSON: Well, I agree. I agree with that. And may I interrupt you and just go back to something you said, which is baffling. So the industry is on the verge really of a collapse, and yet we're being flooded with foreign oil. Our refiners are being flooded with foreign oil, why are we allowing that?</p><p>PERRY: So you bring up an incredibly important issue. Here's what I would do, and I certainly would give this advice to the President. It is, I would, for the next 60 to 90 days, not from now on, but for the next 60 to 90 days, I would say refiners, we're going to refine U.S. crude. U.S. crude only.</p><p>And that would give a buffer to the market. It would send a clear message that we're just not going to let foreign oil flow in here, bust our energy industry. And here's the more important thing, Tucker, I think that not only your viewers, but everyone in the administration, I think knows well, but I want to reiterate this, this is about our national security.</p><p>This is about Americans ability to defend ourselves. If our independent operators who have led the shale revolution, who have made America number one oil and gas producing country in the world, if we lost that, we'd go back to 1974-1975.</p><p>I was a pilot of the United States Air Force in that period of time. I remember what that was like, where we were beholden to countries that didn't necessarily have our best interest in mind --</p><p>CARLSON: Of course.</p><p>PERRY: We cannot afford that again.</p><p>CARLSON: Of course. And I don't know why we would allow our fake allies, the Saudis, to flood our market right now and I hope that your recommendation is acted upon.</p><p>Mr. Secretary, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>PERRY: And I hope we'll talk about maybe the Treasury Department buying oil futures. I think all of these things make a lot of -- stay the American energy industry that we worked so hard to build up.</p><p>CARLSON: Great to see you. Thank you for that.</p><p>PERRY: You bet.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, you've been told by your media that it was bigoted to worry about coronavirus. Calm down, racist. Now, they want to use the pandemic to get veto power over what you're allowed to talk about. They're using this crisis. We'll tell you how in just a minute.</p><p>But first to deserted Los Angeles tonight. This is from Fox's Kyle Rothenberg.</p><p>CARLSON: Protecting the public from this pandemic is more complex than almost anything we do as a country. Several months in, there's still a huge amount we don't know about coronavirus. We don't know how easily it spreads, how long it can survive outside the body.</p><p>We don't know what the real death rate is. We don't know how many people currently have it, or how many have had it and recovered and most importantly, we don't know the best way to treat it.</p><p>Those are some of the things we don't know and we should never be embarrassed to admit that. All scientific advances come from conceding ignorance. That's always the critical first step in discovery.</p><p>Admit what you don't know. Observe. Test. Test again and compare. Never allow your preconceptions to influence the results. That's called the scientific method. It works. It's why the average life expectancy is no longer 42.</p><p>Unfortunately, Western media companies are not pro-science at the moment, they're opposed to science. It means losing control. They see their job not encouraging the kind of robust and open-minded debate that yields scientific breakthroughs, but instead as guardians of stale conventional wisdom, the Praetorian Guard of the discredited professional class.</p><p>For example, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro recently questioned the value of quarantine. Bolsonaro argued that the coronavirus is less deadly than we thought that keeping the economy from crashing is a more important goal and that isolation should be practiced only for people at risk.</p><p>Now, of course Bolsonaro could be completely wrong about that. He might also be completely right. We don't know. Nobody does.</p><p>But Big Tech does not believe you should be allowed to think about this. So Twitter has already deleted Bolsonaro's comments. The other tech monopolies have followed suit. They claim Bolsonaro contradicted official public health guidelines -- consider that.</p><p>Official public health guidelines. The U.S. government has spent weeks telling you that masks don't protect the public from coronavirus. That is a lie. It's also an official public health guideline.</p><p>In mid-January, the World Health Organization told you that China had determined the virus couldn't be spread from person to person. That was a lie, too. It killed tens of thousands of people, another public health guidelines.</p><p>Should Twitter have censored anyone who disagreed with it? If it happened today, they would have censored anyone who disagreed with it.</p><p>At the moment, Twitter is censoring comments that say unapproved things about hydroxychloroquine. It's the antimalarial drug that has shown some promise. Is the drug known for certain to be effective? No, it's not. But some doctors and researchers on the front lines think it works and they're treating patients with it right now. The F.D.A. just approved it.</p><p>Yet because the media are partisan and stupid, their position is hydroxychloroquine doesn't work and can never work and if you disagree with that, we will make you shut up.</p><p>That's the Middle Age's position on science. Free inquiry is scary and must be suppressed. They're doing it now on the largest scale in history and they're not likely to stop.</p><p>It's just too tempting to use a crisis to achieve your political objectives. Soon, they'll be telling you that Fox News, not China caused this pandemic. In fact, many are saying that now.</p><p>How long before they start claiming that in the name of public health, Fox News must be suppressed? Paranoid? Okay. You watch, that'll happen.</p><p>Harmeet Dhillon is an attorney. She serves on the President's 2020 Advisory Council. She joins us tonight. Harmeet, thanks so much for coming on.</p><p>HARMEET DHILLON, ATTORNEY: Hi, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: It seems like efforts to censor opinion -- opinion that falls outside the boundaries set by the professional class is more aggressive than ever. You've been following this for a long time. Is that true?</p><p>DHILLON: Oh, absolutely. Tucker, you mentioned some examples just now. It's only a couple of days ago that they were censoring people for reporting that a drug that has been approved by the F.D.A. is a hopeful alternative to suffering and dying from this disease.</p><p>But at the same time, if the Chinese government spreads absolute gaslighting propaganda about this disease originating not in Wuhan where we all know that it did, but actually by the United States military bringing it to China, that's A-okay in Twitter's worldview, and they have some gobbledygook explanation as to why they're allowing certain world leaders stating certain viewpoints to continue to spread false propaganda on an American company's medium.</p><p>Whereas people speaking truth who are Americans, but unpopular with the mainstream media and the social media czars are allowed to be treated differently. It's absolutely Orwellian.</p><p>CARLSON: How can you innovate? How can you practice the scientific method when opinions that fall outside prescribed guidelines are banned?</p><p>DHILLON: Well, we certainly -- I hope -- certainly hope that we aren't practicing our science through Twitter. But information is very important in a crisis like this.</p><p>The government relies on the consent of those who are being governed and so, if the populace is being fed total propaganda from foreign nationals trying to manipulate our public opinion, which is absolutely what's happening according to not Fox News, or you or I, but ProPublica, then, you know, it's a very dangerous situation and they're deliberately doing this.</p><p>It's been documented that China is doing this and they're being allowed to do it by Twitter and by the other social media companies. You may ask yourself, why? Well, the answer is big dollar signs.</p><p>These companies are desperate to break into China. They're currently banned from China, even though Twitter has over 10 million users there. And these American corporations want to -- they are globalists. They are pushing a global agenda and they want to make sure that when the time comes for China to be open to them, they aren't on the wrong side of China's propaganda arm and the Chinese government.</p><p>CARLSON: That's totally right.</p><p>DHILLON: So that's why they're allowing this, but it could have health consequences here, Tucker, if people are getting wrong information, supposing they're telling people that hydrochloroquine doesn't work and Chinese bots are out there telling people they'll die if they take that, well, that could happen the way that these rules are being applied. And yet they're being allowed to get away with it.</p><p>CARLSON: It seems frightening.</p><p>DHILLON: Absolutely.</p><p>CARLSON: If Fox News and this show were under the control of Google, we would have been silenced and pulled off the air a long time ago. You can bet money on that. Harmeet, great to see you tonight. Thank you.</p><p>DHILLON: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: That's it for us tonight. Stay in touch with the ones you love. We'll see you tomorrow. Sean Hannity takes over now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2020033101cb260</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YJN-JBJ1-DXH2-633G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7526\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 31, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show &lt;Head Coronavirus Death Toll Surpasses 9/11;

I\u2019m not about to tell anyone that smoking\u2019s a good habit. We all know better, and I\u2019m a retired registered nurse. I\u2019ve probably seen more damage from smoking than the average bloke.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But I also know that there are folks out there who\u2019ve struggled with addiction, poverty, bad breaks, unhealthy and dangerous neighborhoods and a whole lot of other ills, and sometimes a smoke is the only pleasure left that helps them get through the day. These are not powerful people \u2014 they sure didn\u2019t set up the PERS system \u2014 and it\u2019s almost too easy to tax cigarettes again and again.</p><p>So how about a shift? How about a latte tax, like maybe a buck per drink? That would hit a completely different population. Don\u2019t we all have kids and grandkids in the school system? Haven\u2019t we all seen other state functions that are breaking down for lack of funds? I\u2019m just asking everyone to think outside the box here. This problem is too big, too horrendous to ignore. I\u2019ll leave it to others to point fingers of blame. Meanwhile, taxing our nicotine addicts over and over is a tired idea. And, it seems to me, one without much mercy behind it.</p><p>Catherine R. Smith, Happy Valley</p><p>Collusion evidence is strong</p><p>I wish everybody would stop saying \u201cno collusion.\u201d It should be \u201cno criminal collusion.\u201d</p><p>There is evidence of collusion all over the place. Paul Manafort gave polling data to a Russian known to have intelligence ties while he was campaign chairman. That is collusion! The fact that it was offered at all, regardless of what was done with it, is collusion. Why is that act not criminal?</p><p>Numerous people from the campaign have been charged, convicted or pleaded guilty to lying to federal officers about contacts with Russians. That is also collusion! Manafort even continued to lie about this particular act and voided an agreement from prosecutors to seek a lighter sentence.</p><p>Why all the lying, by so many people, including the president of the United States, if there is nothing there?</p><p>Mark Tompkins, Newberg</p><p>Replace Trump and Merkley</p><p>We are now in the post-Mueller report revelations era, and America largely wants to move on. Despite the predicted demise of Trump not occurring (reminding us of end-of-the-world doomsday prophets), Oregon\u2019s junior U.S. senator, Jeff Merkley, has on display in bold relief his pathological hatred of all things Trump, notwithstanding an election and another on the distant horizon.</p><p>Merkley\u2019s small, obsessive attitude rivals Donald Trump\u2019s utter lack of humility in its repugnance. Merkley\u2019s demagogic tirades are an embarrassment to the memory of all of the giants of Oregon politics (Democrats and Republicans) preceding him. And I\u2019m getting real tired of Rep. Earl Blumenauer\u2019s arrogance as well \u2014 so emblematic of what happens in an overwhelmingly safe district.</p><p>As a fourth-generation Oregonian, I can only hope and pray that 2020 offers not just a worthy successor to Donald Trump, but Sen. Merkley as well.</p><p>Robert E. Repp, Marylhurst</p><p>Stop tar sands oil shipments</p><p>Many thanks to The Oregonian for informing readers about Zenith Energy\u2019s disturbing plans to ship tar sands oil through a terminal in Portland (\u201cCrude Oil Trains Increasingly Travel Through Portland, Alarming Regulators,\u201d April 6). Because of Gordon Friedman\u2019s excellent investigative reporting, we have learned of this latest proposal for transporting dangerous oil through our cities and our scenic areas.</p><p>Not that long ago, and after a huge collective effort, citizens from Portland, Vancouver and nearby communities blocked an oil terminal proposed for the Port of Vancouver. Now that this latest proposal has come to light, citizen activists are poised for another fight to protect our environment and our waterways.</p><p>The dangers of such fossil-fuel expansion are real, and accidental spills or explosions could change our region forever. Zenith\u2019s permits should be denied. The city of Portland and the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality must investigate Zenith\u2019s project and take decisive action.</p><p>Jean M. Avery, Vancouver</p><p>Protect our personal information</p><p>I want to thank the Oregon House for passing House Bill 2395, which protects consumer privacy in an era of increasing connectivity. The bill requires manufacturers of internet-connected devices to ensure their products have security measures to guard against unauthorized access. As a former business analyst, I am very aware of the importance of device security and information privacy. Electronic devices hold large amounts of personal information, and this bill is a step in the right direction. The Senate should pass it, too.</p><p>I enrolled in law school to promote accountable use of personal data. Data is powerfully useful, but it must be collected with a constant eye toward consumer protection and personal privacy. News recently broke that Amazon employs thousands of people to listen to voice recordings captured by Alexa/Echo owners. Amazon-owned Ring has employees that identify vehicles and people in unencrypted videos captured by the company\u2019s doorbell cameras. Google still tracks you on your phone even if you turn off location history. Facebook has admitted that Portal, an AI-based video call assistant similar to Alexa, will collect personal data to better target the ads you see.</p><p>In short, hackers and thieves are only part of the problem. Big Tech is constantly mining our personal data. House Bill 2395 is a step in the right direction, but we need our state and federal leaders to further protect our data privacy from Big Tech companies that seek to collect our personal information for unclear purposes.</p><p>Stuart Leijon, Newberg</p><p>Immigrants aren\u2019t our only problem</p><p>By all means, let\u2019s \u201copen our arms\u201d to immigrants. According to Simon Armstrong (\u201cBring us the asylum seekers,\u201d April 17) and Som Subedi, (\u201cOpen your arms to immigrants,\u201d April 18), everything is perfect to accommodate them. We have the room, good weather, our \u201csuburban areas\u201d are \u201cflush with funds,\u201d and we are ready to fight in court to lead the welcome. Never mind that we are overrun with the homeless, their camps and garbage; we increased our gas tax to fix our streets; school buildings are in dire need of repair, which will require more dollars; and Portland police are greatly understaffed. These are just a few of the problems in the city.</p><p>Within our sanctuary state, the Department of Human Services is being sued, which requires taxpayer dollars to pay attorney and court costs, not taking into account settlements; PERS is a never-ending funnel of our tax dollars, with more to come; and we have our own veterans and families in dire need of help. I feel bad about the immigrants and their situation.</p><p>Jo Berreth, Portland</p><p>Portland bothers you? Go elsewhere</p><p>Jeff Sayre of Lewiston, Idaho, visited downtown Portland with his family recently, attending a concert. He was appalled at the lack of hygiene conditions of the downtown core and wrote a letter concerning his dismay (\u201cPortland Needs to Clean Up Its Act,\u201d April 19). I will agree that homelessness has affected our city (as it has most cities along the Interstate 5 corridor) in negative ways that are concerning to everyone. But I have to question Mr. Sayre\u2019s description of what he saw unless he had been all over the city for several days, towing along his wife and children, while he deliberately looked for problematic issues.</p><p>It\u2019s like Mr. Sayre deliberately spent his family\u2019s vacation looking for the negatives large cities have. I don\u2019t like how people from small towns and cities think they know all the ins and outs of running a metropolis with all its built-in problems, but if these issues bother Mr. Sayre so much, please vacation elsewhere. Try Boise \u2014 it\u2019s closer. Homelessness is not quite the problem east of the Cascades, where winters are usually much colder. Perhaps he wouldn\u2019t be so annoyed with the \u201clawlessness and debauchery\u201d he may find there, too.</p><p>Linda Davies, Portland</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><correction appended=\"true\"><correctionDescription><bodyText><p>Lines in kicker: 1 Lines in header: 1 Lines in subheader: 1 Lines in preface: 1 Lines in body: 0 Lines in caption: 0</p></bodyText></correctionDescription><correctionDate day=\"24\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 24, 2019</dateText></correctionDate><correctionStatusText>Correction Appended</correctionStatusText></correction></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OREGNN-MERLIN_85615838</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OREGNN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VYJ-8Y61-F08V-64JB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">235910</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1353\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Oregonian All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Oregonian (Portland Oregon)</publicationName><edition>ORE - MAIN EDITION</edition><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 24, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DPIO</classCode><className>ADDICTION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001688</classCode><className>TAXES &amp;

But for anyone who uses the internet for anything, from watching cat videos to deep-state surveillance, net neutrality could not be more important. And next month, it could be going away. The Federal Communications Commission, now controlled by three Republican appointees, is moving to rewrite regulations passed just two years ago that guarantee that all content on the internet is treated equally. This is the way it's been since the World Wide Web became accessible to the public in 1991.</p><p>Net neutrality is not broken, but Ajit V. Pai, President Donald Trump's FCC chairman, wants to fix it. Pai tweeted Tuesday, \"Today, I'm proposing to repeal the heavy-handed Internet regulations imposed by the Obama Administration and to return to the light-touch framework under which the Internet developed and thrived before 2015.\"</p><p> This is singularly dishonest. The FCC, with a Democratic majority under President Barack Obama, merely enshrined the neutral internet into federal regulations.</p><p> Pai is rewriting regulations to benefit big internet service providers and claiming that he's undoing burdensome regulations. This is the \"big lie\" approach to policy, as you'll discover when your Netflix movies go into endless buffer mode.</p><p> The big internet service providers, or ISPs -- AT&amp;T, Verizon, Comcast, Charter, etc. -- see a business opportunity here. If they can charge a customer more for receiving a priority transmission slot, then that's just the free market at work. After all, the ISPs argue, they've invested in the routers, cables and connections that make the system work. Why shouldn't they be able to charge what the market will bear?</p><p> That means everyone else's content will be delivered just a little bit slower, but that's just freedom at work -- enabled, of course, by Pai's new regulations. So if Comcast, which has a 30 percent ownership stake in the Hulu streaming TV service, gives Hulu priority over competitors like Netflix, well, then, too bad for Netflix and its customers.</p><p> Pai dismisses concerns like that as \"hypothetical harms and hysterical prophecies of doom.\" But an immutable fact of nature is that monopolies will act like monopolies.</p><p> Big tech companies like Google and Amazon are opposed to any change. Small wonder: They were able to prosper precisely because the internet was an open market. Future innovators won't find things quite so easy.</p><p> The Supreme Court or Congress will eventually have to settle this dispute. Already a U.S. Appeals Court has upheld the Obama-era rules that said the FCC can regulate the internet as a public utility. Pai argues that the ISPs that enable the internet are competing businesses that should be regulated by the Federal Trade Commission. Net neutrality will be enforced \"voluntarily,\" he said.</p><p> Sure it will.</p><p> - St. Louis Post-Dispatch</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKIL-7305318</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2898549EC675AC NWBKIL2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R2S-3P41-DXVP-V3GR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399548</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"478\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Register-Mail<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

It already has 4,000 employees at two buildings in Dublin, a data centre in Clonee, Co Meath, and a lab in Cork.</p><p>\"When completed, [Ballsbridge] will have 870,000sq ft of office space and there will be capacity for 7,000 desks,\" he says. \"It's a very long-term investment and it gives us a lot of room for growth, and an ability to plan strategically.\"</p><p>The campus will be developed over the next three years, with staff at Facebook and its subsidiaries moving there over three phases, beginning in March or April next year. </p><p>Facebook started in Ireland with a \"landing team\" of 30 in late 2008. Lambe says it is a \"great country to invest in\", although there are \"risks in the future\". He cites housing as the number-one lobbying item for the American Ireland Chamber of Commerce, where he is on the board of directors. \"The affordability and scarcity of residential accommodation is something that we're worried about. I'm confident the Government has realised it's a burning platform and is doing everything it can, and this should loosen up in a few years. But it's definitely something that is a potential risk to hiring in the future. </p><h>Direct access \"We will have our own direct access to Lansdowne Road Dart station and I'm hoping that the net will widen considerably for our employees in terms of places to live and there won't be as much pressure on living in the city centre.\"</h><p>Tax is another issue high on the agenda of US multinationals in Ireland. Earlier this week, European Union finance ministers failed to reach agreement on a European Commission proposal to implement a 3 per cent digital sales tax, a levy being pushed by France. </p><p>It's a measure that could have negative implications for Ireland, given that a large number of internet companies, including Facebook and Google, have their regional headquarters here. The impact on our corporation tax receipts is estimated at about EUR 160 million.</p><p>Ireland opposes the proposed levy, preferring to wait for the outcome of an OECD process to agree a framework for taxing such activity on a global basis. Perhaps not surprisingly, Lambe supports this approach. \"Our preference is for the EU and all countries to follow this OECD Beps [Base Erosion and Profit Sharing] project, which is a global initiative co-ordinated as opposed to unilateral smaller arrangements,\" he says. \"Whether it results in more tax, which it probably will, it's the planned and co-ordinated predictable certainty of it. In terms of Paschal Donohoe and Ireland, I think he is right to resist this to help Ireland Inc in terms of its attractiveness. </p><p>\"For us, we are [tax] compliant in all the countries that we operate in and we will be whether it's a digital sales tax, OECD or whatever.\"</p><p>Lambe also notes that Facebook has moved to a \"local selling model\".</p><p>\"In the European countries where we have a sales office with employees, we are recognising the revenue sold by those offices in those markets so that tax income goes into the local market. It's difficult when there's intellectual property as to where it should be [taxed]. That's why the OECD [process] is important. </p><p>\"My own view is that we will end up paying more tax in whatever mechanism is used and that's fine. We just want to make sure it's done in a planned and co-ordinated way.\"</p><p>On our tour of the office, we pass its newly updated \"insights wall\" (right), an interactive map that shows Facebook activity around the world. Lambe clicks on Ireland and it tells us there are 2.8 million active monthly users here - 2.3 million daily.</p><p>Facebook's biggest market is no longer the United States (217 million monthly users, 166 million daily) but India, where it has about 300 million users. During the summer, the Indian government asked Facebook subsidiary WhatsApp to act to prevent the spread of \"irresponsible and explosive\" messages amid a spate of mob lynchings of strangers based around rumours of child kidnappings. </p><p>It was just one of a number of controversies that Facebook has had to deal with in what Lambe describes as a \"tough year\". Earlier this year, it emerged that a data company called Cambridge Analytica had used personal information harvested from more than 50 million Facebook accounts to build a system that could target American voters with political advertising based on their individual profiles. </p><p>Details emerged via a whistleblower contractor called Christopher Wylie, who helped build the algorithm. </p><p>Facebook, which had known about the breach since 2015, took out ads apologising for the breach. In April, Mark Zuckerberg was forced to go before a powerful US Congress committee to explain Facebook's role in this scandal. </p><p>\"It was really disappointing for all of us,\" Lambe says. \"It was my lowest moment in Facebook. It was clear that we didn't do enough up to 2014 to protect our users' data from malicious actors. </p><p>\"Since then, I've been really pleased with the actions we've taken. It's good in the sense that it has us much better prepared for the next five to 10 years in terms of that understanding of the responsibility we have to make sure that stuff is much more buttoned-up. </p><p>\"I've also been pleased with how we've collaborated across the company. We believe we were best in class for GDPR [the EU's General Data Protection Regulation] when that came through [in May]. </p><p>\"Cambridge Analytica was disappointing, there were a lot of learnings from it but it was all locked down many years ago and there were a lot of actions following up. But it was a low point.\"</p><p>At the Web Summit this week, Wylie accused the big tech companies of colonising our society. \"As a very active player in the misuse of the data in Cambridge Analytica, I'm not sure Chris Wylie is who we should be looking to for guidance or inspiration,\" Lambe says. </p><p>\"What people tend to forget is that we're providing a really useful service to the 2.3 billion people on Facebook. We know we need to explain better to them how it works, give them more control over it. That's a lot of our focus. </p><p>\"I think [more] regulation is coming down the road and we welcome that. We're trying to make sure it's done in a way that fully understands the internet.\"</p><p>Lambe says Facebook is \"heavily regulated\" by the Data Protection Commission in Ireland, which is responsible for oversight of its EU activities, given that it is based out of Dublin. </p><p>Many would argue that the Irish commission does not have the necessary financial resources or staffing to regulate the multibillion-dollar social media giant but Lambe disagrees. </p><p>\"Speaking from the inside, working with the data protection regulator and having been involved in their audits, I can tell you that they are extremely thorough with Facebook. But I do agree that they need a lot more resources, especially post-GDPR for all the tech companies . . . and we have also lobbied the Government to increase investment there. We would absolutely agree that they need to be staffed much more.\" </p><p>Of course, to avoid a repeat of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook could just ban political advertising. Lambe says its \"not big money for us and would lead to a much easier life\" but \"part of the power of Facebook for positivity and good is the social movements that happen on Facebook\".</p><p>Lambe says the \"massive changes and improvements\" introduced by Facebook in response to the Cambridge Analytica scandal are working. \"I think we are going to be fairly pleased with how these [US] midterm elections have worked out . . . in terms of those remediations we have set up. </p><p>\"But this is never going to be completely eradicated. It's going to be an arms race against well-resourced, smart people. We can't do it on our own, we're looking to partner with governments and security organisations to get ahead of this.\" </p><p>Facebook's \"mission\" is to \"make the world more inclusive and bring communities together\", he argues. However, the company also stands accused of providing a platform for cranks and extremists to promote hate speech. </p><p>In July, the Channel 4 programme <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Dispatches </emphasis>revealed that Facebook moderators were instructed not to remove extreme, abusive or graphic content from the platform even when it violated the company's guidelines. </p><p>The moderators were contracted from Irish recruiter CPL. Violent videos involving assaults on children, racially charged hate speech and images of self-harm among underage users all remained on Facebook after being reported by users and reviewed by moderators.</p><p>Lambe says Facebook is conducting a \"pretty intensive investigation\" with CPL. \"Our enforcement teams as well as our policy teams are conducting that with CPL at the moment to see if we can identify where there were any breakdowns, where is the policy and was there some misrepresentation or misunderstanding of it, and if we need to take any action.\"</p><p>The Irishman expects that process to conclude in the \"next few weeks\". Will anyone be held accountable? \"I'm going to wait for the outcome of that investigation. Certainly, if there's any breakdowns or processes or training, or if there was any malicious intent by anyone, of course we'll act on that. I just don't know the answers to that at the moment. \"Obviously we were disappointed in some of the outcomes of that programme and there were clearly failings in our systems. But this space is very complex and difficult . . . there's a lot of subjectivity in things like freedom of speech versus hate speech, taste, offence - these things are very subjective.\" </p><p>What about CPL's role? \"There were definitely some comments made by some of the employees that weren't true to our values . . . and that was disappointing because it gave an opportunity to cast aspersions. But we have to take responsibility because, at the end of the day, they are a partner of ours. The relationship continues at the moment but we are investigating that thoroughly.\"</p><h>Business planning and sales operations Lambe has two roles with Facebook. He runs its business planning and sales operations for all regions outside the US. In addition, he heads up the Irish unit, and sits on the boards of its various companies and subsidiaries.</h><p>He's met Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg a \"few times\" but doesn't have one-to-ones with him. \"My track on my functional role, because it's on the revenue side, would be more up to [chief operating officer] Sheryl Sandberg. This year, I've probably met her two or three times.\"</p><p>As we close, Lambe looks at the decade ahead and predicts the likely shape of Facebook. \"Facebook and social media started out as text-based, then it was about photographs, and now it's more about video. It will become predominantly about video and visual and much less text. We're investing heavily in virtual and augmented reality. We believe that could be the next operating platform after mobile. You're probably talking about a 10 or 15-year timeframe where that becomes mainstream.\" </p><p>Will Facebook survive that long? \"We are still growing tens of millions of users every quarter. I think [social media] will fragment but I think we will still be very relevant to people. For a lot of people, it's a scrapbook of their lives.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.3691541</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TP3-X031-JC8Y-80SF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1980\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 9, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

And that is prompting some policymakers and legal experts to ask: How big is too big?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It\u2019s a key issue in an economy being rapidly reshaped by e-commerce, a sector where Amazon and the merchants operating on its platform account for up to a third of all U.S. retail sales, according to some estimates.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It\u2019s also critical for Seattle, a city that has hitched its wagon to the e-commerce titan, and that once saw another local champion, Microsoft, mired in a lengthy antitrust battle. That fight, over Microsoft keeping a rival internet browser off PCs running Windows, almost led to the breakup of the software giant.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">E-commerce is not Amazon\u2019s only game. It also dominates cloud computing, and it</p><p>may soon have a significant brick-and-mortar presence, with its pending acquisition of Whole Foods Market. The unexpected $13.7-billion deal announced in June spurred an outcry among critics of the company and some members of Congress who asked the Federal Trade Commission to take a close look at the deal.</p><p>Last month, Marc Perrone, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, which represents grocery workers, wrote to the FTC that Amazon\u2019s proposed takeover of the organic food purveyor \u201cis a competitive threat to our economy that will hurt workers and communities.\u201d</p><p>Legal experts say it\u2019s really hard to build an antitrust case against the Whole Foods deal, which would give Amazon just a small percentage of the U.S. grocery market.</p><p>Amazon\u2019s budding dominance in other markets, too, is likely to remain unchallenged in the long term, unless the philosophy underlying antitrust regulations changes. In fact, U.S. regulators have sided with Amazon against its rivals\u2019 anti-competitive moves \\x97 such as when they charged Apple and top New York publishers with conspiring to raise prices for e-books, a market Amazon dominates.</p><p>Under the current U.S. antitrust view, how consumers are treated is the yardstick, not the company\u2019s dominance in a market. To take antitrust action against Amazon, regulators would have to prove that the company somehow harms shoppers \\x97 for example, by conspiring to make the products they buy artificially more expensive. Another way Amazon could run into trouble is by undermining rivals with strategies such as sustained predatory pricing or forcing suppliers to lock out competitors.</p><p>But rather than using tactics like that, some experts say, Amazon has built its empire just by giving customers what they want \\x97 products at low prices with lots of choices \\x97 which is not against the rules, no matter how big it grows.</p><p>\u201cAntitrust law doesn\u2019t make it illegal to get market power,\u201d provided it is done properly, said A. Douglas Melamed, a professor of antitrust law at Stanford University and a former U.S. Department of Justice antitrust official. Amazon\u2019s humongous size is \u201cpolitically important,\u201d but not an antitrust issue. \u201cNot if they got there by being more innovative and more creative than the next guy,\u201d he said.</p><p>At the same time, the huge role occupied by Amazon \\x97 and other big tech firms such as Google and Facebook \\x97 is fostering a rethinking among policy wonks about how government can oversee the power of these tech giants.</p><p>\u201cA lot of people are waking up to the fact that Amazon has positioned itself as a central piece of infrastructure for the 21st-century economy,\u201d said Lina Khan, a fellow at the New America Foundation, a Washington, D.C., think tank. She is also author of \u201cAmazon\u2019s Antitrust Paradox,\u201d which has attracted wide attention since it was published in January by the Yale Law Journal.</p><p>\u201cWe need to rethink how to go about preserving competition,\u201d she said in an interview.</p><p>Amazon plays down the antitrust issue. During a recent call with reporters, Amazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said that \u201cthe businesses we are in are all very large market segments with lots of very serious competition.\u201d</p><p>Nevertheless, the company last year hired a veteran D.C. antitrust adviser, Seth Bloom.</p><p>Amazon\u2019s North American retail sales totaled about $80 billion in 2016. That doesn\u2019t include sales by third-party merchants operating on Amazon\u2019s site, which some experts estimate to be about the same, or more.</p><p>Together, Amazon and its merchants account for about a third of all online sales. But e-commerce is a small part \\x97 about 8 percent \\x97 of the huge U.S. retail sector.</p><p>Amazon grows fast, however. In the latest quarter, the company\u2019s sales grew 25 percent, to $38 billion, and the company is on track to becoming the second-largest U.S. employer among the Fortune 500, after Wal-Mart.</p><p>It dominates some markets, such as e-books. In others, it\u2019s growing so quickly that it makes incumbents quake. For instance, analysts with Cowen estimate that Amazon might surpass Macy\u2019s as the biggest seller of clothes this year.</p><p>When a rumor arises that Amazon might dip its toe in a new market, stocks for potential rivals tremble, as happened to Zillow in June amid reports of a potential Amazon service for real-estate agents.</p><p>Even more important than its retail power, in the eyes of some policymakers, is Amazon\u2019s increasingly central role as a platform widely used by other retailers. Brands now feel compelled to hawk their wares on Amazon\u2019s site, the biggest destination for online shoppers.</p><p>Many merchants also pay to use Amazon\u2019s logistics, having their products stored and shipped by the Seattle giant. Amazon, the largest purveyor of cloud computing, even rents competitors the computing capacity they need to operate their businesses.</p><p>Khan, the New America fellow, likens Amazon to the 19th-century railroad empires that farmers and manufacturers relied on to get their products to market \\x97 and whose dominance generated public concern that led to the creation of the first federal antitrust laws.</p><p>\u201cToday you have to ride Amazon\u2019s rails,\u201d she said.</p><p>Current antitrust laws, which focus on protecting efficiency and consumer prices, are ill-suited to regulate that type of power. They also don\u2019t fully take into account how Amazon\u2019s bevy of mutually reinforcing businesses can undermine competition, Khan argues.</p><p>But that regulatory framework could change. In the past year, the attention the issue has been getting from the media and members of Congress on both sides of the aisle \u201chas been mind-blowing,\u201d Khan said.</p><p>In a recent op-ed in The New York Times, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., pointed to more strict oversight of corporate giants as one of the main points of the Democratic Party platform.</p><p>\u201cWe are going to fight to allow regulators to break up big companies if they\u2019re hurting consumers and to make it harder for companies to merge if it reduces competition,\u201d he wrote.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Default Yes false</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Amazon.com's new\"fulfillment center\" in Fall River during a job fair the company hosted last month.

Two outcomes most people predicted would never come true came true. First, there was Brexit in Europe, and then Donald Trump in America. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ALEX GOLDMARK: And when David tries to make sense of it, he realizes that some of the same people were behind both campaigns. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DAVID GOLDSTEIN: It is so rare and so hard in politics to pull an upset. They are few and far between. Maybe in your entire 30-, 40-year political career, you will be on the winning side of a single upset. They pulled off two upsets in back to back years. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: Specifically, there was one company that worked on both campaigns - Cambridge Analytica. </p><p>AILSA CHANG: And as we heard about a lot since then, they got caught using personal data without permission, some of it from Facebook. They were accused of breaking laws. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: But they also claimed to have pulled off new legal tactics for finding especially personalized, even intimate ways to persuade voters using online data. </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: There is a lot that was simply innovative, that we hadn't thought of doing before. A big thing was, you know, this kind of setting up your own personal, like, online ecosystem of content meant to persuade people to a certain action, kind of like drawing a fly into a web. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: They were claiming they could create profiles of people based on their online data and then use that against them to change their minds, maybe without them even knowing it was happening, maybe using misinformation. And it just felt like playing dirty. </p><p>AILSA CHANG: And he's thinking, this is not how democracy should work. </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: I'm not somebody who scares easily, but I am legitimately scared. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: He's looking at this like an arms race, with the Democrats way behind, as he sees it. And he wants to sound an alarm. </p><p>AILSA CHANG: He sets up a bunch of meetings at places like Google, Facebook, Twitter, other big online companies. </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: And my hope was - is that there could be some kind of, like, cross-industry investigative body that could work with the government and regulatory and private industry. And I was shot down very fast. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: I imagine the people that he talks to at these big tech companies are, like, obviously, you can target people and persuade them; that is the point of our ad platforms - to get the most persuasive ad in front of every person, exactly in the way that persuades them the most. That is why we get paid so much. </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: So (laughter) I was told that. Nicely, though, the same person who shot me down said at the same time, if you want to see something happen on this, you have to do this yourself. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: You have to do it, too. </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: Yes. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: You have to become a Cambridge Analytica yourself. </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: Well, that - yes. Without the illegal part. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF ADRIAN QUESADA AND SKINNY WILLIAMS' \"THE SPAGHETTI WESTERNER\")        </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: Hello and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Alex Goldmark. </p><p>AILSA CHANG: And I'm Ailsa Chang. To prove that there is a threat to democracy, David decides to mess with democracy and maybe help his own party along the way. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: When he says he wants to prove there's a threat, he mean proof, like with a science experiment, on actual voters in an actual election, with data, statistics, controls - all of it. </p><p>AILSA CHANG: Today on the show, how to meddle in an election, step by step. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF ADRIAN QUESADA AND SKINNY WILLIAMS' \"THE SPAGHETTI WESTERNER\")        </p><p>AILSA CHANG: So at this point, David's living in New York City, and his main job - it's not in politics. He's now working at a big corporate ad agency. This science experiment thing he's hatching, it's like a side project, a nights and weekends thing. And the first thing he needs to get it going is some money. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: And so he calls up some old contacts he has, and most of the donors that he goes to, they're like, are you kidding me? You want me to fund a plan for you to go rogue and be a Cambridge Analytica of the left with potentially ethically sketchy methods on real voters in a real election, but you don't know which one yet? And David is like, yes, exactly; that is exactly what I want. Eventually, he scares enough donors and raises $85,000. And he's in business. </p><p>AILSA CHANG: It takes David about two weeks to get his whole team together. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: He's going to be the brains. He comes up with the strategy, picks the messaging and designs what people will see when they click his ads. </p><p>AILSA CHANG: He needs someone to wrangle the data for him. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: And he needs people to design the ads he'll be running. </p><p>AILSA CHANG: He also checks the whole plan over with an election lawyer because he wants to stay legal. </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: So we had kind of formed our team, right? And we had all resolved, OK, we're going to do this. But the thing was, it was, like, summer 2017, you know (laughter). </p><p>AILSA CHANG: The next big elections are more than a year away, and he needs a big election because he's running a science experiment on voters. He needs lots of voters. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: He needs a way to make two groups of voters, ideally, demographically identical. </p><p>AILSA CHANG: Voting histories identical. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: Turnout history, partisan makeup - all the things that he can measure - as identical as possible. </p><p>AILSA CHANG: And he needs to be able to break those voters in half, into one control group and one test group. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: Half get his campaign and half don't. And then he's going to measure it. </p><p>AILSA CHANG: Like a medical drug trial, but for politics. </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: It was very tough to figure out exactly how we would cut up the potential electorates in such a way that we could reliably say we had an impact in the test condition because this did not happen in the control. </p><p>AILSA CHANG: And Alabama comes through. The senator there, Jeff Sessions, he becomes the attorney general. So there's an open seat. </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: So what had happened is the Alabama Senate election was called. It didn't seem winnable for the Democrats at first. </p><p>AILSA CHANG: This is that election, by the way, that ended up with Roy Moore, the Republican candidate, getting accused of being a pedophile, against Doug Jones, the Democrat. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: But David is assessing this race way before those are the final candidates. And he knows it's been about 25 years since a Democrat won the Senate seat in Alabama. </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: But what I point out to my team and what occurred to me was we don't have to win. It doesn't matter if we win. We just have to show an effect. I was like, if he loses by 14 points, but we go back to our group that we hit and he only loses in that group by eight points, we can show that we lessened the loss, if our hypothesis is right. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: And now to set up the experiment - he takes three state senate districts, matches those against three others. </p><p>AILSA CHANG: Three test districts, three control districts. </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: And three of those, you give them the ads, and the other three, you don't give them the ads, but you measure them like you did, so you can compare. Yeah. </p><p>AILSA CHANG: And with digital ads, it's easy to pick who will see your ads and who won't. </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: Yeah. And in fact, I think what's actually been surprising to a lot of people is this element of what we call negative targeting. So if I don't want someone to see my ads, I can put their name into the system, and they will never see my advertising. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: He said he could even feed in the names of all the campaign staff, the journalists covering the race, the regulators, too, and make sure that they never see his campaign firsthand - if he wanted to. </p><p>AILSA CHANG: But the people he does want to target, he can bombard them with whatever ads he can afford to pay for. </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: One of the wonderful things - or perhaps awful things - about this new age of digital advertising is the number of times that we can touch you, right? </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: That sounds creepy. </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: I know (laughter). And you know, it's referred to as, you know, essentially, a touch. Like, how often can I get my content, what I want you to see, in front of you? </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: With the old ways, a candidate would flood local TV ads and be lucky to get it in front of a voter they wanted to reach maybe twice a day. </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: With the amount of time that people now spend on their smartphones, on their laptops and simply online - you know, four to five hours a day - I now have hundreds of opportunities in one single day to hit you and possibly even thousands. </p><p>AILSA CHANG: He can show you one ad and then another and another, testing out different messages or designs on different websites you might check, trying to figure out what catches your eyes and when. </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: Going after the same pool of voters and hitting them over and over and over and over again until they figured out what would make them click. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: And once the automated ad system has that information, it learns. The next time the system tries to target you, it goes right to the stuff it knows you like - always testing, always learning, very rapidly. </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: And that's why this is so devastatingly effective. Because you can cut into people who are typically very sophisticated viewers, people with high educations, you know, people who are very wealthy. But because you're continually exposing them until you find out what flips their trigger, and something always does, you are getting access into that person's mind that you never would have previously. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: And sometimes looking into that person's mind is relatively harmless. I mean, it's just annoying when the Internet wants you to buy that pair of sunglasses; it gets dangerous when it's trying to change the way you vote. </p><p>AILSA CHANG: Especially when the person behind all of this doesn't want you to notice they're even trying. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: And this isn't just Facebook, to be clear; he is trying to reach people all over the web, regular websites, too. His system, it's like any online ad system. </p><p>AILSA CHANG: And for all this to work, David needs to create a ton of different messages to test out, and those messages need to lure voters. </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: The best thing to do, for me, when - sorry, let me think about how to phrase this - on it - (laughter) I'll sound nefarious; that's fine. So basically, what you are going to click on in the future is what you are clicking on now, right? I mean, that - we're creatures of habit. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: That makes sense. </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: So I assumed if I went to right-wing websites and took a look at what the advertisers were doing on those, that would help direct me to what the brief should be for my own content producers and ad-makers. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: Because you had to actually get inside the mind of the Republicans. </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: Exactly. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: Which was not normally what you do. </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: Right, exactly. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: He does a kind of obsessive study on the look and the styles, the themes, the phrasing even. </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: Very big on words having to do with things like - you know, anything that spoke to, like, the flag, the U.S., patriotism - honor was a very important concept that came out of my deep dive. So when I was putting my ads together for them, I was trying to tap into those themes. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: All right, Ailsa, I want to show you something. </p><p>AILSA CHANG: Betrayal of Alabama's honor, and there's a dude in a cowboy hat. Alabama's great shame. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: It looks like a 1990s website level of, like, animation. </p><p>AILSA CHANG: Right, like you did it at home, not with Paint; it's like a step above. But, like, with stencils that you're borrowing from some program (laughter). </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: He says that's what works. </p><p>AILSA CHANG: Like amateurish? </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: Enough that I was actually curious why he did that. </p><p>That was on purpose? </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: (Laughter) Yes, absolutely on purpose. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: That wasn't because you just had a small budget? </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: No (laughter). No, I mean, look - one of the nice things about working in New York is you have access to the best town in the world. And yes, it was tough for me to tell these very, very talented art guys, this is too nice. Make it simpler, you know, more blocky. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: But those are the ads that fit in with the other ads on the websites that his target voters are going to. So that's what he gets, and now he's almost ready to go. </p><p>AILSA CHANG: And then the election changes. Roy Moore becomes the candidate on the Republican side, and he is now probably the worst candidate imaginable for a general election because this is the time where he's getting barraged by all these allegations about how he's a pedophile. And there are now prominent Republicans saying Roy Moore is unfit for office. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: Suddenly, David's science experiment is happening in a nail-biter of a close election, and maybe his science experiment can help his side win. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)        </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: So David has his click-harvesting machine, the ecosystem drawing flies into a web. </p><p>AILSA CHANG: But what does a click get him? I mean, where do you go when you click? </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: What happens when they get the click is they go to a website that I've set up just for them. </p><p>AILSA CHANG: In this case, different websites for different groups of voters. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: David's plan for Democrats is just to boost voter turnout. So when a Democrat in Alabama clicks on an ad, they get sent to a website with videos and articles designed to boost their mood, to uplift them and, in the process, make them feel like everything will come down to their one vote. </p><p>AILSA CHANG: With Republicans, David's plan is a little savvier, a little sneakier. He wants them to vote less. His plan for moderate Republicans is to make them want to write in candidates other than Roy Moore by making them think that that's what everyone else is doing. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: So he sends the moderate Republicans to a website. It looks like a news site. It's filled with true stories about how other Republicans are planning to write in other candidates. </p><p>AILSA CHANG: His plan for conservative Republicans is to make them stay home. </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: On the conservative website that was just for the conservative Alabamians, I filled it with content that was not written by me; it was written by other conservatives, out somewhere, anywhere on the web, who are writing about how terrible Roy Moore was. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: So not fake news. This was... </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: Not fake news. I never once created article, tweet - nothing, ever. </p><p>AILSA CHANG: So what this might look like is a Breitbart or a Drudge-style news site. </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: But except it has pieces linking to the local newspaper or maybe something a conservative writer posted on his blog. </p><p>AILSA CHANG: And it just happens that all these posts on the site paint Roy Moore in this really bad light. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: David is using the site to create a fake view of the world, with real stories. They're out of context, but they are still technically real. And the point is to dissuade voting. </p><p>AILSA CHANG: So the sites are all ready. His research tells him he'll have the most impact closer to the election. And about a week and a half before election day, everything goes live. </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: Essentially, what happens is the ads start to get pushed out, right? And they start to appear in front of people in Alabama, either on their smartphones or on their laptops. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: And he waits. It's an automated system, anyway. About this point, it's easy to say, oh, come on, this is overplaying the power of ads. Who really clicks on them? Or I'm immune to ads. I lived through Upworthy. But that is not the point. It doesn't really matter if you do it; it only matters if someone does it, a sliver of the people he's targeting. </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: You might be immune, right? And the guy next to you might be immune, and the guy next to that person might be immune. But if I only need to change 3% of people in order to affect a given result, then I can go 97 people down and not have an effect, but as long as I have an effect on one, two, three, and only on this one specific action, that all the rest of the time they're immune, but to me they're not, then I can literally change the world. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: I talked to digital campaign folks, Republicans and Democrats, professors who study this, regular old ad buyers for noncampaign products, and when I told them about David, they all kind of went, yep, that makes sense. Half of them told me other ways that he could have done it that are even more sophisticated. But that, yeah, in principle, this is what campaigning is becoming. </p><p>AILSA CHANG: And when David checks his early data, the grand science experiment seems to be working. </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: I always say, the biggest shock was the most engaged folks were the conservative Republicans. </p><p>AILSA CHANG: They did the most clicking out of any of the groups. They spent the most time in his ecosystem of websites. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: To measure the vote impact, when he does eventually get the voter rolls and he compares his control districts with his experimental treatment group to see which groups turned out to vote more, it looks like he has had a real impact. </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: The Democrats in our experimental group turned out at a 4% higher level than the Democrats in the control group. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: Four percent. </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: Four percent. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: So you think that your work caused 4% higher turnout... </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: Yes. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: ...In the places you tried it? </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: Yes. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: That's a lot. </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: It is. It is. Most... </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: That is more than the margin of victory in a lot of elections. </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: Loads. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: Yeah. </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: (Laughter). </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: It's enough to flip an election. </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: Absolutely. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: And the Republicans, did it work on them? </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: It did. The experimental condition was 2.5% lower for the moderate Republicans. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: OK, so you believe you caused a 2.5% lower turnout for moderate Republicans that you... </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: Exactly. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: ...That you targeted? </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: Exactly. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: OK. </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: And then for the conservative Republicans, it was 4.4%... </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: OK. </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: ...Of a drop-off. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: Which is also a lot to take out of someone's base. </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: Exactly. </p><p>AILSA CHANG: Roy Moore loses the election to Doug Jones, the Democrat, by just 1.5 percentage points; that's just a little over 20,000 votes statewide. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: So I asked David what did he think that his science experiment had caused? </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: I would say we could reasonably lay claim to about 8- to 9,000 of those votes. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: So that sounds like a lot of votes. </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: (Laughter). </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: No, I'm serious. Like, it's... </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: (Laughter) Yeah, I know. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: It just - it's a big claim. </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: It is. It is. But I'm fine sharing the - you know, I've shared the data with whoever wants to see the data. I mean, it's... </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: No, I would like to take a look at the data. </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: Of course (laughter). </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: I looked at the data. And I went and talked to professors who study this and other campaign strategists on the Republican side, and I talked through David's claims with them and his numbers. And it's pretty much impossible to verify his data. They said there's too many variables or too little information. Like, maybe Doug Jones held a bunch of big rallies in one of the test districts, or maybe a big influential pastor of a church in one of the test districts made a big show of writing in his vote against Roy Moore. It could be all kinds of things. </p><p>And even by his own numbers and his own calculations, the impact that David had on Democratic turnout is a bit closer to, like, 2% change when you factor in a few more variables. In fact, most of the experts that I talked to were skeptical of how big his numbers were, given how little money he spent. But one of the campaigners I talked to also told me that they've heard of other tests and other studies from other campaign groups that are not ever going to be made public, and in a lot of ways, this isn't so far out of line with them. What's different here is the person who ran this campaign was just doing it pretty much on his own, from an office in a city many states away, making it look easy to build an algorithmic system that could sway thousands of votes for less than $100,000. </p><p>What do you do after you meddle in an election? </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: (Laughter) Sorry, it's an intense term, but I get it. So you start showing it to other people who have to worry about the next election themselves. </p><p>AILSA CHANG: After his experiment, David showed his results to Democratic campaign folks, and he said, hire me, and I will show you how to do what I did, or at least learn how to fight against what I did, because anyone can do it or even worse. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: Is it just inevitable that that's going to keep happening, as long as we have online ads? </p><p>DAVID GOLDSTEIN: I mean, not necessarily. I think it was far easier to sway people with a TV ad in the early days of TV. There was a way to do it with radio ads. And I think right now we're in a bit of a free and easy period, I think, when it comes to digital online advertising. But, you know, I do have a belief that as we grow more sophisticated, it should make it more difficult for folks like me to have that impact. </p><p>ALEX GOLDMARK: After I talked with him, I was thinking, this is just an arms race. And I wondered if that ever led him to just want a truce, to go back to the old way. So I asked him if he ever brought that up with anyone. He wrote me an email back, and he said he hadn't. He said this makes it cheaper for campaigns to reach voters, easier to get a message across. So campaigns won't give that up. Also, he wrote, I don't know how to say, I'll stop if you do, in Russian. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF MARC FERRARI, NATE DONMOYER AND ROSHMOND DORAN PATTEN'S \"DYSFUNCTION\")        </p><p>AILSA CHANG: Have you subscribe to our newsletter?

The San Diego chipmaker says it completed its review of its operations and decided that it's best served by its current corporate and financial structure.

This fund will support councils to implement plans for the transformation of their high streets. Businesses rates for small businesses will be cut by one third for two years. This is for retailers with rateable value of under \u00a351,000, saving up to 90 per cent of all shops up to \u00a38,000 each year, and building on previous reductions worth more than \u00a312.5 billion. To help level the playing field further for our high streets, big tech firms will also be required to pay tax on sales in the UK.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Chancellor also announced a further \u00a3650m of grant funding for English Local Authorities for 2019-20. This will enable local councils to provide greater support for older people with care needs as well as help more children to live safely at home.</p><p>I was excited to have the second reading of my private members bill on the regulation of Physician Associates in Parliament. Regulating Physician Associates is key for the future of the health service, it would strengthen provision and ensure better patient safety. It is vital that patients, employers and other health professionals are assured that those providing care can practise safely within appropriate professional standards. Due to lengthy debates on the Homes (Fitness for Human Habitation), Civil Partnerships, Marriages, and Deaths (Registration) and Organ Donation (Deemed Consent) bills before it, the Physician Associates (Regulation) bill was unable to complete its Second Reading and pass onto Committee Stage. It will have another chance to be debated at its Second Reading on November 23rd 2018.</p><p>The Public Accounts Committee took evidence on the Department for Transport's progress on implementing the UK's exit from the European Union. The Department has clearly made a determined effort to address the significant and complex challenge of delivering a wide-ranging programme of work to support EU exit, however a number of challenges remain, including a new trailer registration scheme, road haulage permits, international driving permits and European Maritime Safety Agency systems. I raised the issue of how the department could guarantee that the new trailer registration scheme would be completed by the end of the year, as promised. Whilst progress is being made, the end of December is only 8 weeks away.</p><p>Teignbridge Matters</p><p>Dawlish did not make it into the Chancellor's main speech but it was included in the full budget in the red book. It was announced that following the \u00a315 million of funding committed in November 2016, essential work will begin this November to strengthen the cliffs and protect the seawall at Dawlish. Plans for major improvements for the seawall at Dawlish will be published next summer.</p><p>I was very disappointed to have confirmed by Gigaclear that there will be significant delays to the Phase 2 rollout of superfast broadband. My colleagues and I fought hard for central government funding for Connecting Devon and Somerset Projects and it is unacceptable that Gigaclear keep letting down residents. I met with Gigaclear representatives in Parliament who outlined their new plans to right this wrong and get the rollout back on track. Faster broadband would be transformational for our rural communities and residents deserve better.</p><p>I was shocked and dismayed to see the major fire in Newton Abbot on October 21, which destroyed the old carriage and wagon repair shop in Ford Close. It appears mindless vandals started the fire at the site, which is due to be turned into an Aldi supermarket. Anyone with information is asked to contact police on <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:101@dc.police.uk\">101@dc.police.uk</email> or call 101, quoting CR/097864/18.</p><p>My next surgery is on Friday, November 16, at 2pm in Newton Abbot. Call my office on 01626 368277 to arrange an appointment.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HEREXT-BR15518401</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HEREXT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TNH-YN81-DYY4-31BF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">166716</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"659\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Localworld All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Torquay Herald Express</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"31926\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 8, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Central</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001020</classCode><className>LEGISLATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009G89</classCode><className>REGIONAL &amp;

It's the NPR POLITICS podcast, here with our weekly roundup of political news. Republicans today released the first draft of their highly anticipated tax bill. If it passes, it will be the most significant overhaul of the federal tax code since <person><nameText>Ronald Reagan </nameText></person>was president. And if it fails, oof (ph) - we'll get into that, too. </p><p><person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>is also calling for changes to the Diversity Visa Program after a terrorist attack in New York City left eight people dead. It's the same program the accused attacker used to get into the country. And lawyers for Facebook, Twitter and Google were grilled by lawmakers on Capitol Hill about the role their platforms played in aiding Russia's efforts to disrupt the 2016 election. And as always, we'll end with what we just can't let go this week. I'm <person><nameText>Susan Davis. </nameText></person>I cover Congress for NPR. </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: I'm Danielle Kurtzleben, political reporter. </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO: I'm Domenico Montanaro, political editor. </p><p>RON ELVING: And I'm Ron Elving, editor correspondent. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: Tam and Scott are off on reporting trips today. I have not locked them in the basement. I'm just filling in, although people often confuse Tam and I on air. So in theory, I maybe could've pretended to be her and saw which really, really good podcast listeners would be able to tell the difference. </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO: And I think Ron and I have only been in, like, one other podcast together. So you see the - you know, we're not the same person. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: Yes. So, Danielle, we'll have to see if anybody confuses us today. </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: I could affect an accent for the whole show... </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: (Laughter). </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: ...Maybe a Russian one. And then, you know... </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: Then people will know for sure. </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: And it will be fitting. So, you know... </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: And timely. </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: OK. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: So, Danielle, I want to start with you because I want to talk about taxes. </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: So do I. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: So a lot of buildup and maybe a little behind schedule - but Republicans finally released their tax bill today. And we have the name for it - disappointingly... </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: ...The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: The sadly non-redundant Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (laughter). </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: Before we even get in... </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO: What kind of acronym is that? The TCJA? </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: The tahjahcah (ph)? The tahcahjah (ph)? </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO: That's not good. </p><p>RON ELVING: They don't want an acronym because they want everyone to refer to it as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Bill. </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: OK. That's fair. </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO: How is it not the MAGA something? </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: Before we get into the substance, we have to talk about what <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>initially wanted to call the bill. Who wants to say it? You all want to say it. </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: I think you want to say it. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: Should we say it together? </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO: On three. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: Should we say it together? </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO: One, two, three. </p><p>RON ELVING: Cut Cut Cut. </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO: Cut Cut Cut Act. </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: Cut Cut Cut. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: Cut Cut Cut. So there was a great story, which I also confirmed with my own congressional sources, that when they were drafting the bill, House Speaker Paul Ryan and Kevin Brady, who's the top tax writer on this bill, were brainstorming and said, you know what? <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>- he's such a good brander. Let's get him in on this. Let's see what he wants to call it. The White House came back, first offering the Cut Cut Cut Act. And so... </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO: I've got to say I remember the Cut Cut Cut act. I don't remember - what is it? The TCJA? Tahcahjah? </p><p>RON ELVING: Can we shorten it to just Cut 3? </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: Yeah - C3, Cut Cubed. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: Once again, the establishment wins. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act released today. Danielle, you have been working your way through this bill. We know that it is tax cuts for both taxpayers and businesses. </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: Right. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: I want to start talking about taxpayers because I think when people hear there's going to be a tax cut, their first question is, how does this affect my life? So how does this affect the regular taxpayer? </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: Right. So first of all, I mean, the big thing that Republicans will be touting is that this cuts the number of brackets. It cuts it from 7 to 4. So, you know, I'm not going to go through the numbers here. But, you know... </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: What's the highest? </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: What is the highest? 39.6, which is where the highest bracket is right now. The difference is that where that bracket starts changes. It is higher than it is. If you're, for example, a married couple filing jointly, it's much higher. Right now that 39.6 bracket starts at around 470,000. If this bill would pass, it would start at 1 million. So you would have however many people there are in that gap between 500K and a million who would now no longer pay 39.6. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: So the top rate would stay 39.6 percent in the country. What would be the lowest tax rate someone would pay? </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: That would be 12 percent. Yeah. So I mean - and there are all sorts of other changes on top of that, as well. But that is the first basic change. Another basic change that's going to affect a lot of people is the standard deduction will be doubled. So right now it's somewhere around 6,000 for an individual and 12,000 for a married couple. That would roughly double. </p><p>However - and this is where it all gets sort of messy. I mean, so that might sound great for a lot of people. It might mean you're less likely to itemize. But we're also getting rid of personal exemptions. You know, you get an exemption for every single person in your family. And you used to get to tack that on to your standard deduction - no longer. So that could offset some of that. So whether your tax bill is going to be higher or lower depends on that. </p><p>RON ELVING: And I think we should also point out that for roughly half the households in America - half the people in America - they don't make enough money to pay... </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: Yeah. </p><p>RON ELVING: ...Federal income taxes. They do pay payroll taxes. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: Right. </p><p>RON ELVING: They pay Social Security taxes, Medicare taxes, which are totally unaffected by this bill. Those taxes are not going down for anyone. </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO: So, Danielle, let me ask you a question because, you know, the big political talking point coming into this, in some ways, was that the middle class was the focus, right? Paul Ryan, speaker of the House, would say that the middle class is going to get a tax cut. Really, the biggest cuts in this, obviously, are for corporations - from 35 to 20 percent. But what about the middle class? Are there going to be people that are stuck, you know, in this sort of Neverland between these tax brackets like they'd been talking about and then potentially some people seeing an increase? </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: That's a great question. And there's honestly no great way for me to answer it yet because, you know, listen. Were this bill to be enacted - or even once, you know, we all start reporting more deeply on it, I'm sure there will be all sorts of case-by-case-by-case things that we reporters will dig up and say, oh, this particular person would be way worse off. This particular person would be way better off. But, I mean, because the thing is they're also doing a lot of other stuff on the individual side - there's a bigger child tax credit. There's now a per-person credit. That would seem to offset some of that personal exemption stuff that I just talked about. </p><p>And, plus, they're getting rid of a bunch of little deductions. The Republican Party - and the Democrats, sometimes - like to talk about simplifying the tax code. So they are potentially getting rid of a bunch of deductions that a lot of people really like - you know, some smaller ones like student loan interest, medical expenses and then, of course, big ones like the state and local tax deduction. If you are an itemizer, much of that is going away. They're keeping property tax deductions, though. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: Politically, though, the bill is intended to cut taxes. But Republicans are also saying they want to simplify the code - that it should just be easier to file your taxes. Though, Ron, I don't know how many people are really going to be excited by the fact that Congress just made it easier to file if they don't see any discernible benefit. How much do people really care about tax reform? </p><p>RON ELVING: I don't think people care a great deal about either the idea of reform or the idea of simplicity if they wind up paying more money. They're going to wind up feeling that, somehow, they were left out, or they're the ones who are paying more so that someone else can pay less. And they're going to identify the person they like least among those paying less. So maybe there will be some people who, because of the standard deduction changes, will actually no longer owe any federal income tax at all. And they're a beneficiary - no question about that. But there will also be a large number of people who are passed through businesses who are suddenly going to be seeing their taxes go down from 35 to 20 percent. That's a huge tax break. </p><p>Plus, we're eliminating the estate tax. So the richest people who die under the eliminated estate tax - they're going to phase it out. But once it's eliminated, they would go tax-free on the billions of dollars they may want to pass on to their inheritors. Now, we can have an argument about whether or not that money should be taxed at the point of death. But it is something that is paid by only a fraction of the richest 1 percent of the people in the country. And so that is a tax break for the wealthy - no question about it. So if you wind up paying more as a normal, American, middle-class family, those are the people whose tax breaks you're financing. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: But, Domenico - OK. </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: And to tack on to what we're talking about here, you know, only a quarter of Americans in a poll that came out from CBS News this week - only one quarter said that tax reform should be the top priority for Congress and the president right now, which shows you that, you know, Americans might be kind of excited about particular tax breaks they might get. But they're not exactly, you know, chomping at the bit to be like, yes. Congress, please do this. Not at all. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: Domenico, one of the things that struck me about this politically is that this bill also - that I think for the first time in a very long time - also has the Republican Party conceding that maybe the wealthiest Americans don't deserve a tax cut. Leaving that top rate at - 39.6 six percent I believe it is - that's a concession in its own way, even if it seems small politically. It's still kind of big. </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO: It's a huge deal. And they even were talking about possibly raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans after there became the talking point that this bill benefits the wealthy far more than it does the middle class or any other group. And there's two things that are left out of this bill that I think are really interesting to talk about - first the fact that the highest level is still 39.6 percent, although, as Danielle noted, the income level that would be taxed on that obviously goes up higher. So those people will get some bit of a tax cut - but not as big maybe as people thought it could. </p><p>But the other big piece of this is that there was a lot of talk about putting a cap on 401(k) contributions. Right now you can put in about $18,000 a year tax-free. You can put in as much as you want - but tax-free, we're talking 18,000 bucks, right? Now, what they were talking about in some of the details of the conversation that got leaked was potentially capping that at $2,400 a year. That is a huge change and would be a major shift and, frankly, would create a talking point for Democrats who oppose this bill to say, wait a minute. So you want to lower - you want to slash corporate tax rates at the expense of my retirement? Good luck with that one. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: I think we've identified why they didn't put that in the bill. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: It was phenomenally unpopular in polls. And one thing I can't believe we haven't even gotten to yet is the mortgage interest deduction... </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: Yeah. </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: ...Which tends to be a tax break that is considered untouchable. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: As someone who just purchased a house, that is certainly one of those things you never think about in your entire life. And then it's the thing you clock most closely that Congress does. </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO: You are going to be doing a dance... </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: Yes. </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO: ...On April 15. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: (Laughter) I'm looking... </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO: You're going to be looking forward... </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: I hope. I hope. </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO: You're going to be looking forward to filing your taxes in, like, January. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: Yeah. </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO: I'm just letting you know. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: OK. </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: Existing mortgages are grandfathered in anyway, as I understand it. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: Fantastic. </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO: (Laughter). </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: Ta-da. </p><p>RON ELVING: That's right. But somebody who's buying a new home next year - and they're buying it in California or New York or any of the other places where mortgages are typically well up into the hundreds of thousands of dollars... </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: Absolutely. </p><p>RON ELVING: ...Are going to discover that they better not try to buy the house they thought they needed. They're going to have to buy a smaller house. </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: Right. Because to be clear, they're not getting rid of the mortgage interest deduction. That would, you know, be insane because lots of people - like Sue - probably kind of like it. Instead, they're changing the cap on where it starts. Right now, the cap is at a million dollars. So if you have a million dollars in home debt, then it would start there. Now they're knocking that down to $500,000. Which, you know, that's a pretty big change. And, you know, it won't affect a lot of people in America who just don't have that much in mortgage debt. But also, it has bipartisan support to some degree. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: But this raises a great point, right? If you want to do tax cuts, you have to pay for them. Or you have to pay for most of them. </p><p>RON ELVING: You don't have to pay for that last trillion and a half that they decided to put on the cuff, but you do have to pay for the other three-and-a-half trillion that has not been put on the cuff. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: And so that means that the final tax bill can't add to the deficit by more than 1.5 trillion over the next 10 years. That is the way that Republicans approved a budget resolution. And the budget resolution is kind of what outlines these target numbers that they have to hold to in order to get a bill through the Senate in the end. And so that means there's some people today who are going to be thrilled about this bill and some people who are not going to be happy about this bill. Who's not happy about this bill? </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: Homebuilders are not happy about this bill. That change in the mortgage interest deduction really has them kind of upset? The National Conference of State Legislatures sent out a release today saying they were also heavily displeased with this because they are upset about getting rid of that state and local tax deduction which is, you know, an indirect subsidy of states, of state spending. </p><p>RON ELVING: It certainly means that you can no longer write off thousands and thousands of dollars, even tens of thousands of dollars depending on your income, in high-tax states like Illinois or New York or Massachusetts or California. And those are, gee, I don't know, maybe a lot of them blue states, as it turns out. A lot of the states also where people are going to get hurt most with respect to that mortgage deduction are blue states. So this is, among other things that you have to be able to say about it, it's a favorable-to-the-red-states tax overhaul. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: I want to get to the politics of this. But before we get to that, Danielle, I want you to just also broad-strokes talk about the business side of this because this is really a lot of the prize for Republicans who have been eager to reform the business side of the tax code. They say this is what's going to jumpstart the economy, and this is what's going to deliver higher wages and jobs. So what is - I don't imagine there's a lot of corporate tax experts listening to our podcast, but if you are, welcome. So for the non-corporate tax expert, what does this bill do on the corporate side of the tax cuts? </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: It cuts corporate taxes. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: By how much? </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: I mean, from 35 to 20 percent. That is a big hit. And we can get into the, you know, the ins and outs of, you know, what else happens beyond that. But, I mean, that is important to keep in mind. Even though, you know, lots of people are going to focus on the individual income tax side, this is a huge part of this. It is going to be a hugely expensive part of this tax bill. And, you know, it's really kind of at the center of it, I would say. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: This is the prize. </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: Yeah. I mean, and on top of that, you know, you have this other thing - and I'm going to try not to allow people's eyes to glaze over here. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: (Laughter) OK. Give it your best shot. </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: All right. All right. So pass-through businesses... </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: Hoo (ph). </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: I know, we're all excited already. All right, pass-through businesses, I mean, this is a thing that really had a lot of analysts worried coming up to the rollout of this bill. And the reason is some businesses - if you are the sole proprietor of your business, you pay taxes through the individual income tax code, not that 35 percent corporate tax rate. So Republicans had said, well, we're going to put in a special rate for those people. But there were worries that, you know, people would say, well, now I'm an independent contractor. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: Right, abuse in the system. </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: Yes, absolutely. So what they did is there is a relatively complicated system that I'm not going to get into here but they - so they've introduced this 25 percent pass-through rate, but they have put in some, quote, unquote, \"guardrails\" to try to prevent people from gaming that. And I think that's going to be a big thing people are going to pay attention to in the coming weeks is, do we think that that is gameable or do we not? </p><p>I can tell you that the National Federation of Independent Business is another group that came out today, and they did not particularly like how this pass-through is being implemented. So there are some, you know, business groups who don't tend to be inimical to Republicans but who might not be happy about this. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: And for people who do want to see more about those numbers, you can go to npr.org. There's a lot of dissecting of the tax bill if you really want to dig deep. But before we turn the page and talk about the next thing, I just - we have to talk about the politics of this, right? It's November. Republicans have not delivered a lot of legislative wins. There was a very dramatic failure of the health care bill. And the things we've been hearing repeatedly is this is must-pass and it can't fail. Why can't it fail? What are the stakes here? </p><p>RON ELVING: (Laughter) Of course it can fail. Anything can fail in Congress. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: Believe me, I know. </p><p>RON ELVING: And we've seen must-pass bills again and again and again not be passed. </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO: Just this year. </p><p>RON ELVING: Just this year. And now, of course, we're hearing that this is the be-all and end-all of the Republicans holding their House and Senate majorities next year. All of that talk is clearly overblown. We don't know yet what the political circumstances one year from today when we're on the brink of that mid-term election will be. We could be talking about something totally different. </p><p>But for the moment, we do know this is the biggest game in town, and that politically, the Republicans feel they have to deliver on their promise of a big, big corporate tax cut that is supposedly going to create a lot of jobs. And this is going to be the real payoff of the bill, not so much the middle class tax cut which appears to be kind of, average it out, maybe a hundred bucks a month for a typical family, and that's if you buy what Paul Ryan said. So a hundred bucks a month for the average family? That's not what this has all been about. What it's all about is the corporate tax cut to create jobs. That's the big delivery for Donald Trump. He needs to deliver jobs for his Congress, for their re-election and for his own re-election. </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO: And more short term, I mean, this is what Republicans are supposed to be good at. I mean, they are supposed to be the ones who, if nothing else, can, you know, deliver on tax cuts. Taxes is what they talk about. They're money guys, right? And when it comes a tax overhaul, this is coming at the end of a year in which Republicans in the Senate and House have been unable to pass a repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act, which they failed on three times in a very high-profile way. </p><p>And there are lots of fissures, lots of cracks within the Republican political apparatus. And right now, Donald Trump is the most popular figure within the Republican Party. It ain't Mitch McConnell. It ain't Paul Ryan. And we've seen <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>turn on both of them in a heartbeat if needed. And, you know, if they are unable to pass this tax bill, who knows what that could do to that relationship? </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: And if they do though, that's a pretty big win for <person><nameText>President Trump. </nameText></person></p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: It is. </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO: It's at least something for them to build on. </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: Right. But speaking of the fissures that Domenico was talking about - and I think this can't be stated enough - I think one of the big questions here is, you know, what is the cost of this bill and how it is paid for? You know, one of the experts I talked to this morning said, you know, I look at this and I'm skeptical that this can be paid for. And, you know, on the Republican side, you have plenty of people who really care about fiscal responsibility, as they call it, about the deficit, about blowing a hole in the debt. And, you know, there is good reason for that. </p><p>You can make the argument because, you know, the question is this tax cut that you think is going to boost the economy or be rocket fuel, as our president says, very well may boost the economy. But long term, if you blow a hole in the debt, then do you slow down the economy? And that is a big question that some right-leaning economists have wondered about. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: I would say the party that cares about the deficit is the party that's not in governing control. That's the party that always feels the most passionate about the deficit. </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: Yeah. And we've suddenly seen that from the Democrats this week. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: So we should also caution that this is the first in a lot of steps that have to happen before this bill can move forward. This was just the House unveiling of the bill today. It's got to move through committee next week, the floor after that. The Senate still has to pass it, but we do know the stated goal. As of today, they want to pass this bill out of both chambers before Thanksgiving - in three weeks. </p><p>RON ELVING: Or just the House before Thanksgiving. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: No, they want it out of the Senate as well before Thanksgiving. </p><p>RON ELVING: Oh, come on. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: I know. </p><p>RON ELVING: Oh, they aren't serious. </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO: Didn't he say by Christmas he wants a signing? </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: No. The goal is... </p><p>RON ELVING: I think it's House in Thanksgiving. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: It's not. The goal by - John Cornyn this week said the goal is to get it out of the House and Senate before Thanksgiving to give themselves December to get it through conference, get a final bill, get it to the president. </p><p>RON ELVING: Oh, OK. All right. You mean the first... </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: Yes. So it's going to be a rough and tumble three weeks, and we're going to be hearing a lot more about it. And before we go - because we're talking about Christmas - this is how <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>described the tax bill. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)        </p><p>DONALD TRUMP: We are giving them a big, beautiful Christmas present in the form of a tremendous tax cut. It will be the biggest cut in the history of our country. It'll also be tax reform, and it'll create jobs. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: So we're going to take a quick break. We're going to tap out Domenico. We're going to tap in justice reporter Ryan Lucas, who's going to join us to talk about all things Russia, <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>response to the terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people and, of course, Can't Let It Go. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)        </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: We're back. And there is something else <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>wants Congress to work on now, one very specific slice of immigration. Less than 24 hours after a man drove a truck onto a bike path in New York City that killed eight people, Trump again called for - in his words - extreme vetting. He said this. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)        </p><p>DONALD TRUMP: So we want to immediately work with Congress on the diversity lottery program on terminating it, getting rid of it. We want a merit-based program where people come into our country based on merit. And we want to get rid of chain migration. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: Trump is singling out the diversity visa program and attacking Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in the meantime because the man accused of driving the truck came to the U.S. under the program in 2010. He's originally from Uzbekistan. Trump has also said he would consider sending him to Guantanamo Bay. And Trump tweeted late last night in all caps that he should get the death penalty. There's a lot to talk about here. Let's just start with the diversity visa program. Who wants to explain what that is? </p><p>RON ELVING: Well, I can talk about it a little bit. It's a lottery system that lets in 50,000 people, get an opportunity to come to the country on a visa, get a green card - out of something like 9 million people who were interesting in doing this last year. It was put in place in the 1990 adjustments to our immigration law, signed into law by George H.W. Bush. And Chuck Schumer's connection to it was that he was one of the sponsors to that 1990 law. However, more recently, 2013, Chuck Schumer was pushing for legislation that would have eliminated the diversity visa program as part of a comprehensive immigration overhaul. So it's not exactly something that was originally his baby alone and certainly not something that he's been associated with more recently. He's been trying to eliminate it because many of the circumstances that created the perceived need for it back in the 1980s have changed a great deal. </p><p>RYAN LUCAS: I will say, having spent a very long time overseas, that this is a program that foreigners like, they appreciate. It provides people an avenue to get to a country that they very much admire and an avenue for people who often don't have another way to get here. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: So, of course, this accused attacker used the diversity visa program to enter the country and eventually obtain a green card. And the president is saying let's get rid of this program, but it doesn't sound like there's much appetite to start an immigration fight again. </p><p>RON ELVING: This was originally put in place largely on the impetus of people who felt that the law as it stood in the 1980s was disadvantaging people from Italy and Ireland. And it was representatives who particularly cared about those nationalities who were pressing for it. In years since, it has come to be used primarily from people - from Africa and Asia. The proportions have changed a great deal. But this is really a minor part of the overall immigration program. </p><p>It's not as though people who have come in on these visas have been an especially great problem or have been rife with terrorists. This is someone who's apparently been radicalized, as best we can tell, in the period of time since he came here in 2010. So this, in a very real sense, has very little to do with immigration law. Yes, this is a person who came from another country. This is an immigrant. But it does not have that much to do with the fine points of immigration law and which program which people come in under. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: So there's this debate reviving about how he got here, but now we're also talking about, what do you do with people like this when they come here and commit a crime, specifically a terrorist attack? And the president seems to have at least - be open to the idea that he could be sent to the military prison at Guantanamo Bay. </p><p>RYAN LUCAS: Yes, the president did signal that he was open to that idea. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: He was asked about it, correct? He was - he said this in response to a question. And he said it was something that he could consider sending him to Guantanamo Bay. </p><p>RYAN LUCAS: He could consider it. It would face legal challenge were he to try to do so. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: Why? </p><p>RYAN LUCAS: Because Sayfullo Saipov was here legally. And according to legal experts that I've spoken with, that gives him constitutional protections including due process. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: To be tried in the U.S. court system? </p><p>RYAN LUCAS: Yes. This would most definitely face legal challenges that would make that very difficult to do. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: It also just seems like calling to send someone to Gitmo is just sort of a visceral emotional appeal to wanting to go after these people, right? I mean, this is classic Trump. He's tough on law and order and crime, and he is going to crack down on terrorism. </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: Right. And it's possible he heard that, went, you know, it's a possibility, yes. You know, and that perhaps the weight of that did not occur to him at the time. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: Let's listen to a little bit of the president, particularly because I think this is when he uses it as an opportunity to say we just have to stop being politically correct when we talk about these things. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)        </p><p>DONALD TRUMP: We have to get much tougher. We have to get much smarter. And we have to get much less politically correct. We're so politically correct that we're afraid to do anything, and that's not only our country, that's other countries too that are having very similar problems. And we have to get tough. We have to get smart. We have to do what's right to protect our citizens. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: And here's more of how he talked about this. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)        </p><p>DONALD TRUMP: We also have to come up with punishment that's far quicker and far greater than the punishment these animals are getting right now. They'll go through court for years. At the end, they'll be - who knows what happens? We need quick justice. And we need strong justice, much quicker and much stronger than we have right now because what we have right now is a joke. And it's a laughingstock. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: Ryan? </p><p>RYAN LUCAS: So two things on this. One, on the question of Gitmo, the U.S. has never sent someone arrested in the U.S. to Guantanamo. Everyone who has been sent to Guantanamo has been picked up overseas. The second thing is calling the U.S. justice system a joke for people who work in the justice system is offensive. And on the question of terrorism, the U.S. justice system and the federal court system has proven quite effective at prosecuting terrorism suspects. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: Well, that's what's so interesting to me. I mean, we're doing a really good job at prosecuting terrorists. It's not as if the justice system is failing on that front. </p><p>RYAN LUCAS: No. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: All right. Well, let's leave it there for now. I'm sure we're going to have a lot more to talk about this. I want to move on to the latest in the Russia investigations. There is a great podcast in your feed from Monday about the first charges to come out of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. That involves former campaign aides to Donald Trump. Paul Manafort and Rick Gates were both indicted on 12 counts, although we should note none of those counts were related to their work on the Trump campaign. And we also talk about one-time campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos, we learned who pleaded guilty earlier this month to lying to the FBI about his contacts with the Russians during the campaign. </p><p>So, Ryan, that was Monday. </p><p>RYAN LUCAS: That was Monday. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: What has happened on this front since then? </p><p>RYAN LUCAS: Well, Sam Clovis, who was an adviser to the Trump campaign, withdrew from consideration as a top scientist at the Agriculture Department, where he was under consideration. His confirmation hearing, in fact, was supposed to be next week. Clovis decided to withdraw after it became clear on Monday that one of the senior campaign advisers that Papadopoulos was corresponding with about his efforts to contact the Russians and his ongoing communications with the Russians was one Sam Clovis. So this is fallout from the Mueller investigation that is now kind of having ripple effects across Washington and the Trump administration itself. </p><p>RON ELVING: You know, we might want to add here, actually, Susan, that the tentacles of this are reaching out in directions that a lot of people would not have foreseen. For example, Tony Podesta, the brother of John Podesta, who ran the Clinton campaign last year, has now left his company, the Podesta Group, because he had worked for Paul Manafort at one point and been involved with Paul Manafort in a business way. So that being touched on by this Mueller investigation of Paul Manafort has knocked down a major figure in Democratic lobbying circles here in Washington the same week that it brought down Sam Clovis or at least ended his potential role in the Trump administration. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: It also sort of, I think, inoculates any accusations that Robert Mueller is leading any kind of a partisan investigation - where it just seems to me to indicate that he's willing to go wherever he wants to go. </p><p>RON ELVING: And why not? And why not? He's well-known for his time as FBI director. He is well-known to be a lifelong Republican. So he feels as though he can pretty much do whatever he sees the evidence leading him to do. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: And, again, there's a great podcast in your feed that goes into far more detail on this. Please, please check it out. And in other Russia-investigation-related news, lawyers for Facebook, Twitter and Google testified before the House and Senate intelligence committees yesterday and the Senate judiciary committee the day before. Here's Senator Mark Warner. He's the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)        </p><p>MARK WARNER: Candidly, your companies know more about Americans in many ways than the United States government does. And the idea that you had no idea of any of this was happening strains credibility. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: Ryan, you were covering all these hearings. What did you learn? </p><p>RYAN LUCAS: We got a lot of numbers that we didn't have before. Facebook, for example, said that upwards of 150 million Americans saw Russian-sponsored ads, Russian-sponsored pages, Russian-sponsored content between 2015 and 2017. That is a huge number. They also tried to put this in perspective by saying the amount of content that was linked back to Russian bots, Russian trolls is actually a sliver of the full amount of content that is on Facebook. </p><p>So they acknowledge that there were large numbers of Americans who saw this stuff. But in general, this is a very, very small amount of Facebook's overall traffic. And that goes for Twitter, as well, and Google. You had all three of the big social media companies on the Hill. And they all basically said the same thing. They came up with numbers that were big but then tried to put it into the context of the broader scheme of things. This is just a sliver. </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: To give that even a bit more context, 150 million Americans saw those ads. Now, there's no specification if those people were all voter eligible or whether they were all voters, but around 136 million people voted for someone for president in the 2016 election. So just to give you some sense of how big that 150 million is, it's bigger than the number of people who cast votes. That's huge. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: Were the lawyers that showed up - I just am curious about, like, their posture. Did they come in defiant? Were they apologetic? Were they - you know, how were they sort of presenting themselves to Congress? Like, oh, we're sorry. Or was it like, this isn't our responsibility? </p><p>RYAN LUCAS: There was kind of all of those things across the spectrum. There was certainly an acknowledgement from all of the companies that what has gone on - what the Russians did on their networks - is a problem. They don't like to see that sort of abuse. And they want to address it. They are very conscious of the fact that they have come under a lot of scrutiny in the past couple of months. Their public image has certainly taken a knock. And they are very wary of regulation, possible legislation. There's already been one bill that's been proposed by Mark Warner and Amy Klobuchar and John McCain, three senators, that would impose the same sort of transparency requirements on online advertising on political issues that you have for print and broadcast. </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: So what did we learn, if anything, about solutions, about what they're doing to combat this and what works to combat this? </p><p>RYAN LUCAS: The companies all talked about self-imposing greater transparency on political advertising. They want to create a database where you can go back and see who paid for what ad and what other ads they've sponsored. They've talked about using artificial intelligence to try to weed out fake accounts and automated accounts, accounts from people who are not who they say they are. But this is a really thorny problem. There are no easy solutions to this. </p><p>And this is something that the general counsel of Facebook, Colin Stretch, said. Like, this is bigger than just these three companies. This is a problem that stretches across the internet. You have RT and Sputnik. These are two media companies sponsored by the Russian government that have a reach beyond the internet. RT is on cable providers. This is not just online stuff. This is a very tricky thing to deal with. There are no easy answers. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: What is the argument these companies are offering for why they shouldn't be subjected to the same disclosures that broadcast channels are, especially in a modern world where so much digital content is what drives most of our election information? </p><p>RON ELVING: Because they're not - I'm putting this in quotation marks - \"media companies,\" unquote. We're not media companies. We can't be regulated as though we were media. We're just platforms. We're just a place where people, you know, have a chance to transmit messages. We're not media companies. We're not producing anything. We're not telling anybody what to think. And at another point, you know, they're saying we didn't have any way of putting together who the identities of these groups were with the messages they were putting out, at which point Senator Al Franken had a typical characteristic moment of fun by saying, is it not true that you were being paid at one point in rubles? </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>RON ELVING: Did you ask yourself why a group was paying in rubles? Was that not a pair of data points you might have connected? </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: It's a reminder, too, that these are still relatively young industries. And they haven't been subjected to the kind of rigorous regulation that Congress has put other broadcast industries to. And I think that we may be seeing a sea change in that there's going to be a lot more regulation coming out. </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: Absolutely. </p><p>RYAN LUCAS: People have always been kind of starry-eyed about these big tech companies. And that is - that's changing. </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: Totally. I mean, if you ask them, you know, the binary question - yes, no - are you a media company? I mean, you're leaving out - like, what if there's another classification we're just going to have to create or that someone will have to? I mean, that very well could happen in the coming years. </p><p>RON ELVING: A social media company. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: So much more to learn here. And thank you for covering it for us, Ryan, so I didn't have to (laughter). </p><p>RYAN LUCAS: My pleasure. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: We're going to leave it there. But before we leave you, we have to, of course, do Can't Let It Go, where we all share the one thing we cannot stop thinking about this week in politics or otherwise. I'm invoking host privileges. I'm going to go first, unless anybody has any objections. </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: Fine. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: I think after that conversation, we need a feel-good story. So I've got one for you. Congratulations to the Houston Astros, who won the World Series. Not really here to talk about baseball, but congrats to you and to all the fans who are listening. My favorite anecdote that came out of the World Series is the story of Evan Gattis. He is a player on the Astros. He's the designated hitter. And he's - out of every sort of sports story, there's a hero - right? - or somebody who has the rough-and-tumble American story. </p><p>And he had just, I think, a very tough young life in which he was a really promising baseball player, and his life kind of just went sideways. He had some drug problems. He had - he was crippled by anxiety. He had to go in and out of rehab. He spent several years just kind of wandering the country, working odd jobs. He was a ski lift operator. He was homeless at one point and living on the streets in New York City. And he had this moment where he called a friend and said, I want to get back into baseball. And he was so talented that after all that time, he was still able to get back in. And he was drafted by the Atlanta Braves in 2010. He was traded to the Astros in 2015. </p><p>And last night, he won his first World Series on a team - that is the first time that they can win the World Series. And it's just a great story. It's a great American success story - and I think particularly because we have a lot of younger people that listen to the podcast. It's a good reminder that, sometimes, you have to have the worst day of your life to have the best day of your life. And I like that story. </p><p>RON ELVING: Great turnaround story. On the other hand... </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: Ron, what do you have? </p><p>RON ELVING: Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the bookstore, there's another 2016 campaign saga, this one coming to us from Donna Brazile, who came on to be the interim head of the Democratic National Committee after the Democratic National Convention last year. </p><p>We all remember that Debbie Wasserman Schultz, congresswoman from Florida, was kind of thrown out of the job just before the convention when it was revealed through hacked emails that Russians hacked and leaked through WikiLeaks that the DNC had been putting a very heavy thumb on the scales - no surprise - all the way through the campaign against Bernie Sanders, the independent running strongly for the Democratic presidential nomination and in favor, of course, of Hillary Clinton, who was - no one's surprise - pretty much the best choice of the DNC from early on. </p><p>But now we learn from Donna Brazile that it was not only their preference for her. But the DNC had become kind of a wholly owned subsidiary of the Hillary Clinton campaign back into 2015, when the campaign took over a $2 million debt for the DNC. And they signed a fundraising agreement that essentially joined their efforts, which was also offered for other candidates but signed in special terms with Hillary Clinton because she took over these debts. And after that, really, the committee was just an extension of the Hillary Clinton campaign decision-making apparatus. And Donna Brazile learned all this after she saw the books when she became the new interim chairman of the DNC in September of 2016 and shared all that information with Bernie Sanders. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: Does not sound like Debbie Wasserman Schultz is going to want to read this book. </p><p>RON ELVING: This book is not particularly going to make the day of Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz, although much of this information was already pretty widely known. This is putting a pretty fine point on it - and blaming her for the debt that the DNC had run in the first place for failing to raise enough money to keep the Democratic National Committee afloat. Now, this is only one part of a book that also goes into many other things that happened in 2016 that Donna Brazile has information to report on. But it is the thing that is being teased out as Politico prepares to run excerpts from this at the end of this week. And then the book comes out, and it'll be in your bookstore. So you can go in and pick that up alongside all the other tell-all books from 2016. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: Donna's got some things to get off her chest. Danielle, what do you have to get off your chest? </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: I think we should talk about beer. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: OK. </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: More specifically, we should talk about Sarah Huckabee Sanders talking about beer because at the Monday press briefing at the White House, Sarah Huckabee Sanders - you know, she had a lot to talk about. There was a little thing about a guy named Paul Manafort that had just broken. </p><p>RYAN LUCAS: Oh, right. Right. Right. </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: And so she got up to the podium. And she said, you know, I've got to start with the thing that I know you all want to ask about. And she started like this. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)        </p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS: Suppose that every day, 10 people - for our purposes, we'll say reporters - go out for beer. And the bill for all 10 comes to $100. If these 10 reporters paid their tab every night the way we pay our taxes, it would go something like this. The first four, the poorest, would pay nothing. The fifth would pay $1. The sixth would pay $3. The seventh would pay $7. The eighth would pay $12. The ninth would pay $18. The tenth, the richest, would pay $59. So that's what they decided to do. </p><p>The 10 reporters drank in the bar every day and seemed quite happy with the arrangement until, one day, the bar owner threw them a curve ball. Since you're all such good customers, he said, I'm going to reduce the cost of your daily beer by $20. Drinks for the 10 reporters would now cost just $80. The group still wanted to pay their bill the way we pay our taxes. So the first four were unaffected. They would still drink for free. But what about the other six? How can they divide the $20 windfall so that everyone would get their fair share. These are the reporters after all, so they're concerned with fairness. They realize... </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: So she goes on like this. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: And on and on. </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: And on and on. Basically, let me just give you the too long; didn't read here because it is too long. It's apparently four minutes. Our producer just told us. But she's essentially hammering home the point that the richest people in America bear a relatively large burden of America's income tax revenue. So she goes on to say, you know, that these 10 people for some reason by 10 beers that are $10 each. Sure. Why not? And that, also, they decide for some reason to pay their tab the same way that the American tax system is set up. And so therefore, blah, blah, blah, blah. Moral of the story - rich people pay a lot. And so on and so forth. </p><p>RON ELVING: The moral - I thought the moral of the story was that the richest reporters should pay for everybody's beer. </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: Well (laughter)... </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: The whole thing is a false premise because when 10 reporters go for beers, they expense it. </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: That's absolutely true. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: It's a terrible analogy to start with. </p><p>RON ELVING: So several of America's richest corporations pay for the beer. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: It should be, like, when 10 accountants go for a beer. </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: Perhaps, yeah. </p><p>RON ELVING: Much better. </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: So aside from the fact that I sat and lsitened to this kind of in stunned silence, just thinking, how long this go? - also, tax Twitter was just having a field day with it. Like, so is this after-beer income or no? And it just - it was endless and delightful jokes at a time when real, actual, serious news was happening and a serious tax bill was coming that we were all awaiting. So I - it delighted me. I can't let that go. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: More beer - less tax policy. </p><p>RON ELVING: There's tax Twitter? </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: Oh, there is. </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: There's everything Twitter. There's even border-adjustment-tax Twitter. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: You want to find tax Twitter? I'll tell you how. #TRIH - Tax Reform is Hard. That's the hashtag for tax Twitter. </p><p>RON ELVING: #TRIH? </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: So if you ever want to go down the loophole... </p><p>RON ELVING: See, I thought that was the hashtag for trih (ph). </p><p>RYAN LUCAS: Let me write that down. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: That's a thing. If you - tax Twitter is a real thing. Ryan, what can you not let go this week? </p><p>RYAN LUCAS: So this is something that - it's not that I can't let it go this week. It's I have not been able to let it go for several months. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: OK. </p><p>RYAN LUCAS: I learned about it this summer. I have been sharing it with people left and right. Sometimes, they appreciate it. Sometimes, they don't appreciate it quite as much as I do. There's this guy who goes by the name of spiritgiants on Reddit who has taken to using either emails or letters or statements from members of the Trump world and setting them to song. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: Interesting. </p><p>RYAN LUCAS: And the greatest hit of this is based off of Don Jr.'s email exchange with Rob Goldstone about the meeting with the Russian lawyer at Trump Tower in June of 2016 - very apropos this week, since we had the first charges in the Mueller investigation. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: And what's the clutch line in the email? </p><p>RYAN LUCAS: I love it, especially later in the summer. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: (Laughter). </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"I LOVE IT (ESPECIALLY LATER IN THE SUMMER)\")        </p><p>SPIRIT GIANTS: (Singing) Thanks, Rob. I appreciate that. I am on the road at the moment. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: It's got, like, an Avett Brothers kind of... </p><p>RON ELVING: Yeah, it does. It does. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: A little, like, Americana folk getting in there. </p><p>RON ELVING: I'm expecting him to burst out in harmony here. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: Yeah. Like a... </p><p>RON ELVING: Big moment, yeah. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"I LOVE IT (ESPECIALLY LATER IN THE SUMMER)\")        </p><p>SPIRIT GIANTS: (Singing) Seems we have some time. And if it's what you say, I love it, especially later in the summer. </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: It's, like, summer pop. </p><p>RON ELVING: (Imitating mandolin sounds). </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: It feels like a road trip song, you know? </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: Yeah. It's, like, windows down. </p><p>RON ELVING: (Imitating mandolin sounds). </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: It's, like, trying-to-subvert-a-nation pop. </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN: Guys, I think Ron wants to take a solo. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>RON ELVING: (Imitating mandolin sounds). </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF SPIRIT GIANTS SONG, \"I LOVE IT (ESPECIALLY LATER IN THE SUMMER)\")        </p><p><person><nameText>SUSAN DAVIS</nameText></person>: All right.

They've accomplished something nearly impossible - getting Democrats and Republicans to agree on something. in both major parties want to rein in or even break up the companies, albeit for some very different reasons. Standing in the way are antiquated antitrust laws in desperate need of an update.</p><p>The U.S. Department of Justice last week announced that it will investigate whether these major tech companies have become too big and too powerful.</p><p>One would be hard pressed to argue that competition hasn't suffered under the behemoths. Upstarts that pose a small threat may wind up bought out and assimilated. What social media could challenge Facebook's 2.4 billion monthly users? Instagram? Facebook bought it.</p><p>Republicans claim that the big tech companies control the major venues for online speech and silence conservative voices. Democrats claim that they are stifling innovation and harming workers. Members of both parties worry that they are gobbling up people's private information and using it for who knows what.</p><p>Some of those claims are stronger than others, but whatever one thinks of them, there's no denying that regulators need to take a serious look at whether consumers are being harmed. Facebook's $5 billion settlement over consumer privacy says yes.</p><p>The Justice Department investigation (run by the Republican Trump administration) and House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust hearings are good starts, so long as they remain objective, not fixated on partisan narratives.</p><p>One challenge is whether antitrust laws are up to the task. The laws were originally designed to deal with railroads, not complex tech conglomerates.</p><p>Whether Congress is able to rewrite antitrust laws for the 21st century remains to be seen. Senators and representatives, it is fair to say, don't always demonstrate cultural and technological nimbleness. Many West Coast lawmakers, such as Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Medina, who worked for Microsoft before running for office, are keyed into the industry. They must help their colleagues better understand the complex issues and write laws that will protect consumers and encourage a modern, healthy marketplace.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SEATTM-ba988238b22211e996ba73dc851a7f2a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SEATTM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WPD-RCS1-JBKM-D0H0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8206</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"367\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Seattle Times Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Seattle Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 30, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The complaint seeks unspecified damages, including possible punitive damages.</p><p>Facebook and Cambridge Analytica did not immediately respond on Wednesday to requests for comment.</p><p>A former Facebook manager who was responsible for policing the network's data handling procedures in 2011-2012 said he had warned senior executives about the issue.</p><p>The manager, Sandy Parakilas, said he had told them that Facebook's failure to police how outside software developers used its data put the company at risk of major data breaches. \"There was very little detection or enforcement,\" he told a British parliamentary committee via videolink.</p><p>Swing voters</p><p>The academic who provided the data, psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, told the BBC that Cambridge Analytica had greatly exaggerated its role in Trump's victory.</p><p>Facebook and Cambridge Analytica have both blamed Kogan, who gathered the data by running a survey app on Facebook. Kogan combines the roles of an academic at Cambridge University and a web entrepreneur based in San Francisco.</p><p>U.S. political campaigns collect large amounts of data, hoping to target swing voters sympathetic to their message. Cambridge Analytica stood out for the scale of claims in its marketing materials to \"collect up to 5,000 data points on over 220 million Americans\" in all its activities.</p><p>It uses techniques based on personality traits and then applies analytic tools to pinpoint supporters.</p><p>However, Kogan said the services provided by the consultancy had been greatly exaggerated.</p><p>\"I think what Cambridge Analytica has tried to sell is magic, and they've made claims that this is incredibly accurate and it tells you everything there is to tell about you. But I think the reality is it's not that,\" he said.</p><p>Arron Banks, who campaigned for Britain to leave the European Union in a 2016 referendum, also questioned the value of psychologically-based data.</p><p>Banks told Reuters that Cambridge Analytica had unsuccessfully pitched for work with his Leave.eu campaign group. \"I think they are nothing more than a company that places Facebook ads and shrouds in a sort of mystery,\" he said.</p><p>Kogan's application, \"thisisyourdigitallife,\" offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as \"a research app used by psychologists.\"</p><p>Kogan said he had gathered the data in 2014. He was then approached by Cambridge Analytica who provided the legal advice around its use, he added.</p><p>Facebook says Kogan then violated its policies by passing the data to Cambridge Analytica for commercial use, saying on Friday he \"lied to us.\" Cambridge Analytica said it destroyed the data once it realized the information did not adhere to data protection rules.</p><p>\"My view is that I'm being basically used as a scapegoat by both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,\" said Kogan. \"We were assured by Cambridge Analytica that everything was perfectly legal and within the limits of the terms of service.\"</p><p>Cambridge Analytica has denied various allegations made about its business practices in recent media reports.</p><p>British Prime Minister Theresa May said she backed an investigation into the consultancy, while the German government also expressed its concern.</p><p>In Europe the tax affairs of tech giants have become a hot political issue. On Wednesday the European Commission proposed rules to make digital companies pay their fair share of tax, with Facebook and its peers set to foot much of the bill.</p><p>Personality test</p><p>Alexander Nix, the head of Cambridge Analytica, said in a secretly recorded video broadcast on Tuesday that his company had played a decisive role in Trump's election victory. He was suspended by the company shortly before the video was shown on Britain's Channel 4 News.</p><p>Around 270,000 people downloaded the app, Facebook said. The app scored the results of each quiz and gathered up data from test-takers' Facebook accounts. However, it also pulled down the data of their Facebook friends, vastly increasing the size of the sample.</p><p>Kogan put the number of app users as closer to 200,000.</p><p>The researcher said, in total, he passed the data of around 30 million American Facebook users to SCL, a government and military contractor that is the parent of Cambridge Analytica. Media reports have put the total number of Facebook profiles collected at around 50 million users.</p><p>U.S. and European lawmakers have demanded an explanation of how Cambridge Analytica gained access to user data in 2014 and why Facebook failed to inform its users.</p><p>Facebook said it had been told by the Federal Trade Commission, the leading U.S. consumer regulator, that it would receive a letter this week with questions about the data acquired by Cambridge Analytica. It said it had no indication of a formal investigation.

The complaint seeks unspecified damages, including possible punitive damages.</p><p>Facebook and Cambridge Analytica did not immediately respond on Wednesday to requests for comment.</p><p> A former Facebook manager who was responsible for policing the network's data handling procedures in 2011-2012 said he had warned senior executives about the issue.</p><p> The manager, Sandy Parakilas, said he had told them that Facebook's failure to police how outside software developers used its data put the company at risk of major data breaches. \"There was very little detection or enforcement,\" he told a British parliamentary committee via videolink.</p><p> Swing voters</p><p> The academic who provided the data, psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, told the BBC that Cambridge Analytica had greatly exaggerated its role in Trump's victory.</p><p>Facebook and Cambridge Analytica have both blamed Kogan, who gathered the data by running a survey app on Facebook. Kogan combines the roles of an academic at Cambridge University and a web entrepreneur based in San Francisco.</p><p> U.S. political campaigns collect large amounts of data, hoping to target swing voters sympathetic to their message. Cambridge Analytica stood out for the scale of claims in its marketing materials to \"collect up to 5,000 data points on over 220 million Americans\" in all its activities.</p><p> It uses techniques based on personality traits and then applies analytic tools to pinpoint supporters.</p><p> However, Kogan said the services provided by the consultancy had been greatly exaggerated.</p><p> \u201cI think what Cambridge Analytica has tried to sell is magic, and they've made claims that this is incredibly accurate and it tells you everything there is to tell about you. But I think the reality is it's not that,\u201d he said.</p><p> Arron Banks, who campaigned for Britain to leave the European Union in a 2016 referendum, also questioned the value of psychologically-based data.</p><p> Banks told Reuters that Cambridge Analytica had unsuccessfully pitched for work with his Leave.eu campaign group. \u201cI think they are nothing more than a company that places Facebook ads and shrouds in a sort of mystery,\u201d he said.</p><p> Kogan's application, \"thisisyourdigitallife,\" offered a personality prediction and billed itself on Facebook as \"a research app used by psychologists.\"</p><p> Kogan said he had gathered the data in 2014. He was then approached by Cambridge Analytica who provided the legal advice around its use, he added.</p><p>Facebook says Kogan then violated its policies by passing the data to Cambridge Analytica for commercial use, saying on Friday he \u201clied to us.\u201d Cambridge Analytica said it destroyed the data once it realized the information did not adhere to data protection rules.</p><p> \"My view is that I'm being basically used as a scapegoat by both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,\" said Kogan. \"We were assured by Cambridge Analytica that everything was perfectly legal and within the limits of the terms of service.\"</p><p> Cambridge Analytica has denied various allegations made about its business practices in recent media reports.</p><p> British Prime Minister Theresa May said she backed an investigation into the consultancy, while the German government also expressed its concern.</p><p> In Europe the tax affairs of tech giants have become a hot political issue. On Wednesday the European Commission proposed rules to make digital companies pay their fair share of tax, with Facebook and its peers set to foot much of the bill.</p><p> Personality test</p><p> Alexander Nix, the head of Cambridge Analytica, said in a secretly recorded video broadcast on Tuesday that his company had played a decisive role in Trump's election victory. He was suspended by the company shortly before the video was shown on Britain's Channel 4 News.</p><p> Around 270,000 people downloaded the app, Facebook said. The app scored the results of each quiz and gathered up data from test-takers' Facebook accounts. However, it also pulled down the data of their Facebook friends, vastly increasing the size of the sample.</p><p> Kogan put the number of app users as closer to 200,000.</p><p> The researcher said, in total, he passed the data of around 30 million American Facebook users to SCL, a government and military contractor that is the parent of Cambridge Analytica. Media reports have put the total number of Facebook profiles collected at around 50 million users.</p><p> U.S. and European lawmakers have demanded an explanation of how Cambridge Analytica gained access to user data in 2014 and why Facebook failed to inform its users.</p><p>Facebook said it had been told by the Federal Trade Commission, the leading U.S. consumer regulator, that it would receive a letter this week with questions about the data acquired by Cambridge Analytica. It said it had no indication of a formal investigation.

If she lives up to that criticism it will be a good thing for the economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The establishment in this town is the most progressive I've ever encountered. In other cities, Durkan would sit solidly center-left. She may flunk the purity test of the even more left-leaning City Council, but her pragmatism is a necessary counterweight.</p><p>With this in mind, here's a potential do-list for the new mayor.</p><p>Amazon. Yes, kiss the ring. Meaning: Build a constructive relationship with the city's largest private-sector employer and a huge generator of taxes and investment. It's scandalous that this had been allowed to wither before the company announced it would build a second \"equal\" headquarters elsewhere.</p><p>Think we're being taken to the cleaners? Some 238 localities in North America vying for HQ2 would love to be similarly processed, pressed and delivered. And they'll pay for the privilege. We got the original headquarters through a hometown company's organic growth, no big incentive packages.</p><p>Sure, I'd love a country with tough enforcement against the market power of giants. Until that happens, Seattle would be suicidal to unilaterally disarm. The region has two of the five Big Tech behemoths. That's a huge advantage in the world as it is, however we might wish it to be.</p><p>Sure, Amazon was among the biggest donors to the pro-Durkan war chest of the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber. But consider me un-appalled. Amazon - and all the jobs and small businesses it supports - has a lot riding on some sanity at City Hall. It's not like we're talking about the Koch brothers. Durkan deserves some credit for independence until she shows otherwise.</p><p>In the end, barring a breakup, Amazon won't have two equal headquarters. A full-spectrum effort is necessary to make sure the real home base remains Seattle, and that includes political leadership.</p><p>Other companies. Attention also must be paid to other large employers and institutions, their needs, concerns and competitive issues. An ecosystem of large headquarters and important branch locations in a diverse economy ensures a much healthier small-business environment, too.</p><p>This is not an either-or issue, if one is interested in social justice. Progressive cities and states typically have much stronger economies than those that emphasize low taxes and light regulation. But a balance is needed.</p><p>Unlike most cities, the mayor's office here doesn't need to focus on business recruitment. The city's appeal does that. But retention is an important issue and one that requires a fresh look. A head tax on large employers is especially wrongheaded, and would encourage them to send employees - and their tax dollars - to suburbs hungry for Seattle to do a face-plant.</p><p>Housing. Like other extremely desirable cities, especially those with limited area, Seattle is expensive. But barring a catastrophe that would most hurt the less affluent, this is the new reality. We're not going back to Seattle circa 1985. Life is unfair. I want to live in London but can't afford it. I want a pony.</p><p>The most effective remedy is to think and act regionally. Parts of the metropolitan area are significantly more affordable, especially in the South Sound. The mayor can play a major role in speeding up and expanding rail transit to provide fast, frequent connections between these areas and the employment centers of Seattle (and pushing for faster links to Ballard and West Seattle, too).</p><p>Beyond that, the city's future is dense and vertical in more places. Midtown Manhattan was once farmland. But this needs to be carried out with care. Single-family neighborhoods are not the enemy.</p><p>Continuing some version of the Housing Affordability and Livability plan is also necessary. It's not perfect. But unlike the Bay Area, Seattle is actually building.</p><p>Workforce development. At the risk of quoting Ronald Reagan in bluetown, \"the best social program is a job.\" But with dramatic structural changes in the economy, offshoring, automation and the destruction of unions, a job alone is not enough.</p><p>Seattle especially benefits from the University of Washington in producing high-skilled tech talent at the top end. The challenge is lower-skilled people who can get stuck in poorly paid jobs that lack the ladder up that once existed.</p><p>As with so much else here, some realism is necessary. City government can do only so much to change this condition. The $15 minimum wage was a start, made possible by a thriving private-sector economy. Otherwise, the most important initiatives must come from the federal government, such as major investment in infrastructure and education (a longshot in this era of total GOP control). States can do some (a better shot now that we've become part of the Blue Wall).</p><p>Still, the mayor can be an important bridge between community colleges and the private sector in job training. Finding the way to move more service-sector jobs into higher skills and creativity, hence better wages, is an opportunity Seattle should seize.</p><p>Connectivity. It's appalling that even in this tech town most people have few options for high-speed broadband internet. Yet efforts to build city nets, or even regulate the giants more, run up against the lobbying and legal power of the cartel giants.</p><p>It's a fight worth waging. If Chattanooga can build a gigabit-per-second fiber network, Seattle can do it. At the least, the mayor could lead a city effort to expand to Google Fiber options.</p><p>Durkan is untested in this type of executive role. As her predecessor Mike McGinn learned, to his chagrin, \"there's no school for mayors.\"</p><p>Seattle can't take its past success for granted. It certainly didn't happen because of the genius of the City Council, but because of luck, geography and, especially, generations of stewardship and reinvention led by both business and political leaders.</p><p>These good times won't last, either. The threats range from North Korea and Donald Trump to a downturn that slams tech hard. City Hall will learn where its revenue comes from. So Mayor Durkan should be prepared.</p><p>And (pro tip), plow the streets if it snows.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SEATTM-0fed1f76c36611e78b891c0ebfef0f3e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SEATTM2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PXY-YB41-DY2P-42PD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8206</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-11-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1032\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Seattle Times Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Seattle Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"11\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>November 12, 2017 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>Mayors</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Qjc5QjBGQUU4M0Y4NDVEMEI4Njk1MUVGRjU1NzREMzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008X9I</classCode><className>CITY GOVERNMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921100JQ</classCode><className>MAYORS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Qjc5QjBGQUU4M0Y4NDVEMEI4Njk1MUVGRjU1NzREMzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode><className>Mayors</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000297</classCode><className>CITIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001588</classCode><className>SOCIAL JUSTICE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009G89</classCode><className>REGIONAL &amp; LOCAL GOVERNMENTS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA</classCode><className>Local Governments</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CYCH</classCode><className>LIBERALISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001688</classCode><className>TAXES &amp; TAXATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001581</classCode><className>SMALL BUSINESS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GX518</classCode><className>SEATTLE, WA, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GS163</classCode><className>WASHINGTON, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GR120</classCode><className>NORTH AMERICA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

But_ \"If the company lied to the FTC . . . its CEO could end up in jail.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Recall, if you will, the promise of the Internet. Democracy would be upgraded, distant peoples would be brought together in perfect harmony, and all of human knowledge would be a click away. Let's just say the bugs haven't been worked out quite yet. Today, the Internet is a wasteland of partisan rants and sensational clickbait of dubious origin, dominated by monopolies you can count on one hand. It has become a playground for Russian saboteurs, neo- Nazis, and grotesque conspiracy-mongers. It lured paying customers to the Fyre Festival and helped put a Twitter troll in the Oval Office. Oh, and everything you read, watch, swipe, type, or tap is being tracked and shared with shady middlemen, government agents, and other Internet giants. Somehow we ended up way off course from utopia.</p><p>Back in the '90s, Oregon senator Ron Wyden simply wanted the Internet-and the little guy working away in his dorm room, fueled by Mountain Dew and a big dream-to be able to get off the ground. \"I had no idea it would have these implications,\" he tells me, slouched on his office sofa. His wire-thin, six-foot-four frame is comfortably sprawled out, with his feet crossed on the coffee table between us.</p><p>Wyden's expertise on technology issues is unequaled in national politics. Yes, that's a notoriously low bar. Remember when then-senator Ted Stevens described how \"an Internet was sent by my staff,\" calling it \"a series of tubes\"? Or when then-senator Orrin Hatch asked Mark Zuckerberg how it was possible to make money off a free product? But Wyden is not merely tech proficient; he's the link between the hacktivist community and Congress, where the 69-year-old Democrat is a leading advocate for net neutrality, strong encryption, and election security. He's also got a libertarian streak that has sent him, as a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, down long, lonely rabbit holes from which he emerges to shed light on the NSA's warrantless wiretapping, or question the CIA's assassination-by-drone program.</p><p>For Wyden, surveillance issues are personal. Both of his parents fled Nazi Germany. His father, Peter, volunteered with the U. S. Army's propaganda department, where he delighted in writing pamphlets to demoralize the Germans before becoming a respected investigative journalist. \"[My dad always] said, 'You gotta ask the hard questions, Ron boy,' \" Wyden recalls. \" 'Because what the big guys are always out there looking for is the little, itty-bitty, unfair advantage.' \"</p><p>And yet Wyden has a lot to atone for regarding the growing \"techlash.\" He cosponsored several major pieces of Internet legislation and coauthored the landmark Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, which regarded websites as a new form of library, freeing them of any liability for what their users post or upload. Section 230 is why YouTube isn't deluged with copyright suits and Reddit isn't responsible for the often noxious utterances of its redditors, thereby allowing a social-media platform such as Facebook to become one of the world's most valuable companies. This law also trusted websites to self-police and remove any objectionable material without penalty. Wyden refers to these two parts of 230 as the shield and the sword. And while tech companies have long enjoyed the unlimited liability protection of the shield, they've pretty much laid down their swords, which has enabled hostile foreign governments to turn Facebook and Twitter into unwitting, Alien-style host bodies for fifth-column subversion.</p><p>Wyden has concerns about the likes of Alex Jones and the coarsening of online discourse. \"Are you gonna just say that it's okay to harass parents and tell them things that will upset them after their kids die?\" But he remains steadfast in his defense of free speech. \"I would like to make clear that government shouldn't regulate content, as a principle,\" he says. \"I would like the big tech companies to do more to step up and deal with the slime that's on their platform. The companies are clearly capable of doing it when they think it helps their bottom line,\" referring to most social- media platforms' policing of pornography.</p><p>Considering Wyden's field of expertise, his office feels startlingly low-tech. It's pretty much like any other workspace, with family portraits, souvenirs, cabinets of tchotchkes, a desk piled with paperwork. The only observable security feature is a sticker covering the camera on his desktop iMac. What Wyden has that most politicians don't is a high-tech brain trust. (Unofficial code name_ \"guerrilla movement.\") Senior advisor Chris Soghoian, a well-regarded and somewhat infamous cybersecurity researcher who calls Wyden the \"nerdiest senator\"-he means it as a compliment-has in the past year, via his boss, gotten the Supreme Court to start encrypting its emails, publicized the discovery of cell-phone listening devices near the White House, and uncovered phone companies' location-data sharing with highly questionable third parties.</p><p>This year, Wyden is also aiming to rein in what author Shoshana Zuboff calls \"surveillance capitalism.\" Making widgets is out; selling your interests, consumption habits, or location data to the highest bidder is Silicon Valley's reigning business model. That's when it's not sharing user data with political mercenaries, as Facebook did with Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>Online privacy is shaping up to be a major issue in 2019 and the next election cycle. Several politicians have already introduced privacy bills of varying quality. Wyden's own bill would give users the option not to be surveilled as well as threaten massive fines for big companies (over $1 billion in annual revenue or more than 50 million users) and jail time for CEOs who lie about their business practices. \"[Facebook executives] clearly haven't been honest with Congress or the American people in how they're sharing data.\" When asked directly whether Mark Zuckerberg should face jail time, Wyden says, \"My bill isn't retroactive, so it wouldn't put anyone in jail for past actions.\" However, he adds, \"the kind of privacy scandals Facebook has been involved with in recent years would almost certainly trigger massive, unprecedented fines.

Maybe you have, too. Maybe you think the same.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The speakers are seeking a just, cleansing fire that burns those smug, overpaid techies - especially Amazonians - greedy developers, real-estate speculators and _______ (fill in the blank).</p><p>At its purest and most sentimental level, it's a desire to return to a city with plenty of blue-collar workers, easy driving, fewer people - especially Californians - and single-family housing that the average middle-class family can afford.</p><p>Well, hang around. A recession will show up, perhaps sooner than you think.</p><p>The trouble is that it won't dispense a biblical butt-whippin' of the digerati, although some may be slapped. It will hurt the most vulnerable people worst. House prices would go down some, but bounce back and rise even higher. And it won't return the Seattle of 1950, 1980 - pick your golden time.</p><p>To be sure, recessions are natural phenomena of human action in the market. The business cycle expands and contracts.</p><p>Since I became a business journalist in 1984, the United States has been through three official national recessions, along with plenty of region- and industry-specific downturns.</p><p>The National Bureau of Economic Research, a private, nonprofit organization, officially dates the events. It says a recession \"is a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months.\"</p><p>Economists like recessions. They clean out the system, wiping out the bad bets, imbalances and shaky enterprises that accumulate during an expansion, especially when it becomes a bubble. A recession is a necessary purification so the economy can return to health.</p><p>And economists are right, at least in theory (no wonder it's called the dismal science). But they also tend to have secure jobs.</p><p>Until 2008, this professional dispassion was reinforced by the long-running \"Great Moderation.\" From the mid-1980s until the big crash, the U.S. economy was defined by steady growth, low inflation and mild recessions.</p><p>The situation is different now.</p><p>Nearly 8.6 million people lost their jobs nationally in the Great Recession. Nearly 134,000 jobs were vaporized in Washington state. It took five years to recover the lost employment, and even longer to reach the level of jobs that would have been created without the downturn and to meet the growth of the workforce.</p><p>The downturn mauled the household wealth of Americans. According to the Federal Reserve, most households had not fully recovered as of last year. Inequality rose. Those at the lowest level of income suffered the greatest harm.</p><p>Even in the mild recession of 2001, more than 2 million jobs were lost.</p><p>The characteristics of recoveries have also changed since the turn of the century. It takes longer to regain lost employment. One reason is China's rise in the world economy. But another is that companies use recessions to re-engineer themselves, whether through offshoring or automating work, doing more with fewer people. Hence the \"jobless recovery\" has become commonplace.</p><p>Seattle is known by a couple of truisms. It's a boom-and-bust town, going all the way back to the Klondike Gold Rush and its aftermath. And national recessions tend to arrive here later. It's an open question whether these still apply, in what has become a prosperous world city with a diverse economy and a major technology hub.</p><p>We did go through one of the most famous local- and industry-specific crashes: The \"Boeing Bust\" of the late 1960s and much of the 1970s. When the region was much more dependent on one company, it faced severe pain from cancellation of the supersonic transport and slow 747 sales. This was when real-estate agents Bob McDonald and Jim Youngren put up the iconic billboard reading, \"Will the last person leaving Seattle - Turn out the lights.\"</p><p>This local recession preceded the national downturns of 1970 and 1974-75, which were largely caused by spikes in oil prices. Those, in turn, made the situation here worse.</p><p>The Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue metropolitan area sidestepped the worst of the Great Recession. Most areas here weren't overbuilt with spec subdivisions. Still, it took down our last large financial institution, Washington Mutual, and caused widespread layoffs elsewhere, including the first for Microsoft.</p><p>Our comeback was far above the national average. Powered by the tech sector, Seattle was one of the few cities to see stellar expansion in the recovery, one of the winners in the renewed popularity of urban cores.</p><p>Some of the results - population growth, traffic, widening of income gaps, disruption of once-stable middle-class neighborhoods, and loss of favorite shops - fuel the \"what this town needs is a good recession\" discontent among mossbacks.</p><p>We also have seen a dramatic increase in unsheltered people on the streets. Although it's easy to blame this on Amazon and other tech companies, it's more uncomfortable to ask whether this compassionate city is subsidizing and attracting the problem with its lavish spending.</p><p>A recession would sandbag that funding and much more. The booming economy, including fees from development, allowed the city to increase its budget dramatically - and perhaps unsustainably, according to the Municipal League Foundation.</p><p>The boom also allowed for experiments such as raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. While the effects are still unclear, overall employment growth in low-wage sectors has continued. This trend would come under severe stress in a downturn. So would badly needed infrastructure improvements, including Sound Transit 3.</p><p>A minor downturn might be a speed bump here. A bigger obstacle would come if Amazon HQ2 became the only headquarters, significantly slowing growth in Seattle.</p><p>Widening the lens, the world economy faces growing asset bubbles, banking regulations set to be removed and an aging business cycle. Something more menacing might emerge. Such a crisis would confront an untested chairman of the Federal Reserve, with the central bank still rebuilding its anti-recession ammo expended fighting the last downturn.</p><p>A truly 21st century recession might not be triggered by conventional bubbles or financial mischief, but trouble in the technology sector. A digital black swan.</p><p>The sector is facing significant risks, from overvalued stocks to controversy about its power, security and interconnected vulnerabilities. And with two of the five Big Tech giants headquartered here, trouble would hit home hard.</p><p>None of these scenarios would bring back grunge, Ralph's Grocery or happy motoring. There is no good recession.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SEATTM-13fb81acf4d011e7a271d02ff151a4f4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SEATTM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RDD-4701-JBKM-D4MN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8206</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1117\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Seattle Times Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Seattle Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>January 14, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000551</classCode><className>ECONOMIC NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DLA3</classCode><className>ECONOMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001457</classCode><className>RECESSION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00090NT</classCode><className>ECONOMIC CONDITIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>STX001010</classCode><className>LAYOFFS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008XKI</classCode><className>BUSINESS CLIMATE &amp;
