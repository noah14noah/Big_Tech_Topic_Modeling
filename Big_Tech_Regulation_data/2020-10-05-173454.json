And the idea is you can just walk around, pick up whatever you like and then walk out the door, it will get automatically charged to your WeChat account. WeChat relies on users handing over big chunks of their personal data and now that now even includes your face. These vending machines are set up to use WeChat's new facial pay feature. </p><p>The idea is you opt into it in the app and once you've done that, you can use your face to buy anything from these machines. It basically links your face to your face to your WeChat account and your government ID. But, is the convenience with the possible cost to privacy? In 2016, Amnesty International awarded the parent company of WeChat, Tencent, zero out of 100 for their privacy practices. I think there's a common perception that people in China don't care about their privacy, and that perception is completely false. The government over the last few years has been trying to roll out its own cybersecurity regulations and trying to educate consumers about the dangers of data being lost or leaked. WeChat's privacy policy says it will provide the Chinese government access to much of what you do in the app when legally required, including the things you type and data like your location. It's hard to deny that social apps in China have taken on a life of their own, if not outpacing, then going in new directions to competitors in the West. The big question is whether more Chinese apps can follow TikTok in going global, despite the concerns around privacy and censorship. Or, if not, it could it be the turn of tech companies in the West to play copycat themselves? That was Stephen Beckett's view of China. And since the explosion of TikTok in the West, other apps have been springing up to try and compete. And Chris Fox has been looking at some of the alternatives that are available. If you can't get enough of short, hyper-edited videos, luckily there are plenty of apps that have cottoned on to the format. This is Triller, which I think is fair to say, has taken a bit of inspiration from TikTok. You can record clips with special effects and share them onto an endless scrolling feed of content. Triller seems to have done quite well out of all this uncertainty, at the start of August, it topped the app store charts on both iOS and Android and has managed to attract some big-name TikTok stars and celebrities over to on its platform, including Mike Tyson and magician Dynamo. Another app offering a similar experience is Byte, which has also been popping in and out of the App Store top download charts. Like TikTok, it offers you creative effects for your videos, although it is trailing behind Triller, it's been downloaded over 1 million times on Google Play, whereas Triller has had more than ten million. Tiktok's biggest competition may come from Instagram Reels, Instagram's newly-launched rival. It has incorporated many of TikTok's core features, including that endlessly-scrolling feed of short videos. Just in the past few weeks, Mark Zuckerberg has appeared at a Congressional hearing about big tech companies using their power to neutralise the competition. Isn't ripping off TikTok essentially doing that? There is innovation everywhere and people are constantly inspired by what they see. It's no longer a surprise to see a feed in a mobile social product, that wasn't the case until Facebook brought that to scale. We brought stories to Instagram in 2016. And gave full credit to Snap for inventing that format, but evolved it from there. So what is Instagram bringing to the table with this format, that makes it different to TikTok? I think the ability to be discovered is unique to Reels. I think in Instagram, historically, if you had a large follower base it was easier to kind of get bigger. This is now a product specifically designed to help creators find an audience. Now, to be fair to TikTok, I think the idea that you never know what video is going to go viral or who get discovered is what draws people to TikTok. It's certainly not unique to Instagram Reels, but I think companies are seeing TikTok has refined a winning formula and they want a piece of the action. And that's it for this week. Next week, we're going to be looking at another hugely important topic - the technology being used to fight climate change. Until then, you can keep with us on social media, on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter @BBCClick.

You're replicating a video of someone sitting here and they are speaking and you sync their lips and head movements and things like that. If you try to do something like this with a voice, then the training data will be a lot more limited, so let's say even if you have two hours of you talking, that is still a very, very little part of all the things you could possibly say. So could I use your platform to upload a video of anyone, not me, and create a virtual version of them?</p><p> No. Why not? We need written consent from whoever is being uploaded. So everything goes through manual review and we only do custom avatars for corporate clients. So clearly you have protocols in place, but is the very existence of this technology, the fact that all of this is possible, not a pretty big risk in itself, that the wrong people will use it? We have seen these kind of things happen before. Definitely, synthetic media as a whole definitely comes with potential for misuse, that is something that is really important that we address. Both from a technical perspective but also from an educational perspective. I think any technology can be used for good and bad, I am not I think that deepfakes or video is uniquely different from being able to forge text or images, or tweets, which has been possible for the last 20 years, but it is certainly something we need to be really aware of. Thanks, Victor. So the reality is that making fake videos has become a lot more sophisticated. And we are already all-too-familiar with how false information can cause real harm, and has damaged people's trust in news. And even though most of the conversations have been centred around Facebook, YouTube has also been a big contributor to the spread of misinformation. Now the upcoming US election is going to place even more emphasis on this issue. And so the BBC's specialist disinformation reporter Marianna Spring has been finding out more. YouTube has an incredibly smart algorithm. At least smart enough to make the company a lot of money. More eyeballs on a video and more engagement equals more cash. It's simple. But what is not simple is how potent this combination has become. Videos from fringe groups with extreme ideas surfacing to the top and influencing users' views. The pandemic has pushed the issue to new levels, with false information about the coronavirus often finding a much larger audience than trusted sources. As the months have gone on, YouTube has become inundated with documentary-style films from pseudoscientists promoting conspiracy theories. This Plandemic documentary received millions of views. Despite efforts to remove it from Youtube, Facebook and Twitter, users were constantly re-uploading the clip. And recently demonstraters have taken to the streets in London to promote some of the most popular coronavirus conspiracy theories mainly seen online. A man who would like to remain anonymous got in touch with us after his mum decided to go along. Mum had two posters, one read \"Arrest Bill Gates for crimes against humanity\", the other had a Qanon hashtag, \"Save the children\". She was first taken in by coronavirus conspiracy theories on YouTube and now she has been radicalised by QAnon on there too. It is so hard to have a normal conversation. QAnon is a conspiracy theory that suggests President Trump is waging a secret war against satanic paedophiles in government, media and business. Since the last US election, the social media giants have had a bit of a reckoning. They are all trying to clean up their act to stave off heavy-handed regulation. Facebook with its oversight board, Twitter with more robust warning labels, and now YouTube says it has added a new tool to its arsenal to combat misinformation. It has partnered up with fact checking sites to warn users if the phrase they are searching has been refuted, and pointing them to information by a trusted source. Put simply, it is a tool where when users go to search for a particular topic on YouTube, if there happens to be a fact check, these fact checks are generated by third-party publishers, that will trigger in the results of that particular query, right at the top of the query, and it will link out to that fact check, saying whether that particular claim is false, oftentimes fact checking publishers have a rating of that type of claim, that will be displayed as well. This is one of the many tools YouTube says it uses to reduce misinformation on the site. But none of these measures seems to be proactive and doing nearly enough to reduce exposure to misleading information. The challenge about misinformation, as you know, on a platform like ours, which is an open platform, we really do value the fact that it's an open platform where there's a diversity of voices, is that with the changing nature</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-001585f204de4667afe8f3b951d8f00f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60Y7-9021-JBH6-C516-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"856\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

Next, the other big tech news       stories. A slew of new smartphones       has been announced by some of the       biggest players in the industry       keen to get the jump on Apple which       will launch its new iPhone in the       next few days. Nokia showed off its       Lumia 920 which features Wireless       charging. It has a curved touch       screen which can be used was       wearing gloves. Nokia is hoping       took clawback market share after       Samsung overtook it. It is also       extending is a free music streaming       service to Lumia handset owners in       America. It works offline by       downloading tunes and mix in       various other genres. Motorola has       launched its first handset since it       was acquired by Google in May. Most       noticeable is the Razor M, the       smallest telephone which boasts a       4.3 inch edge to edge screen in a       super thin it chassis. Motorola       says it can last an impressive 21       hours of the phone calling or 31       hours of video viewing. It is not       just the telephone space hotting up.       Amazon has sparked interest into       new H D versions of his popular       Kindle Fire. The 8.9 inch looks set       to give Apple's iPad a run for its       money. It is also slashing the       price of its basic E readers and       introducing a new higher resolution       one making it more readable in       darker conditions. Sweden turns out       to be the best country in the world       for making the Web work for its       citizens, beating the US and the UK       to the top spot. A new index       launched by the Webber Foundation       analyse 61 countries to evaluate       how useful the Web is. Content and       censorship and his political and       economic impact were considered.       The high cost of access was the       biggest barrier for most people. He       says he hopes the index will spur       nations and their citizens to think       again about how the Web is used,       costed and regulated where they are.       And finally iPhone and iPad users       have another option this week. You       can now watch whatever you want       even without a connection. The       BBC's catch-up service iPlayer has       updated with an offline function       allowing users to download programs       over Wi-Fi and watch them within 30       days. Once you have started, you       have got a week to get to the end       credits before the program deletes.       Android viewers will have to wait a       little longer before the auction is       coded for them. Download us, baby.       For the last few years, most of the       excitement at trade shows has       revolved around tablets and smart       phones. But this year, the focus       has shifted back towards the PC.       That is because of the imminent       release of Microsoft's Windows 8.       We have asked in the past whether       the desktop PC has had its day.       Even laptops are decreasing in       sales. It is the tablet market that       is growing, and its touch screens       gained popularity. The Windows way       of doing things is starting to look       a bit irrelevant. So Microsoft has       come up with the Windows 8. It will       go on sale on October 26th.

Next, the other big tech news       stories. A slew of new smartphones       has been announced by some of the       biggest players in the industry       keen to get the jump on Apple which       will launch its new iPhone in the       next few days. Nokia showed off its       Lumia 920 which features Wireless       charging. It has a curved touch       screen which can be used was       wearing gloves. Nokia is hoping       took clawback market share after       Samsung overtook it. It is also       extending is a free music streaming       service to Lumia handset owners in       America. It works offline by       downloading tunes and mix in       various other genres. Motorola has       launched its first handset since it       was acquired by Google in May. Most       noticeable is the Razor M, the       smallest telephone which boasts a       4.3 inch edge to edge screen in a       super thin it chassis. Motorola       says it can last an impressive 21       hours of the phone calling or 31       hours of video viewing. It is not       just the telephone space hotting up.       Amazon has sparked interest into       new H D versions of his popular       Kindle Fire. The 8.9 inch looks set       to give Apple's iPad a run for its       money. It is also slashing the       price of its basic E readers and       introducing a new higher resolution       one making it more readable in       darker conditions. Sweden turns out       to be the best country in the world       for making the Web work for its       citizens, beating the US and the UK       to the top spot. A new index       launched by the Webber Foundation       analyse 61 countries to evaluate       how useful the Web is. Content and       censorship and his political and       economic impact were considered.       The high cost of access was the       biggest barrier for most people. He       says he hopes the index will spur       nations and their citizens to think       again about how the Web is used,       costed and regulated where they are.       And finally iPhone and iPad users       have another option this week. You       can now watch whatever you want       even without a connection. The       BBC's catch-up service iPlayer has       updated with an offline function       allowing users to download programs       over Wi-Fi and watch them within 30       days. Once you have started, you       have got a week to get to the end       credits before the program deletes.       Android viewers will have to wait a       little longer before the auction is       coded for them. Download us, baby.       For the last few years, most of the       excitement at trade shows has       revolved around tablets and smart       phones. But this year, the focus       has shifted back towards the PC.       That is because of the imminent       release of Microsoft's Windows 8.       We have asked in the past whether       the desktop PC has had its day.       Even laptops are decreasing in       sales. It is the tablet market that       is growing, and its touch screens       gained popularity. The Windows way       of doing things is starting to look       a bit irrelevant. So Microsoft has       come up with the Windows 8. It will       go on sale on October 26th.

Videos from fringe groups with extreme ideas surfacing to the top and influencing uses people 's views. The pandemic has pushed the issue to new levels, with false information about the coronavirus often finding a much larger audience than trusted sources. As the months have gone YouTube has become inundated with documentary style films from geosciences advancing bumblebees. </p><p>This Plandemic documentary saw millions of years. Use were re- uploading the clip. And recently demonstrated have taken to the street in London to promote some of the most popular coronavirus conspiracy theories is mainly seen online. The man who would like to remain anonymous got in touch with us after his mum decided to go along. One -- mum had two posters, one had a rest Bill Gates, the other one had a Qanon hashtag. She has been first taken in by coronavirus conspiracy is a new tube and now has been taken in by Qanon. It is so hard to have a normal conversation. Qanon is a conspiracy theory that suggests President Trump is waging a secret war against satanic paedophiles in government, media and business. The social media giants have had a bit of a reckoning since Trump 's election, all trying to clean up their act to stave off hand handed -- heavy-handed regulation. YouTube now that it has added a new tool to its arsenal to combat misinformation. It has partnered with fact checking sites, pointing them to information by trusted sources. Put simply, it is a tool where when users go to search for a particular topic on YouTube, if there happens to be a fact checker, these FAQ checks are generated by third-party publishers, that will trigger in the results of that particular query, right at the top of the query, and it will link up to that fact check, saying whether that particular claim is false, oftentimes fact checking publishers have a rating of that type of claim, that will be displayed as well. This is one of the many tools YouTube says it uses to reduce misinformation on the website. None of these measures seem to be proactive and doing enough to reduce exposure to misleading information. The challenge about misinformation, as you know, on a platform like ours which is an open platform, we really do value the fact that it is an open platform, where there is a diversity of voices, is that with the changing nature of information around this pandemic, what is the new type of misinformation that might pop up? Before there was the conspiracy around 5G and Covid-19, who would have guessed that those two could randomly, separate pieces of technology and science would be linked together? All that happened in the course of the pandemic. So we had to adjust very quickly to change our enforcement guidelines. You say these conspiracy theories are new and evolving but a number of the ones that are still being promoted on your platform have been around for months. Especially in foreign languages, including Russian and Hindi, false conspiracy theories about the origin of coronavirus or even doubting its existence. The content that might not clearly cross the lines of our policies, we reduce that content in our recommendations. So if it is borderline content in nature, because as I said misinformation can be murky but we still want to reduce the exposure to it. YouTube says it has removed millions of videos containing misinformation from the platform. In many instances before anyone has viewed them at all. But there have been numerous examples of videos promoting false claims and conspiracy theories about coronavirus, especially in foreign languages. And those of state online for months, accumulating hundreds of thousands of views. The Mozilla foundation behind the Firefox browser decided to act, this week releasing a new extension called regrets reporter. The idea is a user can report any content they find unsavoury. They say this can force YouTube to become more transparent about how it algorithm works. I think that you too's algorithm is really one of the most opaque ones out of all the platforms out there, which is why they have a lot more work to do. So YouTube has come out with a lot of statistics like saying they have increased, introduce policy changes that work to decrease recommendations of borderline content by upwards of 70%. But the problem is that there is really no way to verify whether or not this is the case without involving the public, involving researchers, sociologists, people who have knowledge that goes beyond just the boardrooms of Silicon Valley, that together we are better able to</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-018dfef810b046d99416971abb6d9aa7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60XK-CC21-DY08-3026-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"814\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

And let's say the test gives 10% false positives, so out of every ten people you test, the test says they are positive but actually they are not infected at all. Run those numbers, you test 1000 people, one of them has got the virus. And then 100 of them have, are wrongly flagged as having the virus, because you have a 10% false positive rate. </p><p>So then you have 100 times as many people being given false positives as given a true positive. So that sounds like a total disaster, it sounds like you couldn't possibly use that information. But think about it in another way - before you gave everyone the test, you would have thought 1 in 1000 people has the virus, but now you are able to zoom in on a subset of those people, 100 people, and now you know one out of 100 people has the virus. So the other 900 people are probably fine. But if the alternative is to lock down everybody, to tell everybody they have to stay home and tell everyone they can't go to school or a restaurant, maybe the imperfect test could be better. We just have to use the information in the right way. So your latest book, How to Make the World Add Up, was just being finished, I think, as we were going into lockdown. And I wonder whether you looked at what the virus was doing around the world, and whether that taught you anything about statistics? Well, I am sad to say it underlined the point I was trying to make in the book, which was that while we tend to think of statistics as a kind of political weapon, that you know, people lie with statistics and they try to win arguments with statistics, actually statistics are a way of seeing the world around us, seeing things we can't see any other way. So they are a bit like you need radar to spot incoming bombers, we need statistics to spot the incoming virus. So I am trying to get people to take the numbers seriously as a way of seeing what is true. Hello, and welcome to the Week in Tech. This week, Apple announced the launch of a new workout subscription programme called Fitness+. It forms part of a bundle of services including News and Arcade, now branded as Apple One. Facebook unveiled a new version of its Oculus Quest VR headset with more power and higher resolution. The new device also comes with a significant price drop. The entry-level version will be #100 deeper than its predecessor. And Sony confirmed the price of the forthcoming PlayStation 5, matching the $500 price of its rival the Xbox One Series X. Google says it has gone beyond being carbon neutral, and has now compensated for all of the carbon it has ever produced. It comes as a range of big tech firms have committed to reducing or eliminating their carbon footprint. British-based chip designer Arm is being sold to the American graphics chip specialist Nvidia. Nvidia said the deal, worth $40 billion, will create the premier computing company for the age of artificial intelligence. And finally, is there life on...Venus? Scientists have discovered what they say could be potential signs of life floating in the clouds of the planet. A new scientific paper reveals the discovery of gas called phosphine, typically associated with living organisms. The future really is in the cloud. This isn't fog, it's smoke. California is a state reeling from wildfires. Flying into San Francisco this week from London, you could barely see the city. My name is James Clayton, and I am the new BBC and Click San Francisco technology reporter. And I have landed at a pretty weird time. I've been to San Francisco a few times before, but this was San Francisco only different. Mandatory masks everywhere, the airport almost completely empty. The streets quieter, much more so than London. I've come during a monster week for tech though. Many of the stories based on theme that are likely to dominate tech journalism in the years to come. On Monday, Oracle agreed a deal with TikTok to oversee its US operations, after Mr Trump said it would ban the company if it couldn't find a US suitor. I'll be doing more on how tech is being dragged into a geopolitical battle between China and the US. It was also a week that Twitter launched its election hub, to promote accurate information and resources for voters. How companies like Google and Twitter and Facebook regulate their platforms in the run-up to the elections</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-5117a7a1bf1941ffaeedb0571d43c07d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60WR-N5G1-JBH6-C4J4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"780\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

On Monday, Oracle agreed a deal with TikTok to oversee its US operations after Mr Trump said it would ban the company if it couldn't find a US suitor. I will be doing more on how tech is being dragged into a geopolitical battle between China and the US. It was also a week that Twitter launched its election hub to promote accurate information and resources for voters. How companies like Google and Twitter and Facebook regulate their platforms in the run-up to the elections are likely to have a massive impact on that</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-f05f85750bba4dcf996179899a7cb3f1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60W3-K1R1-JBH6-C1XG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"761\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

It also happened to be a week when Mr Trump visited California, sparking controversy by refusing to acknowledge climate change's impact on the environment. Going forward, could big tech do more by not just being green companies themselves, but by leading the way in innovation, perhaps even reversing some of the damage that humans have done to our planet? At Apple's launch on Tuesday, the company didn't release an iPhone or ARM-based MacBooks But it did centre its new iteration of products around healthcare, including a new Apple Watch that can measure oxygen levels in the blood. </p><p>How the world of tech responds to Covid-19 in the coming years is likely to be crucial in our battle against the virus. And finally this week, Google was grilled by senators asking questions about anti-trust. Or, in other words, are companies like Google monopolistic? Whether massive tech companies like Facebook, Apple, and Amazon are simply too big and whether they should be broken up, remains a central challenge to governments around the world. The tech stories that we have seen this week perhaps underpin the fundamental question of our age - how can we harness the progress that humanity has made for good and not bad? That was James Clayton who, as he says, is our new man in San Francisco, and he's online now. James, not even off the plane and we ask you to start filming. Well done! What a time to move to San Francisco though! It's a really strange time for two reasons. I mean, obviously, you've seen those kind of horrendous pictures of California under this huge blanket of smoke. And it's not just California, it's pretty much the whole of western America. It is Oregon, it's Washington. And then, of course, you have Covid-19. Covid-19 has affected the US very badly, and California is no exception, and it's really noticeable. How do you feel about being there? If you look at all of the conferences that are coming up, literally all of them are virtual. So the chances of me actually being able to get there and, you know, review products in the same way as my predecessor did, well, it's going to be quite unlikely for now. I know that different people feel differently about climate change within the US, and the big tech giants have certainly committed to trying to go carbon neutral - or I think Google now says it is carbon neutral. Do you think the arrival of forest fires at the doors of these companies will change any of their behaviours or focus any of their attention? I think the next stage is are they going to really invest in the kind of innovation that the world might actually need to try and reverse some of this climate change? And at the moment, Microsoft have committed a lot of money to that - so have Amazon, so have Apple too - but it's really only been the last year that has happened. What else are you looking forward to covering? Well, the big tech story of the next 5-6 weeks is going to be about social media with the US elections. You're already seeing all sorts of disinformation and all sorts of challenges and problems that companies like Facebook and Twitter and Google, who owns YouTube, are having to make, you know, when trying to regulate what should and shouldn't be on it. Well, we're really looking forward to hearing more about it from you over the coming weeks. James, thank you very much and stay there! You know, all of these launch events that we have been talking about and, indeed, the run-up to the US election, they are all like theatre really, aren't they? And that links perfectly to the next bit of the program. Yes, theatre has had a particularly tough time of it since March, and until actors can tread the boards again, technology is seeing whether it can fill the void. But can it really provide the excitement of a live performance? Marc Cieslak has disappeared down the rabbit hole to find out. We're late, we're late for a very important theatrical date. However, in order to follow Alice down the rabbit hole for an adventure in Wonderland, all we have to do is log in to a video chat call. Are you all OK? Alice, A Virtual Theme Park is actually an immersive theatre show which, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the audience experiences from the comfort of their homes via the video chat platform Zoom. It's the result of a collaboration between theatre companies Creation, Big Telly and Fox dog, partnering with tech outfit Charisma AI. We have built an animated version of the Cheshire Cat</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-64cf8f2ceea348d9997c62011485daa0</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60WR-GNN1-DY08-31MP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"813\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

It also happened to be a week when Mr Trump visited California, sparking controversy by refusing to acknowledge climate change was make impact on the environment. Going forward, could dig tech do more by not just being green companies themselves but by leading the way in innovation and perhaps even reversing some of the damage humans have done to the planet. In Apple's launch on Tuesday, the couple didn't release an iPhone or a new range of matter walks but did talk about its new healthcare products, including a new happy couple watch that can measure oxygen levels in the blood. </p><p>How the world of tech response to Covid-19 in the coming years is likely to be crucial in our battle against the virus. And finally this week, Google was grilled by Senators asking questions about anti-trust, or in other words, companies like Google not political. Whether massive tech companies like Facebook, Apple, and Amazon are to be and should be broken up, a central challenges to governments around the world. The tax stories we have seen this week underpin perhaps the fundamental question of our age, how can we harness the progress humanity has made for good and not bad? That was James Clayton who, as he says, is our new man in San Francisco. And he is online now. James, not even off the plane and we ask you to start filming. Well done, what a time to move to San Francisco though. Is a really strange time for two reasons. Obviously, you have seen those kind of horrendous pictures of California under this huge blanket of smoke. It's not just California but pretty much the whole of western America. It is Oregon, Washington, then of course you have Covid-19. Covid-19 has affected the US very badly and California is no exception. It is really noticeable. How do you feel about being there because yellow if you look at all of the conferences are coming up literally all of them are virtual. So the chances of me actually being able to get there and actually review products in the same way as my predecessor did, well, it's going to be quite unlikely for now. I know the different people feel differently about climate change within the US and the big tech giants have certainly committed to trying to go carbon neutral or I think, Google now says it is carbon neutral. Do you think that the arrival of forest fires at the doors of these companies will change any of their behaviours or focus any of their attention? I think the next stage is are they going to really invest in the kind of innovation that the welds might actually need to try and reverse some of this climate change? At the moment, Microsoft have committed a lot of money to that, so have Amazon and Apple. It really is a limb in the last year that has happened. Would also looking forward to covering? The big tech story of the next few weeks is going to be about social media with the US elections. You are already seeing all sorts of this information and all sorts of challenges and problems that companies like Facebook and Twitter and Google who owns YouTube are having to make when trying to regulate what should and shouldn't be on it. We're really looking forward to hearing more about it from you over the coming weeks. James, thank you very much and there stop you know, all of these launch events that we have been talking about and indeed the run-up to the US election, they are all like theatre really, aren't they? And at least perfectly to the next bit of the program. Yes, theatre has had a particularly tough time of it since March and until actors can tread the boards again, technology seeing whether it can fill the void. But cannot really provide the excitement of a live performance? Mark has disappeared down a rabbit hole to find out. We are late, we're late for a very important theatrical date. However, in order to follow Alice down the rabbit hole for an adventure in Wonderland, or we have to do is look into a video chat. Alice, a virtual theme park is actually an immersive theatre show which due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the audience experiences from the comfort of their homes via the video chat platform Zoom. It is the result of a collaboration between theatre companies, Creation, big television, and Fox dog, partnering with tech outfit Charisma AI. We have built an animated version of the</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-72ba978693be44f6a4173ad542034c99</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60W3-K1R1-JBH6-C1XN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"779\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

How will our children be consenting to sharing their data, their behavioural data? These are all kind of questions that I think a lot of people have in mind. Questions like these have increased tensions, and scrutiny of the whole project has intensified after several members of its advisory board resigned over privacy concerns. </p><p>The project is also now facing a challenge in the courts. The Canadian Civil Liberties Association is suing three different levels of government, as well as Waterfront Toronto over plans for the tech driven development. Michael, what is it that Sidewalk is proposing that the CCLA is unhappy with or opposes? What we are unhappy with is that a private company is self-regulating in an area that involves people's constitutional rights, their privacy, and their dignity. What the government in Canada and Ontario and Toronto has done, has said, \"Sidewalk Labs, you figure out how to act \"in the public interest. \"You self regulate the way in which you are going to be \"collecting and storing data. And we, those of us who live in Toronto, or walk anywhere near or through this part of the waterfront, we are the lab rats. And number one, we never signed up for this, number two, there is no jurisdiction for Waterfront Toronto to do this, and number three, there is no protection whatsoever by law of the data that is being collected and manipulated and stored and used in whatever form it is going to be used. Privacy and data, there are some huge concerns around privacy and especially data, about what happens to it, who will manage it. Governance, who has oversight of the data. This project is fundamentally about protecting everyone's privacy, it is built on the established laws we have in Canada. It is not us that is planning to manage or make money off the data in this neighbourhood, it's actually proposed that it is an independent nonprofit public sector entity, we have altered in urban data trust, that will take response ability for managing and using the collection of data. Sidewalk Labs has just submitted its 1,000-page long master plan document that outlines what has in store for the Quayside project in more detail. Waterfront Toronto says it will open it up for public discussion. I think you have a perfect storm, timing, players, actors and a pressure point on projects that could be a lighthouse of how you solve these issues if we get it right. If we get it wrong, then that would not be good. As more people become aware of the kind of data that is captured by big tech outfits, and how it is used, concerns around privacy mean decisions made in Toronto could end up having ramifications for future smart city projects around the world. That was Mark. Big tech companies offering services for free written by data. It is a familiar theme from Toronto to Timbuktu. Originating in Silicon Valley, for some this type of business transaction has come to define the age we live in, and its consequences, good and bad, are only just beginning to shake down. We have been looking at some of the most influential thinking in what is being described as\" surveillance capitalism\". We freely give out our personal data every day through the apps on our phone, conversations with smart home assistance or other so-called smart devices like toothbrushes and vacuum cleaners. It seems like an inevitable and perhaps cheap price to pay for living in a digitally connected world, giving us access to free services, like Google's surgeon match, and social media sites like Facebook. But the data we are giving away for free about our everyday lives is very valuable, and it is exploitation - if exploitation is the basis of a new economic paradigms which one author calls surveillance capitalism. She presented her book in Cambridge, also known as the UK's Silicon Valley. What surveillance capitalism does, is it claims private human experience, private human experience is unilaterally claimed to be brought into the marketplace, where it is translated into behavioural data.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-6119b3061b9a41c2856af6d0c6ec178f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WD4-N2J1-DY08-34WB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"725\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

So this convenient store is set up on the campus of WeChat's head office. And the idea is you can just walk around, pick up whatever you like and then walk out the door, it will get automatically charged to your WeChat account. WeChat relies on users handing over big chunks of their personal data and now that now even includes your face. </p><p>These vending machines are set up to use WeChat's new facial pay feature. The idea is you opt into it in the app and once you've done that, you can use your face to buy anything from these machines. It basically links your face to your face to your WeChat account and your government ID. But, is the convenience with the possible cost to privacy? In 2016, Amnesty International awarded the parent company of WeChat, Tencent, zero out of 100 for their privacy practices. I think there's a common perception that people in China don't care about their privacy, and that perception is completely false. The government over the last few years has been trying to roll out its own cybersecurity regulations and trying to educate consumers about the dangers of data being lost a leaked. WeChat's privacy policy says it will provide the Chinese government access to much of what you do in the app when legally required, including the things you type and data like your location. It's hard to deny that social apps in China have taken on a life of their own, if not outpacing, then going in new directions to competitors in the West. The big question is whether more Chinese apps can follow TikTok in going global, despite the concerns around privacy and censorship. Or, if not, it could it be the turn of tech companies in the West to play copycat themselves? That was Stephen Beckett's view of China. And since the explosion of TikTok in the West, other apps have been springing up to try and compete. And Chris Fox has been looking at some of the alternatives that are available. If you can't get enough of short, hyper-edited videos, luckily there are plenty of apps that have cottoned on to the format. This is Triller, which I think is fair to say, has taken a bit of inspiration from TikTok. You can record clips with special effects and share them onto an endless scrolling feed of content. Triller seems to have done quite well out of all this uncertainty, at the start of August, it topped the app store charts on both iOS and Android and has managed to attract some big-name TikTok stars and celebrities over to on its platform, including Mike Tyson and magician Dynamo. Another app offering a similar experience is Byte, which has also been popping in and out of the App Store top download charts. Like TikTok, it offers you creative effects for your videos, although it is trailing behind Triller, it's been downloaded over 1 million times on Google Play, whereas Triller has had more than ten million. TikTok's biggest competition may come from Instagram Reels, Instagram's newly-launched rival. It has incorporated many of TikTok's core features, including that endlessly-scrolling feed of short videos. Just in the past few weeks, Mark Zuckerberg has appeared at a Congressional hearing about big tech companies using their power to neutralise the competition. Isn't ripping off TikTok essentially doing that? There is innovation everywhere and people are constantly inspired by what they see. It's no longer a surprise to see a feed in a mobile social product, that wasn't the case until Facebook brought that to scale. We brought stories to Instagram in 2016. And give full credit to Snap for inventing that format, but evolved it from there. So what is Instagram bringing to the table with this format, that makes it different to TikTok? I think the ability to be discovered is unique to Reels. I think in Instagram, historically, if you had a large follower base it was easier to kind of get bigger. This is now a product specifically designed to help creators find an audience. Now, to be fair to TikTok, I think the idea that you never know what video is going to go viral or who get discovered is what draws people to TikTok. It's certainly not unique to Instagram Reels, but I think companies are seeing TikTok has refined a winning formula and they want a piece of the action. And that's it for this week. Next week, we're going to be looking at another hugely important topic - the technology being used to fight climate change. Until then, you can keep with us on social media, on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter @BBCClick.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-52b40b18cb314021a4562237b1fc1835</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60M8-VFC1-JBH6-C1X5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"781\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

And so the BBC's specialist disinformation reporter Marianna Spring has been finding out more. YouTube has an incredibly smart algorithm. At least smart enough to make the company a lot of money. More eyeballs on a video and more engagement equals more cash. </p><p>It's simple. But what is not simple is how potent this combination has become. Videos from fringe groups with extreme ideas surfacing to the top and influencing users' views. The pandemic has pushed the issue to new levels, with false information about the coronavirus often finding a much larger audience than trusted sources. As the months have gone on, YouTube has become inundated with documentary-style films from pseudoscientists promoting conspiracy theories. This Plandemic documentary received millions of views. Despite efforts to remove it from Youtube, Facebook and Twitter, users were constantly re-uploading the clip. And recently demonstraters have taken to the streets in London to promote some of the most popular coronavirus conspiracy theories mainly seen online. A man who would like to remain anonymous got in touch with us after his mum decided to go along. Mum had two posters, one read \"Arrest Bill Gates for crimes against humanity\", the other had a Qanon hashtag, \"Save the children\". She was first taken in by coronavirus conspiracy theories on YouTube and now she has been radicalised by Qanon on there too. It is so hard to have a normal conversation. Qanon is a conspiracy theory that suggests President Trump is waging a secret war against satanic paedophiles in government, media and business. Since the last US election, the social media giants have had a bit of a reckoning. They are all trying to clean up their act to stave off heavy-handed regulation. Facebook with its oversight board, Twitter with more robust warning labels, and now YouTube says it has added a new tool to its arsenal to combat misinformation. It has partnered up with fact checking sites to warn users if the phrase they are searching has been refuted, and pointing them to information by a trusted source. Put simply, it is a tool where when users go to search for a particular topic on YouTube, if there happens to be a fact check, these fact checks are generated by third-party publishers, that will trigger in the results of that particular query, right at the top of the query, and it will link out to that fact check, saying whether that particular claim is false, oftentimes fact checking publishers have a rating of that type of claim, that will be displayed as well. This is one of the many tools YouTube says it uses to reduce misinformation on the site. But none of these measures seem to be proactive and doing enough to reduce exposure to misleading information. The challenge about misinformation, as you know, on a platform like ours, which is an open platform, we really do value the fact that it's an open platform where there is a diversity of voices, is that with the changing nature of information around this pandemic, what is the new type of misinformation that might pop up? Before there was the conspiracy around 5G and Covid, who would have guessed that those two kind of randomly, separate pieces of technology and science would be linked together? Well that happened in the course of the pandemic. So we had to adjust very quickly to change our enforcement guidelines. You say that these conspiracy theories are new and evolving, but a number of the ones that are still being promoted on your platform have been around for months. Especially in foreign languages, including in Russian and Hindi, of false conspiracy theories about the origin of the coronavirus or even doubting its existence. For content that might not clearly cross the lines of our policies, we reduce that content in our recommendations. So if it is borderline content in nature, because as I said misinformation can be murky but we still want to reduce the exposure to it. YouTube says it has removed millions of videos containing misinformation from the platform, in many instances before anyone has viewed them at all. But there have been numerous examples of videos promoting false claims and conspiracy theories about coronavirus, especially in foreign languages. And those have stayed online for months, accumulating hundreds of thousands of views. The Mozilla foundation behind the Firefox browser has decided to act, this week releasing a new extension for both Chrome and Firefox called RegretsReporter. The idea is a user can report any recommended content they find unsavoury. Mozilla says this helps crowdsource research into YouTube's recommendation problem, and it hopes it can force YouTube to become more transparent about how its algorithm works. I think that YouTube's algorithm is really one of the most opaque ones out of all the platforms out there, which is why they have a lot more work to do. So YouTube has come out with a lot of statistics</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-22d7f65dddb0480bb24ffe8145171b54</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60XN-NKC1-JBH6-C0GH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"877\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

Let's say the test gives 10% false positives. So, out of every ten people you test, the test says they're positive but in fact, they're not infected at all. Well, run those numbers, you test a thousand people, one of them has got the virus and then 100 of them are wrongly flagged as having the virus, because you've got a 10% false positive rate. </p><p>So, you've got 100 times as many people being given false positives as given a true positive. So, that sounds like a total disaster, it sounds like you couldn't possibly use that information. But think about it another way - before you gave everyone the test, you would have thought one in a thousand people has the virus. But now you're able to zoom in on a subset of those people, 100 people, and now you know one out of 100 people has the virus. So, the other 900 people are probably fine. But if the alternative is to lock down everybody, is to tell everybody they have to stay home, to tell everyone they can't go to school or can't go to a restaurant, well, maybe the imperfect test could be better. We just have to use the information in the right way. So your latest book, How To Make The World Add Up, was just being finished, I think, as we were going into lockdown, and I wonder whether you looked at what the virus was doing around the world and whether that taught you anything about statistics. Well, I'm sad to say it underlined the point that I was trying to make in the book, which was that while we tend to think of statistics as a kind of political weapon - you know, people lie with statistics and they try to win arguments with statistics - actually, statistics are a way of seeing the world around us, seeing things we can't see in any other way. So, they're a bit like, you need radar to spot incoming bombers, we need statistics to spot the incoming virus. So, I'm trying to get people to take the numbers seriously as a way of seeing what's true. This isn't fog, it's smoke - California is a state reeling from wildfires. Flying into San Francisco this week from London, you could barely see the city. My name is James Clayton and I'm the new BBC and Click San Francisco technology reporter. And I've landed at a pretty weird time. I've been to San Francisco a few times before, but this was San Francisco, only different. Mandatory masks everywhere. The airport's almost completely empty, the streets quieter - much more so than London. I've come during a monster week for tech, though, many of the stories based on themes that are likely to dominate tech journalism in the years to come. On Monday, Oracle agreed a deal with TikTok to oversee its US operations after Mr Trump said it would ban the company if it couldn't find a US suitor. I'll be doing more on how tech is being dragged into a geopolitical battle between China and the US. It was also a week that Twitter launched its election hub to promote accurate information and resources for voters. How companies like Google and Twitter and Facebook regulate their platforms in the run-up to the elections are likely to have a massive impact on that November poll, and it's something that Click will be doing more on. It also happens to be a week when Mr Trump visited California, sparking controversy by refusing to acknowledge climate change's impact on the environment.

This week, Apple announced the launch of a new work-out subscription programme called Fitness+. It forms part of a bundle of services including News and Arcade, now branded as Apple One. Facebook unveiled a new version of its Oculus Quest VR headset with more power and higher resolution. The new device also comes with a significant price drop. The entry-level version will be #100 deeper than its predecessor. And Sony confirmed the price of the forthcoming PlayStation 5, matching the $500 price of its rival the Xbox One Series X. Google says it has gone beyond being carbon neutral, and has now compensated for all of the carbon it has ever produced. It comes as a range of big tech firms have committed to reducing or eliminating their carbon footprint. British-based chip designer Arm is being sold to the American graphics chip specialist Nvidia. Nvidia said the deal, worth $40 billion, will create the premier computing company for the age of artificial intelligence. And finally, is there life on...Venus? Scientists have discovered what they say could be potential signs of life floating in the clouds of the planet. A new scientific paper reveals the discovery of gas called phosphene, typically associated with living organisms. The future really is in the cloud. This isn't fog, it's smoke. California is a state reeling from wildfires. Flying into San Francisco this week from London, you could barely see the city. My name is James Clayton, and I am the new BBC and Click San Francisco technology reporter. And I have landed at a pretty weird time. I've been to San Francisco a few times before, but this was San Francisco only different. Mandatory masks everywhere, the airport almost completely empty. The streets quieter, much moreso than London. I've come during a monster week for tech though. Many of the stories based on theme that are likely to dominate tech journalism in the years to come. On Monday, Oracle agreed a deal with TikTok to oversee its US operations, after Mr Trump said it would ban the company if it couldn't find a US suitor. I'll be doing more on how tech is being dragged into a geopolitical battle between China and the US. It was also a week that Twitter launched its election hub, to promote accurate information and resources for voters. How companies like Google and Twitter and Facebook regulate their platforms in the run-up to the elections</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-215fecd0a9954f929372abdc8906c4c6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60W5-WC31-JBH6-C1TF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"779\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

At Apple's launch on Tuesday, the company didn't release an iPhone or ARM-based MacBooks, but it did centre its new iteration of products around health care, including a new Apple Watch that can measure oxygen levels in the blood. How the world of tech responds to Covid-19 in the coming years is likely to be crucial in our battle against the virus. And finally this week, Google was grilled by senators asking questions about antitrust. </p><p>Or, in other words, are companies like Google monopolistic? Whether massive tech companies like Facebook and Apple and Amazon are simply too big, whether they should even be broken up, are central challenges to governments around the world. The tech stories that we've seen this week underpin perhaps the fundamental question of our age - how can we harness the progress that humanity has made for good and not bad? That was James Clayton, who, as he says, is our new man in San Francisco, and he's online now. James, not even off the plane and we ask you to start filming, well done. What a time to move to San Francisco, though. It's a really strange time for two reasons. I mean, obviously, you've seen those horrendous pictures of California under this huge blanket of smoke. And it's not just California, it's pretty much the whole of western America - it's Oregon, it's Washington. And then, of course, you have Covid-19. Covid-19 has affected the US very badly and California is no exception, and it's really noticeable. So, how do you feel about being there? If you look at all of the conferences that are coming up, literally all of them are virtual. So, the chances of me actually being able to get there and review products in the same way as my predecessor did, well, it's going to be quite unlikely for now. I know that different people feel differently about climate change within the US and the big tech giants have certainly committed to trying to go carbon neutral - or I think Google now says it is carbon neutral - do you think the arrival of the forest fires at the doors of these companies will change any of their behaviours or focus any of their attention? I think the next stage is, are they going to really invest in the kind of innovation that the world might actually need to try and reverse some of this climate change? And, at the moment, Microsoft have committed so have Amazon, so have Apple too, but really, it's only been the last year that that's happened. What else are you looking forward to covering? Well, the big tech story in the next five, six weeks is going to be on social media, with the US elections. You're already seeing all sorts of disinformation, all sorts of challenges and problems that companies like Facebook and Twitter and Google - that owns YouTube - are having to make when trying to regulate what should and shouldn't be on it. Well, we're looking forward to hearing more about it from you over the coming weeks. James, thank you very much and stay there! You know, all of these launch events that we've been talking about, and indeed the run-up to the US election, they're all like theatre, really, aren't they? And that links perfectly to the next bit of the programme. Yes, theatre has had a particularly tough time of it since March, and until actors can tread the boards again, technology is seeing whether it can fill the void. But can it really provide the excitement of a live performance? Marc Cieslak has disappeared down the rabbit hole to find out. We're late, we're late, for a very important theatrical date. However, in order to follow Alice down the rabbit hole for an adventure in Wonderland, all we have to do is log into a video chat call. Are you all OK? Alice - A Virtual Theme Park is actually an immersive theatre show which, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the audience experiences from the comfort of their homes, via the video chat platform Zoom. Had Matter, Mad Hatter - you see, It's the result of a everyone in Wonderland's a little bit mixed up! collaboration between theatre companies Creation, Big Telly and Fox Dog, partnering with tech outfit Charisma.ai. We have built an animated version of the Cheshire Cat that the audience talk to. You are now ready to go further into Wonderland... And before the show, they can chat to it, flirt to it. It's been asked out on dates a couple of times. And then the second thing we do is we've really pushed Zoom into sort of video game territory.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCWLD-12e80773edde4ea5b0eb772843d977c9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCWLD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60X7-D1X1-JBH6-C064-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402043</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"812\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

It also happened to be a week when Mr Trump visited California, sparking controversy by refusing to acknowledge climate change's impact on the environment. Going forward, could big tech do more by not just being green companies themselves but by leading the way in innovation, perhaps even reversing some of the damage humans have done to our planet? At Apple's launch on Tuesday, the company didn't release an iPhone or ARM-based MacBooks but they did talk about its new health care products, including a new Apple Watch that can measure oxygen levels in the blood. </p><p>How the world of tech responds to Covid-19 in the coming years is likely to be crucial in our battle against the virus. And finally this week, Google was grilled by senators asking questions about anti-trust, or in other words, are companies like Google monopolistic? Whether massive tech companies like Facebook, Apple, and Amazon are simply too big and whether they should be broken up, remains a central challenge to governments around the world. The tech stories we have seen this week perhaps underpins the fundamental question of our age - how can we harness the progress humanity has made for good and not bad? That was James Clayton who, as he says, is our new man in San Francisco. And he's online now. James, not even off the plane and we ask you to start filming. Well done, what a time to move to San Francisco though. It's a really strange time for two reasons. Obviously, you've seen those kind of horrendous pictures of California under this huge blanket of smoke. And it's not just California but pretty much the whole of western America. It is Oregon, Washington, then of course you have Covid-19. Covid-19 has affected the US very badly and California is no exception. And it's really noticeable. How do you feel about being there? If you look at all of the conferences coming up, literally all of them are virtual. So the chances of me actually being able to get there and actually review products in the same way as my predecessor did, well, it's going to be quite unlikely for now. I know that different people feel differently about climate change within the US and the big tech giants have certainly committed to trying to go carbon neutral or I think, Google now says it is carbon neutral. Do you think the arrival of forest fires at the doors of these companies will change any of their behaviours or focus any of their attention? I think the next stage is, are they going to really invest in the kind of innovation that the world might actually need to try and reverse some of this climate change? At the moment, Microsoft have committed a lot of money to that, so have Amazon and Apple too, but it's really only been the last year that has happened. What else are you looking forward to covering? The big tech story of the next few weeks is going to be about social media with the US elections. You're already seeing all sorts of disinformation and all sorts of challenges and problems that companies like Facebook and Twitter and Google, who owns YouTube, are having to make when trying to regulate what should and shouldn't be on it. We're really looking forward to hearing more about it from you over the coming weeks. James, thank you very much and stay there. You know, all of these launch events that we have been talking about and indeed the run-up to the US election, they are all like theatre really, aren't they? And that links perfectly to the next bit of the programme. Yes, theatre has had a particularly tough time of it since March and until actors can tread the boards again, technology is seeing whether it can fill the void. But can it really provide the excitement of a live performance? Marc Cieslak has disappeared down a rabbit hole to find out. We're late, we're late for a very important theatrical date. However, in order to follow Alice down the rabbit hole for an adventure in Wonderland, all we have to do is log in to a video chat call. Are you all ok? Alice, A Virtual Theme Park is actually an immersive theatre show, which due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the audience experiences from the comfort of their homes via the video chat platform Zoom. It's the result of a collaboration between theatre companies, Creation, Big Telly, and Fox dog, partnering with tech outfit Charisma AI. We have built an animated version of the Cheshire Cat that the audience talk to.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-34058f88ee2d432da87636197e0d1198</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60W5-WC31-JBH6-C1S7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"801\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

TRANSLATION: I'm a professional musician. I also give lectures via Kuaishou in my spare time, which teach people how to play the Chinese sorna. I try to popularise Chinese traditional music and knowledge. </p><p>Between sales of recorded lessons, purchases of virtual gifts during livestreams, he says he makes around #15,000 a month, and that is after Kuaishou takes their 25% commission. But Kuaishou's 200 million users isn't quite so impressive when you compare it to China's social titan Tencent, and their so-called mega app WeChat. And now WeChat is becoming a daily part of life, thanks to something called Mini-Programs. TRANSLATION: WeChat Mini-Programs are an app that doesn't require you to download and install, they are sub-applications within the WeChat ecosystem, and a new tool developed by WeChat. Many programmes allow third parties to add new features to WeChat on demand. It's a bit like having the entire App Store already on your phone. The idea is that you can pretty much do everything you could ever want on your phone without ever closing WeChat. So this convenient store is set up on the campus of WeChat's head office. And the idea is you can just walk around, pick up whatever you like and then walk out the door, it will get automatically charged to your WeChat account. WeChat relies on users handing over big chunks of their personal data and now that now even includes your face. These vending machines are set up to use WeChat's new facial pay feature. The idea is you opt into it in the app and once you've done that, you can use your face to buy anything from these machines. It basically links your face to your face to your WeChat account and your government ID. But, is the convenience worth the possible cost to privacy? In 2016, Amnesty International awarded the parent company of WeChat, Tencent, zero out of 100 for their privacy practices. I think there's a common perception that people in China don't care about their privacy, and that perception is completely false. The government over the last few years has been trying to roll out its own cybersecurity regulations and trying to educate consumers about the dangers of data being lost or leaked. WeChat's privacy policy says it will provide the Chinese government access to much of what you do in the app when legally required, including the things you type and data like your location. It's hard to deny that social apps in China have taken on a life of their own, if not outpacing, then going in new directions to competitors in the West. The big question is whether more Chinese apps can follow TikTok in going global, despite the concerns around privacy and censorship. Or, if not, it could it be the turn of tech companies in the West to play copycat themselves? That was Stephen Beckett's view of China. And since the explosion of TikTok in the West, other apps have been springing up to try and compete. And Chris Fox has been looking at some of the alternatives that are available. If you can't get enough of short, hyper-edited videos, luckily there are plenty of apps that have cottoned on to the format. This is Triller, which I think is fair to say, has taken a bit of inspiration from TikTok. You can record clips with special effects and share them onto an endless scrolling feed of content. Triller seems to have done quite well out of all this uncertainty, at the start of August, it topped the app store charts on both iOS and Android and has managed to attract some big-name TikTok stars and celebrities over to its platform, including Mike Tyson and magician Dynamo. Another app offering a similar experience is Byte, which has also been popping in and out of the App Store top download charts. Like TikTok, it offers you creative effects for your videos, although it is trailing behind Triller, it's been downloaded over 1 million times on Google Play, whereas Triller has had more than ten million. Tiktok's biggest competition may come from Instagram Reels, Instagram's newly-launched rival. It has incorporated many of TikTok's core features, including that endlessly-scrolling feed of short videos. Just in the past few weeks, Mark Zuckerberg has appeared at a Congressional hearing about big tech companies using their power to neutralise the competition. Isn't ripping off TikTok essentially doing that? There is innovation everywhere and people are constantly inspired by what they see. It's no longer a surprise to see a feed in a mobile social product, that wasn't the case until Facebook brought that to scale. We brought stories to Instagram in 2016. And give full credit to Snap for inventing that format, but evolved it from there. So what is Instagram bringing to the table with this format, that makes it different to TikTok?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-f9b90d4ee6ca48979da0add92b0713ed</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60KR-2G21-DY08-31N7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"828\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

But is the convenience worth the possible cost to privacy? In 2016, Amnesty International awarded the parent company of WeChat, Tencent, zero out of 100 for their privacy practices. I think there's a common perception that people in China don't care about their privacy and that perception is completely false. </p><p>The government, over the last few years, has been trying to roll out its own cybersecurity regulations and trying to educate consumers about the dangers of data being lost or leaked. WeChat's privacy policy says it will provide the Chinese government access to much of what you do in the app when legally required, including the things you type and data, like your location. It's hard to deny that social apps in China have taken on a life of their own, if not outpacing, then going in new directions to competitors in the West. The big question is whether more Chinese apps can follow TikTok in going global despite the concerns around privacy and censorship, or, if not, it could be the turn of tech companies in the West to play copycat themselves. That was Stephen Beckett's view of China. And since the explosion of TikTok in the West, other apps have been springing up to try and compete, and Chris Fox has been looking at some of the alternatives that are available. If you can't get enough of short, hyper-edited videos, luckily there are plenty of apps that have cottoned on to the format. This is Triller, which I think it's fair to say has taken a bit of inspiration from TikTok. You can record clips with special effects and share them onto an endless scrolling feed of content. Triller seems to have done quite well out of all this uncertainty. At the start of August. it topped the App Store charts on both iOS and Android, and it's managed to attract some big name TikTok stars and celebrities over onto its platform, including Mike Tyson and the magician Dynamo. Another app offering a similar experience is Byte, which has also been popping in and out of the App Store top download charts. Like TikTok, it offers you creative effects for your videos, although it is trailing behind Triller. It's been downloaded more than a million times on Google Play, whereas Triller's had more than ten million. TikTok's biggest competition may come from Instagram Reels, Instagram's newly launched rival. It has incorporated many of TikTok's core features, including that endlessly scrolling feed of short videos. Just in the past few weeks, Mark Zuckerberg has appeared at a Congressional hearing about big tech companies using their power to neutralise the competition. Isn't ripping off TikTok essentially doing that? There is innovation everywhere and people are constantly inspired by what they see. It's no longer a surprise to see a feed in a mobile social product. That wasn't necessarily the case until Facebook brought that to scale. We brought stories to Instagram in 2016 and give full credit to Snap for inventing that format, but then evolved it from there. So what is Instagram bringing to the table with this format that makes it different to TikTok? I think the ability to be discovered is unique to Reels. I think on Instagram, historically, if you had a large follower base, it was easy to kind of get bigger. This is now a product specifically designed to help creators find an audience. Now, to be fair to TikTok, I think the idea that you never know what video is going to go viral or who gets discovered is exactly what draws creators to TikTok - it's certainly not unique to Instagram Reels - but I think companies are seeing that TikTok has refined a winning formula and they want a piece of the action. And that's it for this week. Next week, we're going to be looking at another hugely important topic - the technology being used to fight climate change. Until then, you can keep up with us on social media, on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, @bbcclick. Thanks for watching and we'll see you soon.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCWLD-ee3520364e614edc81e4cd98006344aa</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCWLD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MS-K5P1-DY08-30YT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402043</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"684\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

Bruce is an internationally renowned technologist, privacy and security commentator, and someone whom I respect a lot more than I agree with. But his latest book opens new common ground between us, as we both foresee a darker future for a world that is digitally connecting things that can kill people -- without figuring out a way to secure them. Breaking with Silicon Valley consensus, we see security regulation in the Valley's future, despite all the well-known downsides that regulation will bring. We also find plenty of room for disagreement on topics like encryption policy and attribution. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.skatingonstilts.com/.a/6a011570268f42970c022ad3b007d9200b-piIn\">http://www.skatingonstilts.com/.a/6a011570268f42970c022ad3b007d9200b-piIn</url> the News Roundup, I ask Jamil Jaffer[3], Nate Jones[4], and David Kris[5] for the stories that people who took August off should go back and read. Jamil nominates the fascinating-as-a-slow-motion-car-wreck story of Maersk's losing battle with NotPetya[6]. We speculate on whether the Russians caused $10 billion in worldwide damage by mistake or on purpose, and whether anyone other than a US government lawyer would call that indiscriminate attack a war crime. David nominates the 179-page complaint[7] against a North Korean hacker behind most of that country's famous hacks. And, as a palate cleanser, the remarkable, score-settling, where-are-they-now story[8] of the companies that challenged the FBI's attribution of the Sony hack to North Korea. Finally, I suggest spending some time with what might be called DCLeaks for good guys: Intrusion Truth[9], a website devoted to outing personal details about the government hackers who have been attacking Western companies. It (and Crowdstrike[10]) provides an old-fashioned pantsing of China's Ministry of State Security (MSS) - the sort of embarrassing doxing that allowed the MSS to take over much of China's cyberespionage portfolio from the hapless People's Liberation Army after it was outed several years ago. In other news, a Five Country Ministerial (homeland security and immigration ministers from the US, UK, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand) issued a statement on encryption[11] that seemed to threaten action, saying that if tech companies don't address the ministers' concerns, \"we may pursue technological, enforcement, legislative or other measures to achieve lawful access solutions.\" While this group isn't really the \"Five Eyes\" of SIGINT fame, that's not very comforting for Big Tech, since the statement suggests a wider coalition and another step forward in the effort to bring Big Tech to heel on the issue.

Earlier this year, before the pandemic took hold, Stephen Beckett went to Beijing to meet some of the major players in the Chinese social media landscape. When it comes to social media, China is a world away from the West - that's in part because of long-term government blocking of US tech giants like Google and Facebook, and that's partially why the country has evolved its own completely distinct online ecosystem. China, with its huge population of over 1.3 billion people has plenty of room for social ideas. </p><p>And the competition is intense. These are the head offices of Kuaishou, they're one of the biggest social networks here, they've got over 200 million active users, but unless you're in China, you probably haven't heard of it. Kuaishou has made a name for itself by targetting China's relatively-untapped rural population, and that's a lot of people - around 40% don't live in cities. And that has led to a platform where the stars aren't necessarily what you expect. Kuaishou's secret sauce is the options it gives streamers to make their streams pay. TRANSLATION: I'm a professional musician. I also give lectures via Kuaishou in my spare time, which teach people how to play the Chinese sorna. I try to popularise Chinese traditional music and knowledge. Between sales of recorded lessons, purchases of virtual gifts during livestreams, he says he makes around #15,000 a month, and that is after Kuaishou takes their 25% commission. But Kuaishou's 200 million users isn't quite so impressive when you compare it to China's social titan Tencent, and their so-called mega app WeChat. And now WeChat is becoming a daily part of life, thanks to something called Mini-Programs. TRANSLATION: WeChat Mini-Programs are an app that doesn't require you to download and install, they are sub-applications within the WeChat ecosystem, and a new tool developed by WeChat. Many programmes allow third parties to add new features to WeChat on demand. It's a bit like having the entire App Store already on your phone. The idea is that you can pretty much do everything you could ever want on your phone without ever closing WeChat. These vending machines are set up to use WeChat's new facial pay feature. The idea is you opt into it in the app and once you've done that, you can use your face to buy anything from these machines. It basically links your face to your face to your WeChat account and your government ID. But, is the convenience worth the possible cost to privacy? In 2016, Amnesty International awarded the parent company of WeChat, Tencent, zero out of 100 for their privacy practices. I think there's a common perception that people in China don't care about their privacy, and that perception is completely false. The government over the last few years has been trying to roll out its own cybersecurity regulations and trying to educate consumers about the dangers of data being lost or leaked. WeChat's privacy policy says it will provide the Chinese government access to much of what you do in the app when legally required, including the things you type and data like your location. It's hard to deny that social apps in China have taken on a life of their own, if not outpacing, then going in new directions to competitors in the West. The big question is whether more Chinese apps can follow TikTok in going global, despite the concerns around privacy and censorship. That was Stephen Beckett's view of China. And since the explosion of TikTok in the West, other apps have been springing up to try and compete. And Chris Fox has been looking at some of the alternatives that are available. If you can't get enough of short, hyper-edited videos, luckily there are plenty of apps that have cottoned on to the format. This is Triller, which I think is fair to say, has taken a bit of inspiration from TikTok. You can record clips with special effects and share them onto an endless scrolling feed of content. Triller seems to have done quite well out of all this uncertainty, at the start of August, it topped the app store charts on both iOS and Android and has managed to attract some big-name TikTok stars and celebrities over to its platform, including Mike Tyson and magician Dynamo. Another app offering a similar experience is Byte, which has also been popping in and out of the App Store top download charts. Like TikTok, it offers you creative effects for your videos, although it is trailing behind Triller, it's been downloaded over 1 million times on Google Play, whereas Triller has had more than ten million. Tiktok's biggest competition may come from Instagram Reels, Instagram's newly-launched rival. It has incorporated many of TikTok's core features, including that endlessly-scrolling feed of short videos. Just in the past few weeks, Mark Zuckerberg has appeared at a Congressional hearing about big tech companies using their power to neutralise the competition. Isn't ripping off TikTok essentially doing that? There is innovation everywhere and people are constantly inspired by what they see. It's no longer a surprise to see a feed in a mobile social product, that wasn't the case until Facebook brought that to scale. We brought stories to Instagram in 2016. And give full credit to Snap for inventing that format, but evolved it from there. So what is Instagram bringing to the table with this format, that makes it different to TikTok? I think the ability to be discovered is unique to Reels. I think in Instagram, historically, if you had a large follower base</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-dca02dab2ab544288677b4a3a5594c53</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60KR-JB61-JBH6-C4K4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"952\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

This year's report offers insights on four major antitrust themes that will have significant implications to businesses and M&amp;amp;A environment around the world, in light of growing political tensions, development of the digital economy and increasing regulatory scrutiny.  1. Merger Control \u2013 antitrust authorities across the EU as well as in China are getting tougher on gun-jumping violation cases. </p><p>New rules, new agencies and new policies are emerging across jurisdictions to modernise and strengthen merger review processes. There are also new ideas about which mergers harm competition that could create fresh obstacles for future deals.  2. Enforcement \u2013 while the European Commission's \u20ac4.34 billion antitrust fine on Google broke the world record, a number of Asia-Pacific authorities have also imposed their highest ever fines in the past year. At the same time, authorities are expanding their tools to improve efficiency in handling the increased amount of antitrust cases and there is growing competition between European venues to attract damages claims.  3. The Digital Economy \u2013 as the digital economy evolves while online platforms gain further market power, antitrust authorities are intensifying their focus on the tech sector and refining their thinking on the role of data in antitrust infringements and merger assessments. Regulators in various jurisdictions are putting forward new plans and special task forces to police tech companies.  4. Politicisation \u2013 the global trend of increased politicisation of M&amp;amp;A and antitrust continues. From the US to the EU, the scope of deals raising national security concerns has expanded in recent years, posing further risks for infrastructure, technology and data-driven transactions. In Europe, proposals to allow politicians to override competition laws are gaining traction, reflecting a shift in the EU\u2019s centre of gravity.  Thomas Vinje, Chairman of Clifford Chance Global Antitrust Group comments:  \"Antitrust is making headlines. We are seeing tougher enforcement against mergers and anticompetitive conduct on all continents, driven by a growing public and political consensus that more should be done to curb market power. The antitrust horizon is particularly foreboding for big tech players, with numerous jurisdictions planning more stringent regulation. Sophisticated compliance will be required to achieve and maintain a competitive edge in the coming year.  \"  Our global network of over 140 antitrust lawyers covers all the key hubs of Europe, Asia-Pacific and the US, enabling us to support our clients on their most complex and important antitrust matters across the world. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN963994620190416</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VWT-YN21-J9XT-P2G2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"488\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 16, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

MARTIN HOERLING, RESEARCH METEOROLOGIST, NOAA: So, in our report, in addition to looking at arctic changes, we've looked at weather events that occurred in the past year throughout the world, including such remote areas as Tasman Sea and a hot ocean temperature event that occurred in 2017 over the Tasman Sea. The science is finding these types of events are occurring increasingly frequently. And also -- this is really amazing -- is that these events are being found to occur only because of the increase in carbon dioxide. They could not have occurred in our grandfathers' and grandmothers' times when the carbon in the atmosphere was appreciably less. So we're hitting thresholds that have never been hit before and it is attributable to the increasing carbon dioxide due to human activities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BERMAN: All right, there you go. So you had quite a remarkable moment. The president dispatching an official to this conference where you're discussing hard scientific data like that, and yet pushing the use of more fossil fuels, which, of course, create the bulk of those carbon emissions. I just want to play that sound for folks at home to see that moment here. A U.S. official laughed at. Have a listen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Under President Trump's leadership, the United States is experiencing economic growth at record levels.</p><p>(INAUDIBLE).</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCIUTTO: I believe the laughing was not about the economic data but about the fact that he was pushing fossil fuels.</p><p>Just explain to us, if you can, Martin, you are part of this effort to address climate change. Where is the U.S. standing today, particularly in a moment like that, where you have the U.S. aligning itself with Russia, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia, three countries who are entirely dependent on fossil fuels for their economic health?</p><p>HOERLING: So I think it's important to look at the types of reports you're seeing from the scientific community as serving society as a whole, giving as much evidence basis, fact basis the truth as to what the science can say about how our environment is changing. Of course policy will take that as they need to. But the public needs to know as much facts as they can, the truth of what the situation is that's unfolding.</p><p>And these reports are containing that unvarnished truth, which may not always be as agreeable as we would like it to be, but, nonetheless, these are the facts. And whether we choose to embrace them or ignore them, they are the facts.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Yes. Yes.</p><p>I want to show these pictures just because it was so clear to me, as you look up there, we were up there in March and areas of the arctic ice that normally would be a clean, white, uninterrupted sheet were breaking up. They melt earlier. They freeze later. And the U.S. Navy, which is not exactly a wilting flower on this issue, it chronicles this, it tracks it itself. It has -- that's me freezing up there -- but it has documented this and its changing behavior and supports climate change behavioral change in response to this.</p><p>Tell us how this affects folks' lives at home because, of course, people look at that and say, well, it's up in the arctic, it's not going to bother me, but this gets to rising oceans and other issues, does it not?</p><p>HOERLING: Well, the arctic is the canary in the coal mine. There's no doubt about that and no report card speaks to the many arctic changes. Here where we live, if we're in Washington or if it's on the west coast in California, the effects of the arctic is a little bit different in what it's having an impact in the high latitudes. Basically, there's just less cold air available being generated in the arctic that would move into North America or Europe, if you will. So we have milder winters, for instance. We have less extreme cold waves on average. We may have heard about polar vortex events in the past. Those are perhaps less related to what the arctic is doing to just weather patterns.</p><p>But I think important also is that as much as the arctic is changing, climate change is also altering the weather patterns immediately in North America and other parts of Europe and Asia. Heat waves being an example. Heavy extreme rainstorms, storm surges with hurricanes. And these are the types of events, and fires, I can't emphasize fires enough in light of the recent events that we saw in California. These are being made more severe. And this is rather independent of the arctic but they're all tied together through the same phenomena, and that is, we are putting a lot of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and it traps the heat.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Well, we've got to do something about it.</p><p>Martin Hoerling, thanks very much for explaining it to us.</p><p>HOERLING: Thank you.</p><p>POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR: So important, and no replacement for what you saw, you being up there and seeing it for yourself.</p><p>All right, we'll stay on that.</p><p>Also, outrage in Texas after a former fraternity president, accused of rape, offered a plea deal with not only no jail time, doesn't even have to register as a sex offender? Coming up, his accuser's powerful response.</p><p>[10:39:29] SCIUTTO: There is outrage in Texas after prosecutors accepted a plea agreement that means a former fraternity president from Baylor University, who was accused of rape, will not go to jail. Jacob Anderson, the former president of Baylor's Phi Delta Theta Fraternity was accused of raping a sophomore. This at an off campus party in 2016. Anderson had faced a maximum of 20 years in jail, but an agreement with prosecutors means he will serve no jail time now and he also will not have to register as a sex offender.</p><p>HARLOW: Let me just take a moment here and read you part, part of the victim impact statement from this girl who says she was raped by Anderson when she was 19 years old.</p><p>[10:40:06] And I quote her, it must be horrible to be you. To know what you did to me. To know that you are a rapist. To know that you almost killed me. To know that you ruined my life, stole my virginity, and stole many other things from me.</p><p>She goes on to say, by the grace of God, I am alive today to fight this injustice. One breath either way and Jacob Walter Anderson would be on trial for murder.</p><p>Our Ed Lavandera is all over this story. He joins us now from Texas.</p><p>Good morning, Ed.</p><p>Just walk us through what we know at this point.</p><p>ED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Poppy and Jim.</p><p>It's also important to keep in context in all of this, this is, you know, surrounding Baylor University, which over the course of the last several years has been embroiled in these types of cases, and a huge scandal involving that, and, obviously, the role that the local prosecutor's office there in Waco played in all of this. So this kind of coming on the heels of what has already been a highly publicized scandal for that Waco area.</p><p>But, as you mentioned, this dating back to February of 2015. This off- campus fraternity party where Jacob Anderson is accused of raping this young victim. He was indicted on four counts of sexual assault. And despite all of that, he's essentially pleaded no contest to unlawful restraint, which is a third-degree felony. And the details of that include no jail time, a $400 fine, and receive counseling. That probation is supposed to last about three years. So after that three- year period is over, all of this would be expunged from his record, if there are no other problems during that -- during that three-year period. But in a highly intense and emotional moments inside that courtroom when prosecutors and the defense attorneys and the judge all agreed to this plea deal, I'll read you a little bit more of what the victim in this case also went on to say during that court hearing yesterday. This is from our affiliates down there in Waco, saying, quote, if I had the courage to come back to Waco, she's referencing this because apparently the prosecutor and the D.A. did not appear in the courtroom yesterday, she said if I had the courage to come back to Waco and face my rapist and testify, you could at least have had enough respect for me to show up. You both will have to live with this decision to let a rapist run free in society without any warning to future victims. I wonder if you will have nightmares every night watching Jacob rape me over and over again.</p><p>According to the victim's attorneys in this case, they basically said that Jacob Anderson had left this victim to die, choking on her own vomit. And that's why this victim was describing this in such emotional terms.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Just heartbreaking.</p><p>Ed Lavandera, thanks very much for following the story.</p><p>HARLOW: All right, regulating big tech. Our next guest, Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, says it must happen. This is Google's CEO -- those are live pictures -- Google's CEO right now publicly testifying for the first time on Capitol Hill. What would she ask him, next.</p><p>[10:47:40] HARLOW: All right, so underway right now, Google's CEO, Sundar Pichai, is testifying for the first time ever publicly on Capitol Hill. He is going to be grilled about accusations of political bias by the president and other Republicans. In August, President Trump blasted Google, accusing it of rigging search results against him and, quote, suppressing the voice of conservatives. That is an accusation that Google vehemently denies.</p><p>The Google CEO told lawmakers as part of his prepared testimony this morning, quote, I lead this company without political bias. To do otherwise would go against our core principles and interests.</p><p>HARLOW: Joining us now is Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. She has been pushing on big tech for regulation and she joins me now.</p><p>Good morning. Thank you for being here.</p><p>SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D), MINNESOTA: Thanks, Poppy.</p><p>HARLOW: Look, the Senate Judiciary Committee invited Google and other big tech CEOs to testify in April. We only saw FaceBook come forward. There was that sort of famous empty chair moment before the Senate Intel Committee where we saw Google choose not to testify. And I wonder if you were before him today asking questions of the Google CEO, what would be the first question, the most important question that you would ask him?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Well, first of all, thanks for the opportunity to put those questions out there. I hope my House colleagues will hear them because I think it is really important. Yes, these are great companies. But Google is one that has not supported the Honest Ads Act. And while they have done some self-reporting, they haven't even done issue ads. And this is a bill that I put forward with Senator Warner and former Senator McCain, who we miss very much.</p><p>And I would like to ask him why they would not come out and strongly support a bill that we can get done, I think eventually here in the House and Senate, that says, come on, you've got to disclose these political ads and have disclaimers. So that's number one.</p><p>The second is privacy. And the fact that they have had their own bug in their system, which Senator Cortez Masto and I sent a letter way back this fall and now it's gotten worse. I think it's an example of why you want to have notification of users when there's a breach within 72 hours.</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: And that's a bill I have with Senator Kennedy.</p><p>So I think while I know some of our Republican colleagues in the House want to focus on this partisan issue, which I just haven't seen proof of in terms of their search engine being biased. I think we've got to find the common ground on this, which is privacy rules that protect all Americans and then doing something about these fake political ads and ads coming in from places like Russia.</p><p>[10:50:20] HARLOW: So I spoke to a very high ranking Google executive just this morning, minutes before our show started, who told me I think they, being lawmakers, will be pleasantly surprised at how thoughtful he is and his willingness to work with D.C., roll up his sleeves and work with them.</p><p>So when it comes to your proposed legislation of the Honest Ads Act, it's basically for transparency so that all of these social media sites, big tech, has to put out there who bought this ad, who paid for it, et cetera, in the wake of Russia's election meddling in the 2016 election. You say Google is not supportive of it at this point in time. You also tweeted in March that you were surprised to hear Mark Zuckerberg's interview and FaceBook's change position on it. It sounds like FaceBook is now supportive of it. What is the last thing you heard from Google on this front? Is there no way that they're getting behind it?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Oh, we just simply don't have their support yet. Twitter is also supporting the bill.</p><p>And just to make this clear, when a political ad runs on CNN, or you've got something on radio, my little radio station in Thief River Falls, Minnesota, they have got to disclose those ads, and they have to have disclaimers. $1.4 billion was spent in the last presidential race in online ads. The same kind of ads you see on TV. There's absolutely no reason we should let dark money hide behind a veil and pay for ads and then we don't know who paid for them.</p><p>HARLOW: So, senator, you tweeted just yesterday, this is part of what you tweeted, quote, we must give people power over their data. Does the United States need even more than the Honest Ads Act? Does the United States need something akin to GDPR in Europe where it forces all of these big tech companies, if you or I or any American were to ask them, show me everything you have on me, they would have to hand over that data. Do we need that much?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: We don't have to do exactly what Europe did. But we sure need to do something. And the first thing would be, as you point out, transparency in the data that's collected. The second would be making sure you can opt out of your data being collected if you want to. And the third is to have a notice if you have a breach, just like other companies do.</p><p>We love these companies. They're uniquely American companies. But they can't be on a castle in a hill, OK? They have got to realize that they are part of a major consumer force here and consumers need to be protected.</p><p>HARLOW: You wrote a letter to Mark Zuckerberg just last month, and I'll read part of it. You said, all of what we've learned from \"The New York Times\" exclusive reporting on FaceBook, for example, quote, raises concern that the company could improperly or illegally use its vast financial and data resources against government officials and critics seeking to protect the public and our democracy. That was a letter to Mark Zuckerberg of FaceBook.</p><p>Did you hear back from him? It's a letter that you penned with other Democratic senators.</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: We have not heard back any extensive answer here from them, and Definers (ph), the company that they had hired and then had terminated. And that was, of course, this issue that we found out that they had hired this company to do oppo research. OK, people can do research. But then we found out that charts were issued that were to journalists that basically undermined elected officials before a hearing. We found out that they had gone after their critics, like George Soros, and used their own platform to spread it as far as we can see. So we're just trying to get to the bottom of this to determine if there were any campaign financial violations or any SEC violations.</p><p>This is serious stuff. Companies can do research, but they better be careful of what they're doing if they start crossing the line legally.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes. So no extensive response from Mark Zuckerberg or FaceBook on that.</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: No, we're awaiting that.</p><p>HARLOW: Just one final point on FaceBook after \"The New York Times\" investigative reporting; Part of it, as you know, included what they say was a tense conversation between you and FaceBook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, who called you to complain about your attacks on FaceBook.</p><p>Did Sheryl Sandberg ask you to dial down your public criticism, senator, of FaceBook?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: This was a discussion and -- where there were other staff people on the phone as well. I wouldn't have called it heated. But what I would say is that we had a vigorous discussion about this issue ad piece because at the time, and now I want to make clear, FaceBook since did support the bill and since supported, including issues ad, because at the time they weren't supporting it. They said it was hard to figure out what were issues ads. And I said, well, you know what, these are the kinds of ads that are really being used by other countries like Russia to divide America, whether it's in the civil liberty areas or energy. And, guess what, TV, radio, little newspapers, they're somehow able to figure it out because that's federal law.</p><p>[10:55:12] So that was our discussion. We didn't change the bill. And then, sure enough, during the hearing when Mark Zuckerberg testified, he came out in support of the bill a few months later.</p><p>And so I just think we need to have this bill passed because it's not just FaceBook and Twitter and Google. It is all these major platforms. And they're all doing different things and claiming their voluntarily disclosing, which we appreciate very much, but you have to have a law, like you do for everything else, or you're going to have a repeat of the same thing in the next presidential.</p><p>HARLOW: Senator Amy Klobuchar, please keep us posted on what you do hear back from all these big, powerful tech companies on this front.</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: I will, Poppy.</p><p>HARLOW: And thank you for your time this morning.</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Thank you. Always good to be on a Minnesotan's show. Thank you, Poppy.</p><p>HARLOW: Thank you, senator.</p><p>Jim.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Quite a big deal. Big tech companies regulated.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>SCIUTTO: And it seems like it's becoming more of a possibility.</p><p>HARLOW: It's coming.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Yes.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes, it's coming.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Well, in just minutes, the president is set for a big meeting with top Democrats Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. All of this as a government shutdown looms. Will they make a deal? Stay with us.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2018121104CNV11</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TY5-3K71-JB20-G35S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3009\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 11, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC000D9FB</classCode><className>AL MUDON INTERNATIONAL REAL ESTATE CO KSCC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>BAYLOR UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

As I speak, wildfires are devouring the American West and consuming American lives: east of Salem, OR, two people dead in a scorched vehicle; in Butte County, CA, three dead, overrun by a fast-moving fire; in Ashland, a 1-year-old boy; in Malden, WA, almost the entire town burned down; half a million Oregonians evacuated due to fire. That is 1 out of 10 people in the entire State. Over the weekend, Oregon's emergency management director said they are preparing for a ``mass fatality event.'' Paradise, CA, suffered apocalyptic destruction in the 2018 Camp Fire. It is, once again, under fire warnings, this time the North Complex fire, which has stunned firefighters with its rapid growth and ferocity. We cannot avoid it. Climate change is here. Plenty of factors contribute to individual wildfires, but climate change is now always among them. Last fall, I went out to the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Colorado and met leading wildfire researcher Daniel Swain. As Dr. Swain puts it: Climate change has not just made the extreme heat waves that coincide with fires worse. The bigger effect is the more subtle, long-term warming. That couple of degrees of (average) warming over decades . . . it's lurking in the background, sucking extra moisture out of the vegetation and the soil. The new normal is smoke, ash, orange skies, and constant nerve- fraying vigilance. Climate change's impacts through the West land crushing economic blows. The 2018 Camp Fire that burned Paradise cost $16.7 billion. NOAA says natural disasters--mostly hurricanes and wildfires, both highly climate-related--inflicted $91 billion worth of damage that year, 2018; and over the past 40 years, 241 climate- and weather-related disasters have cost Americans $1.6 trillion. The first report I want to talk about warns that it is not just what is lost in floods and flames. As climate risk worsens, the harder it is for communities to rebuild, for bankers to write mortgages, for owners to find insurers willing to continue to write policies and pay out claims. That risk spreads beyond burned or flooded land and runs through the rest of the economy. Climate risk becomes what economists call systemic risk. So one of our leading regulatory agencies, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, has done a report on risk. [[Page S5600]] Think of the 2008 financial crisis. That home mortgage problem spread far beyond mortgage lenders into a brutal global recession. Millions of people who had no connection to a bad mortgage lost their jobs, lost their homes, or lost their retirement savings. Many are still recovering from that collapse. Now think even worse. The Stanford Business School's Corporations and Society Initiative believes ``the financial risks from climate change are systemic''--there is that economic word again--that these risks are ``singular in nature''; and that ``[g]lobal economic losses from climate change could reach $23 trillion--three or four times the scale of the 2008 Financial Crisis.'' Those of us who were here for the 2008 financial crisis don't want to see that happen again, and we certainly don't want to see it happen at a three- or four-times scale. Senator Schatz and I have been calling for financial regulators to do a better job accounting for these risks. In May, we wrote to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Subcommittee on Climate-Related Market Risk. We had two simple requests: One, recommend a carbon price, and, two, urge our financial regulators to include climate risks in their core market risk assessments and supervisory practices. The CFTC Subcommittee report is out, and I am happy to report that they did both. They write: ``Financial markets will only be able to channel resources efficiently to activities that reduce greenhouse gas emissions if an economy-wide price on carbon is in place at a level that reflects the true social cost of those emissions.'' That is actually kind of economics 101, but it is good to hear them say it. They went on to say: Climate change poses a major risk to the stability of the U.S financial system and to its ability to sustain the American economy. . . . U.S financial regulators must recognize that climate change poses serious emerging risks to the U.S financial system, and they should move urgently and decisively to measure, understand, and address these risks. And what if we don't? Well, the CFTC report goes on: Failing to act would lead to what they called ``disorderly repricing of assets''--that is commonly known as a crash--``with cascading effects'' through the economy. Put simply, do nothing and trigger financial chaos far and wide, just like 2008, except probably worse. The CFTC report calls for corporate America to tell the truth about climate-related risks to their business models. Investors need to know the truth for the free market to operate. The subcommittee writes that we must require ``disclosure by corporations of information on material, climate-related financial risks . . . to ensure that climate risks are measured and managed effectively.'' That is a key point. We have seen Exxon, for instance, downplay climate risks to investors, shareholders, and the general public. That mischief will stop if financial regulators require an honest accounting of climate-related risks. The CFTC report is a big deal, but it requires Congress to act. America is among the few industrialized nations worst prepared for wide-ranging reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Regulators will not be enough; Congress must act. That is where another report comes in, the Senate Democrats' Special Report on the Climate Crisis. Under Chairman Schatz's leadership, we recently released a roadmap for fixing that problem. We propose a plan to cut emissions across our economy, to get on course to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, to create a host of well-paying jobs in clean energy and other emerging technologies, and to remedy the burdens of pollution across all sectors of the economy, including those usually overlooked. We know we have a battle ahead. The fossil fuel industry runs a covert operation that has blocked progress in Congress. This covert op is extremely well funded and has reached its roots deeply into our politics. We need to tear up those roots. This is how. First, our report tells the dark story of that covert op: the story of the fossil fuel industry apparatus built to obscure the industry's hands behind phony front groups, the story of capture and control of corporate trade associations, the story of lives marketed by flashy PR firms, and the story of brute-force political spending and threats to blockade climate progress. Those tactics were a test run for the fossil fuel industry by Big Tobacco: Manufacture false doubt in science and flex your political muscle against anyone who dares to challenge you. That bullying worked pretty well, and then when the Supreme Court handed down Citizens United, the fossil fuel industry supercharged its covert campaign with dark money, almost immediately turning the ability to spend unlimited money in politics into spending unlimited dark money in politics. Then the bullying worked really well. Citizens United was a climate watershed. After that decision unleashed its fearful weaponry, not one Republican in this body joined any comprehensive bill to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The Senate heartbeat of bipartisan climate activity before Citizens United, which I remember and experienced in 2007, 2008, and 2009, all flat-lined under the supercharged political pressure unleashed by fossil fuel interests with Citizens United behind them. Our Senate report tells the full rotten story because that is step 1 in fighting covert influence. Follow the money. Show the American people how corporate interests pay to block progress on climate. Show the co-opted trade associations and the phony front groups. Let the American people see the scheme, and they are less likely to fall for it. Second is cleaning it up. Fully exposing and ending Citizens United dark money and the fossil fuel scheme will take reform. Bold transparency measures like the DISCLOSE Act are needed, and our report calls for that. Then, we need to wake up the so-called good guys in corporate America. They need to see the mischief a few bad actors have perpetrated right under their noses. They need to see how the fossil fuel industry commandeered their corporate trade associations, like the U.S Chamber of Commerce, which is one of the two most obstructive organizations against climate action. Why would the U.S Chamber of Commerce, with its wide corporate membership, be one of the two most obstructive organizations against climate action unless the fossil fuel industry had co-opted it right under their noses? The so-called good guys need to examine how their own lobbyists and their own trade associations and their own political operatives are doing on climate because with very few and very rare exceptions, the answer is that they are doing nothing on climate, not lifting a finger in Congress. Just last week, the giant tech companies came in through their trade group TechNet, with a 13-page list of all of their lobbying priorities--13 pages and not a mention of climate. Google, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook--the Big Tech barons--a lot of big talk, and they never even mentioned climate in their shopping list for Congress. Everyone needs to understand the two faces of corporate America and to imagine how quickly Congress would act if powerful trade associations like the chamber became actual advocates for serious climate policies or if the big interests in Congress, like Big Ag, or Big Tech, or Wall Street, or the insurance industry actually took an interest in something more than their own special interest programs and tax benefits. What if climate had been on Big Tech's list of priorities, perhaps even on page 1 of 13? That would change the game. A 16th century alchemist by the name of Paracelsus is credited with the phrase ``sola dosis facit venenum,'' Latin for ``the dose makes the poison.'' The dose makes the poison. The idea is that everything from a nerve agent to the water we need to drink to survive can be lethal if delivered in sufficient dosage. Right now, in the American West, toxins in the climate wildfire smoke waft in such high concentrations that our typical measurement systems fail. The dosage is literally off the charts. In our Earth's atmosphere, the dosage of carbon dioxide is way outside the range of human experience, putting all of mankind into uncharted territory, to face unprecedented dangers. Citizens United unleashed toxic doses of money, unprecedented doses of virulent dark money, into our American [[Page S5601]] political atmosphere. So our democracy is poisoned, stunned by secret fossil fuel money and threats, and, consequently, failing to listen to plain warnings like those of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. We had better act before the poison has overpowered us, and we had better get the dosages back to safe and normal levels. One good start would be to wake up to the reality of climate change. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS3761524</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60VR-4KX1-JDG9-Y05G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1916\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 16, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Those who do nothing ride free, while those who undertake costly reductions pay dearly. If an important player does not go along, the others could establish a climate club with penalties in the form of tariffs for the free rider.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On June 1, 2017, President Trump announced his intent to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement. This intent was reiterated in a December 2018 meeting of the Parties. Thus, the US is on the trajectory of becoming that free rider.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">From a strategic point of view, we are reminded that 'economic elites and organized groups representing business interests have substantial and independent impact on US government policy, while average citizens and mass-based interest groups have little or no independent influence.' (Gilens 2014)</p><p>Given the present situation and dynamics of free riders, the critical question is: where are the US economic elites going? Strangely, my impression is that our economic elites are in a bind.</p><p>Indeed they obtained huge benefits through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reported that under the Act, individuals and pass-through entities like partnerships and S corporations would receive about $1,125 billion in net benefits (i.e., net tax cuts offset by reduced healthcare subsidies) over ten years, while corporations would receive around $320 billion in benefits. The only catch here is that this represents a continuation of the story of economic inequality.</p><p>The top one percent had real income after transfers and taxes, 225 percent greater than that in 1979 as compared to 41 percent for the middle class. From 1989 to 2018, the top 1 percent increased its total net worth by $21 trillion. The bottom 50 percent saw its net worth decrease by $900 billion over the same period, in 2018 dollars (Bruenig 2019).</p><p>The American dream of upward mobility has been dramatically weakened, with many families taking on multiple jobs trying to pay higher education, health care, and adequate housing. Some financial elites are beginning to wonder if this is good for America and the market.</p><p>'Shortsighted executives may be satisfied with an American economy whose firms win in global markets without lifting US living standards. But any leader with a long view understands that business has a profound stake in the prosperity of the average American.' (Vladmanis 2014)</p><p>Another part of the economic elite, the managers of Big Oil have been hyper-active, promoting more sales of fossil fuels and the weakening of environmental regulation involving their products.</p><p>The petroleum industry may have made a compromise with the automotive sector, avoiding two auto emission standards and two markets for future vehicles, an absurd and anti-economic situation, apparently finally abandoned thanks to the resistance of California and other states. Naturally, carbon pricing is off the agenda, along with modifying the massive oil subsidies.</p><p>Big Tech, another critical component of the economic elite, has avoided any constraining legislation. What Tech, and all of us, did not get with Trump was an infrastructure program, which could have had many features of a green economy, such as the use of more renewables, decentralized energy production, energy-efficient buildings. Of course, the oil industry would be opposed to this version of infrastructure.</p><p>Big Tech does not conduct a significant amount of research on climate change. Some loners, like Bill Gates, through his foundation, are running some pilot experiments. Tech may believe that science and technology can solve everything.</p><p>Still, it seems they are applying their new super tool, Artificial Intelligence, primarily to lower labor costs or to get more information about us consumers and forecast (and change) our purchasing habits. If one takes climate change seriously, they are solving the wrong problems.</p><p>Are they going to sit out climate change in fire-protected villas, or allocate needed funds for technological research on climate warming? What about supporting an ARPA for climate research?</p><p>International banks are getting a bit uneasy about the prospects of the fossil fuel industry. In a new draft policy, the European Investment Bank pledged to stop funding of fossil infrastructure projects by the end of next year.</p><p>In addition, stock prices of the oil and gas sector of the S and P total markets index have been declining five years for a variety of reasons, but one issue is what happens if there is more adherence to the Paris Agreement.</p><p>Some banks are prohibiting investments in new coal projects, the most damaging source in terms of local air pollution and deaths. Instead, they are actively financing renewable energy projects.</p><p>Recently 225 of the world's largest 500 companies, participating in a continuing disclosure survey for climate change, reported substantial risks to climate change but with potential opportunities outweighing the risks. They also had higher rates of board oversight and stakeholder scrutiny of climate-related issues and higher rates of potential reputational risks.</p><p>'The top four drivers for potential financial impact are increased revenue through demand for low emission products and services; better competitive position to reflect shifting consumer preferences; increased revenue through new solutions to adaption needs; and increased capital availability (as more investors favor low emissions producers).' (CDP 2019). These global producers appear to operate in an environment quite different from the US situation.</p><p>In my opinion, the primary short-term stumbling blocks for the US economic elites are the economic and international uncertainties generated by the Trump administration. A return to protectionism is not helpful, nor is the lack of trust of America in trade and foreign relations. This could be improved with new elections.</p><p>Two essential issues remain: how to deal with climatic and economic injustice. Mother nature will keep reminding us of our progress, or lack thereof, in combating climate warming. All the recent forest fires from Brazil to California should be a wake-up call. The hollowing out of the middle class, also due to unfavorable globalization, is not going away and may eventually find a more articulate political voice.</p><p>In other words, the US economic elites, at least in part, could go for green infrastructure, some carbon taxes, and higher income (lower taxes) for the middle and lower classes. It is a shift to the left but in their best interests and more in line with the international situation. This implies a potential conflict of interests between the oil industry and the others.</p><p>What the economic elites, and many others, keep underestimating is the race against time with climate change. Not only does it cost much more if you delay investing in climate abatement, but there may be a point where it will become apparent that additional economic growth is the problem.</p><p>Energy intensity is declining at around 0.4 percent a year. To hit midcentury global de-carbonization targets, global energy intensity needs to decline by between 4 and 10 percent a year. That means the world should accelerate efficiency and electrification rates by about ten times (REN21 2019).</p><p>Diverse rebound effects are working against rapid improvements in energy intensity, as reported by the European Environmental Bureau (Parrique 2019). Not meeting these targets implies a much warmer climate, higher costs, lower productivity, and even more drastic needs for intensity reductions, which we eventually may not be able to achieve.</p><p>If we get to the necessity of de-growth, this will challenge our traditional capitalistic model and make the economic inequalities practically impossible to justify. The kings indeed will be nude. United consumers and labor unions may make a difference in forcing a change in the model, as occurred in Germany where labor participates in management.</p><p>Economic elites, what is your next move? Drifting towards a free rider or doing something that maybe your children could live with?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRENZA-PRESZA1612201900001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRENZA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XS4-D0T1-F00C-62TG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">423885</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1362\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

big tech to Big Oil, global corporations in all sectors are churning out climate action plans to reduce carbon footprints and adapt to tomorrow's low-carbon economy. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At Davos' annual conclave of the rich and powerful, \"it is all that anyone is talking about,\" Alain Roumilhac, CEO of ManPowerGroup France, told AFP Wednesday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But many of these seemingly ambitious pledges are more greenwashing than green, experts caution. </p><p>Indeed, the tsunami of eco-initiatives sparked by a rising tide of climate anxiety range, for the most part, from doubtful to deceptive, they say.</p><p>One planet-saving idea with serious traction among titans of industry -- including major fossil fuel companies such as Shell, BP and ENI --  is planting trees, which absorb and store CO2 as they grow.</p><p>\"We are facing a planetary climate crisis and trees are one of the most effective ways to sequester carbon,\" Marc Benioff, founder and chairman of cloud computing powerhouse Salesforce, said in the Swiss resort. </p><p>Even notorious climate sceptic Donald Trump, also in Davos, backed a \"trillion trees\" reforestation scheme hailed by global media as a silver-bullet solution when unveiled last year by Swiss researchers.</p><p>The plan calls for covering nearly a billion hectares -- an area larger than the continental United States -- with foliage.  </p><p>Big business in general has jumped on the tree-planting bandwagon, with many signing up to \"offset\" schemes that allow them to continue pumping CO2 into the atmosphere.   </p><p>But the Swiss study, published in Science, came in for a severe drubbing from peers, with four top experts -- writing in the same journal -- dismissing it as \"incorrect scientifically and dangerously misleading\".</p><p>\"Heroic reforestation can help, but it is time stop suggesting there is a 'nature-based solution' to ongoing fossil fuel use,\" Myles Allen, head of the Climate Dynamics Group at the University of Oxford, told AFP at the time. </p><p>\"There isn't.\"</p><p>- Flawed science -</p><p>The study's long list of flaws, according to Allen and dozens of other scientists, includes overestimating the CO2-absorbing capacity of the trees, overlooking the possibility that their dark canopy will absorb the Sun's radiation, and the fact that much of the land earmarked will be needed to feed 10 billion people in 2050.</p><p>The authors of the study defended their findings, but described it as a thought experiment more than an action plan.</p><p>\"Sometimes these climate policies are decent, but often -- and especially when it comes to the financial sector -- they are incremental or voluntary moves,\" said Greenpeace executive director Jennifer Morgan, who is participating in several Davos events this week.</p><p>\"Greenwashing is misinformation, a blurring of reality, and given the urgency of the climate emergency we have no time left for spin or hypocrisy.\"</p><p>Microsoft, meanwhile, announced a plan last week that would not only allow the software giant to become \"carbon neutral\" within a decade, but also to erase its entire carbon footprint since its creation in 1975. </p><p>But here again, the claim depends on blanketing large swathes of the planet with dense foliage, as well as technologies that do not yet exist on a meaningful scale, such as machines that suck CO2 directly out of the air.</p><p>Without these compensating measures, Microsoft's CO2 emissions -- which it estimates at 59 million tonnes per year -- would be reduced by just over half in 2030.</p><p>Perhaps even more problematic are highly lucrative deals that Microsoft has supplying major oil and gas companies with state-of-the-art tools to boost extraction rates and supply forecasts.</p><p>Last year, for example, ExxonMobil said it would use the software giant's cloud technology to analyse oil reserves in its Permian Basin project in the US southwest. </p><p>\"You simply cannot claim to support ambitious climate action one moment and then continue to cosy up to industries that are at the core of this crisis,\" said Sriram Madhusoodanan, deputy campaigns director at Corporate Accountability, a watchdog group. </p><p>- Say one thing, do another -</p><p>That same type of cognitive dissonance crops us across all sectors of the economy.</p><p>The industry-led Alliance to End Plastic Waste, for example, is investing one billion dollars on recycling, but at the same time its members are spending many times that amount to open up new plastics production.</p><p>Pledges like Microsoft's are often accompanied by lobbying efforts to ward off government regulations, resulting in an unenforceable web of voluntary corporate commitments, according to some experts.</p><p>\"A totally voluntary and unregulated corporate responsibility approach facilitates the diffusion of greenwashing,\" researchers led by Lucia Gatti from the Universita della Svizzera Italiana concluded in a peer-reviewed study last year.</p><p>Governments have started to crack down on greenwashing.</p><p>Last week, Italy's Competition and Marketing Authority fined Italian oil and gas giant ENI a maximum five million euros for deceiving consumers over its \"green diesel\" claims in advertising.</p><p>On Monday, the International Energy Agency (IEA) reported that the oil and gas sector worldwide spent less than one percent of capital investments in 2018 outside their core business areas, such as on renewables. </p><p>In December, the European Union tightened the rules for which financial investments can be labelled \"environmentally sustainable\". </p><p>\"The EU's green standard means that people can no longer be sold fake green investments,\" said William Todts, executive director of watchdog group Transport &amp; Energy.</p><p>SALESFORCE.COM</p><p>EXXONMOBIL</p><p>ENI</p><p>BP</p><p>MICROSOFT</p><p>ROYAL DUTCH SHELL

Trading is over on Wednesday, the 12th  of October.  Tonight voting begins in battleground states with Hillary  Clinton in a commanding lead.  Samsung sees its latest setup of profits go  up in smoke, and making history for all the wrong reasons.  The pound  slumps to an all-time low.  I'm Maggie Lake.  This is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> As early voting begins in key swing states across America, Hillary Clinton  has the edge over Donald Trump, if a new set of polls are to be believed.   New numbers on the presidential race show Clinton either holding on to a  decisive lead or wiping out her Republican rivals' advantage.  National  polls out today from Reuters and Rasmussen given Clinton a lead of seven  and four points respectively.  Another poll from \"Los Angeles Times\", which  has had Trump in the lead the past few months now has the race a tie.  </p><p> With Clinton still riding high, Trump's path to the White House looks less  clear.  A reminder that whoever wins will need 270 electoral college votes.   According to CNN projections, Clinton is already on track to get that magic  number.  She's been consolidating support in key swing states like  Colorado, Virginia, and Pennsylvania.  If Clinton holds on to all blue  states shown here, it doesn't matter how many other Trump wins, as Clinton  will take the White House.  </p><p> We may be 27 days out from election day, but some Americans are already  heading to the polls.  Early voting kicked up in the crucial swing state of  Ohio Wednesday morning.  One of the only states we are still counting as a  battleground shown in yellow.  However, one new poll of likely Ohio voters  shows Clinton ahead by 9 percent in a four-way race.  Poppy Harlow has been  traveling through the swing states hearing first hands from her voters from  her special report \"YOUR MONEY/YOUR VOTE.\"  First she takes us to Ohio.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> POPPY HARLOW, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  This neighborhood in Cleveland, Ohio was  one of the strongest for President Obama in 2012.  Mitt Romney did not get  a single vote from people living in these homes.  Not one.  People living  here have been struggling economically for a long time and they still are.   So the question is, will they come out in droves for Hillary Clinton?  The  way they did for President Obama?  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Hillary.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Hillary is the best candidates.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  That's a no-brainer.  </p><p> HARLOW (voice-over):  There have been decades of economic despair and a  dwindling faith that politicians will help.  </p><p> JEFF CROSBY, YOUTH MENTOR, CLEVELAND PEACEMAKERS ALLIANCE:  I think the  Democratic platform is saying the same thing we have heard for about the  past 50 years.  </p><p> HARLOW (on camera):  Over and over?  </p><p> CROSBY:  Over and over.</p><p> HARLOW:  Since the war on poverty was declared?  </p><p> CROSBY:  Yes.  </p><p> HARLOW (voice-over):  Jeff Crosby used to be in gangs.  That landed him in  prison.  Now he's working to keep kids from the same life he lived.  </p><p> CROSBY:  It's one of the highest crime areas in Cleveland.  </p><p> HARLOW (on camera):  This is?  </p><p> CROSBY:  Yes.  About ten gangs over here.  What's up?  You're good?  I  think the Democratic Party is taking us for granted.  The Republican Party  his literally ignores us, except for Trump.  Trump is trying to make  inroads, but he is a polarizing figure.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I don't trust Donald.  That's all.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Because he's got money?  That ain't everything.  </p><p> SIERRA LESLEY, VOTER:  I'm willing to vote for a clown before Donald Trump.  </p><p> HARLOW:  Really?  </p><p> LESLEY:  Yes.  With a red nose.  I do agree with Republicans sometimes, but  I don't agree with nothing that Donald Trump stands for.  </p><p> HARLOW:  And that brings us to the second part of this Ohio chapter, 200  miles south.  We're in Pike County, Ohio.  This place matters a lot.  Not  for the number of votes here, but because of what it represents.  It used  to be solidly blue, but it's been moving more and more red.  In 2012, this  was the closest county in the country.  Mitt Romney won here by a single  vote, just one vote.  It's 96 percent white, largely blue collar, and  unemployment here is high.  These are exactly the voters Donald Trump has  been speaking to.  So if his message isn't resonating here, he's in  trouble.  </p><p> SCOTT HAMMOND, BUSINESS MANAGER:  I would say right now you're looking at a  coin toss.  </p><p> HARLOW:  A coin toss among union workers who until now have been solidly  blue.  Have we ever seen anything like that before?  Donald Trump says he's  the one to bring these jobs back?  He's the one to build up your industry?  </p><p> HAMMOND:  Donald Trump is saying that, that's total propaganda.  Where is  his merchandise made?  What does he have to offer to American industry?   Nothing.  </p><p> HARLOW (voice-over):  Many here do believe Trump and see them as their best  shot at getting ahead.  Since 2000, Ohio has lost nearly a third of its  manufacturing jobs.  </p><p> [16:05:00] BILL STANLEY, VOTER:  He's got a lot of things that are amazing  that he was telling us he can do for us.  </p><p> HARLOW:  Angie Shanks runs a successful real estate firm here.  </p><p> ANGIE SHANKS, VOTER:  It means more jobs, more better-paying jobs.  </p><p> HARLOW:  You voted for President Obama in 2008.  </p><p> SHANKS:  Yes, I did.  </p><p> HARLOW (voice-over):  But her faith in the Obama administration has faded.  </p><p> SHANKS:  I think Trump is a businessman and the country is a business.  It  needs to be run as a business.  </p><p> HARLOW:  When we met Angie, she is leaning towards Trump.  Now, after the  \"Access Hollywood\" tape surfaced, she's reconsidering.  </p><p> HARLOW:  You're a lifelong Democrat?  </p><p> CHARLIE SALTKIELD, VOTER:  Yes.  </p><p> HARLOW (on camera):  So you're voting for Hillary this time around?  </p><p> SALTKIELD:  No, I'm not.  </p><p> HARLOW:  No?</p><p> SALTKIELD:  My dad was a coal miner.  They put the coal miners out of the  work.  </p><p> HARLOW:  We left Ohio asking this question.  Why does economic pain from  one town to the left push some to the left, others to the right?  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> LAKE:  And Poppy Harlow joins us now in the studio.  Poppy, you touched on  the piece, but a lot of the people you talked to, the Trump tape had just  started coming out.  I know you circled back to a lot of them.  Do you feel  it's swaying people?  Or are they really focused on some of the themes they  talk to you about a smut doesn't matter?</p><p> HARLOW:  It's not swaying his loyal supporters.  Maggie, on this swing  state trip, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Florida, we talked to 26 solid Trump  supporters.  Like totally in the Trump camp.  So we called all of them back  obviously this weekend, after that tape was released with those comments  about groping women, and with the exception of three people they are all  standing by Trump.  One said she'll no longer vote for him, two are  undecided, but I think that gives you the lens of loyalty he has here in  this critical state.  I mean, no one has won the White House without  winning Ohio since 1960.</p><p> LAKE:  Except nobody can win the White House without getting swing voters  and some of the voters away from the other party's people.  And we know  he's got loyal supporters.  It's interesting as I was watching that piece,  we see these themes and we know the economic disarray.</p><p> Interesting they talked about his business, even though there's been  controversy about how he handled business, but another sign that really  struck me.  And it stopped the overdoses.  This is the middle of the  country that's been hit by the heroin epidemic.  They have lost job.  They  have lost faith in government it seems.  </p><p> HARLOW:  I'm so glad you bring that up.  Because that is something we  actually did a number of interviews, and even spoke with a woman at an  opioid clinic where they help people getting over these horrific  addictions.  And you don't see it here in that piece, because it's such a  huge issue to dive into.  We wanted to give it a just amount of time.  That  is ripping their society apart and their economy apart.  </p><p> LAKE:  And they don't feel like anyone is helping.  </p><p> HARLOW:  And they don't feel like anybody's helping, the state government,  local or nationally.  And they feel forgotten.  I think from the drug  epidemic there, to the lack of manufacturing jobs, they feel forgotten, and  their hope in politicians is gone.  That's why so many said to us they're  willing to bet on an unknown in Donald Trump.  Some of them said roll the  dice.</p><p> LAKE:  Do they know his policies, though?  Do they think that --</p><p> HARLOW:  They don't care.  That's a great point.  Their answer, many of  them, and were talking about many well-educated people that are supporting  him said, he's made money.  He's been a success.  We trust him to figure it  out, or surround himself with smart people that will.  It is the  willingness to try something else, because the establishment has failed  them in their mind.  </p><p> LAKE:  It's an indictment of Washington.  And not just --</p><p> HARLOW:  Absolutely.  </p><p> LAKE:  -- not just a Democrat or Republican administration.  I think  they're losing faith in government, which is very disturbing.  </p><p> HARLOW:  Maggie, the fact that you have union workers supporting Donald  Trump.  This is a solidly blue contingent that Hillary Clinton should be  able to not lose a minute of sleep over.  In Ohio, 12 percent of overall  workers are union.  That's higher than the national average.  That's huge.   The fact that so many of them are looking and siding with a Republican  ticket right now, I think is a huge indicate of where this country is  going.  But again, he needs to win over a big amount of those undecided  voters.  </p><p> LAKE:  And temperament remains an issue.  When you talk to his supporters,  do they recognize their concern about that?  Because it is something we  hear.  Although Hillary doesn't score much better.  Her trust factor.  </p><p> HARLOW:  They say we doth trust Hillary, right?  Or they say we don't  really like her, but we don't know why.  Then with Donald Trump there is  the temperament issue.  I mean, yes, a number of them said they're  concerned about his temperament.  Angie Shanks, the young woman, the blonde  woman who owns a real estate business, told me, yes, that did throw her  off, and she is concerned about this.  And that was before the tape came  out.  Now she told me on the phone this weekend, she's very undecided at  this point.  </p><p> They are worried about temperament, but they look at someone who's -- they  see it as successful in business.  The bankruptcies don't bother them.  And  you heard one woman say, well he has a hit television show.  </p><p> [16:10:02] I mean, that really to her is the definition of success.  That's  what Cindy Newberry told me, and she says our country needs that.  </p><p> LAKE:  It's easy to dismiss them, but we shouldn't dismiss the fact that so  many feel disenfranchised and feel like the system is no longer working for  him and that's what happened to all the Republican contenders.  They  underestimated that at their peril.</p><p> HARLOW:  Yes, and that's why it was so important to us, to me an hour team,  the amazing CNNMoney team who did this, to get out of the coast.  To get  out of New York and California, and get into middle America and talk to  these voters and hear from them directly.  This is part of a bigger series.  </p><p> LAKE:  Where are you going next?  </p><p> HARLOW:  So we're going tomorrow, were going to take you on the show to  Florida.  Which is fascinating, so that the Latinos and retires.  And then  we're going to take you to Pennsylvania, the Keystone state, which is  critical as well.  A bunch of the same problems as Ohio.  The manufacturing  job base just disappearing and depleted.  </p><p> LAKE:  These are serious problems and it's going to be a big platform for  whoever wins the presidency.  They're going to have to address this  feeling.  And by the way, it's not just happening in the U.S., we should  point out, a lot of this has an international thread as well.  Poppy, great  stuff.  Look forward to the next one.  </p><p> HARLOW:  Thank you.  </p><p> LAKE:  Thanks so much.  We'll have more, as poppy just mentioned, on her  series throughout the rest of the week, and in two weeks from now, Richard,  will be tackling  the swing states himself.  He'll be making his way through Florida as part  of his American Quest, speaking to leaders and voters who may hold the key  for decision the next president of the United States.  You can see that on  QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, on Monday, October 24th.  We know how much can change  in two weeks.  </p><p> Hillary Clinton's campaign is facing a new email controversy.  This time  involving WikiLeaks.  The whistleblowing website has published emails  hacked from the campaign manager John Podesta.  They allegedly show that  the Clinton campaign and the U.S. Justice Department shared information  while Clinton was under investigation for her use of a private email server  as U.S. Secretary of State.  Donald Trump wasted no time in trying to make  political capital from the leak.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  The WikiLeaks emails  show that Hillary Clinton's staff even has to give her secret notes on when  she needs to smile.  Smile, Hillary, smile.  Hey, folks, we have to get  back to work.  Our country is in trouble.  We can't play games any more.   Smile.  Can you believe it?  Smile.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LAKE:  The chairman John Podesta has blamed Moscow for involvement in the  hack.  Russia's foreign minister told CNN that is not true.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SERGEY LAVROV, RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER:  Well, it's flattering, of course,  to get this kind of attention for original power, as President Obama called  us some time ago.  Now everybody in the United States is saying that it is  Russia, which is running the United States presidential debate.  It's  flattering, as I said, but it has nothing, you know, to be explained by the  facts.  We have not seen a single fact, a single proof.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> LAKE:  CNN's Joe Johns is in Washington.  So, Joe, once again, we have this  revelations coming out about Hillary, does it tell us something we already  didn't know about the candidate?  </p><p> JOE JOHNS, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  I don't think so.  There  aren't any really big surprises in there.  It's sort of in the eye of the  beholder, if you look through these emails, perhaps a business embarrassing  for some of the people who work for the Clinton campaign, but no smoking  gun, as it were, Maggie.  </p><p> LAKE:  I imagine that there is, you know, a great deal of sort of positive  chatter within the Clinton campaign about some of these new polls coming  out.  They are encouraging, but this is in no way a runaway race,  especially considering some of the bombshells that come out about Trump.   How do they square the fact that it's still such a tough race?  </p><p> JOHNS:  They've been saying that all along.  They've really never changed  the message.  They've always said they expect this to be a close race at  the end of the day.  But certainly gratified about the latest polls.   Gratified even they say that the candidate herself was happy with her  performance in the last debate.  They say it will be a close race.  They're  concerned, of all things about people becoming complacent and not voting in  November because they look at these numbers.  That is what they're going to  fight against as we move toward November.  </p><p> LAKE:  It's interesting you mention that, Joe.  Because we do hear some  people feeling so disgusted or certainly Republicans turned off by Trump.   It's interesting to hear the Democrats are worried about the get out the  vote effort as well.  Clinton though has the entire Democratic establish  behind her.  Something Donald Trump is struggling with right now.  Does  that help her?  </p><p> [16:15:00] JOHNS:  Well, it certainly helps to have the whole Democratic  establishment behind you in force, out on the campaign trail with the  number one surrogate being the president of the United States himself.   Nonetheless, both of these candidates, both Hillary Clinton and Donald  Trump have very high negatives.  We've seen that all year long.  That's  another concern, that people might not be that excited about voting for  Hillary Clinton, and might stay home.  So they're working very hard to put  an affirmative message out there, not just about voting against Donald  Trump, but also Hillary Clinton making the case for why she says voters  need to vote for her along policy lines.  </p><p> LAKE:  Absolutely, and were still hearing from some people.  It may be a  day of decision for them.  A lot of work to be done.  Joe, thank you so  much.  Joe Johns for us tonight.  </p><p> Still ahead, hitting the wrong note.  Samsung proves that 7 isn't always  the lucky number and now faces more bad luck when it comes to the company's  balance sheet.  More on that next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> LAKE:  U.S. markets managed to hold their nerve after Tuesday's 200-point  drop.  The Dow closed slightly higher, up only 15 points.  It didn't really  manage to dig out of that hole.  In the past few hours, the Fed released  minutes from the last meeting.  It says a rate hike is needed, \"relatively  soon\" but there is no firm agreement on timing.  Paul La Monica is at the  New York Stock Exchange.  Paul, I think we already knew that their  inclination is to raise rates, but we still don't exactly know when.  </p><p> PAUL R.  LA MONICA, CNN MONEY CORRESPONDENT:  No, I think that, you know,  if you wanted to have a magic eight ball, all indications point to December  as probably what would come up, but of course, Maggie, there are wild  cards, the presidential election if Donald Trump sneaks out a victory,  obviously the odds seem to be against him right now based on the polls.   That could change things, because he's been critical of Fed policy and  Janet Yellen in particular.  If the global economy has another mini  meltdown.  That could put the Fed on hold for the foreseeable future.  So  right now I think investors are betting Clinton wins.  The economy stays  relatively stable.  Fed rate hike comes in December, and that's what the  Fed is indicating as well.</p><p> LAKE:  Yes, it's all about the expectations.  If things start to move  drastically then the Fed risks losing faith.  I'm sure they want to keep  their options open.  I want to ask you about some news that came out late  in the day.  It's all still firming up right now.  But it looks like we may  finally get the birth of a unicorn some time in 2017.  Snapchat?  </p><p> LA MONICA:  Yes, definitely.  We've had, Maggie, some smaller tech unicorns  go public here at the NYSC, as well as the NASDAQ.  But snapchat would be  the first \"Deca-corn,\" if you will, more than a $10 billion valuation.   Right now the private market valuation is 18 billion.  CNNMoney has not  confirmed any of this.  This is a Bloomberg report as of right now.  But  Saying That Snapshot has hired Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs to be its  lead underwriters.  </p><p> [16:20:00] A lot of other big Wall Street banks might be co-managers of  this offering as well.  Obviously everyone would be very excited to see how  Snapshot does, because a successful Snapchat IPO some time in 2017 could  lead the way for Uber, Airbnb, China's Xiaomi, to all potentially go public  as well.  That would be the first time in a while we've had a truly big  tech company go public.  Facebook was probably the last major one that I  can think of.</p><p> LAKE:  Yes, and obviously that has done really well for people who stuck  with it through the ups and downs.  Not so much of a track record when we  look through out tech stocks.  Paul, you and I have talked a lot, there's  been a lot of concern about the valuations of some of these companies that  frankly we don't know a lot about what their financials look like.  They're  private.  We don't get to see their books every quarter.  </p><p> LA MONICA:  Yes, until they go public it is a lot of speculation about how  strong the numbers really are.  And obviously most of these companies have  metrics that are favorable probably, revenue growth is going up pretty  dramatically for companies that have users.  They're seeing user growth and  subscribers, but at the end of the day, Wall Street, the people behind me,  they don't really care about users and revenue as much as profits when you  become a public company.  Facebook is a very profitable company, has  continued to grow like a weed.  That's why it's now one of the world's most  valuable companies.  And Twitter, another relatively recent IPO, is not.   Just to name two names.  </p><p> LAKE:  That's right, the pressures of being public and getting those  quarter on quarter profit expectations down is a difficult one.  And it's  one that's frustrated a lot of CEOs including Alibaba's.  We talked about  it.  All right Paul, it's going to be fascinating to watch.  Thank you so  much.</p><p> LA MONICA:  Thank you.</p><p> LAKE:  Paul La Monica for us.  </p><p> Joining me now is Roger McNamee, the cofounder of Elevation Partners, a  private equity firm that focusing on consumer tech.  Roger, great to see  you.  Got to ask you right out of the gate --</p><p> ROGER MCNAMEE, COFOUNDER, ELEVATION PARTNERS:  Good to be back Maggie.  </p><p> LAKE:  -- what your thoughts are about Snapshot.  If it turns out that we  are going to see an IPO in the first quarter of the year, toward the end of  it anyway.  How do you feel about that company?  Is there something you'd  be interested in?  Or do you think there is a lot of hype?  </p><p> MCNAMEE:  There's obviously a lot of hype.  But I think what we want to  understand is that with Snap, they are one of those companies in a consumer  market where going public can make their business more successful.  If you  think of their target audience, which is young people, you know, 25 and  under.  It's a video product addressing an audience that has a much, much  lower interest level in television viewing than older people have.  So as a  consequence from an advertiser's point of view, Snap offering something  that is, you know, getting them at a demographic they can't really get at  with traditional television advertising.  And so I do think going public  will make a really big deal.  But we shouldn't pretend that this is going  to be a bargain.  </p><p> On the earnings numbers at the time they go public, this will be very,  very, very expensive.  But we should also understand that like Facebook,  this is a company where the active going public can actually strengthen  their business opportunity and get their revenue to grow much more rapidly.   In fact, it may surprise a lot of people.  I'm personally really looking  forward to seeing the company as a public company, because I do think it  has a market opportunity that we haven't yet seen, a mobile only video  company with really serious traction.  </p><p> LAKE:  Interesting you say that.  Talk to me about those users.  We know  the filters, some of the things that attracts younger users.  Does it  matter to build and lock in that love of brand at an early age?  Or is this  a fickle group that if somebody comes along with deep pockets, they can  replicate it.  They can kind of run over Snapchat?  </p><p> MCNAMEE:  We're going to find out.  We're actually going to find that out  over the next 12 months.  Because Facebook is doing everything in its power  to take its video products and match what Snapchat the product has today.   I do believe that Snap as a company has built a consumer awareness and  consumer brand that at the moment I think be able to resist the attack from  Facebook.  But over time, it is going to be I think a cutthroat battle of  Snap versus Facebook versus other players that want a piece of that action.   I do believe, though, that what they're doing is real and it will be big,  and advertisers will flock to it.  As a consequence, it may be a decent  IPO.  </p><p> LAKE:  That is the future.  Let's talk about a name that we know well from  the past.  And had been performing so well, and that is Samsung.  Now the  seven shelved for the moment.  How much of a disadvantage is that to be out  of the market?  Letting your competitors run ahead of you without a product  out there.  How damaging?  </p><p> MCNAMEE:  You know, I think, Maggie, that is not the big problem they face  today.  Two or three years ago when the smartphone business was still  growing rapidly, that would have been a disaster to be out of the market.   This is serious, because they've really mishandled the recall so far.  </p><p> [16:25:00] And so, you know, people compare this to Tylenol when they had  the scare many, many years ago.  The difference was that Johnson and  Johnson moved in immediately.  They were totally transparent.  They gave  the consumers their money back.  They got everything off the shelves.  They  are super-aggressive to do the right thing.  And Samsung acted for the  first couple of months as though they thought there was a possibility there  were customers out there who might perceive an exploding phone as a  feature, not a bug.  And that I think has cost their brand a lot.  Samsung  is a huge company.  They'll get through this.  But I think their smartphone  business has taken a hit that would be hard to recover from.  I think this  is fantastic for Apple and may wind up also being good for other Android  vendors.  </p><p> LAKE:  Yes, absolutely.  Roger, you think there's a management issue here?  </p><p> MCNAMEE:  I think, you know, you look at this, and what it really is all  about is cutting corners.  The market has slowed down.  It's been really,  really hard to be people to buy their fourth smartphone, you know, on a  two-year cycle, which is the way it's been.  Consumers basically they have  products they like.  They aren't broken, they don't need a new phone.  So  Samsung strategy was to throw in the kitchen sink.  Literally take every  feature it could think of, and strap it onto this lithium-ion battery.  The  problem is that lithium-ion is a very unstable chemical.  And so if you  don't get everything exactly right, fire risk is a huge issue.  And  everyone in that business has done a very good job of managing it so far,  as have the people in the electric car business.  But Samsung cut some  corners.  And they're going to pay a huge price for that.  </p><p> LAKE:  A hard lesson learned.  Roger, always a pleasure to catch up with  you.  Thank you so much.  Appreciate it.</p><p> MCNAMEE:  Thanks for having me on, Maggie.  Good to see you.  </p><p> LAKE:  With Samsung effectively dropping out of the smartphone market for  time, as we just heard, the door is order for its Chinese rivals to  capitalize.  Other than Apple, Huawei, and OPPO, Samsung's biggest  competitors.  Matt Rivers has more on how China is reacting to Samsung's  problems.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MATT RIVERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The bad news now front and  center on Samsung's Chinese website, the global recall of the Galaxy Note 7  will now include China.  That means about 191,000 phones will have to be  replaced with new ones, according to government regulators.  Eroding  confidence with Chinese consumers.  \"I don't trust Samsung,\" says Yan Jung  Jin, \"With these problems and the recall the company has lost all  credibility with me.\"</p><p> Initially Chinese versions of the Note 7 weren't recalled.  They used a  different battery than other models and Samsung said they were safe.  Many  Chinese consumers were skeptical though after seeing things like this.   Huang Wang Yua (ph) said his phone seen here, caught fire the same way  others had, despite Samsung's claims.  In total the Chinese government says  at least 20 Chinese version Note 7s burned up.  </p><p> It's just the latest bad news for Samsung in China after several  challenging years of sales.  In the second quarter of 2013, Samsung phones  account fold 18.2 percent of China's total smartphone market.  The next  year, it was cut in half to 9.9%, and today it sits at 6.5 percent.  That's  good enough for sixth place overall behind Chinese companies, Huawei, OPPO,  Vivo and Xiaomi and its chief rival Apple.  According to market research  and analysis firm IDC.  </p><p> RIVERS (on camera):  Both Apple and Samsung have seen falling sales here in  China recently battling both each other and domestic producers.  But one  analyst tells CNN that with the latest recall Samsung's loss is likely to  be Apple's gain.  The company will try and snap up those high-end customers  that still want a foreign-made phone, but are now wary or even distrustful  of Samsung products.  </p><p> But China is the largest smartphone market in the world with well over a  half billion potential customers.  It's a market Samsung can ill afford to  ignore if it's to rebound in a significant way Note 7 crisis.  But winning  back the trust of the Chinese consumer will be an uphill battle.  </p><p> \"I used to use a Samsung phone, because it was user-friendly,\" says this  woman, \"But after the whole catching fire thing, there's no way I'm going  back to it.\"  That sentiment is Samsung's new reality in China.

They were taken from campaign chair  john Podesta's account.  Donald Trump says the hacked emails show the U.S.  Justice Department helped Clinton \"Cover up for her crimes.\"  </p><p> At least 25 people are dead after air strikes on the rebel-held east of  Aleppo.  Another 45 were wounded according to volunteer rescue workers.   That comes after at least 41 people were killed in strikes Tuesday,  bringing an end to a period of relative calm in the city.  </p><p> The lawyers for Paris attack suspect Salah Abdeslam has quit his defense,  because he's refusing to speak in court.  Abdeslam is the only known  survivor of the group accused of carrying out the deadly assault last  November.  The attorney spoke at a TV interview taped in the Belgian  capital Tuesday.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> FRANK BERTON, ATTORNEY (through translator):  We decided to no longer  defend Salah Abdeslam.  This is not a surrender.  It's a renunciation.  We  know and he told us he would not speak and will use his right to remain  silent.  </p><p> SVEN MARY, ATTORNEY (through translator):  The real victims in all of this,  it is the actual victims of the Paris attacks.  Because they have the right  to know the truth and understand the incomprehensible.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LAKE:  British film production company has been fined $2 million over  Harrison Ford's injury two years ago.  A hydraulic door on set broke the  actor's leg as he was repricing the role of Han Solo for the \"Star Wars:   The Force Awaken\".  The judge in the case said that the company failed to  let Ford know about the set piece.</p><p> The FTSE may be down for Wednesday, but it has soared since the Brexit  referendum.  The pound, however, has taken a nosedive.  It's currently  trading at around 1.22.  A historic low according to the Bank of England's  indices.  They go back to 1975, the year the U.K. voted to stay in the  European economic market.  The British Prime Minister that she would not  give a running narrative on the Brexit process, but one thing is clear,  Teresa May wants \"Maximum possible access to the EU single market.\"   Speaking earlier in Westminster she denied opposition claims that the  Brexit process is a shambles.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER:  What we are going to do is be  ambitious in our negotiations.  To negotiate the best deal for the British  people.  And that will include the maximum possibility access to the  European market for firms to trade with and operate within the European  market.  But I'm also clear that the vote of the British people said we  should control the movement of people from the EU into the U.K.</p><p> [16:35:00] LAKE:  Senior politicians are calling for a full parliamentary  vote before the Brexit process is officially begin.  Earlier I spoke to one  British lawmakers who said it would be a betrayal not to have one.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> STEPHEN KINNOCK, UK MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT, LABOR PARTY:  Well, I think the  first thing to be clear on is that we have voted as a country to leave the  European Union.  And that means we have to leave.  Nobody as far as I know  is disputing that.  Certainly the vast majority of my colleagues on the  Labor bench accepts that completely.  But we also know that the referendum  was an incredibly divisive and confrontational experience for the United  Kingdom.  </p><p> The first step towards reuniting our country and healing some of these  divisions would be to have a proper national conversation about Brexit.   About what it will actually mean in practice.  The first place to start  with that conversation is the House of Commons, because we are the elected  representatives of the people.  So it's absurd, really, that the government  has been trying to claim that Parliament shouldn't have a role in  scrutinizing these Brexit negotiations.  </p><p> This government has more power to reshape and shape the future of our  country than any government since the Second World War in my view.   Therefore, it's absolutely critical that parliament gets the opportunity to  scrutinize, to hold the government to account and to ensure that we get the  best possible deal.  </p><p> LAKE:  The European partners have made it perfectly clear they believe that  free movement of people is nonnegotiable.  That it must exist in order to  have free trade and remain part of the trading bloc.  Is there any scenario  where it's worth giving up that?  Worth having free movement of people in  order to achieve the economic relationship that you would like to have with  Europe?  </p><p> KINNOCK:  Well, my view is that there is a tremendous opportunity now for  Theresa May to go to Paris and Berlin and The Hague and the Nordic  countries, and others.  And to say, look, you've got a challenge in all of  your countries around the rise of these populist parties, and that there is  a real question mark over the free movement of labor.  Free movement of  labor, those provisions were introduced at a time particularly around the  treaty where the reality was very, very different.  There were movements of  people across borders were far less.  We're now living in a far more fluid  and mobile age.  </p><p> What I think Theresa May should be saying to her counterparts across the  European Union, is look, let's look at making a European decision on this.   You all want a need a reform of the free movement of labor.  Let's do that  deal, change the paradigm of where we are on free movement of labor, and  after that have the negotiations on the free movement of goods, services  and capital, which are the other three pillars of the single market.  And I  believe that if Theresa May was taking a bit more of ambitious and creative  approach to these negotiations, she could actually square that circle  between getting the reforms on free movement of labor that we need and also  getting us maximum access to the single market and creating a win/win  situation.  When you go into a negotiation, you have to be bold, you have  to be ambitious and you have to be creative.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> LAKE:  European markets closed firmly in the red, as investors reacted to  falling oil prices and weak tech stocks.  Samsung and Erickson both posted  major prompt warnings.  Investors also waiting for the minutes from the  U.S. Federal Reserve.

Obama has chosen Mars.  In an exclusive  opinion piece for CNN, the president outlined his goal to put humans on the  red planet with the help of private industry.  \"We have set a clear goal  vital to the next chapter of America's story in space, sending humans to  Mars by 2030, and returning them safely to earth, with the ultimate  ambition to one day remain there for an extended time.\"  President Obama is  not the first leader to target Mars.  The quest to explore the planet has  fascinated America and the world for more than half a century.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's waiting out there just as it always has.  What's  it really like?  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is launch complex 41 from where the Viking  missions will be launched from the Titan Center launch vehicle.</p><p> BARACK OBAMA, U.S. PRESIDENT:  By the mid-2030s, I believe we can send  humans to orbit Mars and return them safely to Earth.  And landing on Mars  will follow.  And I expect to be around to see it.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LAKE:  Inspiring words.  Joining now, Michio Kaku, is a physics professor  at the City University of New York, and he hosts \"Sci-Fi Science\" on the  Science Channel.  Thanks so much for being with us.  </p><p> MICHIO KAKU, PHYSICS PROFESSOR, CITY UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK:  Glad to be  here.</p><p> LAKE:  2030 sounds ambitious.  Is it realistic?  </p><p> KAKU:  Well, Matt Damon, watch out.  If you saw the movie \"The Martian\",  you know that is a very arduous trip.  It takes two years for a round-trip  mission to Mars, but you know, there could be a traffic jam over Mars.   Three groups, not one, three groups have announced that in 15 to 20 years  they want to go to Mars.  SpaceX with Elon Musk, Boeing, and the United  States government.  Now, NASA has been criticized as being the agency to  nowhere.  It doesn't go anywhere anymore.  That's all going to change.</p><p> LAKE:  Beside now wants to go to Mars.  There has been some concern that  while it's great to have these goals and inspiring, that maybe people are  rushing too much, and safety is an issue.  We have seen so many times  recently how dangerous space exploration can be.  </p><p> KAKU:  That's right.  There's something called the Mars jinx.  And that is  that on the order of, well, 30, 40, 50 percent of the missions never  reached the red planet.  Now, we've been more successful, because our space  probes have in fact reached mars with a certain amount of regularity, but  there's dangers.  There's radiation, there's weightlessness, micro  meteorite impact, plus Mars itself is a frozen desert.  You can't live off  the land.  There's no vegetation, no food, no water, no air.  </p><p> [16:45:00] LAKE:  And yet it continues to fascinate us.  What makes so many  people believe that life can be sustained or a colony can be sustained on  Mars?  What is that has put that into so many minds and imaginations.</p><p> KAKU:  You know, it's part of our psyche to look for other civilizations,  other worlds in outer space.  Mars is the closest in terms of looking like  the earth.  It's a rocky planet, not a gas giant like Jupiter.  The  temperatures are cold, but not super-hot like Venus, and it is reachable,  with a two-year mission, so it's fascinating to believe that perhaps there  could be men from mars.  </p><p> Well, now we know we can't even find microbial life on mars, but still it  beckons.  Elon Musk has said we should by a multi-planet species, so in  other words we need earth 2.0.  It's simply too dangerous to put homo  sapiens on just one planet --</p><p> LAKE:  We're doing such a good job taking care of the one we're on, we  should go to others, I suppose.  But truthfully a lot of people believe  that if we don't do that so many things can be learned and can benefit life  here, even in the quest, even if it is further out than 2030.  </p><p> KAKU:  Take a look at the space program.  That has given us miniaturized  transistors, the internet, the space program with weather satellites,  telecommunications.  All of that is a byproduct of the space program.  </p><p> LAKE:  Sorry to interrupt, do the technological advances we see help us  more in space?  You know, we all wonder at the leaps and bounds that we  have seen, carrying smartphones around.  Is that helping us make further  progress into getting further into deep space.</p><p> KAKU:  There is a synergy.  The space program forces us to miniaturize  electronic components and that gave birth to the electronic revolution,  which in turn makes possible space probes that can go safely to the  planets.  That creates another synergy.  There's a back and forth between  the space program and innovation and ingenuity.  </p><p> LAKE:  You mentioned what a long and dangerous journey it is.  What is the  next generation of astronaut going to have to be like if they're going to  go to Mars?  </p><p> KAKU:  Forget the moon.  The moon was a Sunday picnic.  Three days to moon,  three days to come back, you can do it in a week.  Mars is a nine-month  mission to mars, plus you have to be on the red planet, plus another nine  months going back, and realize that the world's record for being up in  outer space is just a little bit over a year.  That's the world's record.  </p><p> LAKE:  We have a way to go.  </p><p> KAKU:  Yes, we've got a way to go.  </p><p> LAKE:  Do you think the private partner-government relationship is good for  everyone?  </p><p> KAKU:  I think it will be key.  The taxpayers are saying who will foot the  bill?  Private enterprise wants a piece of action.  They see a lot of spin  offs and benefits, so I think there's a synergy between the government and  taxpayer who will foot most of the bill and private enterprise because they  want a piece of the action.  </p><p> LAKE:  Together we can get there, we think.  Thank you for coming in.  </p><p> KAKU:  My pleasure.  </p><p> LAKE:  Appreciate it.  </p><p> Still ahead, creepy clown sightings are no laughing matter.  Next we hear  from a professional about how his classic entertainment form is suffering.  </p><p> [16:50:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> LAKE:  One of the America's most recognizable pop culture icons has fallen  victim to a bizarre trend.  Appearances by McDonald's mascot Ronald  McDonald are being limited until the creepy pranks die down.  The sinister  craze these people dressing up as clowns just to scare others is a trend  spreading internationally.  Clare Sebastian has more from London.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GEORGE BURKE, VICTIM OF CREEPY CLOWN SIGHTING:  I want to get past.  I want  to go out.</p><p> CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  This is the moment that George Burke  back from Plymouth realized the clown standing in his path with what he  said looked like a hammer was no joke.  </p><p> BURKE:  Going in, yes, off, mate.  </p><p> SEBASTIAN:  Clown sightings like this across the U.K. have been appearing  on social media.  This was on a university campus in London, a 19-year-old  man was later arrested suspected of a public order offense.  This was just  outside London, a clown staring into a restaurant where Leah Woodcock was  having dinner.  </p><p> LEAH WOODCOCK, CREEPY CLOWN OBSERVER:  It had like big teeth and blood and  stuff.  It wasn't particularly nice to see.  I don't think that they're  doing it just for fun.  I think they're doing it to scare people.   SEBASTIAN:  The craze actually began in the U.S. over the summer, sightings  of clowns carrying weapons and an armed robbery at a drugstore in Michigan  caught on CCTV, and clown-based threats led to several school districts  being put on alert.  That trend now spreading to the U.K. We saw as  increased police presence after an Instagram post -- for those who see  themselves as good clowns the craze is particularly distressing.  </p><p> Matte, the Clown, now in his 60s has been doing this for 40 years.</p><p> MATTE, THE CLOWN:  Hello.  I'm doing and interview.  The clown can do all  sorts of things.  Which are really funny in the right circumstance, but  with a scary mask on, very unfunny.  Don't do it, please, don't do it.   Dress up as something else.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED SINGER:  Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right --  </p><p> SEBASTIAN:  Unfortunately, it's the right time of year for dressing up.   Police have warned these incidents could increase in the run up to  Halloween.  Clare Sebastian, CNN, London.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> LAKE:  Now, clowning is a centuries-old tradition that continues to  influence modern-day film and theater.  Let's speak to one of the  professionals.  Many know him as Kooky Cosmo, the clown, friends and  colleagues call him Michael Kramer.</p><p> Michael, thank you for being here with us today.</p><p> MICHAEL KRAMER, KOOKY COSMO, THE CLOWN:  Thank you for having me.  </p><p> LAKE:  I want to ask you, in all seriousness -- because this is quite  serious -- how has this impacted your business?  Have you felt any negative  reaction to this craze that's going around?  </p><p> KOOKY COSMO:  I feel it every day.  I was in the supermarket in my clown  outfit.  Some actually reported me to the manager and said there's a clown,  and the manager had to say we know this guy, he's really nice.  I hear it  all the time now.  </p><p> LAKE:  Are you worried what that will do to your business?  </p><p> KOOKY COSMO:  Yes, I am worried.  When I'm doing street market events,  people make comments, and my clients hear that.  They may get the idea that  clowns are creepy now, and may not want to use us.  </p><p> LAKE:  Have you seen any cancellations yet?  </p><p> KOOKY COSMO:  I haven't, no.  I'm fortunate that I have steady clients.   They know me.  </p><p> LAKE:  Yes.  Why do you think this is happening?  Have you ever experienced  anything like this before?  </p><p> KOOKY COSMO:  I've experienced negative comments about me, but that's been  mainly from the movie \"It\", John Wayne Gacy, the serial killer they give  clowns a bad name.  I've heard \"I hate clowns\" a lot.</p><p> LAKE:  But those are individuals.  There have always been people who find  clowns a little odd.  There's always a kid at a birthday party who is not  that thrilled, but obviously there are a lot of joyful moments as well.   They seem to be able to coexist.  All of a sudden there seems to be such a  sinister connection.  Do you worry it will be hard to dispel that?  </p><p> KOOKY COSMO:  No, I think it will die out.  </p><p> LAKE:  What makes you so confident?  </p><p> KOOKY COSMO:  I just think it will.  That's how things are.  People want  attention at times.  They just do it for attention, and then something else  comes along.  That will start being a big thing.  I think this will die  out.  </p><p> LAKE:  I know you have associations and memberships where all of you and  your colleagues get together and communicate.</p><p> [16:55:00] Have you talked about trying to counter it or support each other  or put a different message out there?  </p><p> KOOKY COSMO:  Find a new job?  I don't know.  Yes, no, we haven't spoken  about it.  For me what I try to do, I try to be extra nice to people and be  as giving as possible, which I have always done, but now I try to be a  little extra, do a little extra now.</p><p> LAKE:  It's extraordinary that it's had to come to this.  Are you worried  about your personal safety?  Usually, I'm sure when you put the outfit and  you get ready to go to work, you have to get all your enthusiasm and good  cheer up.  Do you worry a bit about moving around now, commuting, getting  to your job based on the negative reaction?  The fear people seem to have?</p><p> KOOKY COSMO:  I do.  I travel around the New York city subway system in my  clown suit.  People give me looks.  I am concerned that -- I don't know  what they'll do.  So far nothing has happened.  </p><p> LAKE:  We certainly know you're not one of those clowns for sure.  And  there are so many double entendre here but we do hope that this passes, we  are all scratching our head about it.  But I am sure it has been around for  so long that certainly it is an art that will endure.</p><p> KOOKY COSMOS:  Thank you very much </p><p> LAKE:  Thank you, Michael for coming on.  Have a good day.  </p><p> KOOKY COSMO:  you're very welcome, it's a pleasure.</p><p> LAKE:  Now if you have a daily digest of the day's top business stories  delivered to your inbox, you can subscribe to the QUEST MEANS BUSINESS  newsletter featuring Richard's Profitable Moment and all the top headlines  from the rest of the CNNMoney team.</p><p> Just go to CNNMoney.com/quest to subscribe and don't forget to download the  new CNNMoney stream app, you can find that link on the CNNMoney home page.  </p><p> Just time for a quick reminder of how U.S. markets ended the day.  The Dow  managed to hold its nerve after Tuesday's 200-point drop.  The Dow closed  slightly higher, up just 15 points.

Trading is over on Wednesday, the 12th  of October.  Tonight voting begins in battleground states with Hillary  Clinton in a commanding lead.  Samsung sees its latest setup of profits go  up in smoke, and making history for all the wrong reasons.  The pound  slumps to an all-time low.  I'm Maggie Lake.  This is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As early voting begins in key swing states across America, Hillary Clinton  has the edge over Donald Trump, if a new set of polls are to be believed.   New numbers on the presidential race show Clinton either holding on to a  decisive lead or wiping out her Republican rivals' advantage.  National  polls out today from Reuters and Rasmussen given Clinton a lead of seven  and four points respectively.  Another poll from \"Los Angeles Times\", which  has had Trump in the lead the past few months now has the race a tie.  </p><p>With Clinton still riding high, Trump's path to the White House looks less  clear.  A reminder that whoever wins will need 270 electoral college votes.   According to CNN projections, Clinton is already on track to get that magic  number.  She's been consolidating support in key swing states like  Colorado, Virginia, and Pennsylvania.  If Clinton holds on to all blue  states shown here, it doesn't matter how many other Trump wins, as Clinton  will take the White House.  </p><p>We may be 27 days out from election day, but some Americans are already  heading to the polls.  Early voting kicked up in the crucial swing state of  Ohio Wednesday morning.  One of the only states we are still counting as a  battleground shown in yellow.  However, one new poll of likely Ohio voters  shows Clinton ahead by 9 percent in a four-way race.  Poppy Harlow has been  traveling through the swing states hearing first hands from her voters from  her special report \"YOUR MONEY/YOUR VOTE.\"  First she takes us to Ohio.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>POPPY HARLOW, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  This neighborhood in Cleveland, Ohio was  one of the strongest for President Obama in 2012.  Mitt Romney did not get  a single vote from people living in these homes.  Not one.  People living  here have been struggling economically for a long time and they still are.   So the question is, will they come out in droves for Hillary Clinton?  The  way they did for President Obama?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Hillary.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Hillary is the best candidates.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  That's a no-brainer.  </p><p>HARLOW (voice-over):  There have been decades of economic despair and a  dwindling faith that politicians will help.  </p><p>JEFF CROSBY, YOUTH MENTOR, CLEVELAND PEACEMAKERS ALLIANCE:  I think the  Democratic platform is saying the same thing we have heard for about the  past 50 years.  </p><p>HARLOW (on camera):  Over and over?  </p><p>CROSBY:  Over and over.</p><p>HARLOW:  Since the war on poverty was declared?  </p><p>CROSBY:  Yes.  </p><p>HARLOW (voice-over):  Jeff Crosby used to be in gangs.  That landed him in  prison.  Now he's working to keep kids from the same life he lived.  </p><p>CROSBY:  It's one of the highest crime areas in Cleveland.  </p><p>HARLOW (on camera):  This is?  </p><p>CROSBY:  Yes.  About ten gangs over here.  What's up?  You're good?  I  think the Democratic Party is taking us for granted.  The Republican Party  his literally ignores us, except for Trump.  Trump is trying to make  inroads, but he is a polarizing figure.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I don't trust Donald.  That's all.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Because he's got money?  That ain't everything.  </p><p>SIERRA LESLEY, VOTER:  I'm willing to vote for a clown before Donald Trump.  </p><p>HARLOW:  Really?  </p><p>LESLEY:  Yes.  With a red nose.  I do agree with Republicans sometimes, but  I don't agree with nothing that Donald Trump stands for.  </p><p>HARLOW:  And that brings us to the second part of this Ohio chapter, 200  miles south.  We're in Pike County, Ohio.  This place matters a lot.  Not  for the number of votes here, but because of what it represents.  It used  to be solidly blue, but it's been moving more and more red.  In 2012, this  was the closest county in the country.  Mitt Romney won here by a single  vote, just one vote.  It's 96 percent white, largely blue collar, and  unemployment here is high.  These are exactly the voters Donald Trump has  been speaking to.  So if his message isn't resonating here, he's in  trouble.  </p><p>SCOTT HAMMOND, BUSINESS MANAGER:  I would say right now you're looking at a  coin toss.  </p><p>HARLOW:  A coin toss among union workers who until now have been solidly  blue.  Have we ever seen anything like that before?  Donald Trump says he's  the one to bring these jobs back?  He's the one to build up your industry?  </p><p>HAMMOND:  Donald Trump is saying that, that's total propaganda.  Where is  his merchandise made?  What does he have to offer to American industry?   Nothing.  </p><p>HARLOW (voice-over):  Many here do believe Trump and see them as their best  shot at getting ahead.  Since 2000, Ohio has lost nearly a third of its  manufacturing jobs.  </p><p>[16:05:00] BILL STANLEY, VOTER:  He's got a lot of things that are amazing  that he was telling us he can do for us.  </p><p>HARLOW:  Angie Shanks runs a successful real estate firm here.  </p><p>ANGIE SHANKS, VOTER:  It means more jobs, more better-paying jobs.  </p><p>HARLOW:  You voted for President Obama in 2008.  </p><p>SHANKS:  Yes, I did.  </p><p>HARLOW (voice-over):  But her faith in the Obama administration has faded.  </p><p>SHANKS:  I think Trump is a businessman and the country is a business.  It  needs to be run as a business.  </p><p>HARLOW:  When we met Angie, she is leaning towards Trump.  Now, after the  \"Access Hollywood\" tape surfaced, she's reconsidering.  </p><p>HARLOW:  You're a lifelong Democrat?  </p><p>CHARLIE SALTKIELD, VOTER:  Yes.  </p><p>HARLOW (on camera):  So you're voting for Hillary this time around?  </p><p>SALTKIELD:  No, I'm not.  </p><p>HARLOW:  No?</p><p>SALTKIELD:  My dad was a coal miner.  They put the coal miners out of the  work.  </p><p>HARLOW:  We left Ohio asking this question.  Why does economic pain from  one town to the left push some to the left, others to the right?  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAKE:  And Poppy Harlow joins us now in the studio.  Poppy, you touched on  the piece, but a lot of the people you talked to, the Trump tape had just  started coming out.  I know you circled back to a lot of them.  Do you feel  it's swaying people?  Or are they really focused on some of the themes they  talk to you about a smut doesn't matter?</p><p>HARLOW:  It's not swaying his loyal supporters.  Maggie, on this swing  state trip, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Florida, we talked to 26 solid Trump  supporters.  Like totally in the Trump camp.  So we called all of them back  obviously this weekend, after that tape was released with those comments  about groping women, and with the exception of three people they are all  standing by Trump.  One said she'll no longer vote for him, two are  undecided, but I think that gives you the lens of loyalty he has here in  this critical state.  I mean, no one has won the White House without  winning Ohio since 1960.</p><p>LAKE:  Except nobody can win the White House without getting swing voters  and some of the voters away from the other party's people.  And we know  he's got loyal supporters.  It's interesting as I was watching that piece,  we see these themes and we know the economic disarray.</p><p>Interesting they talked about his business, even though there's been  controversy about how he handled business, but another sign that really  struck me.  And it stopped the overdoses.  This is the middle of the  country that's been hit by the heroin epidemic.  They have lost job.  They  have lost faith in government it seems.  </p><p>HARLOW:  I'm so glad you bring that up.  Because that is something we  actually did a number of interviews, and even spoke with a woman at an  opioid clinic where they help people getting over these horrific  addictions.  And you don't see it here in that piece, because it's such a  huge issue to dive into.  We wanted to give it a just amount of time.  That  is ripping their society apart and their economy apart.  </p><p>LAKE:  And they don't feel like anyone is helping.  </p><p>HARLOW:  And they don't feel like anybody's helping, the state government,  local or nationally.  And they feel forgotten.  I think from the drug  epidemic there, to the lack of manufacturing jobs, they feel forgotten, and  their hope in politicians is gone.  That's why so many said to us they're  willing to bet on an unknown in Donald Trump.  Some of them said roll the  dice.</p><p>LAKE:  Do they know his policies, though?  Do they think that --</p><p>HARLOW:  They don't care.  That's a great point.  Their answer, many of  them, and were talking about many well-educated people that are supporting  him said, he's made money.  He's been a success.  We trust him to figure it  out, or surround himself with smart people that will.  It is the  willingness to try something else, because the establishment has failed  them in their mind.  </p><p>LAKE:  It's an indictment of Washington.  And not just --</p><p>HARLOW:  Absolutely.  </p><p>LAKE:  -- not just a Democrat or Republican administration.  I think  they're losing faith in government, which is very disturbing.  </p><p>HARLOW:  Maggie, the fact that you have union workers supporting Donald  Trump.  This is a solidly blue contingent that Hillary Clinton should be  able to not lose a minute of sleep over.  In Ohio, 12 percent of overall  workers are union.  That's higher than the national average.  That's huge.   The fact that so many of them are looking and siding with a Republican  ticket right now, I think is a huge indicate of where this country is  going.  But again, he needs to win over a big amount of those undecided  voters.  </p><p>LAKE:  And temperament remains an issue.  When you talk to his supporters,  do they recognize their concern about that?  Because it is something we  hear.  Although Hillary doesn't score much better.  Her trust factor.  </p><p>HARLOW:  They say we doth trust Hillary, right?  Or they say we don't  really like her, but we don't know why.  Then with Donald Trump there is  the temperament issue.  I mean, yes, a number of them said they're  concerned about his temperament.  Angie Shanks, the young woman, the blonde  woman who owns a real estate business, told me, yes, that did throw her  off, and she is concerned about this.  And that was before the tape came  out.  Now she told me on the phone this weekend, she's very undecided at  this point.  </p><p>They are worried about temperament, but they look at someone who's -- they  see it as successful in business.  The bankruptcies don't bother them.  And  you heard one woman say, well he has a hit television show.  </p><p>[16:10:02] I mean, that really to her is the definition of success.  That's  what Cindy Newberry told me, and she says our country needs that.  </p><p>LAKE:  It's easy to dismiss them, but we shouldn't dismiss the fact that so  many feel disenfranchised and feel like the system is no longer working for  him and that's what happened to all the Republican contenders.  They  underestimated that at their peril.</p><p>HARLOW:  Yes, and that's why it was so important to us, to me an hour team,  the amazing CNNMoney team who did this, to get out of the coast.  To get  out of New York and California, and get into middle America and talk to  these voters and hear from them directly.  This is part of a bigger series.  </p><p>LAKE:  Where are you going next?  </p><p>HARLOW:  So we're going tomorrow, were going to take you on the show to  Florida.  Which is fascinating, so that the Latinos and retires.  And then  we're going to take you to Pennsylvania, the Keystone state, which is  critical as well.  A bunch of the same problems as Ohio.  The manufacturing  job base just disappearing and depleted.  </p><p>LAKE:  These are serious problems and it's going to be a big platform for  whoever wins the presidency.  They're going to have to address this  feeling.  And by the way, it's not just happening in the U.S., we should  point out, a lot of this has an international thread as well.  Poppy, great  stuff.  Look forward to the next one.  </p><p>HARLOW:  Thank you.  </p><p>LAKE:  Thanks so much.  We'll have more, as poppy just mentioned, on her  series throughout the rest of the week, and in two weeks from now, Richard,  will be tackling  the swing states himself.  He'll be making his way through Florida as part  of his American Quest, speaking to leaders and voters who may hold the key  for decision the next president of the United States.  You can see that on  QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, on Monday, October 24th.  We know how much can change  in two weeks.  </p><p>Hillary Clinton's campaign is facing a new email controversy.  This time  involving WikiLeaks.  The whistleblowing website has published emails  hacked from the campaign manager John Podesta.  They allegedly show that  the Clinton campaign and the U.S. Justice Department shared information  while Clinton was under investigation for her use of a private email server  as U.S. Secretary of State.  Donald Trump wasted no time in trying to make  political capital from the leak.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  The WikiLeaks emails  show that Hillary Clinton's staff even has to give her secret notes on when  she needs to smile.  Smile, Hillary, smile.  Hey, folks, we have to get  back to work.  Our country is in trouble.  We can't play games any more.   Smile.  Can you believe it?  Smile.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAKE:  The chairman John Podesta has blamed Moscow for involvement in the  hack.  Russia's foreign minister told CNN that is not true.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SERGEY LAVROV, RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER:  Well, it's flattering, of course,  to get this kind of attention for original power, as President Obama called  us some time ago.  Now everybody in the United States is saying that it is  Russia, which is running the United States presidential debate.  It's  flattering, as I said, but it has nothing, you know, to be explained by the  facts.  We have not seen a single fact, a single proof.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LAKE:  CNN's Joe Johns is in Washington.  So, Joe, once again, we have this  revelations coming out about Hillary, does it tell us something we already  didn't know about the candidate?  </p><p>JOE JOHNS, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  I don't think so.  There  aren't any really big surprises in there.  It's sort of in the eye of the  beholder, if you look through these emails, perhaps a business embarrassing  for some of the people who work for the Clinton campaign, but no smoking  gun, as it were, Maggie.  </p><p>LAKE:  I imagine that there is, you know, a great deal of sort of positive  chatter within the Clinton campaign about some of these new polls coming  out.  They are encouraging, but this is in no way a runaway race,  especially considering some of the bombshells that come out about Trump.   How do they square the fact that it's still such a tough race?  </p><p>JOHNS:  They've been saying that all along.  They've really never changed  the message.  They've always said they expect this to be a close race at  the end of the day.  But certainly gratified about the latest polls.   Gratified even they say that the candidate herself was happy with her  performance in the last debate.  They say it will be a close race.  They're  concerned, of all things about people becoming complacent and not voting in  November because they look at these numbers.  That is what they're going to  fight against as we move toward November.  </p><p>LAKE:  It's interesting you mention that, Joe.  Because we do hear some  people feeling so disgusted or certainly Republicans turned off by Trump.   It's interesting to hear the Democrats are worried about the get out the  vote effort as well.  Clinton though has the entire Democratic establish  behind her.  Something Donald Trump is struggling with right now.  Does  that help her?  </p><p>[16:15:00] JOHNS:  Well, it certainly helps to have the whole Democratic  establishment behind you in force, out on the campaign trail with the  number one surrogate being the president of the United States himself.   Nonetheless, both of these candidates, both Hillary Clinton and Donald  Trump have very high negatives.  We've seen that all year long.  That's  another concern, that people might not be that excited about voting for  Hillary Clinton, and might stay home.  So they're working very hard to put  an affirmative message out there, not just about voting against Donald  Trump, but also Hillary Clinton making the case for why she says voters  need to vote for her along policy lines.  </p><p>LAKE:  Absolutely, and were still hearing from some people.  It may be a  day of decision for them.  A lot of work to be done.  Joe, thank you so  much.  Joe Johns for us tonight.  </p><p>Still ahead, hitting the wrong note.  Samsung proves that 7 isn't always  the lucky number and now faces more bad luck when it comes to the company's  balance sheet.  More on that next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LAKE:  U.S. markets managed to hold their nerve after Tuesday's 200-point  drop.  The Dow closed slightly higher, up only 15 points.  It didn't really  manage to dig out of that hole.  In the past few hours, the Fed released  minutes from the last meeting.  It says a rate hike is needed, \"relatively  soon\" but there is no firm agreement on timing.  Paul La Monica is at the  New York Stock Exchange.  Paul, I think we already knew that their  inclination is to raise rates, but we still don't exactly know when.  </p><p>PAUL R.  LA MONICA, CNN MONEY CORRESPONDENT:  No, I think that, you know,  if you wanted to have a magic eight ball, all indications point to December  as probably what would come up, but of course, Maggie, there are wild  cards, the presidential election if Donald Trump sneaks out a victory,  obviously the odds seem to be against him right now based on the polls.   That could change things, because he's been critical of Fed policy and  Janet Yellen in particular.  If the global economy has another mini  meltdown.  That could put the Fed on hold for the foreseeable future.  So  right now I think investors are betting Clinton wins.  The economy stays  relatively stable.  Fed rate hike comes in December, and that's what the  Fed is indicating as well.</p><p>LAKE:  Yes, it's all about the expectations.  If things start to move  drastically then the Fed risks losing faith.  I'm sure they want to keep  their options open.  I want to ask you about some news that came out late  in the day.  It's all still firming up right now.  But it looks like we may  finally get the birth of a unicorn some time in 2017.  Snapchat?  </p><p>LA MONICA:  Yes, definitely.  We've had, Maggie, some smaller tech unicorns  go public here at the NYSC, as well as the NASDAQ.  But snapchat would be  the first \"Deca-corn,\" if you will, more than a $10 billion valuation.   Right now the private market valuation is 18 billion.  CNNMoney has not  confirmed any of this.  This is a Bloomberg report as of right now.  But  Saying That Snapshot has hired Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs to be its  lead underwriters.  </p><p>[16:20:00] A lot of other big Wall Street banks might be co-managers of  this offering as well.  Obviously everyone would be very excited to see how  Snapshot does, because a successful Snapchat IPO some time in 2017 could  lead the way for Uber, Airbnb, China's Xiaomi, to all potentially go public  as well.  That would be the first time in a while we've had a truly big  tech company go public.  Facebook was probably the last major one that I  can think of.</p><p>LAKE:  Yes, and obviously that has done really well for people who stuck  with it through the ups and downs.  Not so much of a track record when we  look through out tech stocks.  Paul, you and I have talked a lot, there's  been a lot of concern about the valuations of some of these companies that  frankly we don't know a lot about what their financials look like.  They're  private.  We don't get to see their books every quarter.  </p><p>LA MONICA:  Yes, until they go public it is a lot of speculation about how  strong the numbers really are.  And obviously most of these companies have  metrics that are favorable probably, revenue growth is going up pretty  dramatically for companies that have users.  They're seeing user growth and  subscribers, but at the end of the day, Wall Street, the people behind me,  they don't really care about users and revenue as much as profits when you  become a public company.  Facebook is a very profitable company, has  continued to grow like a weed.  That's why it's now one of the world's most  valuable companies.  And Twitter, another relatively recent IPO, is not.   Just to name two names.  </p><p>LAKE:  That's right, the pressures of being public and getting those  quarter on quarter profit expectations down is a difficult one.  And it's  one that's frustrated a lot of CEOs including Alibaba's.  We talked about  it.  All right Paul, it's going to be fascinating to watch.  Thank you so  much.</p><p>LA MONICA:  Thank you.</p><p>LAKE:  Paul La Monica for us.  </p><p>Joining me now is Roger McNamee, the cofounder of Elevation Partners, a  private equity firm that focusing on consumer tech.  Roger, great to see  you.  Got to ask you right out of the gate --</p><p>ROGER MCNAMEE, COFOUNDER, ELEVATION PARTNERS:  Good to be back Maggie.  </p><p>LAKE:  -- what your thoughts are about Snapshot.  If it turns out that we  are going to see an IPO in the first quarter of the year, toward the end of  it anyway.  How do you feel about that company?  Is there something you'd  be interested in?  Or do you think there is a lot of hype?  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  There's obviously a lot of hype.  But I think what we want to  understand is that with Snap, they are one of those companies in a consumer  market where going public can make their business more successful.  If you  think of their target audience, which is young people, you know, 25 and  under.  It's a video product addressing an audience that has a much, much  lower interest level in television viewing than older people have.  So as a  consequence from an advertiser's point of view, Snap offering something  that is, you know, getting them at a demographic they can't really get at  with traditional television advertising.  And so I do think going public  will make a really big deal.  But we shouldn't pretend that this is going  to be a bargain.  </p><p>On the earnings numbers at the time they go public, this will be very,  very, very expensive.  But we should also understand that like Facebook,  this is a company where the active going public can actually strengthen  their business opportunity and get their revenue to grow much more rapidly.   In fact, it may surprise a lot of people.  I'm personally really looking  forward to seeing the company as a public company, because I do think it  has a market opportunity that we haven't yet seen, a mobile only video  company with really serious traction.  </p><p>LAKE:  Interesting you say that.  Talk to me about those users.  We know  the filters, some of the things that attracts younger users.  Does it  matter to build and lock in that love of brand at an early age?  Or is this  a fickle group that if somebody comes along with deep pockets, they can  replicate it.  They can kind of run over Snapchat?  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  We're going to find out.  We're actually going to find that out  over the next 12 months.  Because Facebook is doing everything in its power  to take its video products and match what Snapchat the product has today.   I do believe that Snap as a company has built a consumer awareness and  consumer brand that at the moment I think be able to resist the attack from  Facebook.  But over time, it is going to be I think a cutthroat battle of  Snap versus Facebook versus other players that want a piece of that action.   I do believe, though, that what they're doing is real and it will be big,  and advertisers will flock to it.  As a consequence, it may be a decent  IPO.  </p><p>LAKE:  That is the future.  Let's talk about a name that we know well from  the past.  And had been performing so well, and that is Samsung.  Now the  seven shelved for the moment.  How much of a disadvantage is that to be out  of the market?  Letting your competitors run ahead of you without a product  out there.  How damaging?  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  You know, I think, Maggie, that is not the big problem they face  today.  Two or three years ago when the smartphone business was still  growing rapidly, that would have been a disaster to be out of the market.   This is serious, because they've really mishandled the recall so far.  </p><p>[16:25:00] And so, you know, people compare this to Tylenol when they had  the scare many, many years ago.  The difference was that Johnson and  Johnson moved in immediately.  They were totally transparent.  They gave  the consumers their money back.  They got everything off the shelves.  They  are super-aggressive to do the right thing.  And Samsung acted for the  first couple of months as though they thought there was a possibility there  were customers out there who might perceive an exploding phone as a  feature, not a bug.  And that I think has cost their brand a lot.  Samsung  is a huge company.  They'll get through this.  But I think their smartphone  business has taken a hit that would be hard to recover from.  I think this  is fantastic for Apple and may wind up also being good for other Android  vendors.  </p><p>LAKE:  Yes, absolutely.  Roger, you think there's a management issue here?  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  I think, you know, you look at this, and what it really is all  about is cutting corners.  The market has slowed down.  It's been really,  really hard to be people to buy their fourth smartphone, you know, on a  two-year cycle, which is the way it's been.  Consumers basically they have  products they like.  They aren't broken, they don't need a new phone.  So  Samsung strategy was to throw in the kitchen sink.  Literally take every  feature it could think of, and strap it onto this lithium-ion battery.  The  problem is that lithium-ion is a very unstable chemical.  And so if you  don't get everything exactly right, fire risk is a huge issue.  And  everyone in that business has done a very good job of managing it so far,  as have the people in the electric car business.  But Samsung cut some  corners.  And they're going to pay a huge price for that.  </p><p>LAKE:  A hard lesson learned.  Roger, always a pleasure to catch up with  you.  Thank you so much.  Appreciate it.</p><p>MCNAMEE:  Thanks for having me on, Maggie.  Good to see you.  </p><p>LAKE:  With Samsung effectively dropping out of the smartphone market for  time, as we just heard, the door is order for its Chinese rivals to  capitalize.  Other than Apple, Huawei, and OPPO, Samsung's biggest  competitors.  Matt Rivers has more on how China is reacting to Samsung's  problems.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATT RIVERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The bad news now front and  center on Samsung's Chinese website, the global recall of the Galaxy Note 7  will now include China.  That means about 191,000 phones will have to be  replaced with new ones, according to government regulators.  Eroding  confidence with Chinese consumers.  \"I don't trust Samsung,\" says Yan Jung  Jin, \"With these problems and the recall the company has lost all  credibility with me.\"</p><p>Initially Chinese versions of the Note 7 weren't recalled.  They used a  different battery than other models and Samsung said they were safe.  Many  Chinese consumers were skeptical though after seeing things like this.   Huang Wang Yua (ph) said his phone seen here, caught fire the same way  others had, despite Samsung's claims.  In total the Chinese government says  at least 20 Chinese version Note 7s burned up.  </p><p>It's just the latest bad news for Samsung in China after several  challenging years of sales.  In the second quarter of 2013, Samsung phones  account fold 18.2 percent of China's total smartphone market.  The next  year, it was cut in half to 9.9%, and today it sits at 6.5 percent.  That's  good enough for sixth place overall behind Chinese companies, Huawei, OPPO,  Vivo and Xiaomi and its chief rival Apple.  According to market research  and analysis firm IDC.  </p><p>RIVERS (on camera):  Both Apple and Samsung have seen falling sales here in  China recently battling both each other and domestic producers.  But one  analyst tells CNN that with the latest recall Samsung's loss is likely to  be Apple's gain.  The company will try and snap up those high-end customers  that still want a foreign-made phone, but are now wary or even distrustful  of Samsung products.  </p><p>But China is the largest smartphone market in the world with well over a  half billion potential customers.  It's a market Samsung can ill afford to  ignore if it's to rebound in a significant way Note 7 crisis.  But winning  back the trust of the Chinese consumer will be an uphill battle.  </p><p>\"I used to use a Samsung phone, because it was user-friendly,\" says this  woman, \"But after the whole catching fire thing, there's no way I'm going  back to it.\"  That sentiment is Samsung's new reality in China.  Matt  Rivers, CNN, Beijing.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>LAKE:  There is lots more on the Samsung story here on CNNMoney.com.  It's  a special day for us all at CNNMoney.

That comes after at least 41 people were killed in strikes Tuesday,  bringing an end to a period of relative calm in the city.  </p><p>The lawyers for Paris attack suspect Salah Abdeslam has quit his defense,  because he's refusing to speak in court.  Abdeslam is the only known  survivor of the group accused of carrying out the deadly assault last  November.  The attorney spoke at a TV interview taped in the Belgian  capital Tuesday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FRANK BERTON, ATTORNEY (through translator):  We decided to no longer  defend Salah Abdeslam.  This is not a surrender.  It's a renunciation.  We  know and he told us he would not speak and will use his right to remain  silent.  </p><p>SVEN MARY, ATTORNEY (through translator):  The real victims in all of this,  it is the actual victims of the Paris attacks.  Because they have the right  to know the truth and understand the incomprehensible.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAKE:  British film production company has been fined $2 million over  Harrison Ford's injury two years ago.  A hydraulic door on set broke the  actor's leg as he was repricing the role of Han Solo for the \"Star Wars:   The Force Awaken\".  The judge in the case said that the company failed to  let Ford know about the set piece.</p><p>The FTSE may be down for Wednesday, but it has soared since the Brexit  referendum.  The pound, however, has taken a nosedive.  It's currently  trading at around 1.22.  A historic low according to the Bank of England's  indices.  They go back to 1975, the year the U.K. voted to stay in the  European economic market.  The British Prime Minister that she would not  give a running narrative on the Brexit process, but one thing is clear,  Teresa May wants \"Maximum possible access to the EU single market.\"   Speaking earlier in Westminster she denied opposition claims that the  Brexit process is a shambles.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER:  What we are going to do is be  ambitious in our negotiations.  To negotiate the best deal for the British  people.  And that will include the maximum possibility access to the  European market for firms to trade with and operate within the European  market.  But I'm also clear that the vote of the British people said we  should control the movement of people from the EU into the U.K.</p><p>[16:35:00] LAKE:  Senior politicians are calling for a full parliamentary  vote before the Brexit process is officially begin.  Earlier I spoke to one  British lawmakers who said it would be a betrayal not to have one.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEPHEN KINNOCK, UK MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT, LABOR PARTY:  Well, I think the  first thing to be clear on is that we have voted as a country to leave the  European Union.  And that means we have to leave.  Nobody as far as I know  is disputing that.  Certainly the vast majority of my colleagues on the  Labor bench accepts that completely.  But we also know that the referendum  was an incredibly divisive and confrontational experience for the United  Kingdom.  </p><p>The first step towards reuniting our country and healing some of these  divisions would be to have a proper national conversation about Brexit.   About what it will actually mean in practice.  The first place to start  with that conversation is the House of Commons, because we are the elected  representatives of the people.  So it's absurd, really, that the government  has been trying to claim that Parliament shouldn't have a role in  scrutinizing these Brexit negotiations.  </p><p>This government has more power to reshape and shape the future of our  country than any government since the Second World War in my view.   Therefore, it's absolutely critical that parliament gets the opportunity to  scrutinize, to hold the government to account and to ensure that we get the  best possible deal.  </p><p>LAKE:  The European partners have made it perfectly clear they believe that  free movement of people is nonnegotiable.  That it must exist in order to  have free trade and remain part of the trading bloc.  Is there any scenario  where it's worth giving up that?  Worth having free movement of people in  order to achieve the economic relationship that you would like to have with  Europe?  </p><p>KINNOCK:  Well, my view is that there is a tremendous opportunity now for  Theresa May to go to Paris and Berlin and The Hague and the Nordic  countries, and others.  And to say, look, you've got a challenge in all of  your countries around the rise of these populist parties, and that there is  a real question mark over the free movement of labor.  Free movement of  labor, those provisions were introduced at a time particularly around the  treaty where the reality was very, very different.  There were movements of  people across borders were far less.  We're now living in a far more fluid  and mobile age.  </p><p>What I think Theresa May should be saying to her counterparts across the  European Union, is look, let's look at making a European decision on this.   You all want a need a reform of the free movement of labor.  Let's do that  deal, change the paradigm of where we are on free movement of labor, and  after that have the negotiations on the free movement of goods, services  and capital, which are the other three pillars of the single market.  And I  believe that if Theresa May was taking a bit more of ambitious and creative  approach to these negotiations, she could actually square that circle  between getting the reforms on free movement of labor that we need and also  getting us maximum access to the single market and creating a win/win  situation.  When you go into a negotiation, you have to be bold, you have  to be ambitious and you have to be creative.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAKE:  European markets closed firmly in the red, as investors reacted to  falling oil prices and weak tech stocks.

Obama has chosen Mars.  In an exclusive  opinion piece for CNN, the president outlined his goal to put humans on the  red planet with the help of private industry.  \"We have set a clear goal  vital to the next chapter of America's story in space, sending humans to  Mars by 2030, and returning them safely to earth, with the ultimate  ambition to one day remain there for an extended time.\"  President Obama is  not the first leader to target Mars.  The quest to explore the planet has  fascinated America and the world for more than half a century.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's waiting out there just as it always has.  What's  it really like?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is launch complex 41 from where the Viking  missions will be launched from the Titan Center launch vehicle.</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, U.S. PRESIDENT:  By the mid-2030s, I believe we can send  humans to orbit Mars and return them safely to Earth.  And landing on Mars  will follow.  And I expect to be around to see it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAKE:  Inspiring words.  Joining now, Michio Kaku, is a physics professor  at the City University of New York, and he hosts \"Sci-Fi Science\" on the  Science Channel.  Thanks so much for being with us.  </p><p>MICHIO KAKU, PHYSICS PROFESSOR, CITY UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK:  Glad to be  here.</p><p>LAKE:  2030 sounds ambitious.  Is it realistic?  </p><p>KAKU:  Well, Matt Damon, watch out.  If you saw the movie \"The Martian\",  you know that is a very arduous trip.  It takes two years for a round-trip  mission to Mars, but you know, there could be a traffic jam over Mars.   Three groups, not one, three groups have announced that in 15 to 20 years  they want to go to Mars.  SpaceX with Elon Musk, Boeing, and the United  States government.  Now, NASA has been criticized as being the agency to  nowhere.  It doesn't go anywhere anymore.  That's all going to change.</p><p>LAKE:  Beside now wants to go to Mars.  There has been some concern that  while it's great to have these goals and inspiring, that maybe people are  rushing too much, and safety is an issue.  We have seen so many times  recently how dangerous space exploration can be.  </p><p>KAKU:  That's right.  There's something called the Mars jinx.  And that is  that on the order of, well, 30, 40, 50 percent of the missions never  reached the red planet.  Now, we've been more successful, because our space  probes have in fact reached mars with a certain amount of regularity, but  there's dangers.  There's radiation, there's weightlessness, micro  meteorite impact, plus Mars itself is a frozen desert.  You can't live off  the land.  There's no vegetation, no food, no water, no air.  </p><p>[16:45:00] LAKE:  And yet it continues to fascinate us.  What makes so many  people believe that life can be sustained or a colony can be sustained on  Mars?  What is that has put that into so many minds and imaginations.</p><p>KAKU:  You know, it's part of our psyche to look for other civilizations,  other worlds in outer space.  Mars is the closest in terms of looking like  the earth.  It's a rocky planet, not a gas giant like Jupiter.  The  temperatures are cold, but not super-hot like Venus, and it is reachable,  with a two-year mission, so it's fascinating to believe that perhaps there  could be men from mars.  </p><p>Well, now we know we can't even find microbial life on mars, but still it  beckons.  Elon Musk has said we should by a multi-planet species, so in  other words we need earth 2.0.  It's simply too dangerous to put homo  sapiens on just one planet --</p><p>LAKE:  We're doing such a good job taking care of the one we're on, we  should go to others, I suppose.  But truthfully a lot of people believe  that if we don't do that so many things can be learned and can benefit life  here, even in the quest, even if it is further out than 2030.  </p><p>KAKU:  Take a look at the space program.  That has given us miniaturized  transistors, the internet, the space program with weather satellites,  telecommunications.  All of that is a byproduct of the space program.  </p><p>LAKE:  Sorry to interrupt, do the technological advances we see help us  more in space?  You know, we all wonder at the leaps and bounds that we  have seen, carrying smartphones around.  Is that helping us make further  progress into getting further into deep space.</p><p>KAKU:  There is a synergy.  The space program forces us to miniaturize  electronic components and that gave birth to the electronic revolution,  which in turn makes possible space probes that can go safely to the  planets.  That creates another synergy.  There's a back and forth between  the space program and innovation and ingenuity.  </p><p>LAKE:  You mentioned what a long and dangerous journey it is.  What is the  next generation of astronaut going to have to be like if they're going to  go to Mars?  </p><p>KAKU:  Forget the moon.  The moon was a Sunday picnic.  Three days to moon,  three days to come back, you can do it in a week.  Mars is a nine-month  mission to mars, plus you have to be on the red planet, plus another nine  months going back, and realize that the world's record for being up in  outer space is just a little bit over a year.  That's the world's record.  </p><p>LAKE:  We have a way to go.  </p><p>KAKU:  Yes, we've got a way to go.  </p><p>LAKE:  Do you think the private partner-government relationship is good for  everyone?  </p><p>KAKU:  I think it will be key.  The taxpayers are saying who will foot the  bill?  Private enterprise wants a piece of action.  They see a lot of spin  offs and benefits, so I think there's a synergy between the government and  taxpayer who will foot most of the bill and private enterprise because they  want a piece of the action.  </p><p>LAKE:  Together we can get there, we think.  Thank you for coming in.  </p><p>KAKU:  My pleasure.  </p><p>LAKE:  Appreciate it.  </p><p>Still ahead, creepy clown sightings are no laughing matter.

This was on a university campus in London, a 19-year-old  man was later arrested suspected of a public order offense.  This was just  outside London, a clown staring into a restaurant where Leah Woodcock was  having dinner.  </p><p>LEAH WOODCOCK, CREEPY CLOWN OBSERVER:  It had like big teeth and blood and  stuff.  It wasn't particularly nice to see.  I don't think that they're  doing it just for fun.  I think they're doing it to scare people.   SEBASTIAN:  The craze actually began in the U.S. over the summer, sightings  of clowns carrying weapons and an armed robbery at a drugstore in Michigan  caught on CCTV, and clown-based threats led to several school districts  being put on alert.  That trend now spreading to the U.K. We saw as  increased police presence after an Instagram post -- for those who see  themselves as good clowns the craze is particularly distressing.  </p><p>Matte, the Clown, now in his 60s has been doing this for 40 years.</p><p>MATTE, THE CLOWN:  Hello.

Let's speak to one of the  professionals.  Many know him as Kooky Cosmo, the clown, friends and  colleagues call him Michael Kramer.</p><p>Michael, thank you for being here with us today.</p><p>MICHAEL KRAMER, KOOKY COSMO, THE CLOWN:  Thank you for having me.  </p><p>LAKE:  I want to ask you, in all seriousness -- because this is quite  serious -- how has this impacted your business?  Have you felt any negative  reaction to this craze that's going around?  </p><p>KOOKY COSMO:  I feel it every day.  I was in the supermarket in my clown  outfit.  Some actually reported me to the manager and said there's a clown,  and the manager had to say we know this guy, he's really nice.  I hear it  all the time now.  </p><p>LAKE:  Are you worried what that will do to your business?  </p><p>KOOKY COSMO:  Yes, I am worried.  When I'm doing street market events,  people make comments, and my clients hear that.  They may get the idea that  clowns are creepy now, and may not want to use us.  </p><p>LAKE:  Have you seen any cancellations yet?  </p><p>KOOKY COSMO:  I haven't, no.  I'm fortunate that I have steady clients.   They know me.  </p><p>LAKE:  Yes.  Why do you think this is happening?  Have you ever experienced  anything like this before?  </p><p>KOOKY COSMO:  I've experienced negative comments about me, but that's been  mainly from the movie \"It\", John Wayne Gacy, the serial killer they give  clowns a bad name.  I've heard \"I hate clowns\" a lot.</p><p>LAKE:  But those are individuals.  There have always been people who find  clowns a little odd.  There's always a kid at a birthday party who is not  that thrilled, but obviously there are a lot of joyful moments as well.   They seem to be able to coexist.  All of a sudden there seems to be such a  sinister connection.  Do you worry it will be hard to dispel that?  </p><p>KOOKY COSMO:  No, I think it will die out.  </p><p>LAKE:  What makes you so confident?  </p><p>KOOKY COSMO:  I just think it will.  That's how things are.  People want  attention at times.  They just do it for attention, and then something else  comes along.  That will start being a big thing.  I think this will die  out.  </p><p>LAKE:  I know you have associations and memberships where all of you and  your colleagues get together and communicate.</p><p>[16:55:00] Have you talked about trying to counter it or support each other  or put a different message out there?  </p><p>KOOKY COSMO:  Find a new job?  I don't know.  Yes, no, we haven't spoken  about it.  For me what I try to do, I try to be extra nice to people and be  as giving as possible, which I have always done, but now I try to be a  little extra, do a little extra now.</p><p>LAKE:  It's extraordinary that it's had to come to this.  Are you worried  about your personal safety?  Usually, I'm sure when you put the outfit and  you get ready to go to work, you have to get all your enthusiasm and good  cheer up.  Do you worry a bit about moving around now, commuting, getting  to your job based on the negative reaction?  The fear people seem to have?</p><p>KOOKY COSMO:  I do.  I travel around the New York city subway system in my  clown suit.  People give me looks.  I am concerned that -- I don't know  what they'll do.  So far nothing has happened.  </p><p>LAKE:  We certainly know you're not one of those clowns for sure.  And  there are so many double entendre here but we do hope that this passes, we  are all scratching our head about it.  But I am sure it has been around for  so long that certainly it is an art that will endure.</p><p>KOOKY COSMOS:  Thank you very much </p><p>LAKE:  Thank you, Michael for coming on.

Trading is over on Wednesday, the 12th  of October.  Tonight voting begins in battleground states with Hillary  Clinton in a commanding lead.  Samsung sees its latest setup of profits go  up in smoke, and making history for all the wrong reasons.  The pound  slumps to an all-time low.  I'm Maggie Lake.  This is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As early voting begins in key swing states across America, Hillary Clinton  has the edge over Donald Trump, if a new set of polls are to be believed.   New numbers on the presidential race show Clinton either holding on to a  decisive lead or wiping out her Republican rivals' advantage.  National  polls out today from Reuters and Rasmussen given Clinton a lead of seven  and four points respectively.  Another poll from \"Los Angeles Times\", which  has had Trump in the lead the past few months now has the race a tie.  </p><p>With Clinton still riding high, Trump's path to the White House looks less  clear.  A reminder that whoever wins will need 270 electoral college votes.   According to CNN projections, Clinton is already on track to get that magic  number.  She's been consolidating support in key swing states like  Colorado, Virginia, and Pennsylvania.  If Clinton holds on to all blue  states shown here, it doesn't matter how many other Trump wins, as Clinton  will take the White House.  </p><p>We may be 27 days out from election day, but some Americans are already  heading to the polls.  Early voting kicked up in the crucial swing state of  Ohio Wednesday morning.  One of the only states we are still counting as a  battleground shown in yellow.  However, one new poll of likely Ohio voters  shows Clinton ahead by 9 percent in a four-way race.  Poppy Harlow has been  traveling through the swing states hearing first hands from her voters from  her special report \"YOUR MONEY/YOUR VOTE.\"  First she takes us to Ohio.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>POPPY HARLOW, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  This neighborhood in Cleveland, Ohio was  one of the strongest for President Obama in 2012.  Mitt Romney did not get  a single vote from people living in these homes.  Not one.  People living  here have been struggling economically for a long time and they still are.   So the question is, will they come out in droves for Hillary Clinton?  The  way they did for President Obama?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Hillary.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Hillary is the best candidates.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  That's a no-brainer.  </p><p>HARLOW (voice-over):  There have been decades of economic despair and a  dwindling faith that politicians will help.  </p><p>JEFF CROSBY, YOUTH MENTOR, CLEVELAND PEACEMAKERS ALLIANCE:  I think the  Democratic platform is saying the same thing we have heard for about the  past 50 years.  </p><p>HARLOW (on camera):  Over and over?  </p><p>CROSBY:  Over and over.</p><p>HARLOW:  Since the war on poverty was declared?  </p><p>CROSBY:  Yes.  </p><p>HARLOW (voice-over):  Jeff Crosby used to be in gangs.  That landed him in  prison.  Now he's working to keep kids from the same life he lived.  </p><p>CROSBY:  It's one of the highest crime areas in Cleveland.  </p><p>HARLOW (on camera):  This is?  </p><p>CROSBY:  Yes.  About ten gangs over here.  What's up?  You're good?  I  think the Democratic Party is taking us for granted.  The Republican Party  his literally ignores us, except for Trump.  Trump is trying to make  inroads, but he is a polarizing figure.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I don't trust Donald.  That's all.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Because he's got money?  That ain't everything.  </p><p>SIERRA LESLEY, VOTER:  I'm willing to vote for a clown before Donald Trump.  </p><p>HARLOW:  Really?  </p><p>LESLEY:  Yes.  With a red nose.  I do agree with Republicans sometimes, but  I don't agree with nothing that Donald Trump stands for.  </p><p>HARLOW:  And that brings us to the second part of this Ohio chapter, 200  miles south.  We're in Pike County, Ohio.  This place matters a lot.  Not  for the number of votes here, but because of what it represents.  It used  to be solidly blue, but it's been moving more and more red.  In 2012, this  was the closest county in the country.  Mitt Romney won here by a single  vote, just one vote.  It's 96 percent white, largely blue collar, and  unemployment here is high.  These are exactly the voters Donald Trump has  been speaking to.  So if his message isn't resonating here, he's in  trouble.  </p><p>SCOTT HAMMOND, BUSINESS MANAGER:  I would say right now you're looking at a  coin toss.  </p><p>HARLOW:  A coin toss among union workers who until now have been solidly  blue.  Have we ever seen anything like that before?  Donald Trump says he's  the one to bring these jobs back?  He's the one to build up your industry?  </p><p>HAMMOND:  Donald Trump is saying that, that's total propaganda.  Where is  his merchandise made?  What does he have to offer to American industry?   Nothing.  </p><p>HARLOW (voice-over):  Many here do believe Trump and see them as their best  shot at getting ahead.  Since 2000, Ohio has lost nearly a third of its  manufacturing jobs.  </p><p>[16:05:00] BILL STANLEY, VOTER:  He's got a lot of things that are amazing  that he was telling us he can do for us.  </p><p>HARLOW:  Angie Shanks runs a successful real estate firm here.  </p><p>ANGIE SHANKS, VOTER:  It means more jobs, more better-paying jobs.  </p><p>HARLOW:  You voted for President Obama in 2008.  </p><p>SHANKS:  Yes, I did.  </p><p>HARLOW (voice-over):  But her faith in the Obama administration has faded.  </p><p>SHANKS:  I think Trump is a businessman and the country is a business.  It  needs to be run as a business.  </p><p>HARLOW:  When we met Angie, she is leaning towards Trump.  Now, after the  \"Access Hollywood\" tape surfaced, she's reconsidering.  </p><p>HARLOW:  You're a lifelong Democrat?  </p><p>CHARLIE SALTKIELD, VOTER:  Yes.  </p><p>HARLOW (on camera):  So you're voting for Hillary this time around?  </p><p>SALTKIELD:  No, I'm not.  </p><p>HARLOW:  No?</p><p>SALTKIELD:  My dad was a coal miner.  They put the coal miners out of the  work.  </p><p>HARLOW:  We left Ohio asking this question.  Why does economic pain from  one town to the left push some to the left, others to the right?  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAKE:  And Poppy Harlow joins us now in the studio.  Poppy, you touched on  the piece, but a lot of the people you talked to, the Trump tape had just  started coming out.  I know you circled back to a lot of them.  Do you feel  it's swaying people?  Or are they really focused on some of the themes they  talk to you about a smut doesn't matter?</p><p>HARLOW:  It's not swaying his loyal supporters.  Maggie, on this swing  state trip, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Florida, we talked to 26 solid Trump  supporters.  Like totally in the Trump camp.  So we called all of them back  obviously this weekend, after that tape was released with those comments  about groping women, and with the exception of three people they are all  standing by Trump.  One said she'll no longer vote for him, two are  undecided, but I think that gives you the lens of loyalty he has here in  this critical state.  I mean, no one has won the White House without  winning Ohio since 1960.</p><p>LAKE:  Except nobody can win the White House without getting swing voters  and some of the voters away from the other party's people.  And we know  he's got loyal supporters.  It's interesting as I was watching that piece,  we see these themes and we know the economic disarray.</p><p>Interesting they talked about his business, even though there's been  controversy about how he handled business, but another sign that really  struck me.  And it stopped the overdoses.  This is the middle of the  country that's been hit by the heroin epidemic.  They have lost job.  They  have lost faith in government it seems.  </p><p>HARLOW:  I'm so glad you bring that up.  Because that is something we  actually did a number of interviews, and even spoke with a woman at an  opioid clinic where they help people getting over these horrific  addictions.  And you don't see it here in that piece, because it's such a  huge issue to dive into.  We wanted to give it a just amount of time.  That  is ripping their society apart and their economy apart.  </p><p>LAKE:  And they don't feel like anyone is helping.  </p><p>HARLOW:  And they don't feel like anybody's helping, the state government,  local or nationally.  And they feel forgotten.  I think from the drug  epidemic there, to the lack of manufacturing jobs, they feel forgotten, and  their hope in politicians is gone.  That's why so many said to us they're  willing to bet on an unknown in Donald Trump.  Some of them said roll the  dice.</p><p>LAKE:  Do they know his policies, though?  Do they think that --</p><p>HARLOW:  They don't care.  That's a great point.  Their answer, many of  them, and were talking about many well-educated people that are supporting  him said, he's made money.  He's been a success.  We trust him to figure it  out, or surround himself with smart people that will.  It is the  willingness to try something else, because the establishment has failed  them in their mind.  </p><p>LAKE:  It's an indictment of Washington.  And not just --</p><p>HARLOW:  Absolutely.  </p><p>LAKE:  -- not just a Democrat or Republican administration.  I think  they're losing faith in government, which is very disturbing.  </p><p>HARLOW:  Maggie, the fact that you have union workers supporting Donald  Trump.  This is a solidly blue contingent that Hillary Clinton should be  able to not lose a minute of sleep over.  In Ohio, 12 percent of overall  workers are union.  That's higher than the national average.  That's huge.   The fact that so many of them are looking and siding with a Republican  ticket right now, I think is a huge indicate of where this country is  going.  But again, he needs to win over a big amount of those undecided  voters.  </p><p>LAKE:  And temperament remains an issue.  When you talk to his supporters,  do they recognize their concern about that?  Because it is something we  hear.  Although Hillary doesn't score much better.  Her trust factor.  </p><p>HARLOW:  They say we doth trust Hillary, right?  Or they say we don't  really like her, but we don't know why.  Then with Donald Trump there is  the temperament issue.  I mean, yes, a number of them said they're  concerned about his temperament.  Angie Shanks, the young woman, the blonde  woman who owns a real estate business, told me, yes, that did throw her  off, and she is concerned about this.  And that was before the tape came  out.  Now she told me on the phone this weekend, she's very undecided at  this point.  </p><p>They are worried about temperament, but they look at someone who's -- they  see it as successful in business.  The bankruptcies don't bother them.  And  you heard one woman say, well he has a hit television show.  </p><p>[16:10:02] I mean, that really to her is the definition of success.  That's  what Cindy Newberry told me, and she says our country needs that.  </p><p>LAKE:  It's easy to dismiss them, but we shouldn't dismiss the fact that so  many feel disenfranchised and feel like the system is no longer working for  him and that's what happened to all the Republican contenders.  They  underestimated that at their peril.</p><p>HARLOW:  Yes, and that's why it was so important to us, to me an hour team,  the amazing CNNMoney team who did this, to get out of the coast.  To get  out of New York and California, and get into middle America and talk to  these voters and hear from them directly.  This is part of a bigger series.  </p><p>LAKE:  Where are you going next?  </p><p>HARLOW:  So we're going tomorrow, were going to take you on the show to  Florida.  Which is fascinating, so that the Latinos and retires.  And then  we're going to take you to Pennsylvania, the Keystone state, which is  critical as well.  A bunch of the same problems as Ohio.  The manufacturing  job base just disappearing and depleted.  </p><p>LAKE:  These are serious problems and it's going to be a big platform for  whoever wins the presidency.  They're going to have to address this  feeling.  And by the way, it's not just happening in the U.S., we should  point out, a lot of this has an international thread as well.  Poppy, great  stuff.  Look forward to the next one.  </p><p>HARLOW:  Thank you.  </p><p>LAKE:  Thanks so much.  We'll have more, as poppy just mentioned, on her  series throughout the rest of the week, and in two weeks from now, Richard,  will be tackling  the swing states himself.  He'll be making his way through Florida as part  of his American Quest, speaking to leaders and voters who may hold the key  for decision the next president of the United States.  You can see that on  QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, on Monday, October 24th.  We know how much can change  in two weeks.  </p><p>Hillary Clinton's campaign is facing a new email controversy.  This time  involving WikiLeaks.  The whistleblowing website has published emails  hacked from the campaign manager John Podesta.  They allegedly show that  the Clinton campaign and the U.S. Justice Department shared information  while Clinton was under investigation for her use of a private email server  as U.S. Secretary of State.  Donald Trump wasted no time in trying to make  political capital from the leak.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  The WikiLeaks emails  show that Hillary Clinton's staff even has to give her secret notes on when  she needs to smile.  Smile, Hillary, smile.  Hey, folks, we have to get  back to work.  Our country is in trouble.  We can't play games any more.   Smile.  Can you believe it?  Smile.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAKE:  The chairman John Podesta has blamed Moscow for involvement in the  hack.  Russia's foreign minister told CNN that is not true.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SERGEY LAVROV, RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER:  Well, it's flattering, of course,  to get this kind of attention for original power, as President Obama called  us some time ago.  Now everybody in the United States is saying that it is  Russia, which is running the United States presidential debate.  It's  flattering, as I said, but it has nothing, you know, to be explained by the  facts.  We have not seen a single fact, a single proof.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LAKE:  CNN's Joe Johns is in Washington.  So, Joe, once again, we have this  revelations coming out about Hillary, does it tell us something we already  didn't know about the candidate?  </p><p>JOE JOHNS, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  I don't think so.  There  aren't any really big surprises in there.  It's sort of in the eye of the  beholder, if you look through these emails, perhaps a business embarrassing  for some of the people who work for the Clinton campaign, but no smoking  gun, as it were, Maggie.  </p><p>LAKE:  I imagine that there is, you know, a great deal of sort of positive  chatter within the Clinton campaign about some of these new polls coming  out.  They are encouraging, but this is in no way a runaway race,  especially considering some of the bombshells that come out about Trump.   How do they square the fact that it's still such a tough race?  </p><p>JOHNS:  They've been saying that all along.  They've really never changed  the message.  They've always said they expect this to be a close race at  the end of the day.  But certainly gratified about the latest polls.   Gratified even they say that the candidate herself was happy with her  performance in the last debate.  They say it will be a close race.  They're  concerned, of all things about people becoming complacent and not voting in  November because they look at these numbers.  That is what they're going to  fight against as we move toward November.  </p><p>LAKE:  It's interesting you mention that, Joe.  Because we do hear some  people feeling so disgusted or certainly Republicans turned off by Trump.   It's interesting to hear the Democrats are worried about the get out the  vote effort as well.  Clinton though has the entire Democratic establish  behind her.  Something Donald Trump is struggling with right now.  Does  that help her?  </p><p>[16:15:00] JOHNS:  Well, it certainly helps to have the whole Democratic  establishment behind you in force, out on the campaign trail with the  number one surrogate being the president of the United States himself.   Nonetheless, both of these candidates, both Hillary Clinton and Donald  Trump have very high negatives.  We've seen that all year long.  That's  another concern, that people might not be that excited about voting for  Hillary Clinton, and might stay home.  So they're working very hard to put  an affirmative message out there, not just about voting against Donald  Trump, but also Hillary Clinton making the case for why she says voters  need to vote for her along policy lines.  </p><p>LAKE:  Absolutely, and were still hearing from some people.  It may be a  day of decision for them.  A lot of work to be done.  Joe, thank you so  much.  Joe Johns for us tonight.  </p><p>Still ahead, hitting the wrong note.  Samsung proves that 7 isn't always  the lucky number and now faces more bad luck when it comes to the company's  balance sheet.  More on that next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LAKE:  U.S. markets managed to hold their nerve after Tuesday's 200-point  drop.  The Dow closed slightly higher, up only 15 points.  It didn't really  manage to dig out of that hole.  In the past few hours, the Fed released  minutes from the last meeting.  It says a rate hike is needed, \"relatively  soon\" but there is no firm agreement on timing.  Paul La Monica is at the  New York Stock Exchange.  Paul, I think we already knew that their  inclination is to raise rates, but we still don't exactly know when.  </p><p>PAUL R.  LA MONICA, CNN MONEY CORRESPONDENT:  No, I think that, you know,  if you wanted to have a magic eight ball, all indications point to December  as probably what would come up, but of course, Maggie, there are wild  cards, the presidential election if Donald Trump sneaks out a victory,  obviously the odds seem to be against him right now based on the polls.   That could change things, because he's been critical of Fed policy and  Janet Yellen in particular.  If the global economy has another mini  meltdown.  That could put the Fed on hold for the foreseeable future.  So  right now I think investors are betting Clinton wins.  The economy stays  relatively stable.  Fed rate hike comes in December, and that's what the  Fed is indicating as well.</p><p>LAKE:  Yes, it's all about the expectations.  If things start to move  drastically then the Fed risks losing faith.  I'm sure they want to keep  their options open.  I want to ask you about some news that came out late  in the day.  It's all still firming up right now.  But it looks like we may  finally get the birth of a unicorn some time in 2017.  Snapchat?  </p><p>LA MONICA:  Yes, definitely.  We've had, Maggie, some smaller tech unicorns  go public here at the NYSC, as well as the NASDAQ.  But snapchat would be  the first \"Deca-corn,\" if you will, more than a $10 billion valuation.   Right now the private market valuation is 18 billion.  CNNMoney has not  confirmed any of this.  This is a Bloomberg report as of right now.  But  Saying That Snapshot has hired Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs to be its  lead underwriters.  </p><p>[16:20:00] A lot of other big Wall Street banks might be co-managers of  this offering as well.  Obviously everyone would be very excited to see how  Snapshot does, because a successful Snapchat IPO some time in 2017 could  lead the way for Uber, Airbnb, China's Xiaomi, to all potentially go public  as well.  That would be the first time in a while we've had a truly big  tech company go public.  Facebook was probably the last major one that I  can think of.</p><p>LAKE:  Yes, and obviously that has done really well for people who stuck  with it through the ups and downs.  Not so much of a track record when we  look through out tech stocks.  Paul, you and I have talked a lot, there's  been a lot of concern about the valuations of some of these companies that  frankly we don't know a lot about what their financials look like.  They're  private.  We don't get to see their books every quarter.  </p><p>LA MONICA:  Yes, until they go public it is a lot of speculation about how  strong the numbers really are.  And obviously most of these companies have  metrics that are favorable probably, revenue growth is going up pretty  dramatically for companies that have users.  They're seeing user growth and  subscribers, but at the end of the day, Wall Street, the people behind me,  they don't really care about users and revenue as much as profits when you  become a public company.  Facebook is a very profitable company, has  continued to grow like a weed.  That's why it's now one of the world's most  valuable companies.  And Twitter, another relatively recent IPO, is not.   Just to name two names.  </p><p>LAKE:  That's right, the pressures of being public and getting those  quarter on quarter profit expectations down is a difficult one.  And it's  one that's frustrated a lot of CEOs including Alibaba's.  We talked about  it.  All right Paul, it's going to be fascinating to watch.  Thank you so  much.</p><p>LA MONICA:  Thank you.</p><p>LAKE:  Paul La Monica for us.  </p><p>Joining me now is Roger McNamee, the cofounder of Elevation Partners, a  private equity firm that focusing on consumer tech.  Roger, great to see  you.  Got to ask you right out of the gate --</p><p>ROGER MCNAMEE, COFOUNDER, ELEVATION PARTNERS:  Good to be back Maggie.  </p><p>LAKE:  -- what your thoughts are about Snapshot.  If it turns out that we  are going to see an IPO in the first quarter of the year, toward the end of  it anyway.  How do you feel about that company?  Is there something you'd  be interested in?  Or do you think there is a lot of hype?  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  There's obviously a lot of hype.  But I think what we want to  understand is that with Snap, they are one of those companies in a consumer  market where going public can make their business more successful.  If you  think of their target audience, which is young people, you know, 25 and  under.  It's a video product addressing an audience that has a much, much  lower interest level in television viewing than older people have.  So as a  consequence from an advertiser's point of view, Snap offering something  that is, you know, getting them at a demographic they can't really get at  with traditional television advertising.  And so I do think going public  will make a really big deal.  But we shouldn't pretend that this is going  to be a bargain.  </p><p>On the earnings numbers at the time they go public, this will be very,  very, very expensive.  But we should also understand that like Facebook,  this is a company where the active going public can actually strengthen  their business opportunity and get their revenue to grow much more rapidly.   In fact, it may surprise a lot of people.  I'm personally really looking  forward to seeing the company as a public company, because I do think it  has a market opportunity that we haven't yet seen, a mobile only video  company with really serious traction.  </p><p>LAKE:  Interesting you say that.  Talk to me about those users.  We know  the filters, some of the things that attracts younger users.  Does it  matter to build and lock in that love of brand at an early age?  Or is this  a fickle group that if somebody comes along with deep pockets, they can  replicate it.  They can kind of run over Snapchat?  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  We're going to find out.  We're actually going to find that out  over the next 12 months.  Because Facebook is doing everything in its power  to take its video products and match what Snapchat the product has today.   I do believe that Snap as a company has built a consumer awareness and  consumer brand that at the moment I think be able to resist the attack from  Facebook.  But over time, it is going to be I think a cutthroat battle of  Snap versus Facebook versus other players that want a piece of that action.   I do believe, though, that what they're doing is real and it will be big,  and advertisers will flock to it.  As a consequence, it may be a decent  IPO.  </p><p>LAKE:  That is the future.  Let's talk about a name that we know well from  the past.  And had been performing so well, and that is Samsung.  Now the  seven shelved for the moment.  How much of a disadvantage is that to be out  of the market?  Letting your competitors run ahead of you without a product  out there.  How damaging?  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  You know, I think, Maggie, that is not the big problem they face  today.  Two or three years ago when the smartphone business was still  growing rapidly, that would have been a disaster to be out of the market.   This is serious, because they've really mishandled the recall so far.  </p><p>[16:25:00] And so, you know, people compare this to Tylenol when they had  the scare many, many years ago.  The difference was that Johnson and  Johnson moved in immediately.  They were totally transparent.  They gave  the consumers their money back.  They got everything off the shelves.  They  are super-aggressive to do the right thing.  And Samsung acted for the  first couple of months as though they thought there was a possibility there  were customers out there who might perceive an exploding phone as a  feature, not a bug.  And that I think has cost their brand a lot.  Samsung  is a huge company.  They'll get through this.  But I think their smartphone  business has taken a hit that would be hard to recover from.  I think this  is fantastic for Apple and may wind up also being good for other Android  vendors.  </p><p>LAKE:  Yes, absolutely.  Roger, you think there's a management issue here?  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  I think, you know, you look at this, and what it really is all  about is cutting corners.  The market has slowed down.  It's been really,  really hard to be people to buy their fourth smartphone, you know, on a  two-year cycle, which is the way it's been.  Consumers basically they have  products they like.  They aren't broken, they don't need a new phone.  So  Samsung strategy was to throw in the kitchen sink.  Literally take every  feature it could think of, and strap it onto this lithium-ion battery.  The  problem is that lithium-ion is a very unstable chemical.  And so if you  don't get everything exactly right, fire risk is a huge issue.  And  everyone in that business has done a very good job of managing it so far,  as have the people in the electric car business.  But Samsung cut some  corners.  And they're going to pay a huge price for that.  </p><p>LAKE:  A hard lesson learned.  Roger, always a pleasure to catch up with  you.  Thank you so much.  Appreciate it.</p><p>MCNAMEE:  Thanks for having me on, Maggie.  Good to see you.  </p><p>LAKE:  With Samsung effectively dropping out of the smartphone market for  time, as we just heard, the door is order for its Chinese rivals to  capitalize.  Other than Apple, Huawei, and OPPO, Samsung's biggest  competitors.  Matt Rivers has more on how China is reacting to Samsung's  problems.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATT RIVERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The bad news now front and  center on Samsung's Chinese website, the global recall of the Galaxy Note 7  will now include China.  That means about 191,000 phones will have to be  replaced with new ones, according to government regulators.  Eroding  confidence with Chinese consumers.  \"I don't trust Samsung,\" says Yan Jung  Jin, \"With these problems and the recall the company has lost all  credibility with me.\"</p><p>Initially Chinese versions of the Note 7 weren't recalled.  They used a  different battery than other models and Samsung said they were safe.  Many  Chinese consumers were skeptical though after seeing things like this.   Huang Wang Yua (ph) said his phone seen here, caught fire the same way  others had, despite Samsung's claims.  In total the Chinese government says  at least 20 Chinese version Note 7s burned up.  </p><p>It's just the latest bad news for Samsung in China after several  challenging years of sales.  In the second quarter of 2013, Samsung phones  account fold 18.2 percent of China's total smartphone market.  The next  year, it was cut in half to 9.9%, and today it sits at 6.5 percent.  That's  good enough for sixth place overall behind Chinese companies, Huawei, OPPO,  Vivo and Xiaomi and its chief rival Apple.  According to market research  and analysis firm IDC.  </p><p>RIVERS (on camera):  Both Apple and Samsung have seen falling sales here in  China recently battling both each other and domestic producers.  But one  analyst tells CNN that with the latest recall Samsung's loss is likely to  be Apple's gain.  The company will try and snap up those high-end customers  that still want a foreign-made phone, but are now wary or even distrustful  of Samsung products.  </p><p>But China is the largest smartphone market in the world with well over a  half billion potential customers.  It's a market Samsung can ill afford to  ignore if it's to rebound in a significant way Note 7 crisis.  But winning  back the trust of the Chinese consumer will be an uphill battle.  </p><p>\"I used to use a Samsung phone, because it was user-friendly,\" says this  woman, \"But after the whole catching fire thing, there's no way I'm going  back to it.\"  That sentiment is Samsung's new reality in China.

The pound, however, has taken a nosedive.  It's currently  trading at around 1.22.  A historic low according to the Bank of England's  indices.  They go back to 1975, the year the U.K. voted to stay in the  European economic market.  The British Prime Minister that she would not  give a running narrative on the Brexit process, but one thing is clear,  Teresa May wants \"Maximum possible access to the EU single market.\"   Speaking earlier in Westminster she denied opposition claims that the  Brexit process is a shambles.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER:  What we are going to do is be  ambitious in our negotiations.  To negotiate the best deal for the British  people.  And that will include the maximum possibility access to the  European market for firms to trade with and operate within the European  market.  But I'm also clear that the vote of the British people said we  should control the movement of people from the EU into the U.K.</p><p>[16:35:00] LAKE:  Senior politicians are calling for a full parliamentary  vote before the Brexit process is officially begin.  Earlier I spoke to one  British lawmakers who said it would be a betrayal not to have one.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEPHEN KINNOCK, UK MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT, LABOR PARTY:  Well, I think the  first thing to be clear on is that we have voted as a country to leave the  European Union.  And that means we have to leave.  Nobody as far as I know  is disputing that.  Certainly the vast majority of my colleagues on the  Labor bench accepts that completely.  But we also know that the referendum  was an incredibly divisive and confrontational experience for the United  Kingdom.  </p><p>The first step towards reuniting our country and healing some of these  divisions would be to have a proper national conversation about Brexit.   About what it will actually mean in practice.  The first place to start  with that conversation is the House of Commons, because we are the elected  representatives of the people.  So it's absurd, really, that the government  has been trying to claim that Parliament shouldn't have a role in  scrutinizing these Brexit negotiations.  </p><p>This government has more power to reshape and shape the future of our  country than any government since the Second World War in my view.   Therefore, it's absolutely critical that parliament gets the opportunity to  scrutinize, to hold the government to account and to ensure that we get the  best possible deal.  </p><p>LAKE:  The European partners have made it perfectly clear they believe that  free movement of people is nonnegotiable.  That it must exist in order to  have free trade and remain part of the trading bloc.  Is there any scenario  where it's worth giving up that?  Worth having free movement of people in  order to achieve the economic relationship that you would like to have with  Europe?  </p><p>KINNOCK:  Well, my view is that there is a tremendous opportunity now for  Theresa May to go to Paris and Berlin and The Hague and the Nordic  countries, and others.  And to say, look, you've got a challenge in all of  your countries around the rise of these populist parties, and that there is  a real question mark over the free movement of labor.  Free movement of  labor, those provisions were introduced at a time particularly around the  treaty where the reality was very, very different.  There were movements of  people across borders were far less.  We're now living in a far more fluid  and mobile age.  </p><p>What I think Theresa May should be saying to her counterparts across the  European Union, is look, let's look at making a European decision on this.   You all want a need a reform of the free movement of labor.  Let's do that  deal, change the paradigm of where we are on free movement of labor, and  after that have the negotiations on the free movement of goods, services  and capital, which are the other three pillars of the single market.  And I  believe that if Theresa May was taking a bit more of ambitious and creative  approach to these negotiations, she could actually square that circle  between getting the reforms on free movement of labor that we need and also  getting us maximum access to the single market and creating a win/win  situation.  When you go into a negotiation, you have to be bold, you have  to be ambitious and you have to be creative.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAKE:  European markets closed firmly in the red, as investors reacted to  falling oil prices and weak tech stocks.

Joining now, Michio Kaku, is a physics professor  at the City University of New York, and he hosts \"Sci-Fi Science\" on the  Science Channel.  Thanks so much for being with us.  </p><p>MICHIO KAKU, PHYSICS PROFESSOR, CITY UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK:  Glad to be  here.</p><p>LAKE:  2030 sounds ambitious.  Is it realistic?  </p><p>KAKU:  Well, Matt Damon, watch out.  If you saw the movie \"The Martian\",  you know that is a very arduous trip.  It takes two years for a round-trip  mission to Mars, but you know, there could be a traffic jam over Mars.   Three groups, not one, three groups have announced that in 15 to 20 years  they want to go to Mars.  SpaceX with Elon Musk, Boeing, and the United  States government.  Now, NASA has been criticized as being the agency to  nowhere.  It doesn't go anywhere anymore.  That's all going to change.</p><p>LAKE:  Beside now wants to go to Mars.  There has been some concern that  while it's great to have these goals and inspiring, that maybe people are  rushing too much, and safety is an issue.  We have seen so many times  recently how dangerous space exploration can be.  </p><p>KAKU:  That's right.  There's something called the Mars jinx.  And that is  that on the order of, well, 30, 40, 50 percent of the missions never  reached the red planet.  Now, we've been more successful, because our space  probes have in fact reached mars with a certain amount of regularity, but  there's dangers.  There's radiation, there's weightlessness, micro  meteorite impact, plus Mars itself is a frozen desert.  You can't live off  the land.  There's no vegetation, no food, no water, no air.  </p><p>[16:45:00] LAKE:  And yet it continues to fascinate us.  What makes so many  people believe that life can be sustained or a colony can be sustained on  Mars?  What is that has put that into so many minds and imaginations.</p><p>KAKU:  You know, it's part of our psyche to look for other civilizations,  other worlds in outer space.  Mars is the closest in terms of looking like  the earth.  It's a rocky planet, not a gas giant like Jupiter.  The  temperatures are cold, but not super-hot like Venus, and it is reachable,  with a two-year mission, so it's fascinating to believe that perhaps there  could be men from mars.  </p><p>Well, now we know we can't even find microbial life on mars, but still it  beckons.  Elon Musk has said we should by a multi-planet species, so in  other words we need earth 2.0.  It's simply too dangerous to put homo  sapiens on just one planet --</p><p>LAKE:  We're doing such a good job taking care of the one we're on, we  should go to others, I suppose.  But truthfully a lot of people believe  that if we don't do that so many things can be learned and can benefit life  here, even in the quest, even if it is further out than 2030.  </p><p>KAKU:  Take a look at the space program.  That has given us miniaturized  transistors, the internet, the space program with weather satellites,  telecommunications.  All of that is a byproduct of the space program.  </p><p>LAKE:  Sorry to interrupt, do the technological advances we see help us  more in space?  You know, we all wonder at the leaps and bounds that we  have seen, carrying smartphones around.  Is that helping us make further  progress into getting further into deep space.</p><p>KAKU:  There is a synergy.  The space program forces us to miniaturize  electronic components and that gave birth to the electronic revolution,  which in turn makes possible space probes that can go safely to the  planets.  That creates another synergy.  There's a back and forth between  the space program and innovation and ingenuity.  </p><p>LAKE:  You mentioned what a long and dangerous journey it is.  What is the  next generation of astronaut going to have to be like if they're going to  go to Mars?  </p><p>KAKU:  Forget the moon.  The moon was a Sunday picnic.  Three days to moon,  three days to come back, you can do it in a week.  Mars is a nine-month  mission to mars, plus you have to be on the red planet, plus another nine  months going back, and realize that the world's record for being up in  outer space is just a little bit over a year.  That's the world's record.  </p><p>LAKE:  We have a way to go.  </p><p>KAKU:  Yes, we've got a way to go.  </p><p>LAKE:  Do you think the private partner-government relationship is good for  everyone?  </p><p>KAKU:  I think it will be key.  The taxpayers are saying who will foot the  bill?  Private enterprise wants a piece of action.  They see a lot of spin  offs and benefits, so I think there's a synergy between the government and  taxpayer who will foot most of the bill and private enterprise because they  want a piece of the action.  </p><p>LAKE:  Together we can get there, we think.

There's always a kid at a birthday party who is not  that thrilled, but obviously there are a lot of joyful moments as well.   They seem to be able to coexist.  All of a sudden there seems to be such a  sinister connection.  Do you worry it will be hard to dispel that?  </p><p>KOOKY COSMO:  No, I think it will die out.  </p><p>LAKE:  What makes you so confident?  </p><p>KOOKY COSMO:  I just think it will.  That's how things are.  People want  attention at times.  They just do it for attention, and then something else  comes along.  That will start being a big thing.  I think this will die  out.  </p><p>LAKE:  I know you have associations and memberships where all of you and  your colleagues get together and communicate.</p><p>[16:55:00] Have you talked about trying to counter it or support each other  or put a different message out there?  </p><p>KOOKY COSMO:  Find a new job?  I don't know.  Yes, no, we haven't spoken  about it.  For me what I try to do, I try to be extra nice to people and be  as giving as possible, which I have always done, but now I try to be a  little extra, do a little extra now.</p><p>LAKE:  It's extraordinary that it's had to come to this.  Are you worried  about your personal safety?  Usually, I'm sure when you put the outfit and  you get ready to go to work, you have to get all your enthusiasm and good  cheer up.  Do you worry a bit about moving around now, commuting, getting  to your job based on the negative reaction?  The fear people seem to have?</p><p>KOOKY COSMO:  I do.  I travel around the New York city subway system in my  clown suit.  People give me looks.  I am concerned that -- I don't know  what they'll do.  So far nothing has happened.  </p><p>LAKE:  We certainly know you're not one of those clowns for sure.  And  there are so many double entendre here but we do hope that this passes, we  are all scratching our head about it.  But I am sure it has been around for  so long that certainly it is an art that will endure.</p><p>KOOKY COSMOS:  Thank you very much </p><p>LAKE:  Thank you, Michael for coming on.  Have a good day.  </p><p>KOOKY COSMO:  you're very welcome, it's a pleasure.</p><p>LAKE:  Now if you have a daily digest of the day's top business stories  delivered to your inbox, you can subscribe to the QUEST MEANS BUSINESS  newsletter featuring Richard's Profitable Moment and all the top headlines  from the rest of the CNNMoney team.</p><p>Just go to CNNMoney.com/quest to subscribe and don't forget to download the  new CNNMoney stream app, you can find that link on the CNNMoney home page.  </p><p>Just time for a quick reminder of how U.S. markets ended the day.  The Dow  managed to hold its nerve after Tuesday's 200-point drop.  The Dow closed  slightly higher, up just 15 points.  In the pass few hours, the Fed  released its minutes from the last meeting saying the rate hike is needed  \"relatively soon\", but there's no firm agreement on timing.  </p><p>That is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.

Trading is over on Wednesday, the 12th of October. Tonight voting begins in battleground states with <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>in a commanding lead. Samsung sees its latest setup of profits go up in smoke, and making history for all the wrong reasons. The pound slumps to an all-time low. I'm Maggie Lake.

New numbers on the presidential race show Clinton either holding on to a decisive lead or wiping out her Republican rivals' advantage. National polls out today from Reuters and Rasmussen given Clinton a lead of seven and four points respectively. Another poll from \"Los Angeles Times\", which has had Trump in the lead the past few months now has the race a tie.</p><p>With Clinton still riding high, Trump's path to the White House looks less clear. A reminder that whoever wins will need 270 electoral college votes. According to CNN projections, Clinton is already on track to get that magic number. She's been consolidating support in key swing states like Colorado, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. If Clinton holds on to all blue states shown here, it doesn't matter how many other Trump wins, as Clinton will take the White House.</p><p>We may be 27 days out from election day, but some Americans are already heading to the polls. Early voting kicked up in the crucial swing state of Ohio Wednesday morning. One of the only states we are still counting as a battleground shown in yellow. However, one new poll of likely Ohio voters shows Clinton ahead by 9 percent in a four-way race. Poppy Harlow has been traveling through the swing states hearing first hands from her voters from her special report \"YOUR MONEY/YOUR VOTE.\" First she takes us to Ohio.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>POPPY HARLOW, CNN CORRESPONDENT: This neighborhood in Cleveland, Ohio was one of the strongest for <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>in 2012. <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>did not get a single vote from people living in these homes. Not one. People living here have been struggling economically for a long time and they still are. So the question is, will they come out in droves for <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton? </nameText></person>The way they did for <person><nameText>President Obama?</nameText></person></p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hillary.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hillary is the best candidates.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That's a no-brainer.</p><p>HARLOW (voice-over): There have been decades of economic despair and a dwindling faith that politicians will help.</p><p>JEFF CROSBY, YOUTH MENTOR, CLEVELAND PEACEMAKERS ALLIANCE: I think the Democratic platform is saying the same thing we have heard for about the past 50 years.</p><p>HARLOW (on camera): Over and over?</p><p>CROSBY: Over and over.</p><p>HARLOW: Since the war on poverty was declared?</p><p>CROSBY: Yes.</p><p>HARLOW (voice-over): Jeff Crosby used to be in gangs. That landed him in prison. Now he's working to keep kids from the same life he lived.</p><p>CROSBY: It's one of the highest crime areas in Cleveland.</p><p>HARLOW (on camera): This is?</p><p>CROSBY: Yes. About ten gangs over here. What's up? You're good? I think the Democratic Party is taking us for granted. The Republican Party his literally ignores us, except for Trump. Trump is trying to make inroads, but he is a polarizing figure.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't trust Donald. That's all.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Because he's got money? That ain't everything.</p><p>SIERRA LESLEY, VOTER: I'm willing to vote for a clown before <person><nameText>Donald Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>HARLOW: Really?</p><p>LESLEY: Yes. With a red nose. I do agree with Republicans sometimes, but I don't agree with nothing that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>stands for.</p><p>HARLOW: And that brings us to the second part of this Ohio chapter, 200 miles south. We're in Pike County, Ohio. This place matters a lot. Not for the number of votes here, but because of what it represents. It used to be solidly blue, but it's been moving more and more red. In 2012, this was the closest county in the country. <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>won here by a single vote, just one vote. It's 96 percent white, largely blue collar, and unemployment here is high. These are exactly the voters <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>has been speaking to. So if his message isn't resonating here, he's in trouble.</p><p>SCOTT HAMMOND, BUSINESS MANAGER: I would say right now you're looking at a coin toss.</p><p>HARLOW: A coin toss among union workers who until now have been solidly blue. Have we ever seen anything like that before? <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>says he's the one to bring these jobs back? He's the one to build up your industry?</p><p>HAMMOND: <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is saying that, that's total propaganda. Where is his merchandise made? What does he have to offer to American industry? Nothing.</p><p>HARLOW (voice-over): Many here do believe Trump and see them as their best shot at getting ahead. Since 2000, Ohio has lost nearly a third of its manufacturing jobs.</p><p>[16:05:00] BILL STANLEY, VOTER: He's got a lot of things that are amazing that he was telling us he can do for us.</p><p>HARLOW: Angie Shanks runs a successful real estate firm here.</p><p>ANGIE SHANKS, VOTER: It means more jobs, more better-paying jobs.</p><p>HARLOW: You voted for <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>in 2008.</p><p>SHANKS: Yes, I did.</p><p>HARLOW (voice-over): But her faith in the Obama administration has faded.</p><p>SHANKS: I think Trump is a businessman and the country is a business. It needs to be run as a business.</p><p>HARLOW: When we met Angie, she is leaning towards Trump. Now, after the \"Access Hollywood\" tape surfaced, she's reconsidering.</p><p>HARLOW: You're a lifelong Democrat?</p><p>CHARLIE SALTKIELD, VOTER: Yes.</p><p>HARLOW (on camera): So you're voting for Hillary this time around?</p><p>SALTKIELD: No, I'm not.</p><p>HARLOW: No?</p><p>SALTKIELD: My dad was a coal miner. They put the coal miners out of the work.</p><p>HARLOW: We left Ohio asking this question. Why does economic pain from one town to the left push some to the left, others to the right?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAKE: And Poppy Harlow joins us now in the studio. Poppy, you touched on the piece, but a lot of the people you talked to, the Trump tape had just started coming out. I know you circled back to a lot of them. Do you feel it's swaying people? Or are they really focused on some of the themes they talk to you about a smut doesn't matter?</p><p>HARLOW: It's not swaying his loyal supporters. Maggie, on this swing state trip, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Florida, we talked to 26 solid Trump supporters. Like totally in the Trump camp. So we called all of them back obviously this weekend, after that tape was released with those comments about groping women, and with the exception of three people they are all standing by Trump. One said she'll no longer vote for him, two are undecided, but I think that gives you the lens of loyalty he has here in this critical state. I mean, no one has won the White House without winning Ohio since 1960.</p><p>LAKE: Except nobody can win the White House without getting swing voters and some of the voters away from the other party's people. And we know he's got loyal supporters. It's interesting as I was watching that piece, we see these themes and we know the economic disarray.</p><p>Interesting they talked about his business, even though there's been controversy about how he handled business, but another sign that really struck me. And it stopped the overdoses. This is the middle of the country that's been hit by the heroin epidemic. They have lost job. They have lost faith in government it seems.</p><p>HARLOW: I'm so glad you bring that up. Because that is something we actually did a number of interviews, and even spoke with a woman at an opioid clinic where they help people getting over these horrific addictions. And you don't see it here in that piece, because it's such a huge issue to dive into. We wanted to give it a just amount of time. That is ripping their society apart and their economy apart.</p><p>LAKE: And they don't feel like anyone is helping.</p><p>HARLOW: And they don't feel like anybody's helping, the state government, local or nationally. And they feel forgotten. I think from the drug epidemic there, to the lack of manufacturing jobs, they feel forgotten, and their hope in politicians is gone. That's why so many said to us they're willing to bet on an unknown in <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>Some of them said roll the dice.</p><p>LAKE: Do they know his policies, though? Do they think that --</p><p>HARLOW: They don't care. That's a great point. Their answer, many of them, and were talking about many well-educated people that are supporting him said, he's made money. He's been a success. We trust him to figure it out, or surround himself with smart people that will. It is the willingness to try something else, because the establishment has failed them in their mind.</p><p>LAKE: It's an indictment of Washington. And not just --</p><p>HARLOW: Absolutely.</p><p>LAKE: -- not just a Democrat or Republican administration. I think they're losing faith in government, which is very disturbing.</p><p>HARLOW: Maggie, the fact that you have union workers supporting <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>This is a solidly blue contingent that <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>should be able to not lose a minute of sleep over. In Ohio, 12 percent of overall workers are union. That's higher than the national average. That's huge. The fact that so many of them are looking and siding with a Republican ticket right now, I think is a huge indicate of where this country is going. But again, he needs to win over a big amount of those undecided voters.</p><p>LAKE: And temperament remains an issue. When you talk to his supporters, do they recognize their concern about that? Because it is something we hear. Although Hillary doesn't score much better. Her trust factor.</p><p>HARLOW: They say we doth trust Hillary, right? Or they say we don't really like her, but we don't know why. Then with <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>there is the temperament issue. I mean, yes, a number of them said they're concerned about his temperament. Angie Shanks, the young woman, the blonde woman who owns a real estate business, told me, yes, that did throw her off, and she is concerned about this. And that was before the tape came out. Now she told me on the phone this weekend, she's very undecided at this point.</p><p>They are worried about temperament, but they look at someone who's -- they see it as successful in business. The bankruptcies don't bother them. And you heard one woman say, well he has a hit television show.</p><p>[16:10:02] I mean, that really to her is the definition of success. That's what Cindy Newberry told me, and she says our country needs that.</p><p>LAKE: It's easy to dismiss them, but we shouldn't dismiss the fact that so many feel disenfranchised and feel like the system is no longer working for him and that's what happened to all the Republican contenders. They underestimated that at their peril.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes, and that's why it was so important to us, to me an hour team, the amazing CNNMoney team who did this, to get out of the coast. To get out of New York and California, and get into middle America and talk to these voters and hear from them directly. This is part of a bigger series.</p><p>LAKE: Where are you going next?</p><p>HARLOW: So we're going tomorrow, were going to take you on the show to Florida. Which is fascinating, so that the Latinos and retires. And then we're going to take you to Pennsylvania, the Keystone state, which is critical as well. A bunch of the same problems as Ohio. The manufacturing job base just disappearing and depleted.</p><p>LAKE: These are serious problems and it's going to be a big platform for whoever wins the presidency. They're going to have to address this feeling. And by the way, it's not just happening in the U.S., we should point out, a lot of this has an international thread as well. Poppy, great stuff. Look forward to the next one.</p><p>HARLOW: Thank you.</p><p>LAKE: Thanks so much. We'll have more, as poppy just mentioned, on her series throughout the rest of the week, and in two weeks from now, Richard, will be tackling the swing states himself. He'll be making his way through Florida as part of his American Quest, speaking to leaders and voters who may hold the key for decision the next president of the United States. You can see that on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, on Monday, October 24th. We know how much can change in two weeks.</p><p><person><nameText>Hillary Clinton's </nameText></person>campaign is facing a new email controversy. This time involving WikiLeaks. The whistleblowing website has published emails hacked from the campaign manager John Podesta. They allegedly show that the Clinton campaign and the U.S. Justice Department shared information while Clinton was under investigation for her use of a private email server as U.S. Secretary of State. <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>wasted no time in trying to make political capital from the leak.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The WikiLeaks emails show that <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton's </nameText></person>staff even has to give her secret notes on when she needs to smile. Smile, Hillary, smile. Hey, folks, we have to get back to work. Our country is in trouble. We can't play games any more. Smile. Can you believe it? Smile.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAKE: The chairman John Podesta has blamed Moscow for involvement in the hack. Russia's foreign minister told CNN that is not true.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SERGEY LAVROV, RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER: Well, it's flattering, of course, to get this kind of attention for original power, as <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>called us some time ago. Now everybody in the United States is saying that it is Russia, which is running the United States presidential debate. It's flattering, as I said, but it has nothing, you know, to be explained by the facts. We have not seen a single fact, a single proof.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAKE: CNN's Joe Johns is in Washington. So, Joe, once again, we have this revelations coming out about Hillary, does it tell us something we already didn't know about the candidate?</p><p>JOE JOHNS, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: I don't think so. There aren't any really big surprises in there. It's sort of in the eye of the beholder, if you look through these emails, perhaps a business embarrassing for some of the people who work for the Clinton campaign, but no smoking gun, as it were, Maggie.</p><p>LAKE: I imagine that there is, you know, a great deal of sort of positive chatter within the Clinton campaign about some of these new polls coming out. They are encouraging, but this is in no way a runaway race, especially considering some of the bombshells that come out about Trump. How do they square the fact that it's still such a tough race?</p><p>JOHNS: They've been saying that all along. They've really never changed the message. They've always said they expect this to be a close race at the end of the day. But certainly gratified about the latest polls. Gratified even they say that the candidate herself was happy with her performance in the last debate. They say it will be a close race. They're concerned, of all things about people becoming complacent and not voting in November because they look at these numbers. That is what they're going to fight against as we move toward November.</p><p>LAKE: It's interesting you mention that, Joe. Because we do hear some people feeling so disgusted or certainly Republicans turned off by Trump. It's interesting to hear the Democrats are worried about the get out the vote effort as well. Clinton though has the entire Democratic establish behind her. Something <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is struggling with right now. Does that help her?</p><p>[16:15:00] JOHNS: Well, it certainly helps to have the whole Democratic establishment behind you in force, out on the campaign trail with the number one surrogate being the president of the United States himself. Nonetheless, both of these candidates, both <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>and <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>have very high negatives. We've seen that all year long. That's another concern, that people might not be that excited about voting for <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton, </nameText></person>and might stay home. So they're working very hard to put an affirmative message out there, not just about voting against <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>but also <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>making the case for why she says voters need to vote for her along policy lines.</p><p>LAKE: Absolutely, and were still hearing from some people. It may be a day of decision for them. A lot of work to be done. Joe, thank you so much. Joe Johns for us tonight.</p><p>Still ahead, hitting the wrong note. Samsung proves that 7 isn't always the lucky number and now faces more bad luck when it comes to the company's balance sheet. More on that next.</p><p>LAKE: U.S. markets managed to hold their nerve after Tuesday's 200-point drop. The Dow closed slightly higher, up only 15 points. It didn't really manage to dig out of that hole. In the past few hours, the Fed released minutes from the last meeting. It says a rate hike is needed, \"relatively soon\" but there is no firm agreement on timing. Paul La Monica is at the New York Stock Exchange. Paul, I think we already knew that their inclination is to raise rates, but we still don't exactly know when.</p><p>PAUL R. LA MONICA, CNN MONEY CORRESPONDENT: No, I think that, you know, if you wanted to have a magic eight ball, all indications point to December as probably what would come up, but of course, Maggie, there are wild cards, the presidential election if <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>sneaks out a victory, obviously the odds seem to be against him right now based on the polls. That could change things, because he's been critical of Fed policy and Janet Yellen in particular. If the global economy has another mini meltdown. That could put the Fed on hold for the foreseeable future. So right now I think investors are betting Clinton wins. The economy stays relatively stable. Fed rate hike comes in December, and that's what the Fed is indicating as well.</p><p>LAKE: Yes, it's all about the expectations. If things start to move drastically then the Fed risks losing faith. I'm sure they want to keep their options open. I want to ask you about some news that came out late in the day. It's all still firming up right now. But it looks like we may finally get the birth of a unicorn some time in 2017. Snapchat?</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, definitely. We've had, Maggie, some smaller tech unicorns go public here at the NYSC, as well as the NASDAQ. But snapchat would be the first \"Deca-corn,\" if you will, more than a $10 billion valuation. Right now the private market valuation is 18 billion. CNNMoney has not confirmed any of this. This is a Bloomberg report as of right now. But Saying That Snapshot has hired Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs to be its lead underwriters.</p><p>[16:20:00] A lot of other big Wall Street banks might be co-managers of this offering as well. Obviously everyone would be very excited to see how Snapshot does, because a successful Snapchat IPO some time in 2017 could lead the way for Uber, Airbnb, China's Xiaomi, to all potentially go public as well. That would be the first time in a while we've had a truly big tech company go public. Facebook was probably the last major one that I can think of.</p><p>LAKE: Yes, and obviously that has done really well for people who stuck with it through the ups and downs. Not so much of a track record when we look through out tech stocks. Paul, you and I have talked a lot, there's been a lot of concern about the valuations of some of these companies that frankly we don't know a lot about what their financials look like. They're private. We don't get to see their books every quarter.</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, until they go public it is a lot of speculation about how strong the numbers really are. And obviously most of these companies have metrics that are favorable probably, revenue growth is going up pretty dramatically for companies that have users. They're seeing user growth and subscribers, but at the end of the day, Wall Street, the people behind me, they don't really care about users and revenue as much as profits when you become a public company. Facebook is a very profitable company, has continued to grow like a weed. That's why it's now one of the world's most valuable companies. And Twitter, another relatively recent IPO, is not. Just to name two names.</p><p>LAKE: That's right, the pressures of being public and getting those quarter on quarter profit expectations down is a difficult one. And it's one that's frustrated a lot of CEOs including Alibaba's. We talked about it. All right Paul, it's going to be fascinating to watch. Thank you so much.</p><p>LA MONICA: Thank you.</p><p>LAKE: Paul La Monica for us.</p><p>Joining me now is Roger McNamee, the cofounder of Elevation Partners, a private equity firm that focusing on consumer tech. Roger, great to see you. Got to ask you right out of the gate --</p><p>ROGER MCNAMEE, COFOUNDER, ELEVATION PARTNERS: Good to be back Maggie.</p><p>LAKE: -- what your thoughts are about Snapshot. If it turns out that we are going to see an IPO in the first quarter of the year, toward the end of it anyway. How do you feel about that company? Is there something you'd be interested in? Or do you think there is a lot of hype?</p><p>MCNAMEE: There's obviously a lot of hype. But I think what we want to understand is that with Snap, they are one of those companies in a consumer market where going public can make their business more successful. If you think of their target audience, which is young people, you know, 25 and under. It's a video product addressing an audience that has a much, much lower interest level in television viewing than older people have. So as a consequence from an advertiser's point of view, Snap offering something that is, you know, getting them at a demographic they can't really get at with traditional television advertising. And so I do think going public will make a really big deal. But we shouldn't pretend that this is going to be a bargain.</p><p>On the earnings numbers at the time they go public, this will be very, very, very expensive. But we should also understand that like Facebook, this is a company where the active going public can actually strengthen their business opportunity and get their revenue to grow much more rapidly. In fact, it may surprise a lot of people. I'm personally really looking forward to seeing the company as a public company, because I do think it has a market opportunity that we haven't yet seen, a mobile only video company with really serious traction.</p><p>LAKE: Interesting you say that. Talk to me about those users. We know the filters, some of the things that attracts younger users. Does it matter to build and lock in that love of brand at an early age? Or is this a fickle group that if somebody comes along with deep pockets, they can replicate it. They can kind of run over Snapchat?</p><p>MCNAMEE: We're going to find out. We're actually going to find that out over the next 12 months. Because Facebook is doing everything in its power to take its video products and match what Snapchat the product has today. I do believe that Snap as a company has built a consumer awareness and consumer brand that at the moment I think be able to resist the attack from Facebook. But over time, it is going to be I think a cutthroat battle of Snap versus Facebook versus other players that want a piece of that action. I do believe, though, that what they're doing is real and it will be big, and advertisers will flock to it. As a consequence, it may be a decent IPO.</p><p>LAKE: That is the future. Let's talk about a name that we know well from the past. And had been performing so well, and that is Samsung. Now the seven shelved for the moment. How much of a disadvantage is that to be out of the market? Letting your competitors run ahead of you without a product out there. How damaging?</p><p>MCNAMEE: You know, I think, Maggie, that is not the big problem they face today. Two or three years ago when the smartphone business was still growing rapidly, that would have been a disaster to be out of the market. This is serious, because they've really mishandled the recall so far.</p><p>[16:25:00] And so, you know, people compare this to Tylenol when they had the scare many, many years ago. The difference was that Johnson and Johnson moved in immediately. They were totally transparent. They gave the consumers their money back. They got everything off the shelves. They are super-aggressive to do the right thing. And Samsung acted for the first couple of months as though they thought there was a possibility there were customers out there who might perceive an exploding phone as a feature, not a bug. And that I think has cost their brand a lot. Samsung is a huge company. They'll get through this. But I think their smartphone business has taken a hit that would be hard to recover from. I think this is fantastic for Apple and may wind up also being good for other Android vendors.</p><p>LAKE: Yes, absolutely. Roger, you think there's a management issue here?</p><p>MCNAMEE: I think, you know, you look at this, and what it really is all about is cutting corners. The market has slowed down. It's been really, really hard to be people to buy their fourth smartphone, you know, on a two-year cycle, which is the way it's been. Consumers basically they have products they like. They aren't broken, they don't need a new phone. So Samsung strategy was to throw in the kitchen sink. Literally take every feature it could think of, and strap it onto this lithium-ion battery. The problem is that lithium-ion is a very unstable chemical. And so if you don't get everything exactly right, fire risk is a huge issue. And everyone in that business has done a very good job of managing it so far, as have the people in the electric car business. But Samsung cut some corners. And they're going to pay a huge price for that.</p><p>LAKE: A hard lesson learned. Roger, always a pleasure to catch up with you. Thank you so much. Appreciate it.</p><p>MCNAMEE: Thanks for having me on, Maggie. Good to see you.</p><p>LAKE: With Samsung effectively dropping out of the smartphone market for time, as we just heard, the door is order for its Chinese rivals to capitalize. Other than Apple, Huawei, and OPPO, Samsung's biggest competitors. Matt Rivers has more on how China is reacting to Samsung's problems.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATT RIVERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The bad news now front and center on Samsung's Chinese website, the global recall of the Galaxy Note 7 will now include China. That means about 191,000 phones will have to be replaced with new ones, according to government regulators. Eroding confidence with Chinese consumers. \"I don't trust Samsung,\" says Yan Jung Jin, \"With these problems and the recall the company has lost all credibility with me.\"</p><p>Initially Chinese versions of the Note 7 weren't recalled. They used a different battery than other models and Samsung said they were safe. Many Chinese consumers were skeptical though after seeing things like this. Huang Wang Yua (ph) said his phone seen here, caught fire the same way others had, despite Samsung's claims. In total the Chinese government says at least 20 Chinese version Note 7s burned up.</p><p>It's just the latest bad news for Samsung in China after several challenging years of sales. In the second quarter of 2013, Samsung phones account fold 18.2 percent of China's total smartphone market. The next year, it was cut in half to 9.9%, and today it sits at 6.5 percent. That's good enough for sixth place overall behind Chinese companies, Huawei, OPPO, Vivo and Xiaomi and its chief rival Apple. According to market research and analysis firm IDC.</p><p>RIVERS (on camera): Both Apple and Samsung have seen falling sales here in China recently battling both each other and domestic producers. But one analyst tells CNN that with the latest recall Samsung's loss is likely to be Apple's gain. The company will try and snap up those high-end customers that still want a foreign-made phone, but are now wary or even distrustful of Samsung products.</p><p>But China is the largest smartphone market in the world with well over a half billion potential customers. It's a market Samsung can ill afford to ignore if it's to rebound in a significant way Note 7 crisis. But winning back the trust of the Chinese consumer will be an uphill battle.</p><p>\"I used to use a Samsung phone, because it was user-friendly,\" says this woman, \"But after the whole catching fire thing, there's no way I'm going back to it.\" That sentiment is Samsung's new reality in China.

The pound, however, has taken a nosedive. It's currently trading at around 1.22. A historic low according to the Bank of England's indices. They go back to 1975, the year the U.K. voted to stay in the European economic market. The British Prime Minister that she would not give a running narrative on the Brexit process, but one thing is clear, Teresa May wants \"Maximum possible access to the EU single market.\" Speaking earlier in Westminster she denied opposition claims that the Brexit process is a shambles.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: What we are going to do is be ambitious in our negotiations. To negotiate the best deal for the British people. And that will include the maximum possibility access to the European market for firms to trade with and operate within the European market. But I'm also clear that the vote of the British people said we should control the movement of people from the EU into the U.K.</p><p>[16:35:00] LAKE: Senior politicians are calling for a full parliamentary vote before the Brexit process is officially begin. Earlier I spoke to one British lawmakers who said it would be a betrayal not to have one.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEPHEN KINNOCK, UK MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT, LABOR PARTY: Well, I think the first thing to be clear on is that we have voted as a country to leave the European Union. And that means we have to leave. Nobody as far as I know is disputing that. Certainly the vast majority of my colleagues on the Labor bench accepts that completely. But we also know that the referendum was an incredibly divisive and confrontational experience for the United Kingdom.</p><p>The first step towards reuniting our country and healing some of these divisions would be to have a proper national conversation about Brexit. About what it will actually mean in practice. The first place to start with that conversation is the House of Commons, because we are the elected representatives of the people. So it's absurd, really, that the government has been trying to claim that Parliament shouldn't have a role in scrutinizing these Brexit negotiations.</p><p>This government has more power to reshape and shape the future of our country than any government since the Second World War in my view. Therefore, it's absolutely critical that parliament gets the opportunity to scrutinize, to hold the government to account and to ensure that we get the best possible deal.</p><p>LAKE: The European partners have made it perfectly clear they believe that free movement of people is nonnegotiable. That it must exist in order to have free trade and remain part of the trading bloc. Is there any scenario where it's worth giving up that? Worth having free movement of people in order to achieve the economic relationship that you would like to have with Europe?</p><p>KINNOCK: Well, my view is that there is a tremendous opportunity now for Theresa May to go to Paris and Berlin and The Hague and the Nordic countries, and others. And to say, look, you've got a challenge in all of your countries around the rise of these populist parties, and that there is a real question mark over the free movement of labor. Free movement of labor, those provisions were introduced at a time particularly around the treaty where the reality was very, very different. There were movements of people across borders were far less. We're now living in a far more fluid and mobile age.</p><p>What I think Theresa May should be saying to her counterparts across the European Union, is look, let's look at making a European decision on this. You all want a need a reform of the free movement of labor. Let's do that deal, change the paradigm of where we are on free movement of labor, and after that have the negotiations on the free movement of goods, services and capital, which are the other three pillars of the single market. And I believe that if Theresa May was taking a bit more of ambitious and creative approach to these negotiations, she could actually square that circle between getting the reforms on free movement of labor that we need and also getting us maximum access to the single market and creating a win/win situation. When you go into a negotiation, you have to be bold, you have to be ambitious and you have to be creative.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAKE: European markets closed firmly in the red, as investors reacted to falling oil prices and weak tech stocks.

Joining now, Michio Kaku, is a physics professor at the City University of New York, and he hosts \"Sci-Fi Science\" on the Science Channel. Thanks so much for being with us.</p><p>MICHIO KAKU, PHYSICS PROFESSOR, CITY UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK: Glad to be here.</p><p>LAKE: 2030 sounds ambitious. Is it realistic?</p><p>KAKU: Well, Matt Damon, watch out. If you saw the movie \"The Martian\", you know that is a very arduous trip. It takes two years for a round-trip mission to Mars, but you know, there could be a traffic jam over Mars. Three groups, not one, three groups have announced that in 15 to 20 years they want to go to Mars. SpaceX with Elon Musk, Boeing, and the United States government. Now, NASA has been criticized as being the agency to nowhere. It doesn't go anywhere anymore. That's all going to change.</p><p>LAKE: Beside now wants to go to Mars. There has been some concern that while it's great to have these goals and inspiring, that maybe people are rushing too much, and safety is an issue. We have seen so many times recently how dangerous space exploration can be.</p><p>KAKU: That's right. There's something called the Mars jinx. And that is that on the order of, well, 30, 40, 50 percent of the missions never reached the red planet. Now, we've been more successful, because our space probes have in fact reached mars with a certain amount of regularity, but there's dangers. There's radiation, there's weightlessness, micro meteorite impact, plus Mars itself is a frozen desert. You can't live off the land. There's no vegetation, no food, no water, no air.</p><p>[16:45:00] LAKE: And yet it continues to fascinate us. What makes so many people believe that life can be sustained or a colony can be sustained on Mars? What is that has put that into so many minds and imaginations.</p><p>KAKU: You know, it's part of our psyche to look for other civilizations, other worlds in outer space. Mars is the closest in terms of looking like the earth. It's a rocky planet, not a gas giant like Jupiter. The temperatures are cold, but not super-hot like Venus, and it is reachable, with a two-year mission, so it's fascinating to believe that perhaps there could be men from mars.</p><p>Well, now we know we can't even find microbial life on mars, but still it beckons. Elon Musk has said we should by a multi-planet species, so in other words we need earth 2.0. It's simply too dangerous to put homo sapiens on just one planet --</p><p>LAKE: We're doing such a good job taking care of the one we're on, we should go to others, I suppose. But truthfully a lot of people believe that if we don't do that so many things can be learned and can benefit life here, even in the quest, even if it is further out than 2030.</p><p>KAKU: Take a look at the space program. That has given us miniaturized transistors, the internet, the space program with weather satellites, telecommunications. All of that is a byproduct of the space program.</p><p>LAKE: Sorry to interrupt, do the technological advances we see help us more in space? You know, we all wonder at the leaps and bounds that we have seen, carrying smartphones around. Is that helping us make further progress into getting further into deep space.</p><p>KAKU: There is a synergy. The space program forces us to miniaturize electronic components and that gave birth to the electronic revolution, which in turn makes possible space probes that can go safely to the planets. That creates another synergy. There's a back and forth between the space program and innovation and ingenuity.</p><p>LAKE: You mentioned what a long and dangerous journey it is. What is the next generation of astronaut going to have to be like if they're going to go to Mars?</p><p>KAKU: Forget the moon. The moon was a Sunday picnic. Three days to moon, three days to come back, you can do it in a week. Mars is a nine-month mission to mars, plus you have to be on the red planet, plus another nine months going back, and realize that the world's record for being up in outer space is just a little bit over a year. That's the world's record.</p><p>LAKE: We have a way to go.</p><p>KAKU: Yes, we've got a way to go.</p><p>LAKE: Do you think the private partner-government relationship is good for everyone?</p><p>KAKU: I think it will be key. The taxpayers are saying who will foot the bill? Private enterprise wants a piece of action. They see a lot of spin offs and benefits, so I think there's a synergy between the government and taxpayer who will foot most of the bill and private enterprise because they want a piece of the action.</p><p>LAKE: Together we can get there, we think. Thank you for coming in.</p><p>KAKU: My pleasure.</p><p>LAKE: Appreciate it.</p><p>Still ahead, creepy clown sightings are no laughing matter. Next we hear from a professional about how his classic entertainment form is suffering.</p><p>[16:50:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LAKE: One of the America's most recognizable pop culture icons has fallen victim to a bizarre trend. Appearances by McDonald's mascot Ronald McDonald are being limited until the creepy pranks die down. The sinister craze these people dressing up as clowns just to scare others is a trend spreading internationally. Clare Sebastian has more from London.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GEORGE BURKE, VICTIM OF CREEPY CLOWN SIGHTING: I want to get past. I want to go out.</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: This is the moment that George Burke back from Plymouth realized the clown standing in his path with what he said looked like a hammer was no joke.</p><p>BURKE: Going in, yes, off, mate.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Clown sightings like this across the U.K. have been appearing on social media. This was on a university campus in London, a 19-year-old man was later arrested suspected of a public order offense. This was just outside London, a clown staring into a restaurant where Leah Woodcock was having dinner.</p><p>LEAH WOODCOCK, CREEPY CLOWN OBSERVER: It had like big teeth and blood and stuff. It wasn't particularly nice to see. I don't think that they're doing it just for fun. I think they're doing it to scare people. SEBASTIAN: The craze actually began in the U.S. over the summer, sightings of clowns carrying weapons and an armed robbery at a drugstore in Michigan caught on CCTV, and clown-based threats led to several school districts being put on alert. That trend now spreading to the U.K. We saw as increased police presence after an Instagram post -- for those who see themselves as good clowns the craze is particularly distressing.</p><p>Matte, the Clown, now in his 60s has been doing this for 40 years.</p><p>MATTE, THE CLOWN: Hello. I'm doing and interview. The clown can do all sorts of things. Which are really funny in the right circumstance, but with a scary mask on, very unfunny. Don't do it, please, don't do it. Dress up as something else.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SINGER: Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right --</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Unfortunately, it's the right time of year for dressing up. Police have warned these incidents could increase in the run up to Halloween. Clare Sebastian, CNN, London.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAKE: Now, clowning is a centuries-old tradition that continues to influence modern-day film and theater. Let's speak to one of the professionals. Many know him as Kooky Cosmo, the clown, friends and colleagues call him Michael Kramer.</p><p>Michael, thank you for being here with us today.</p><p>MICHAEL KRAMER, KOOKY COSMO, THE CLOWN: Thank you for having me.</p><p>LAKE: I want to ask you, in all seriousness -- because this is quite serious -- how has this impacted your business? Have you felt any negative reaction to this craze that's going around?</p><p>KOOKY COSMO: I feel it every day. I was in the supermarket in my clown outfit. Some actually reported me to the manager and said there's a clown, and the manager had to say we know this guy, he's really nice. I hear it all the time now.</p><p>LAKE: Are you worried what that will do to your business?</p><p>KOOKY COSMO: Yes, I am worried. When I'm doing street market events, people make comments, and my clients hear that. They may get the idea that clowns are creepy now, and may not want to use us.</p><p>LAKE: Have you seen any cancellations yet?</p><p>KOOKY COSMO: I haven't, no. I'm fortunate that I have steady clients. They know me.</p><p>LAKE: Yes. Why do you think this is happening? Have you ever experienced anything like this before?</p><p>KOOKY COSMO: I've experienced negative comments about me, but that's been mainly from the movie \"It\", John Wayne Gacy, the serial killer they give clowns a bad name. I've heard \"I hate clowns\" a lot.</p><p>LAKE: But those are individuals. There have always been people who find clowns a little odd. There's always a kid at a birthday party who is not that thrilled, but obviously there are a lot of joyful moments as well. They seem to be able to coexist. All of a sudden there seems to be such a sinister connection. Do you worry it will be hard to dispel that?</p><p>KOOKY COSMO: No, I think it will die out.</p><p>LAKE: What makes you so confident?</p><p>KOOKY COSMO: I just think it will. That's how things are. People want attention at times. They just do it for attention, and then something else comes along. That will start being a big thing. I think this will die out.</p><p>LAKE: I know you have associations and memberships where all of you and your colleagues get together and communicate.</p><p>[16:55:00] Have you talked about trying to counter it or support each other or put a different message out there?</p><p>KOOKY COSMO: Find a new job? I don't know. Yes, no, we haven't spoken about it. For me what I try to do, I try to be extra nice to people and be as giving as possible, which I have always done, but now I try to be a little extra, do a little extra now.</p><p>LAKE: It's extraordinary that it's had to come to this. Are you worried about your personal safety? Usually, I'm sure when you put the outfit and you get ready to go to work, you have to get all your enthusiasm and good cheer up. Do you worry a bit about moving around now, commuting, getting to your job based on the negative reaction? The fear people seem to have?</p><p>KOOKY COSMO: I do. I travel around the New York city subway system in my clown suit. People give me looks. I am concerned that -- I don't know what they'll do. So far nothing has happened.</p><p>LAKE: We certainly know you're not one of those clowns for sure. And there are so many double entendre here but we do hope that this passes, we are all scratching our head about it. But I am sure it has been around for so long that certainly it is an art that will endure.</p><p>KOOKY COSMOS: Thank you very much</p><p>LAKE: Thank you, Michael for coming on. Have a good day.</p><p>KOOKY COSMO: you're very welcome, it's a pleasure.</p><p>LAKE: Now if you have a daily digest of the day's top business stories delivered to your inbox, you can subscribe to the QUEST MEANS BUSINESS newsletter featuring Richard's Profitable Moment and all the top headlines from the rest of the CNNMoney team.</p><p>Just go to CNNMoney.com/quest to subscribe and don't forget to download the new CNNMoney stream app, you can find that link on the CNNMoney home page.</p><p>Just time for a quick reminder of how U.S. markets ended the day. The Dow managed to hold its nerve after Tuesday's 200-point drop. The Dow closed slightly higher, up just 15 points. In the pass few hours, the Fed released its minutes from the last meeting saying the rate hike is needed \"relatively soon\", but there's no firm agreement on timing.</p><p>That is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Thanks for watching. The news continues here on CNN.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2016101201cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5KXN-T7H1-DXH2-6339-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7922\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"10\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>October 12, 2016 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC000D3XE</classCode><className>SAMSUNG GROUP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009SVI</classCode><className>LOS ANGELES TIMES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS335220 MAJOR HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCE MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS334413 SEMICONDUCTOR &amp;

Did individuals and firms making large donations to the Foundation, or paying large speaking or consulting fees to <person><nameText>Bill Clinton, </nameText></person>get preferred access to Ms. Clinton as Secretary of State? Is there a revolving door between the Clinton campaign and the Foundation's fundraising staff? Are these relationships the subject of the emails she deleted from her private server?</p><p> These questions point to a more basic issue about the role of money in politics. What, exactly, do large corporations get in exchange for their campaign contributions? Ms. Clinton gave 92 speeches between 2013 and 2015 that netted her $21.6 million, including $1.8 million for just 8 speeches to large banks. (CNN provides eye-opening details[6] about her speaking requirements \u2014 the $225,000 fee is just the tip of the iceberg.) Ms. Clinton is hardly known for her business acumen; her infamous cattle-futures trades[7] are widely recognized as a political payoff, and her views on corporate governance[8] have been ridiculed by experts. Her opinions on world politics are already in the public domain, so I doubt that Goldman Sachs was getting $200K worth of unique insight into global affairs. <person><nameText>Bill Clinton, </nameText></person>with zero experience in higher-education administration, bagged $17 million[9] to be honorary chancellor of an obscure for-profit university. Why are these companies throwing their money away? Most people assume that campaign contributions, speaking and consulting fees and lucrative board positions for former and future politicians, and similar payments are pure graft, the kinds of pay-to-play arrangements common under crony capitalism. And some of these transfers surely do buy access and even specific policy outcomes. There are several problems with the common assumption, however. First, research on campaign contributions finds that the expected rate of return on these payments is quite high and yet, given the potential gains, the contribution amounts are remarkably small[10]. Second, there is little systematic evidence[11] that policies are, on average, greatly influenced by such contributions, leading some to suggest that this form of payment to politicians and political parties is mainly consumption, not investment.Lobbying as a Defensive Strategy\u00a0A more intriguing finding, however, is that most large companies not only give generously, but about equally to both major parties[12], even when the parties' candidates and representatives differ on particular issues. This suggests that payments to politicians are best understood as a form of insurance. Money in politics provides protection against what Fred McChesney[13] has called 'rent-extraction' by government. For example, before the mid-1990s, the tech industry had a very low profile in Washington \u2014 few contributions, no DC headquarters for the big tech companies, and so on. After the Microsoft antitrust trial, this situation was completely reversed, and now tech companies are among the biggest lobbyists in the US[14]. The message was clear: you want to play ball, you pay up \u2014 or we shut you down. It's not that companies are necessarily paying for specific outcomes; rather, they are paying for the right to do business at all. As Ludwig von Mises pointed out, doing business in a world of aggressive governmental regulation is tricky. One consequence is to make firms more bureaucratic, by which Mises means less effective at responding to consumer needs in the most efficient manner.The Cost of Compliance with Government RegulationsUnder capitalism, the size, complexity, and strategy of corporations, reflects the decisions of capitalist-entrepreneurs about how best to earn profit, competing freely with each other for resources and consumer patronage. Under interventionism \u2014 what we now call crony capitalism \u2014 the situation is different. Now companies must employ large staffs of lawyers, accountants, lobbyists, public relations teams, and others who focus not on creating economic value, but on satisfying legal, tax, regulatory, and other government requirements. That large firms are filled with such non-productive employees is not, Mises writes in Human Action[15], 'a phenomenon of the unhampered market economy,' but a result of government policy. In his earlier book Bureaucracy[16], published in 1944, Mises challenges the idea that bureaucracy is a necessary consequence of firm size. 'No pro\ufb01t-seeking enterprise, no matter how large, is liable to become bureaucratic provided the hands of its management are not tied by government interference. The trend toward bureaucratic rigidity is not inherent in the evolution of business. It is an outcome of government meddling with business.' By this Mises means that government interference impedes the entrepreneur's use of economic calculation and the attempt to use prices to impose managerial discipline. Mises gives three examples: taxes and price regulations that interfere with corporate pro\ufb01ts (distorting an important signal of employee performance); laws that interfere with hiring and promotion (including the need to hire people to deal with government); and the omnipresent threat of arbitrary antitrust or regulatory activity, in response to which entrepreneurs must become adept at 'diplomacy and bribery.' This is why large companies send millions of dollars to the Clintons and other top politicians in both major parties. A President Hillary Clinton could direct billions to favored companies, and take billions of potential profits away from those that don't 'play the game.' Just as journalists know that tough questions will get them banned from future press conferences, business leaders under crony capitalism know that if they don't contribute, don't hire, don't pay the right people in Washington or Brussels or wherever, they won't be successful. The solution? Take away the ability of government to intervene in economic affairs. Just imagine the popularity of Ms. Clinton on the speaking circuit in a world like that! Peter G.

Did individuals and firms making large donations to the Foundation, or paying large speaking or consulting fees to <person><nameText>Bill Clinton, </nameText></person>get preferred access to Ms. Clinton as Secretary of State? Is there a revolving door between the Clinton campaign and the Foundation's fundraising staff? Are these relationships the subject of the emails she deleted from her private server?</p><p> These questions point to a more basic issue about the role of money in politics. What, exactly, do large corporations get in exchange for their campaign contributions? Ms. Clinton gave 92 speeches between 2013 and 2015 that netted her $21.6 million, including $1.8 million for just 8 speeches to large banks. (CNN provides eye-opening details[6] about her speaking requirements   the $225,000 fee is just the tip of the iceberg.) Ms. Clinton is hardly known for her business acumen; her infamous cattle-futures trades[7] are widely recognized as a political payoff, and her views on corporate governance[8] have been ridiculed by experts. Her opinions on world politics are already in the public domain, so I doubt that Goldman Sachs was getting $200K worth of unique insight into global affairs. <person><nameText>Bill Clinton, </nameText></person>with zero experience in higher-education administration, bagged $17 million[9] to be honorary chancellor of an obscure for-profit university. Why are these companies throwing their money away? Most people assume that campaign contributions, speaking and consulting fees and lucrative board positions for former and future politicians, and similar payments are pure graft, the kinds of pay-to-play arrangements common under crony capitalism. And some of these transfers surely do buy access and even specific policy outcomes. There are several problems with the common assumption, however. First, research on campaign contributions finds that the expected rate of return on these payments is quite high and yet, given the potential gains, the contribution amounts are remarkably small[10]. Second, there is little systematic evidence[11] that policies are, on average, greatly influenced by such contributions, leading some to suggest that this form of payment to politicians and political parties is mainly consumption, not investment.Lobbying as a Defensive Strategy\u00a0A more intriguing finding, however, is that most large companies not only give generously, but about equally to both major parties[12], even when the parties' candidates and representatives differ on particular issues. This suggests that payments to politicians are best understood as a form of insurance. Money in politics provides protection against what Fred McChesney[13] has called 'rent-extraction' by government. For example, before the mid-1990s, the tech industry had a very low profile in Washington   few contributions, no DC headquarters for the big tech companies, and so on. After the Microsoft antitrust trial, this situation was completely reversed, and now tech companies are among the biggest lobbyists in the US[14]. The message was clear: you want to play ball, you pay up   or we shut you down. It's not that companies are necessarily paying for specific outcomes; rather, they are paying for the right to do business at all. As Ludwig von Mises pointed out, doing business in a world of aggressive governmental regulation is tricky. One consequence is to make firms more bureaucratic, by which Mises means less effective at responding to consumer needs in the most efficient manner.The Cost of Compliance with Government RegulationsUnder capitalism, the size, complexity, and strategy of corporations, reflects the decisions of capitalist-entrepreneurs about how best to earn profit, competing freely with each other for resources and consumer patronage. Under interventionism   what we now call crony capitalism   the situation is different. Now companies must employ large staffs of lawyers, accountants, lobbyists, public relations teams, and others who focus not on creating economic value, but on satisfying legal, tax, regulatory, and other government requirements. That large firms are filled with such non-productive employees is not, Mises writes in Human Action[15], 'a phenomenon of the unhampered market economy,' but a result of government policy. In his earlier book Bureaucracy[16], published in 1944, Mises challenges the idea that bureaucracy is a necessary consequence of firm size. 'No pro t-seeking enterprise, no matter how large, is liable to become bureaucratic provided the hands of its management are not tied by government interference. The trend toward bureaucratic rigidity is not inherent in the evolution of business. It is an outcome of government meddling with business.' By this Mises means that government interference impedes the entrepreneur's use of economic calculation and the attempt to use prices to impose managerial discipline. Mises gives three examples: taxes and price regulations that interfere with corporate pro ts (distorting an important signal of employee performance); laws that interfere with hiring and promotion (including the need to hire people to deal with government); and the omnipresent threat of arbitrary antitrust or regulatory activity, in response to which entrepreneurs must become adept at 'diplomacy and bribery.' This is why large companies send millions of dollars to the Clintons and other top politicians in both major parties. A President Hillary Clinton could direct billions to favored companies, and take billions of potential profits away from those that don't 'play the game.' Just as journalists know that tough questions will get them banned from future press conferences, business leaders under crony capitalism know that if they don't contribute, don't hire, don't pay the right people in Washington or Brussels or wherever, they won't be successful. The solution? Take away the ability of government to intervene in economic affairs. Just imagine the popularity of Ms. Clinton on the speaking circuit in a world like that! Peter G.

View original post here[2].Submitted by Peter Klein via The Mises Institute,[3] <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>has been taking heat for her relationship with the Clinton Foundation. Did individuals and firms making large donations to the Foundation, or paying large speaking or consulting fees to <person><nameText>Bill Clinton, </nameText></person>get preferred access to Ms. Clinton as Secretary of State? Is there a revolving door between the Clinton campaign and the Foundation's fundraising staff? Are these relationships the subject of the emails she deleted from her private server? These questions point to a more basic issue about the role of money in politics. </p><p>What, exactly, do large corporations get in exchange for their payments to candidates and current and former government officials? Ms. Clinton gave 92 speeches between 2013 and 2015 that netted her $21.6 million, including $1.8 million for just 8 speeches to large banks. (CNN provides eye-opening details[4] about her speaking requirements \u2014 the $225,000 fee is just the tip of the iceberg.) Ms. Clinton is hardly known for her business acumen; her infamous cattle-futures trades[5] are widely recognized as a political payoff, and her views on corporate governance[6] have been ridiculed by experts. Her opinions on world politics are already in the public domain, so I doubt Goldman Sachs was getting $200K worth of unique insight into global affairs. <person><nameText>Bill Clinton, </nameText></person>with zero experience in higher-education administration, bagged $17 million[7] to be honorary chancellor of an obscure for-profit university. Why are these companies throwing their money away? Most people assume that campaign contributions, speaking and consulting fees and lucrative board positions for former and future politicians, and similar payments are pure graft, the kinds of pay-to-play arrangements common under crony capitalism. And some of these transfers surely do buy access and even specific policy outcomes. There are several problems with the common assumption, however. First, research on campaign contributions finds that the expected rate of return on these payments is quite high and yet, given the potential gains, the contribution amounts are remarkably small[8]. Second, there is little systematic evidence[9] that policies are, on average, greatly influenced by such contributions, leading some to suggest that this form of payment to politicians and political parties is mainly consumption, not investment.Lobbying as a Defensive Strategy\u00a0A more intriguing finding, however, is that most large companies not only give generously, but about equally to both major parties[10], even when the parties' candidates and representatives differ on particular issues. This suggests that payments to politicians are best understood as a form of insurance. Money in politics provides protection against what Fred McChesney[11] has called 'rent-extraction' by government. For example, before the mid-1990s, the tech industry had a very low profile in Washington \u2014 few contributions, no DC headquarters for the big tech companies, and so on. After the Microsoft antitrust trial, this situation was completely reversed, and now tech companies are among the biggest lobbyists in the US[12]. The message was clear: you want to play ball, you pay up \u2014 or we shut you down. It's not that companies are necessarily paying for specific outcomes; rather, they are paying for the right to do business at all. As Ludwig von Mises pointed out, doing business in a world of aggressive governmental regulation is tricky. One consequence is to make firms more bureaucratic, by which Mises means less effective at responding to consumer needs in the most efficient manner.The Cost of Compliance with Government RegulationsUnder capitalism, the size, complexity, and strategy of corporations, reflects the decisions of capitalist-entrepreneurs about how best to earn profit, competing freely with each other for resources and consumer patronage. Under interventionism - what we now call crony capitalism - the situation is different. Now companies must employ large staffs of lawyers, accountants, lobbyists, public relations teams, and others who focus not on creating economic value, but on satisfying legal, tax, regulatory, and other government requirements. That large firms are filled with such non-productive employees is not, Mises writes in Human Action[13], 'a phenomenon of the unhampered market economy,' but a result of government policy. In his earlier book Bureaucracy[14], published in 1944, Mises challenges the idea that bureaucracy is a necessary consequence of firm size. 'No pro?t-seeking enterprise, no matter how large, is liable to become bureaucratic provided the hands of its management are not tied by government interference. The trend toward bureaucratic rigidity is not inherent in the evolution of business. It is an outcome of government meddling with business.' By this Mises means that government interference impedes the entrepreneur's use of economic calculation and the attempt to use prices to impose managerial discipline. Mises gives three examples: taxes and price regulations that interfere with corporate pro?ts (distorting an important signal of employee performance); laws that interfere with hiring and promotion (including the need to hire people to deal with government); and the omnipresent threat of arbitrary antitrust or regulatory activity, in response to which entrepreneurs must become adept at 'diplomacy and bribery.' This is why large companies send millions of dollars to the Clintons and other top politicians in both major parties. A President <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>could direct billions to favored companies, and take billions of potential profits away from those that don't 'play the game.' Just as journalists know that tough questions will get them banned from future press conferences, business leaders under crony capitalism know that if they don't contribute, don't hire, don't pay the right people in Washington or Brussels or wherever, they won't be successful. The solution? Take away the ability of government to intervene in economic affairs. Just imagine the popularity of Ms. Clinton on the speaking circuit in a world like that!

This comes as a commander in chief targets Europe signaling possible  payback over what he called unfair trade policies with the EU.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I've had a lot of problems  with the European Union.  And it may morph into something very big from  that standpoint, from a trade standpoint.  The European Union has treated  the United States very unfairly when it comes to trade.  The European Union  has been very, very unfair to the United States.  It will turn out to be  very much to their detriment.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The president will address the trade debate assaults the United  States economic boom during his first State of the Union address Tuesday  night.  That will be of course live, and we'll take it for you.  The  address comes as a major indices all close at record levels again on  Friday.  Take a look at Friday's performance up 223 points on the Dow, up  almost 1 percent.  26,616, a new record there.  S&amp;P 500 in unchartered  territory with a 33-point rally.  The Nasdaq as well.  </p><p>This morning a bit of a pull back from those numbers futures indicating a  lower open for the broader averages we have about 25 points on the Dow,  down about 18 on the Nasdaq.  We are watching the yield on the benchmark  10-year treasury.  It is as you can see rising, it broke 2.7 percent for  the first time since early 2014 building on Friday's again after the fourth  quarter GDP came out, and that was up 2.6 percent.  Yields on the rise and  stocks lower.</p><p>In Europe this morning, take a look at the indices, as we watch rates  moving higher even if fractionally, FT 100 it is up fraction, quarter of a  percent.  The CAC Quarante and the DAX index all over again fractional move  here.</p><p>In Asia, overnight stocks were mostly lower with the exception of Korea.   As you can see there, the worst performer was China, Shanghai composite  done about one percent.</p><p>Terror strikes in military school in Afghanistan.  The details on the  attack that left 11 dead, over a dozen injured.  And is technology putting  our troops in danger?  The new concern this morning or free fitness app  that is being used on devices like Fitbit better actually tracking our  military.  We will get into it.</p><p>Then Intel's morning over critical security flaws came after it first  flagged the issue to several Chinese businesses including Alibaba.  The  news leaving the United States government with a chip on its shoulder over  Intel.</p><p>Hillary Clinton using the Grammy stage to mock President Trump.  The  appearance that is leaving many feeling fire and fury of their own this  morning.  Although stories coming up this morning.  And joining me to talk  about it fox Business network's  Dagen McDowell.  PwC partner, Mitch Roschelle and Maslansky and Partners  president, Lee Carter.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great to see you.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY AND PARTNERS:  Great to see you welcome  back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Happy to be back.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CO-HOST:  Welcome back.  Amazing work.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, I missed you, it was a really good trip.  I can't  wait to get back here and talk about all the issues of the day we talk  about every morning.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Everything we are fired up about.  Fire and fury.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You were at the Grammys.</p><p>PWC PARTNER, MITCH ROSCHELLE:  I was at the Grammys.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you saw all of the readings of \"Fire and Fury\" up close and  personal.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  I did.  Yes, I was rolling my eyes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't know why they do that or they make an assumption  everybody agrees with them.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  The crowd there definitely did base upon a response.  I was  actually assuming.  My bet was Obama was going to be -- I knew something  was going on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes, that's a good point.  I am surprised Obama wasn't  there actually.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He can't run again.</p><p>CASONE:  I know I think your generally classier than that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, well, Hillary Clinton their reading right from the book.   And Cher as well.  I will get into it, a big night at the Grammys, coming  up this morning former senior advisor to the Clintons, the Stagwell Group,  president and managing partner, Mark Penn is with us this morning.</p><p>Former presidential candidate, Mike Huckabee is here, and Trump for  President senior advisor, Lara Trump making an appearance.  Plus, a Fox  News senior judicial analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano.  And Joy Villa was  at the Grammys last night, singer and songwriter, former Trump Campaign  Advisory Board member, Joy Villa.</p><p>And the COO of Lamborghini America, Alessandro Farmeschi, is joining us  this morning.  We've got some hot wheels on the plaza, don't miss a moment  of it, that's all coming up.  But first this top story this hour and that  is trade, Mexico and Canada now rejecting a proposal by the Trump  administration to rework the corporate arbitration system.  A key part of  the North American Free Trade Agreement also known as NAFTA.  It comes as  the president himself is speaking out an unfair trade practices with the  European Union even hinting at retaliation there.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  I have a lot of problems with the European Union.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You have done business with them.</p><p>TRUMP:  Not a question of doing business, but I will tell you representing  the United States.  It is a very unfair situation.  We cannot get our  product in.  It's very, very tough.   And yet they send their product to us.  No taxes, very little taxes.  Very  unfair.  I have a lot of problems with European Union and it may morph into  something very big from a trade standpoint.  The European Union has treated  the United States very unfairly when it came to trade.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  end of course trade expected to be one of the key elements in  the present state of the union speech tomorrow night, Dagen, I guess  infrastructure is the bigger headline.  And he is not going to withdraw  from NAFTA at the speech.  But were expected from the state of the union  tomorrow night?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  In \"The Wall Street Journal\" the headline about Canada and  Mexico rejecting a proposal which is kind of one of the linchpins in the  renegotiation of NAFTA, about how you handle corporate arbitration.</p><p>We would prefer it that these disputes go through domestic courts but again  this is one huge stumbling block.  I would say that trade in any foul-up  with trade with other nations around the world is one of the three biggest  risks to the market in our economy in the next year.  You have the 11  remaining countries in the Trans Pacific Partnership, which we withdrew  from, cutting a new deal last week, it will be signed in March.  </p><p>The European Union and Japan, the end of last year making giant trade deal  that will reduce scrap duties on cars coming in from Japan to Europe, scrap  duties on cheese and wine being imported into Japan.  This is one of the  great truths that we start cutting ourselves off from the rest of the  world.</p><p>I know that President Trump talks about bad trade deals, but how about some  trade deals.  We need to also deal with NAFTA and also ink that trade deal  with South Korea before we can move ahead with any other bilateral deals  with nations around the world.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, which is why last week, Mitch, there was some worry that  there will be some more to tariffs on solar panels and tariffs on washing  machines.  Maybe aluminum and steel are next and little by little discrete  creates a real trade issue.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  If you look at the GDP numbers that came out last week they  would've been a whole percentage point higher if it wasn't for trade  imbalance.  Obviously, the president is very focused on trade balance and  he campaigned on that, and he is pushing forward to try to make things a  little bit more fear around the planet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's a balance low.  I mean, Lee, the White House says that the  tone of the president's State of the Union message tomorrow night is going  to be one of bipartisanship.  One very forward-looking in terms of his  agenda.  How much of that includes these issues over trade remains to be  seen.</p><p>CARTER:  I think were going to see a lot about trade, immigration, I think  it's going talk about infrastructure, I think you will talk about jobs and  the economy, I think he is going to spend time talking about what he is  most comfortable with.  What I think is going to be notably absent from the  speech, healthcare.  The reason for that is that is a really partisan issue  right now and I think you can see the administration is making a lot of  progress in some of these other negotiations with Democrats on immigration.  </p><p>There was an interview last week with Chuck Schumer where he said he was  willing to talk to the president about these things.  Of course, they get  upset when the terms change, but I think that he is really going to focus  on those issues that are first and foremost in people's minds right now.   But I think it's really interesting that he is not going to be talking  about healthcare.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You would think infrastructure a sort of along both party  lines, and that would be a positive, but there debating over the cost,  right.  According to a new Politico Morning Consult poll, by the way, a  majority of voters want to hear the president talk about healthcare and  economy.  You don't think that is front and center.  You have got to  believe there is a lot on infrastructure though.  Isn't there a lot there  to talk about infrastructure?</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  In theory, and we have been talking about since the election,  infrastructure should be a bipartisan issue that everybody is going to get  behind.  But I don't think anything is bipartisan anymore.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  First it was supposed to be $1 trillion deal, now we are  talking about $1.7 trillion, but we should point out that the federal money  is 200 billion.  The number is largely expected private and public  partnerships.  We'll see.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It remains to be seen how those work out because public-private  partnerships work if it is for say a toll road, where there is revenue  generation from that project.  In terms of just throwing money, I think you  have 2.7 percent could hire on the 10-year yield.  That is related, so  watch tariffs driving up costs.  Watch talk about the weakening dollar  which imports inflation into this country.</p><p>I think the Trump administration, and this is a warning to them.  They need  to be careful of anything in terms of driving up inflation in the United  States borrowing costs at this point, and also how much more money you are  going to borrow after we doubled it out during the last administration.   Those are very, very big concerns because President Trump love talking  about the record breaking run in the stock market.  The one thing that will  throw cold water on it is much higher borrowing costs.  And 2.7, let that  be a warning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You are right, and we already saw a come back from South Korea,  LG comes out last week and says, oh, guess what we are going to raise  prices.  So that was as a result of the tariff.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to say really quickly one thing.  These are companies  like Samsung that have jobs in the United States.  They have a new  appliance plant in South Carolina.  Part of these tariffs on imported parts  above a certain level.  If you try to import parts into this country and  assemble washing machines and create jobs in the nation, the Republican  Governor of South Carolina is very concerned about these tariffs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They have to figure out a way, what's the cost because you  can't keep putting a terror retirement crosses the border, because reports  are coming from different places.  Same issue with autos.  Because the  parts are coming from different places, so you have got to come up with one  tariffs and not have overly done tariffs, if you will.</p><p>More to come on that.  Coming up terrorism strikes a military school in  Afghanistan.  We have got that story, the details on the attack that left  11 people dead.</p><p>Then the dangerous discovery that is putting our soldiers at risk.  A new  report shows the fitness devices are exposing sensitive military locations,  you've got to hear this.  And then Hillary Clinton surprise appearance at  the Grammys, the former presidential candidate's latest jab at the  commander-in-chief.  That is all ahead.  Back in a minute.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back another deadly attack in Afghanistan to report.   Militants reading a military Academy in Kabul.  Cheryl Casone with the  details in headlines.  Cheryl, good morning to you.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN:AM CO-HOST:  Good morning.  Maria, another attack to  talk about there.  At least seven soldiers have been killed, 16 others  wounded.  It was an early morning assault on a military compound in Kabul.   The Islamic State group claiming responsibility in this comes only two days  after more than 100 people were killed in a suicide attack in the afghan  capital.  This month alone, more than 200 people have been killed and  hundreds wounded in a series of attacks unleashed by the Taliban and their  rival, ISIS.</p><p>Meanwhile, this is interesting, a popular fitness app is revealing top- secret information about the location of the U.S.  military bases.  \"The  Washington Post\" reports that the apps draw heatmaps, pinpoint soldier's  workouts near previously undisclosed military bases, and some spy outposts.   This is part of Strava GPS dealer gathering available on smart phones and  yes, the Fitbit.  Which a lot of soldiers wear because it's Fitbit.</p><p>And there is more fallout today from security flaws that Intel found in its  chips.  \"The Wall Street Journal\" reporting that Intel told some Chinese  technology companies about the potential problems but not the U.S.   government.  Security experts say they may have given the Chinese  government a heads up about the flaws known as inspector and meltdown.   Remember those laws allow hackers to access personal data and researchers  say there's no sign the information was ever exploited, shares of Intel Laura new premarket right now more than half a percent.</p><p>Apple reportedly cutting its iPhone 10 production in half in the first  quarter, this is due to disappointing holiday sales in Europe, the U.S.   and China.  Japan's Nikkei is reporting that Apple is lowering its  production targets to 20 million units.  Part of the problem could be  Apple's price tag which starts at $1000.  Remember, guys, the stock took a  hit last week as well.  Shares of Apple trading slightly lower in the  premarket.  Almost half a percent they are reporting by the way later on in  the week, guys.</p><p>And then finally this, the Grammys.  Typically, it is all about music,  right.  Well, he got really political.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Hip-hop, real talk.  That is love, baby.  Jay for  president.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Tonight, in this room full music dreamers, we  remember this  country was built by dreamers, for dreamers chasing the American dream, and  all I know, it is just like dreams, these kids can't be forgotten.  And are  worth fighting for.</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE:  We have a longtime fear of  being poisoned.  One reason why he like to eat at McDonald's.  Nobody knew  he was coming, and the food was tastily made.</p><p>(END OF VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  And we should say United States Ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley,  was not happy about this.  Here's her tweet, she said I always loved the  Grammys, but how artists read the \"Fire and Fury\" book killed it.  Don't  ruin great music with trash, some of us love music without the politics  thrown in it.</p><p>Now back to the music, the big winner of the night was Bruno Mars, he  earned the top three awards, he got album of the year for \"24k Magic\", and  he won 6 Grammys told, singer and songwriter Joy Villa, by the way, wore a  make America great again dress, remember at the Grammys last year.  Well,  she's coming up later on the show you new dressed that she wore last night.   She is getting a lot of buzz, Maria, about her latest outfit.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, her purse said choose life, enter dress was another  extension of that.  So, she is going to join us and talk more about that.   You were the Grammys.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  I was.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us about it.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  It was awesome.  Bruno Mars, he was incredible.  That was  great.  But the highlight for me was Elton John, everybody my generation  was hanging on for Elton John's performance.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he did a duo with Miley Cyrus.  Right before that it's when  you saw the \"Fire and Fury\" book readings, and that's when I turned it off,  although my TV was still on and I did see it.</p><p>Once I saw the readings on \"Fire and Fury\", I was like, OK, that's it, I'm  done.  Did you watch it?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I watched some of it.  This is what we expect, music is  politics.  A lot of these musicians there, and for the last 50 years, the  music has been filled with political statements, so again that is what  you're going to get.  Kendrick Lamar, if he hadn't done what he did and  that opening number which was incredibly powerful, the people would've been  disappointed.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know what though, Bruno Mars did not get political.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But his music isn't political.  It's when a singer starts making  political statements that's out of character.  But U2 again, their entire  career has been tinged with making political statements.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Going into the show, Jay Z it's all about negatives about  President Trump.  The president actually fought back at them on Twitter.</p><p>CARTER:  I think it is interesting now that the new elites are in Grammys,  are in music or entertainment, in the are completely out of touch with the  American public.  In it continues.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Would they have been able to rally votes, Hillary would have  won.</p><p>CARTER:  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  If all the people who listen to their music would have gone out  there and voted, she might have won.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right, they didn't come out.  All right, we will take a  break, when we come back market momentum rages, the Dow, the Nasdaq, the  S&amp;P 500 trading at record highs even we're looking at a fractional pullback  this morning.  What if anything slows things down for going let take a look  at that, the risks.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BENIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID BURROUGHS, MECUM AUCTIONS AUTOMOBILE AUTHENTICATION EXPERT:  It's  about the size of the tip of a ballpoint pen.</p><p>JAMIE COLBY, FBN HOST:  David Burroughs, Mecum Auctions automobile  authentication expert, pinpoints the problem for me.</p><p>BURROUGHS:  So, if you count in 13 of these ribs would be right about in  the center of this little gutter.  </p><p>COLBY:  But it's missing.</p><p>BURROUGHS:  So restored cars could get all sanded off to make it pretty and  shiny, and found that little fingerprint gets obliterated, so that implies  that this car has either been restored or at least something is fishy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was a clip from tonight's all new \"Strange Inheritance\" on  Fox Business Network host Jamie Colby set out for Chicago to meet the son  of a Vietnam vet was left in mint condition Corvette, in joining us right  now, the host of \"Strange Inheritance,\" Jamie Colby.  Jamie, what a great  story, tell us about this.</p><p>COLBY:  What a cliffhanger that was.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  1967 Corvette Stingray.</p><p>COLBY:  And they have a little dimple under the hood that was part of the  original mold.  This car, it was missing.  With the son of this Vietnam  veteran who sent his combat pay home to give him an incentive to come out  alive and make it back, he treated this as well as his five children.  In  the son inherited it and realized he could not divided into three, for his  kids when he passed, so he finally decides to sell it.  But he only wanted  to go to a family that will appreciate story behind it about his father.  </p><p>And Mecum Auctions actually did propose that this car was special, not only  it sold $675,000 but it had incredible military story behind it, and what  an honor for me to pay tribute to our troops by telling the story of this  Vietnam veteran tonight.  But that little divot missing.  It is an  authentication issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  </p><p>COLBY:  You have to watch to find out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will.  It's a great story.  All of these stories are so  fascinating, I want to take a clip of the second episode airing at 9:30  eastern tonight.  What's this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHARLOTTE SMITH, COLLECTOR OF CLOTHES:  I just lost my job.  And I thought  I am actually a two homeowner because my collection actually cost me more  than maintaining my house.</p><p>COLBY:  Charlotte can only afford to keep one.  </p><p>SMITH:  It was awful, but you know what I just thought there is no way I  would inherit a collection like this for no reason.  I made the decision  I'd rather sell my house than my collection.  </p><p>COLBY:  Now, think about that.  First addresses cost her, her shop, next  the cost her, her husband, now for cost her, her house.</p><p>(END OF VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  She's giving everything up except the clothes.</p><p>COLBY:  Here's the amazing thing and we are learning a lot from viewers  writing us, her godmother was a Quaker.  The last fashionista that you  would imagine.  She got $25 from her parents and bought her first dress, in  turn it was out of control.</p><p>3000 dresses that were left to Charlotte Smith who was an antique shop  owner in Australia, and she has one of the most significant and historic  fashion collections. Her husband said, it's me or the clothes, babe.  And she said.  Bye bye.</p><p>And she has made a career, she said this is not just a collection, it is a  calling.  She has written a book on Dior, she has written a book on Chanel,  the collection is priceless we saw it here in New York at Parsons.  And  wait until you see what she's done with it, but a Quaker very unlikely, but  a great story of her and Matt, also the first gentleman who inherited the  Corvette wanted to do the right thing.  Twists and turns tonight, Maria.   If you watch one night of \"Strange Inheritance\" this season, this is it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'll be watching.  Jamie, great show.  Congrats.</p><p>COLBY:  Thank you, Maria, great to see you, don't forget that money  collection you have, the coins and the dollars.  I'm waiting.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I collect currency.  One of these days I'm going to bring it in  and show everybody.  Thank you so much, Jamie Colby there.  Check out  \"Strange Inheritance\" tonight.  </p><p>We had a great week last week, if you missed it, here are some of the top  moments from our program live from the World Economic Forum last week in  Davos, Switzerland.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  In Davos, welcome to this morning's panel.  </p><p>BRIAN MOYNIHAN, CEO, BANK OF AMERICA:  2018 it is going to be a little bit  about United States trying to make itself a bit more competitive, as that  changes the dynamic is going to reverberate a little bit in the world.  And  so, there is an attitude are you here from the administration about free  trade policy has to be fair trade, but that has to settle back to the real  question how do you get those imbalances straightened out.</p><p>TIDJANE THIAM, CEO, CREDIT SUISSE:  We have already portrayed recently  because actually investors in Europe trade grew more slowly than world GDP.   Which was very worrying.  But I remain optimistic, I think we are in an  exceptionally favorable context.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You said that there have always been trade wars, were you  suggesting that the United States is engaging somewhat in a trade war or  this is just the way the people look at it?</p><p>WILBUR ROSS, COMMERCE SECRETARY OF THE UNITED STATES:  What I meant was  this, every time someone violates trade rules that to me is an act of war.   Things are changing, I think they know we are not going to be suckers  anymore.</p><p>STEPHEN SCHWARZMAN, CEO, THE BLACKSTONE GROUP:  Countries outside the  United States are recognizing that the United States competitive posture  has changed quite dramatically.  And we are going to be seeing on  anticipated foreign investment into the United States because we will be  the best of developed market in the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Were you surprised at all to get all of this focus and  questions hammered about your comments that are weaker dollar is good for  trade.</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY OF THE UNITED STATES:  Again,  I am a bit surprises because my comments on the dollar has been completely  consistent going back for a number of years.  The Treasury Secretary has  just kind of commented on strong dollar, strong dollar, strong dollar.  And  again, my perspective is there is a free market, where it is a short-term  is not a concern of ours.</p><p>ELAINE CHAO, TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY:  The transformative nature of  technology in transportation is very exciting.  But it also cautions us to  address issues about safety, security, accessibility and also privacy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How soon before we see driverless cars on the road as the norm?  </p><p>CHAO:  I think it will come not as fast as some people say, but sooner than  many expect.  </p><p>GINNI ROMETTY, CEO, IBM:  I wish it wasn't called artificial intelligence,  Augmented intelligence.  That it is really going to propel the world  forward.  I think this is a really important inflection point in time for  companies but for the tech industry, society at large.  This idea that it  is our job to steward in these new technologies and guide them safely into  the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I've got to get your take on the employment situation right  now.  Because there is this whole debate about DACA.</p><p>BILL GATES, FOUNDER, MICROSOFT:  We got the country and immigrants.  We are  very lucky country where lots of highly energetic and talented people want  to come to our country.  I certainly believe that we should all want them  to stay and contribute.  We could get the Dreamers, solve them, we could  look at immigration more broadly.</p><p>KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY:  America first is not  America alone.  We need a partner.  You know, as I've said earlier, not one  of us has the ability to do this alone.  So we need to partner with private  sector, we need to partner with our allies.</p><p>RANIA AL ABDULLAH, QUEEN CONSORT OF JORDAN:  America being great again, it  comes from America engaging with the rest of the world and sharing its --  the principles that it represents.  I'm looking forward to seeing how the  United States will continue to set the -- to be the moral authority and  leader in the world.</p><p>RICK PERRY, SECRETARY, U.S. ENERGY:  You have to understand what America  first means to the president of the administration and it's really pretty  simple from my perspective.  This is about America being competitive around  the globe when folks are thinking about where you want to buy your energy  from, where do you want that next load of L&amp;G to come from.  We want you to  think about America, first.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Welcome back, good Monday  morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, it  is Monday, January 29th, your top stories right now 6:30 on the East Coast.  </p><p>One day away, President Trump's first State of the Union Address, this  Tuesday night, he's expected to bring up the booming economy, the soaring  market and an infrastructure plan.  We will have full coverage, live, from  our nation's capital, tomorrow and Wednesday, right here.  </p><p>And meanwhile, take a look at markets pulling back from another record- setter on Friday.  Futures pointing to weakness to kick off the week, as  interest rates move higher.  Dow Industrials now down 40 points.  Investors  are watching a very busy week.  It is the busiest week for fourth quarter  earnings.  For example, take a look at rates right here, 2.72 percent up 5  basis points.  </p><p>And we've got a slew of economic data leading up to the monthly job's  report on Friday, we've got the FOMC meeting and, of course, the State of  the Union, so yes, it is a very busy week for markets.  We are watching  yields and rates move higher, the 10-year treasury topping 2.7 percent,  first time receiving this level since 2014.  This after the major indices  closed at record highs on Friday due to strong corporate earnings that's  really been leading this market, Dow Industrials at 26,616, NASDAQ at 7505.  </p><p>Global action this morning, a little weaker, in Europe, mixed performances,  you've gor the FT 100 up a quarter of a percent, and the CAC Quarante up  fractionally but the DAX Index in Germany is lower by a fraction.  In Asia  overnight, markets closed mostly lower with the exception of Korea, the  KOSPI Index up almost one percent.  </p><p>Closer look at earnings this morning, a third of the Dow and more than 100  S&amp;P 500 companies will report this week.  On tap today, Lockheed Martin, we  will bring you the numbers as soon as they hit the tape.  These defense  contractors have been soaring in the last week and there's a chart just in  the last three months of Lockheed Martin.  </p><p>Our top story this half an hour, the red-hot start to 2018, markets have  only gained momentum through January building on last year's historic  rally.  Since January 1st, the Dow Industrials has seen 11 record closes,  the NASDAQ, 13 record closes and the S&amp;P 500 has seen its biggest gains in  more than 30 years with these markets up from the start of trading, not the  mention since the election.  Joining us right now SkyBridge Capital Senior  Portfolio Manager, Troy Gayeski, Troy, good to see you.</p><p>TROY GAYESKI, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, SKYBRIDGE CAPITAL:  Good to see you  too, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What takes this market off track?</p><p>GAYESKI:  Well, you know, this week, we're going to test the week with  rates backing up, so, you know, our opinion would be the rate move so far  as confirmation of better economic growth, better earnings, a rotation out  of bonds and to equities.  But you start seeing the 10-year approach, 2.8,  2.9 that would certainly decelerate the rate of gains at least, and maybe  cause a longer consolidation period.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen, what's the magic number?  I mean, when do investors go  out and say, OK, I can get a better deal if i put money in treasuries  because interest rates are at this level, I'm going the take my risk out  and take the money out of stocks?  Do you have a magic number?</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Since the financial crisis,  it's been pretty close to the yield that we see right now that when you get  a sustained move above 2 1/2 percent, this is the highest, 2.7 percent is  the highest we've seen the 10-year yield in four years.  </p><p>So this is always been -- but, again, this was in a very slow-growth  environment where the U.S. economy never grew in any one calendar year,  three -- even three percent since 2005, I think.  So it's more than a  decade.  There's -- I think that when you start to get closer to three  percent that that is danger zone at least in the short run.</p><p>GAYESKI: Yes, which should cause a pause, again, when you think about the  gains we've had, since the election last year, and in the la six weeks,  they've been historic.  So, you know, one of the justifications for the  strength of bull market has been how low rates were and how there's an  alternative, but now you have rates backing up, again, you get around,  three or above, that's when you could have at least a mild correction, but  by mild, several percent, not five, six, seven or eight.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC:  Troy, one of the things that I also worry  about is this, sort of, strategy around depressing the value of the  dollars, while it's good for corporate profits and multinationals, it may  not be good for our economy.  What are your thoughts on the cheap dollar  strategy?</p><p>GAYESKI:  Well, that's back to the capital flows argument, whether there's  enough inflows to fund their budget deficit but also to keep equities  trending higher.  And look -- I think -- you know, we are talking about  (INAUDIBLE) the comments that Mnuchin made, and those comments only weaken  the dollar buy a percent, percent and a half.  </p><p>I mean, in the big picture, don't forget the dollar had tremendous gains in  2013, '14 and early '15, since then, it's been weakness, in fact, the  dollar is actually weaker now than prior to when the fed first hiked back  in 2015.  So, you know, we don't want to get in a trade war.  </p><p>We don't want to see the dollar decline by five, six, seven, eight percent  from here, because that would start to set off, you know, concerns about  inflation.  But in the meanwhile, it's just trading weaker in a relatively  sustained range, so we don't see it as a huge threat right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know what?  I want to get your take on whether or not to  put money into this market right now or to take money out.</p><p>GAYESKI:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But first, let's give some context on the backdrop because  Blackstone Group Chairman and CEO and co-founder, Stephen Schwarzman, told  us about the next fundraising cycle for the Blackstone Group, listen to  what he had to say in the future of his business.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEPHEN SCHWARZMAN, CHAIRMAN AND CEO OF BLACKSTONE GROUP:  We started out  just doing the highest return-type of investing, in real estate, it's  called opportunity fund investing, in private equity.  It's like normal  private equity.  And those returns, sort of, have ended up close being to  20 percent after fees --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Every year.</p><p>SCHWARZMAN:  which is every year and this is in pre-fees, of course, you  know, just really pretty amazing, and what happened is that we've done that  and now we've discovered some interesting things, that there are investors  who don't necessarily want those types of returns.  </p><p>They are much more comfortable and are looking for returns in 11, 12, 13- type of area for different types of things, some as private equity that  compounds over the long-term, you don't sell it after four or five years,  you can hold it for 10 or 20, and some in the real estate area.  </p><p>There are also mezzanine securities that can get you in that type of area.   So what's happening is we are now developing products and aggressively  expanding in that 11 to 13 to 14 range.  Now, there's a lot more to do  there because it's easier to have lower returns if you're used to  manufacturing very high returns.  </p><p>So we continue to do the high-return business but all of the sudden, we've  got a much bigger potential market in these other lower returns and still,  there are people in the lower-rate environment who are quite happy making  seven, eight, nine, because they're exceeding what they need for pension  funds and other pools of capital.  And if you can do that in a secure way,  that market is even bigger.  So, what's happening is we used to just be at  the top and now we're addressing a pyramid, and it keeps getting bigger as  we go down.  And we develop those products, and then we take them around  the world.  So, Blackstone is going to be experiencing, I believe, a period  of very substantial growth for a very long time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They are about to go on a fundraising move, they're going to  raise $200 billion.  An incredible number.</p><p>GAYESKI:  It's remarkable.  Yes, remarkable firm, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>GAYESKI:  And, oh, back to the question you were going to ask, I mean, one  of the challenges for investors right now is, you know, equities have done  fantastically well, there's some nervousness creeping in and volatility has  been exceptionally low.  Everybody knows that, you know, this economic boom  won't continue forever and they'll be a correction, or at least a bear  market or mild correction.  So, where else are they going to put their  capital?  And back to the point on bonds, I mean, bonds, you're looking at  -1, -2 to up 1.  So, part of the growth for firms like Blackstones or  alternatives in general, how do you make, you know, a high single digit  return that's at least competitive with equities but has far less downside  in the event of the ultimate bear market.  So, you know, we're seeing some  people start to peel money off from equities.  For the last two years,  investors have been peeling money out of bonds, and that came alternatives  that way.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, would you put new money to work in stocks right here or  not?</p><p>GAYESKI:  Well, look, I mean, $600 billion has saved the year by consumers  has got to go somewhere, so you should continue to follow your asset  allocation.  I don't think you want to be hyper overweight stocks right  now.  You made good money, you have to be realistic, you're looking at low  to high single digits the next 12 months given where multiples are.  So,  you know, right now, we're advocating the clients, just take a little bit  of money off the table and allocate to alternatives.  And that way, you'll  have less downside when the ultimate correction comes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I've got to tell you, even though there's feeling of  complacency, worries about higher rates which you point out, worries about  inflation at some point, I could not find one person to say take money out  of the market in 2018.</p><p>GAYESKI:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because they think that the tax plan is going to have legs for  this year, that we're still going to see another good market.  I don't know  what that means and if it's a contrary indicator, but I can't find anybody  to say short this market in '18.</p><p>GAYESKI:  Yes, some of those people were also saying, if Trump got elected,  the market would collapse. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, good point.</p><p>GAYESKI:  So, I don't know how much you would them as future indicators  here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.</p><p>GAYESKI:  Great to see you.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great to see you, Troy, Troy Gayeski.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  To get a sense of the runway for telecom across  the world, this next company proves it, connecting emerging markets,  Channel I.T. helps under-developed regions for providing micro finance  lending solutions to mobile network subscribers.  I caught up with the  Chairman and CEO of Channel I.T. in Davos, Bassim Haidar, at the World  Economic Forum about business today in the emerging markets and how it's  opening up a whole new opportunity.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p>BASSIM HAIDER, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, CHANNEL I.T.:  We're emerging market  business and we're creating product that have a lot of pull, so customers  need the products.  We're not trying to push something onto someone they  you don't need.  When you have 2.5 billion people in emerging markets that  are unbanked, simply providing them a way into banking or into loans, or  into the financial systems, empowers them and allows us to actually sell  and cross sell more services.  So, take for example, we just launched in  Pakistan a mobile financial service.  The uptake has what we're supposed to  do in the first six months.  We've done already in one month after launch.   So, it just tells you that because all this lack of infrastructure lack of  focus from the very big global players, the cost of acquisition of  customers to bring them into the banking sector of small loans is very  high.  We do it via technology, via big data.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, tell me about that.  How do you connect the dots from  telecom services to micro finance lending?  </p><p>HAIDER:  So, basically for more than 25 years since GSM is out there,  there's been a huge amount of data gathered by the telcos.  This data was  never really used.  It was just dumped onto service and was never ever used  to say how do we understand these customers?  In a country where you have  no data on the consumer, the only way you can reach them is via their  behavior and usage of their mobile phones.  And the amount of data you can  actually get from that almost exceeds what you got on Twitter, for example,  and therefore taking that data, making sense out of it, scoring these  customers, and then, say, we're going to provide loans, services, we're  going to provide you content, digital content that you've never had access  to.  We do, for example, onto our big services today is we provide loans  for customers to go from a simple feature form onto a smartphone.  Can you  imagine what that brings to them?  It brings the whole world.  In countries  where you have no electricity, watching videos and getting onto YouTube,  and Facebook, and social media via your phone and enable you to do this at  any time anywhere is a very powerful proposition?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what kind of growth are you expecting in the coming years?  </p><p>HAIDAR:  This year, 60 percent growth.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow!  60 percent.  </p><p>HAIDAR:  60 percent growth in our business.  We closed the year with about  400 million people interacting with our platform this year.  We honestly  believe we're going to finish more than 620 million people interacting with  our platform by the end of this year, and it's already in sight -- we can  already see it happening the way we're growing.  So, we're probably going  to hit, probably, a billion in the next two years -- users in our  platforms.  </p><p>Geopolitical events don't affect us as much as I was saying earlier,  because even though when economies are affected, we're not even affected as  much.  I think the biggest concern for us is the lack of regulation in what  we're doing today, and perhaps maybe too much regulation coming in which  would slow down what we're doing, because it's a gray area; it sits between  the banking, the telco regulators, and so on.  So, it's an area we're  constantly watching and working very closely with the regulators on the  ground, trying to put laws actually in places.  </p><p>In Bangladesh, for example, there are no laws against -- or with -- for  data usage.  So, when we've met government officials, they're saying, OK,  we need to understand this a bit more and how it works and what it means  for us.  So, passing laws is even, for us, a big issue because then we  can't actually grow in that market because, you know, you're not sure  what's going to happen down the road.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  My thanks to Bassim Haidar for joining us.  We'll be right  back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Music's big night last night.  The Grammy's going into the  show.  I was able to catch with Will.i.am, he's the founder of I Am Plus,  the CEO of the foundation, will.i.am, in Davos last week where we spoke  everything from A.I. to new music.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The last time we talked, you were really lifting up the  neighborhood that you grew up in -- trying to inspire young people when it  comes to science and technology, how's that going?  </p><p>WILLIAM JAMES ADAMS, FOUNDER OF I AM PLUS AND CEO OF WILL.I.AM FOUNDATION:   It's going great and it's the reason why I started I Am Plus, because if  I'm going to inner cities and telling kids that they should apply  themselves down the path of science, technology, engineering, and  mathematics.  And then I go off, and, you know, go on stage, they're going  to look at me sideways, like, Will, you know, I want to do music like you.   So, I'm like, no, you want to do tech like me.  Like, this is the way not  out of the ghetto, but to change the ghetto forever.  </p><p>Since then, you know, the company that I have, we went from, you know, when  I acquired a company out of Bangla, India after we sold beats to Apple, we  were 40 employees.  Now, we're 300 employees across six different locations  around world.  We raised $117 million.  Our A.I., voice operating system is  being used by (INAUDIBLE 54:19) telecom to improve customer service,  working alongside customer service agents, so they have A.I. to augment and  enhance experience.  So, that's really exciting.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's the next big thing?  I know you're working a lot on  artificial intelligence, where is that leading you?  </p><p>ADAMS:  So, A.I. is the next big frontier.  Right now, your iPhone is the  Internet phone and there's a bunch of Internet devices.  A.I. devices are  around the corner.  We're about to deploy ours, shortly, this year, and  really excited for our launch.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you worry that A.I. and all this machine learning that we're  talking about is leading to a loss of jobs for people?  I mean, we're  really going high-tech here in terms of machines.  </p><p>ADAMS:  Imagine it's 1918 and your family were candle stick makers, and  they've been making it for years, thousands of years -- because candles  been around forever, and lanterns, and then Nikola Tesla and Edison are  fooling around with lights.  Imagine the fear of how many jobs it's going  to replace, but just look at how many jobs it created.  Imagine you were  horse and buggy, and you made buggies and you made equipment for the farm  in 1918.  And then, Hemi Ford came around with an automobile.  Imagine how  many people were afraid of how many jobs are going to be replaced, but look  how many jobs it created.  The same is going to happen with artificial  intelligence.  We just can't imagine the jobs yet -- and the jobs are going  to come from folks that have been left behind.  When you encourage kids and  educate them around these skill sets, they will create jobs.  Co</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There's a lot of conversation here in Davos about France, about  Europe coming back economically.  Will 2018 be the year of France, the  U.S., Europe, Asia?  What do you think? </p><p>ADAMS:  My eye is on 2030.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK, why?  </p><p>ADAMS:  Because, that's when my kids will be old enough to create jobs.   The ones that I'm focused on right now, 9-year-olds, right?  So, 2030 --  I'm looking further.  I'm committed further.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you going to go to the Grammy's this year?  </p><p>ADAMS:  I'm committed further.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You don't want to talk about the Grammy's?  </p><p>ADAMS:  That was the past.  I think that was like, 20 to 40 --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean, you have enough Grammy's under your belt to  basically do what you want.  </p><p>ADAMS:  Speaking of Grammy's people are going to get up there this year and  thank everybody and their mom and ignore Edison, who's responsible for the  grammaphone which is our Grammy award.  We forget the sciences, we forget  the innovators and the inventors.  We thank everybody, God, except for the  folks that are responsible for the innovation and bringing it to life.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will.i.am, thank you so much for joining us.

Thank you so much.  </p><p>CARTER:  I know.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Missed you -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Missed you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- a whole bunch of bunch.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have a lot to talk about this morning with the State of the  Union tomorrow night.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNERS:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Big headlines.</p><p>CARTER:  There are some big headlines.  I really think that this State of  the Union address, if his Friday speech in Davos is any indication of his  tone, his mood I think it's going to be a great one.  I think he's really  going to be focused on the American people.  I think a lot of people are  expecting him to be very, very braggadocious but I think he's really going  to turn it back and say look at the American people, look how you're  benefitting.  I'm here to fight for you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And look at the performance.  You liked the Davos speech.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I thought it was very optimistic and it was about what his  policies are doing for everyday Americans.  And it really -- it gave me  that sense of lift and of optimism.  And it wasn't about President Trump's  stock market rally.  It was about the big beautiful waterfall of the bonus  checks that come from the tax reform play and that they didn't anticipate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We tried to explain that to E.U. leader Philip Jennings on  Friday, you and I.  I don't know -- it went over his head.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I thought about that all weekend long because when you have  union leaders, they talk about workers as if the people who aren't in  unions don't work for a living.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Their jobs are not relevant, how hard they work is not relevant.   That's where that really stuck in my neck.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We were good with him.  I'll also say that.</p><p>We've got a big show this morning, coming up.  Joining the conversation:  former presidential candidate and former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee is  with us.  Trump for President senior adviser and Erick Trump's wife Lara  Trump is here.  Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano.   And singer and songwriter who made waves with her \"make America great\"  dress at the Grammys last year Joy Villa will join us as well.  Plus the  COO of Lamborghini America Alessandro Farmeschi is here with some hot  wheels on the Plaza.  Don't miss a moment of it.</p><p>And let's kick it off right here in Washington.  Countdown to the State of  the Union.  President Trump's inaugural State of the Union address is  expected to focus on the economy, on infrastructure, trade, national  security and immigration.</p><p>House minority leader Nancy Pelosi has already dismissed the commander-in- chief's immigration plan as a way to make America white again ahead of the  address.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  That plan is a campaign  to make America white again.</p><p>SENATOR JOE MANCHIN (D), WEST VIRGINIA:  We don't need that type of  rhetoric on either side from Nancy, Paul Ryan or anybody else.  And I come  down this -- the President has laid out a template.  We're going to look at  that template and we're going to work with it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now from Washington is former senior adviser  to the Clinton, Stagwell Group president, managing partner and \"Microtrends  Squared\" author Mark Penn.  Mark -- good to see you.</p><p>MARK PENN, PRESIDENT, STAGWELL GROUP:  Good morning.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you've worked on six State of the Union speeches.  What do  you want to hear or expect to hear from President Trump tomorrow night.</p><p>PENN:  Well, remember the State of the Union speech is sort of the Super  Bowl of American politics.  You've got 45 million to 60 million people who  tune in.  and it's a chance not to really reinforce the base but the  President really has to reach out to those people.  You know, he's got  favorable personal approval ratings, 42 to 44.  He's got to reach out to  the next six or 10 percent of people with the speech otherwise it's not  going to do his presidency any good at all.</p><p>So I think he's got to definitely go ahead and reinforce his record.  He's  got to reach out, I think, with those people who don't like him to show  that he's not as reckless as they think particularly on foreign affairs.   And he's got to show that he's ready for bipartisan compromise on his  issues.</p><p>Those are the goals.  And he's got to then not kill his message with tweets  or talk anything about investigations.</p><p>CARTER:  Mark -- I'll agree with you on him not killing his message with  tweets.  But I do have a question.  I know you're saying the point of this  is to reach across the aisle and get more people on board with his message.   But traditionally we've seen that State of the Union addresses don't really  have that much impact on public opinion.</p><p>Do you think this president could be different because his approval ratings  are low?</p><p>PENN:  Well, I started with President Clinton in '96, we had a tremendous  impact and I think laying down a marker like the era of big government is  over had tremendous effect.  So I disagree.  I think most of them don't  have much effect because they are consistent with everything that the  President has done.</p><p>I think people are looking to see after a year in the presidency has Trump  matured in a way that he can show.  I think that was sort of the point of  Davos.  Or is he the Trump that people really, really don't like because  he's too reckless, too divisive.  And no matter how good the economy is if  he doesn't overcome being reckless and divisive he can't get their support.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mark -- it's Dagen McDowell.  Is the President though in his  message actually helped by the negativity that you hear from some of the  Democratic leaders?  The tsk-tsk-tsk finger-wagging of Nancy Pelosi talking  about these bonuses as pathetic crumbs for the little people.  And the  little pieces of cheese that people have gotten from big corporations.</p><p>I think that that really plays into the President's hands because it shows  a complete disconnect.  And as you pointed out the Democrats keep talking  down the economy rather than trying to lift it up.</p><p>PENN:  Well look, I thought it was fascinating that Manchin came out and  actually took Pelosi on.  It's the first time I've seen that.  It suggests  he's running for reelection in West Virginia and he means it.  I think --  look, I don't think the Democratic comments are neither here nor there.  I  think they see themselves as an opposition party when it comes to these  issues and I think they've successfully challenged Trump on healthcare and  questioned his legitimacy as a president.</p><p>And I think in -- you know, he's got to really give his response here that  he is working as President, that he is working on behalf of people, that he  is improving the economy.  And that's what the battle is all about.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wait a second -- I've got to follow up here because don't you  think that there is going to be some blowback here, the fact that not just  is Nancy Pelosi out calling it crumbs and Armageddon but we are actually  seeing the impact of it.</p><p>And you're seeing company after company -- 200 plus, give out thousand- dollar bonus checks.  You're seeing companies say, ok, we're going to earn  much more than we thought so we're going to cut prices, we're going to  invest in our business.</p><p>I mean at some point will the American people want answers to the fact that  Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats in general did not vote for the tax plan.   They voted no.  And they shut the government down.</p><p>I mean to you think people are going to say we're going to want answers  going into November.  Isn't this going to bite them for being resist,  resist and not having a plan of their own.</p><p>PENN:  Well, what we've seen in our polling is that attitudes are towards  the economy and optimism about it moved up about 5 percent in the last  month.  Attitudes towards the tax plan only about a third were for it when  it passed, moved to 47 percent.</p><p>So we've seen a lot of movement in that.  I think Trump's going to have an  opportunity to try to push that further.  Look, I agree.  I always thought  that some of the Democrats particularly those in Republican states  should've voted for the tax measure and the tax measure is going to play  likely to the advantage of the Republicans.</p><p>But healthcare really is now the number one issue.  Remember, when you  solve a problem, the American public doesn't look back, they look forward.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>PENN:  Overwhelmingly healthcare is the number one issue and that's where  Democrats have a big edge.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It will be interesting to see what's more important going into  the November midterms.  Is it healthcare?  Is it the more money in people's  pockets.</p><p>We've got to ask you about the Grammys.  What did you think of what  happened last night getting political again.  Former presidential candidate  Hillary Clinton making a surprise appearance in a skit that took a jab at  the President at the awards show last night reading from an excerpt from  Michael Wolff's \"Fire and Fury\" book.</p><p>Watch this -- Mark.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLINTON:  He had a longtime fear of being poisoned.  One reason why he  likes to eat at McDonald's.  Nobody knew he was coming and the food was  safely pre-made.</p><p>CORDEN:  That's it -- we've got it.  That's the one.</p><p>CLINTON:  You think so?</p><p>CORDEN:  Oh yes.</p><p>CLINTON:  The Grammy's in the bag.</p><p>CORDEN:  In the bag.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So Mark -- there's that.  And then there's this -- more  controversy because Hillary Clinton is facing some backlash this morning  after posting a video which thanked feminists for their activism.  Warning  to viewers -- the following video contains graphic language.  Listen to  this -- Mark.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLINTON:  Let me just say this is directed to the activist bitches  supporting bitches.  So let's go.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What did you think of that -- Mark.</p><p>PENN:  Look, I think that, as you could see the crowd -- the crowd loved  Hillary there.  And I think that she has been consistent, you know, in the  opposition that she has expressed to Trump and the belief that the election  was unfair.</p><p>Look, I suggest that I'm really at a loss to understand why the networks  let their award shows devolve into political shows.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I certainly agree with you.</p><p>PENN:  I think the American public likes political combat.  There is no  problem seeing Trump and Hillary go at it.  But the question is where.</p><p>And I just am at a loss to understand why networks think they're going to  get a bigger viewership if they let these shows devolve into political or,  you know, late night comedy shows.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's not just that though.  It's the other one -- the  video that she posted.  I don't know.  What did you think?</p><p>You are a message person and you know how things resonate.</p><p>CARTER:  Yes.  No -- well, I think it's just going to reinforce her base.   I don't think it's going to do anything.</p><p>I mean most candidates sort of go away in to the sunset after a loss.  She  is not letting it go.  But neither are the American people who voted for  her.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And what was on -- </p><p>CARTER:  And I think she's just hanging on -- hanging on to relevance.  We  think it's what you're saying -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mark -- you say she's upset about the election was unfair.   What do you mean?  What was unfair?</p><p>PENN:  Well look, I -- look, she wrote an entire book on that so I'm not  going to review it.  I think she's not running for anything.  So I think  she feels freed from having to go out and get votes and say exactly what  she thinks.  And I think she was right to take a plum opportunity like that  at the Grammy shows.</p><p>My question is whether the networks really want to turn every hour of every  minute into a political show.</p><p>CARTER:  So my question to you, Mark, though is if you think that these  kinds of award shows and these statements by artist had any sway on public  opinion and support of Democrats.</p><p>PENN:  No.  I mean I don't really think they do.  I think people know where  Hollywood stands.  I think -- look a lot of people question Hollywood,  question the morality of Hollywood.  After all Weinstein was Hollywood's  leader.</p><p>So I think they understand that and think that they're almost somewhat  puzzled by that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  A Hollywood leader who was notorious for his poor  treatment of women that they basically covered up for -- for almost 40  years -- Mark.  I just want to point that out.</p><p>PENN:  You're not going to get any disagreement from me on that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, absolute.</p><p>All right.  Mark -- good to see you, sir.  Thanks so much.</p><p>PENN:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mark Penn joining us.</p><p>Coming up, hackers hitting the jackpot -- get this, the world's largest ATM  makers are warning of a new heist to make the machines spit out cash like a  slot machine.  Why the attacks could get worse in the United States.  We've  got all the details and what to know.</p><p>Then new proof that Elon Musk is the highest name in technology.  The Tesla  co-founder now is selling flame throwers -- why his underground drilling  company is selling the dangerous new gadget.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>The United States Secret Service targeting a new type of bank robbery.  </p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details.  And this is a scary one -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  It's crazy -- Maria.</p><p>It is called jackpotting.  So get this -- criminals insert a wire into an  ATM using a medical scope.  Then they attach their laptop to it and then  they upload a virus into it.  This causes the ATM to spew cash out at a  rate of 40 bills every 23 seconds.  A group of thieves have already stolen  more than a million dollars here in the United States.  The Secret Service  has sent a warning to banks about these thieves.  This particular strain of  malware first spotted in Mexico back in 2013.  It's said to be very  sophisticated.</p><p>Well, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, has fined three  major European banks millions of dollars each for manipulation of the U.S.  futures market.  Reuters reporting the lenders are UBS, HSBC and Deutsche  Bank.  The banks were accused of spoofing where a buy or sell order is put  in on the futures contract but it's canceled right before the trade is  executed, hence its manipulation.  This is a criminal offense.</p><p>The fine is handed out after a multi-agency investigation that involves the  Justice Department and the FBI.  According to Reuters, we should say UBS  self-reported the manipulation they found within their own bank.  Shares of  UBS, we should say also up about 24 percent from a year ago.</p><p>Well, the long awaited Aramco IPO is going to have to wait a little bit  longer.  The hold-up appears to be that Saudi Arabia's state owned oil  producer isn't sure where to list.  \"Wall Street Journal\" says the crown  prince Muhammad bin Salman prefers the New York Stock Exchange but advisers  won.  And that could expose the Kingdom to lawsuits where shareholders are  9/11 victims.</p><p>Maria, of course -- Maria spoke to the crown prince back in October about  the future of oil.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MUHAMMAD BIN SALMAN, CROWN PRINCE OF SAUDI ARABIA:  Like we know the demand  is not only in energy.  Many of the other sectors use oil like the two  chemicals and many other sectors.  We believe that the demand for energy  increase dramatically in or the future.  So we don't think that it will  decrease the demand for oil.  It will increase between 230 to 240 -- 2030  to 2040.  And it will not immediately collapse.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Meanwhile shares of Prince Al Waleed's kingdom holding are  bouncing back this morning following the prince's release as part of a  government crackdown on corruption last year.  The stock has risen 15  percent since the Prince was allowed to leave the Ritz Carlton Hotel in  Riyadh on Saturday.  He and several other hundred people were, of course,  held here.  The Prince was set free after reaching a settlement with the  government ending the three month detention -- Maria.  You spoke with  Prince al Waleed over the weekend, we understand.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I did actually and he sounded good.  I spoke with him on  Saturday.  He had been home about.  And he said he wasn't mistreated.  He  stayed in the same suite and the Ritz Carlton was never moved to a high  security prison.  And he said that there were no charges and no money paid.  </p><p>Now, this is pretty extraordinary given the fact that we've seen other  princes and other royals having to give up part of their fortune.  And in  fact Prince Al Waleed told me in no uncertain words there is absolutely no  charges and there is no money being paid and he will keep control of  kingdom holdings.</p><p>It's extraordinary that he was able to do this.  He really held his ground.   And he says he agrees with the Crown Prince, what he's doing.  And he  supports the crown prince.  Obviously what is he going to say.  But he has  been in prison quote-unquote since early November and said that it was  never a high security prison and that he's fine.</p><p>I mean the pictures of him, I saw a picture of him in my mind.  He looked  obviously quite haggard but he said that in his suite at the Four Seasons  in Riyadh.  He had the meals that he wanted.  He was not mistreated.  What  else is he going to say, I guess?  I mean, you know.</p><p>CARTER:  Right.  I mean if you're going to be held it's not a place to be  held.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But there was no money charged.  It's extraordinary to me that  he did not have to give up any money or any power of his firms.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Maria -- after a week of incredible interviews, again, you're  still just -- we're in, working the phone.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I was texting on the plane when I knew that he was actually  home.  So I texted and everybody here at Fox said look I know and I can  confirm that Prince al Waleed is home.  He's been home for two hours.</p><p>And then by the time I e-mailed to everybody I texted.  But then I sent a  follow-up e-mail but then it was out.  I mean everybody knew that he had  gone home.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No one works harder than you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It was a big deal.  It was a big deal, I think because he's  sort of the face of the Mideast as it relates to the west.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he has made so much money so people will say what did he  do?  Why is he still in prison?  No doubt that was a little pressure on the  Crown Prince.  So it's fascinating.</p><p>Coming up, the Eagles have landed.

The Eagles have been underdogs this entire postseason but a lot  of money in Vegas going on Philly, the point-spread down from Patriots  minus 5.5 to Pats minus 4.5.</p><p>So the Eagles have landed and the Patriots will land today.  They held one  final practice in Foxboro, Mass yesterday.  Twelve stitches removed from  Tom Brady's hand.  Rob Gronkowski back in in practice from his concussion.

Here's what House Judiciary Chairman, Congressman  Bob Goodlatte told me this Sunday on SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R-VA), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  He should  continue his investigation but it has to be done with propriety and it has  to be done with impartiality and there are a lot of questions that are not  answered at this point.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be following that.</p><p>Meanwhile Futures worsening right now, peak in (ph), pointing to weakness  at the start of trading, this is a low of the morning right here, Dow  Industrials down 60 points, a quarter of a percent; the NASDAQ down 25, a  third of a percent.</p><p>Lockheed Martin earnings just hit the tape and they are there better than  expected, the stock is up 2 1/2 percent.</p><p>The market moves to watch is interest rates and the - and bonds, the yield  on the 10-Year Treasury topping 2.7 percent for the first time since 2014,  that's one of the reasons that markets are having some trouble this  morning; there's the yield on the 10-year at 2.72 percent up five basis  points.</p><p>All this after another record-setter on Friday, strong corporate earnings  led the market then and as you see the Dow Industrials gained another 200  points, up almost one percent; the S&amp;P was up better than one percent; as  was the NASDAQ as at 1 1/4 percent, 95 points higher, that's on Friday.</p><p>This morning, pulling back, global markets are also mixed.  Take a look,  European indices are pretty much mixed, FT 100 up 15; CAC krone up just two  points; but the DAX Index in Germany down, a fraction, 18 points lower.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets closed mostly lower with the exception of Korea,  KOSPI Index up almost one percent.</p><p>Earnings in focus this morning, the busiest week of fourth-quarter earnings  season has begun and that is this week.</p><p>Lockheed Martin kicks things off with earnings which beat analysts'  expectations both on earnings and revenues as you can see, the stock is up  almost four percent right here on Lockheed Martin, that's after a great  year by the way of these Defense contracts just simply rallying.

HAROLD WATSON \"TREY\" GOWDY III (R-SC), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE  COMMITTEE:  If you think your viewers want to know whether or not the  dossier was used in court proceedings, whether or not it was vetted before  it was used, whether or not it has ever been vetted, if you're interested  in who paid for the dossier, if you're interested in Christopher Steele's  relationship with Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee,  then yes, you'll want the memo to come out.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, interesting questions there, FOX NEWS Senior Judicial  Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano joins us right now.</p><p>Do you agree Judge?</p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  I basically -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - good morning to you?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  - do agree but very interesting the manner in which he  answered Chris Wallace's question, is basically a summary of what's in the  dossier.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Now how does he know what's in there, he is one of the three  people that wrote it so it is -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Who read it.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  - 'wrote' it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  It is basically a four-page summary of hundreds and hundreds  of pages of raw intelligence data.</p><p>Last week at this time I was furious because we learned that the House  Intelligence Committee was aware of this for months and sat on it during  the debate on the Expansion of FISA and I argued that the rest of Congress,  all 535 members of both Houses, not just the 22 on the House Judiciary -  Intelligence Committee, should be aware that the NSA and the FBI according  to this memo have abused the FISA authorities we've - we've given them.</p><p>Congress should have been aware of that at the time he voted.</p><p>It wasn't, this came out the day President Trump signed the FISA Expansion  into law; fast-forward, can the Committee release it on its own?</p><p>\"No,\" because it is based on top-secret and secret materials, only the  president on his own can declassify.</p><p>So, after they vote, and they probably will, it's 13:9, Republicans over  Democrats on this Committee, after that - the Committee votes to release  it, it goes to the president who has already said, I don't know if he has  personally seen it but he's already said, 'he wants it out there' and he'll  declassify it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  That is going to provoke another memo, written by the  Democrats on the Committee based on the same documentation and we're going  to have two competing memos which causes me to say, 'let us see the data'  on which both memos, the one that exists, the one that the Democrats are  crafting, is based.</p><p>The government shouldn't treat us like children -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  - we have a right to see these documents and come to our own  conclusions, independently of what the Republicans want us to believe and  what the Democrats want us to believe.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It seems that the Democrats are trying to cloud the story with  another memo?</p><p>Let's face it, if that memo indicates that they used the dossier as  justification to wiretap Donald Trump and his entire campaign, American  people should know it.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Let's face it, if the memo shows that any of the 60,000  domestic spies that work for the NSA or the hundreds and hundreds of FBI  agents who work in the Intelligence Division of the FBI abused the  authority that the government has given them, we need to know who abused  the authority, we need to know who knows about it, we need to know who  looked the other way, and we need to know why nothing was done about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT MASLANSKY + PARTNERS &amp; POLLSTER:  Then how come -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right -</p><p>CARTER:  - (INAUDIBLE) -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - this story is outrageous to me because you know, who - if we  can't trust the FBI to actually be impartial to just do their job - and I  want to just say, a lot of the people at the FBI are great people and they  had no knowledge of any of this -</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Agreed.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - but the top of the FBI was clearly complicit.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Agreed, agreed and the public has the right to know it.</p><p>That if -- this really has very little to do with Mueller, although this  may give Bob Mueller as Trey Gowdy has said and Lindsey Graham has said  over the weekend, something else to investigate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well this is -</p><p>CARTER:  - Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - this is - you know, this is a really good point that you  bring up, I'm wondering how much of this Bob Mueller is looking at because  he could turn around and say, 'no, no, no, these texts are not my mandate,'  but these texts between these two FBI agents, Lisa Page and Peter Strauch  are so damning.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I read recently, I think it was last Thursday or Friday, the  charge that Bob Mueller has, it's only a page long, the language in it is  so vague, it would allow him to go almost anywhere, the -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  - House Committee can indict Paul Manafort for money- laundering in - </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But what about these two (ph) -</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -  2014.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - what about these two, are they going to be in accountability  (ph) you think, Peter Strauch, I mean they - they're -</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  (INAUDIBLE) -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - basically hiding evidence, destroying evidence, they - there  are more texts to come out.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  - I don't - I don't think they've committed a crime, they are  certainly subject to some sort of discipline -</p><p>Bartiromo, but what about the 'secret society,' what about the 'insurance  policy'?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  well they're going to - they're going to have to -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that that -</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  - explain that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - a crime?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  It is - it is not a crime to use those words and it's not a  crime to meet outside the Justice Department and say that 'we love Hillary,  we don't like Donald Trump.'</p><p>It would be a crime to hide evidence.</p><p>It would be a crime to exonerate somebody you know, there's evidence of  guilt a-la (ph) Mrs. Clinton -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  - so that might well be another area -- people that want  Mueller to go away but he - but they - we just keep finding treasure troves  of areas that compel investigation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right but no real evidence of any collusion between Donald  Trump and the Russians which is -</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  No (ph) -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - initially why -</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  - evidence (ph).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - Robert Mueller was hired.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  We have -</p><p>Bartiromo lots of new nuggets but nothing that he was actually supposed to  look at.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  - Right now he's interested in 'obstruction of justice' which  could only have occurred after Donald Trump became president, the alleged  collusion and the legal word is 'conspiracy' could only have occurred be -  during the campaign -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  - so, he's got two different areas he's now examining and it  looks like there may soon be a third.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Did you want to say something Lee?</p><p>CARTER:  I just -</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  (INAUDIBLE) -</p><p>CARTER:  - (INAUDIBLE) -</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  - (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  These are complicated subjects and we need -</p><p>CARTER:  - I just wanted -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  to talk to them now (ph).</p><p>CARTER:  - to know how Republicans and Democrats can interpret the same  data differently?</p><p>It's as if -</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>CARTER:  - just (ph) I mean -</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  (INAUDIBLE) -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  (INAUDIBLE) ignoring the FBI texts.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  - That's why we should be able to see the data and if they  don't reveal the data, I have encouraged some courageous member of the  Committee, I don't know who, to do what Senator Feinstein did with the  CIA's Torture Report that the House - that the Senate Intelligence  Committee voted not to reveal.</p><p>She brought it to the floor of the Senate and revealed it and we all  learned what happened with the CIA torture of people and the sun came up  the next day.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  The government didn't collapse.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  We have the right to know the intelligence data on which these  two different interpretations are based and because you can't be harmed,  prosecuted, or civilly sued for what you say on the floor of the House of  the Senate.</p><p>I want somebody to bring that stuff to the floor of the House and display  it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well Congressman Trey Gowdy is also suggesting that FBI  officials, Peter Strauch and Lisa Page should testify over these anti-Trump  text messages that they said to one another in response to lawmaker's  concerns that they could have protected Hillary Clinton from criminal  charges over her emails.</p><p>Congressman Goodlatte, weighed in with me yesterday on SUNDAY MORNING  FUTURES.

BOB GOODLATTE (R-VA), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  - because  there are tens of thousands of great men and women who every day keep us  safe, prevent terrorist attacks, solve crimes, at the FBI but they are  being besmirched by several people in the leadership of the FBI that have a  shocking contrast in the way they took - the approach they took to the  Clinton investigation and the one there've taken to the Trump investigation  -</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NAPOLITANO:   So, the FBI has three committees it answers to, you just saw  the chair - the chairs of two of them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, Goodlatte and -</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  They, right, they want -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - and Gowdy.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  - to know what was going on in the FBI at the time Mrs.  Clinton was being investigated.</p><p>It is absolutely proper for them to bring those FBI agents and others in  and say, 'what did you mean by this, how did you -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  - come to this decision?\"</p><p>The American public is entitled to know.</p><p>On top of that, I have said this before, I've said it before on your show,  Jeff Sessions, the Attorney General can and in my view, should re-examine  the evidence against her, assign it to a fresh team of FBI agents, and  federal prosecutors, and decide whether or not it should be presented to a  grand jury because the mechanism for exonerating her, every time you look  at it, appears to have been more and more corrupt.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It sure does.</p><p>And you know, what's the 'secret society'?  After Donald Trump wins, it's  time to get the 'secret society' de-texted (ph).</p><p>You know, what -- it's -</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - time for the 'insurance policy' - is the 'insurance policy'  the Mueller probe -</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  - I hope that -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - (INAUDIBLE) - </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  - stuff -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - investigation after investigation leading you nowhere?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  - Yes.

Good Monday  morning everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and  it is Monday January 29th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the  East Coast.  Getting tough on trade, President Trump's America First  message already being tested as Mexico and Canada have rejected a proposal  by the White House to rework a key part of the North American Free Trade  Agreement.  This comes as the Commander-in-Chief  targets Europe this  morning signaling possible payback over what he calls unfair trade policies  with the European Union.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I had a lot of problems with  European Union and it may work into something very big from that  standpoint, from the trade standpoint.  The European Union has treated the  United States very unfairly when it came to trade.  The European Union has  been very, very unfair to the United States and I think it will turn out to  be very much to their -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The president will address the trade debate as well as the U.S.  economic boom during the first State of the Union Address since taking  office where it takes place tomorrow night.  We will have it for you live  9:00 p.m. Eastern right here on the Fox Business Network.  The address  comes as major indices all closed at record levels again on Friday.  </p><p>Take a look at the momentum, Dow Industrials up almost one percent, 223  points higher, S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ both up better than one percent on  Friday.  This morning a bit of a pullback from those record high levels  take a look Dow Industrials expected to be down about 55 points of the  opening of trading a quarter of a percent lower.  S&amp;P 500 also down almost  a third of a percent and the NASDAQ weaker by 22 points that's one-third of  one percent.  </p><p>It is a merger Monday of sorts on Wall Street Dr. Pepper Snapple and Keurig  Green Mountain announcing plans to merge.  Dr. Pepper Snapple shareholders  will receive 103.57 share in special cash dividends and retain 13 percent  of a combined company.  Check out the movement of stock Dr. Pepper Snapple  shares up to 35 percent right now.  Investors are also eyeing orange from  several key names this week, this is one of the busiest weeks so far for  the fourth quarter.  Lockheed Martin both earnings and revenue topped  expectations and the stock this morning is up 3 and quarter percent.  The  defense contract just have been soaring over last year.  </p><p>In Europe this morning, the market look like this, take a look, FTSE 100 up  a quarter of a percent, 16 points higher.  CAC Quarante is up a fraction  and the DAX index is down a fraction.  In Asia overnight, stocks were  mostly lower with the exception of Korea which is up one percent.  Apple  may take a bite out of the iPhone, a new report that claims the technology  giant may cut iPhone X production in half in the first quarter not doing as  well as they thought I guess.  </p><p>Is technology putting our troops in danger?  The new concern over a fitness  app that's used on devices like Fitbit.  They are basically indicating  exactly where our troops are in the Middle East plus Hillary Clinton uses  the Grammy stage to mock President Trump.  The appearance that's leaving  many feelings fire and fury this morning.  All the stories coming up this  Monday morning.</p><p>And joining me to break it all down, Dagen McDowell, Fox Business Network,  it's Dagen McDowell, PwC partner Mitch Roschelle, and Pollster and the  President of Maslansky and Partners, Lee Carter.  Good to see you.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  It's great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lots to talk about today and the State of the Union.  </p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER:  Oh yes.  Busy week.  </p><p>CARTER:  Whoo-hoo.  I'm really excited about the State of the Union, you  know.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, me too.  We have the State of the Union, we got the FOMC  coming out on Wednesday, no interest rate increases expected yet a huge  amount of earnings and then the jobs numbers are on Friday.  So yes it's a  busy week.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Right.  And we keep an eye on  the 10 year treasury yield because again it -- this is why trade policy and  interest rate policy inflation all of wraps up to create some concerns for  the market.  From here, you know, to talk down the dollar you heard that  from treasury secretary last week.  Again lower dollar means we are  importing inflation that means what does the federal reserve it, that means  that we could have higher interest rates this country cannot afford  significantly higher interest rates given the levels of debt that were  riding and therein lies the problem because Washington won't do anything  about these looming problems in terms of the national debt because we're  facing a tsunami.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you know, they're not going to do anything about it  during an election year, right?  Forget about that.  By the way, I know  that you don't want to have the treasury secretary talking down anything or  talking up anything for that matter.  And you mentioned the op-ed and the  journal the other day, but don't you in some ways Steven Mnuchin was saying  what was so obvious what every administration feels anyway from the  beginning of time that yes, a weaker dollar is better for trade, it's just  that they don't say it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You can say it if you're not the treasury secretary and you can  think it if you're the treasury secretary but when it comes to the United  States dollar our dear greenback, you just say we support a strong dollar  policy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is every administration has said but they don't do things  to indicate that's really how they feel that's what I am saying, I feel  like they all think it he just said it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And by the way President Trump can say whatever he wants but  maybe his cabinet members need to rethink that strategy.  </p><p>BARTIROMOR:  Yes, you don't think anybody believed the walk back, do you?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, not at all.  Not safe.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- this morning, former presidential candidate and former  Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee is joining us.

Meanwhile,  President Trump is hinting at retaliation against the E.U. from what he  says is very unfair trade practices.  Blake Burman is live at the White  House the very latest.  Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Well, so much for all  the niceties coming out of Davos.  Maria, good morning to you as well,  President Trump giving an interview to Piers Morgan that was shot during  world the economic forum but aired for the first time yesterday and in it  the president saying that he has a lot of problems with European Union.   The president saying on the trade standpoint that, we can't get our  products in and the U.S. products come in at a very low taxable rate.  The  president saying that this could quote morph into something very big from a  trade standpoint.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>D. TRUMP:  The European Union has treated the United States very unfairly  when it came to trade, they are not the only ones by the way, I could name  many countries and places that do -- but the European Union has been very,  very unfair to the United States and I think it will turn out to be very  much to their detriment.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  Meantime, the Wall Street journal is reporting Mexico and Canada  rejected a proposal from the U.S. to change the corporate arbitration  system that is wrapped into NAFTA, it's called the investor state dispute  settlement and that deals with arbitration claims from companies within all  three countries.  Maria, as you know when he spoke to the commerce  secretary, Wilbur Ross on set there in Davos last week.  He said things are  just beginning from the negotiating standpoint as it relates to NAFTA.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Blake, thanks very much.  We will keep following  that.  Joining us right now is former presidential candidate from Arkansas  Governor Fox News contributor Mike Huckabee.  Governor, it's good to see  you.  Thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR:  Well, thank you Maria.  Great to  be with you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, your reaction here as we know that Canada and Mexico are  rejecting this proposal to rework the arbitration part of the NAFTA  agreement.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, I'm sure they would but I think they also have to  understand that Donald Trump is elected in large measure because he said he  would renegotiate the trade deals make it more fair for the United States.   None of these trade deals came from Mount Sinai, they weren't on Two  Tablets of Stone, they all have the provision that they are made to be  changed and to be updated as the economy changes, as conditions change and  I think this president should be commended for saying you know what our job  is to protect America, American jobs, American economy, we are going to do  that, we want to trade that is all an important part of growth.  But it's  got to be where it's reciprocal and fair.  Bravo to the president for doing  exactly what he said something were not used to seeing politicians often  do.  </p><p>CARTER:  So governor, I have a question for you.  You know, there is so  much talk about how these trade policies -- if we don't get a deal on it  might harm U.S.  What about these other countries, if they don't do a deal  with us, is it going to hurt them as well? </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Of course it would Lee.  And I think that's something that maybe  needs to be said a whole lot more.  I don't hear a lot of people saying  what you just said and thank you for saying it because some of these  countries they've got a whole lot more to lose than we do.  Because they  are utterly dependent upon our dollars buying their products and if we  decide look, you guys aren't playing fair so, you know, we'll look  elsewhere.  It's going to put them in a world of hurt, it is really a  position of strength that the president looks at.  And this is not a  president who sees America as weak, a country we have to apologize for,  even our economic strength is not a weakness it is something that we should  be proud of and we got there by capitalism.  Capitalism is a good thing, it  empowers people, it helps poor people to become not so poor people and  without it we end up like Venezuela.  I think we got a great model to say  to the rest of the world you want to be better off?  Be capitalist, it  works.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Governor, it is Dagen McDowell but some of these policies that  the world doesn't exist in a vacuum that these other countries when you --  you have to say these tariffs that were slapped on solar cells and washing  machines just last week that actually does impact jobs here in the United  States.  The jobs created by companies like Samsung and the very red state  of South Carolina, you have higher prices on washing machines, you've  already heard that from L.G. Electronics so again this actually is done  poorly and this is kind of a little willy-nilly side thing with the small  tariffs.  It's not -- it's not the sky is falling.  But again it can hurt  Americans if executed improperly or poorly.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Short term that may be true but long term a trade deal where  everybody is playing with the same rules is like playing the Super Bowl  where everyone has to play within same rules.  If one team gets special  treatment and the other team doesn't that is not a fair game, you don't  know who the champion is.  So short term there may be some, you know, some  pain.  But the long term is the prices are more realistically reflecting  what it cost to produce something, it does mean that Americans have a  chance to compete to make those very things.  But Americans need to make  things, we always have to be able to do some things that if we don't we  can't be free.  Provide our own energy, make our own food, be able to feed  ourselves and to be able to fight for ourselves which means we manufacture  our weaponry and items of defense.  Manufacturing is a critical part not  just of our economy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  But quite frankly without it, we can't be free.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we already saw L.G. get back and say look we are going to  raise prices.  Now, obviously if there are going to be tariffs on certain  products these companies just going to raise prices.  So that's going to be  a negative for consumers having said that there is real impact from this  tax plan that's very positive.  And yet house minority leader Nancy Pelosi  continues to criticize it.  She's getting a criticism from even within her  own party governor after dismissing the president's immigration plan, she's  now calling it make America white again proposal.  Listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NANCY PELOSI, UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVE, MINORITY LEADER:  That  plan is a campaign to make America white again.  </p><p>SEN. JOE MANCHIN (D) WV:  We don't need that type of rhetoric either side.   From Nancy, Paul Ryan, or anybody else and I come down this, the president  has laid out a template.  We are going to look at that template and we are  going to work with it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know governor before we get your reaction, I got to get the  panel's reaction.  I mean what --she is not doing anything that is showing  progress for her party.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean she keeps -- making America white crumbs like you said  Armageddon.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Armageddon, this pathetic little crumbs, a thousand dollars is  pathetic crumbs to her.  It's a little piece of cheese.  I think that she  is doubling down but she doesn't -- she sounds moronic and she's doubling  down on these comments.  I don't understand in what universe she thinks  that this resonates with the American people.  Let me say this again, a  thousand dollars is more than 20 tanks of gas, a thousand dollars can feed  a family of four in this country for nearly a month and she lives in a  bubble that is San Francisco.  </p><p>CARTER:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's absolutely true.  Governor, your reaction?  Jump in here.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, I tell you Nancy Pelosi is making Marie Antoinette look  like Mary Poppins.  Oh my gosh, to say the things that she says that is so  condescending, so insulting to working class people.  Now that's a group of  people Nancy Pelosi doesn't relate to, doesn't understand because she lives  above them but as Dagen was pointing out and I think so very graphically, a  thousand dollars to a family who has a $50,000 annual income look that is a  huge amount of money and for most families that is significant, that is a  vacation, that is being able to go to the dentist that's a lot of things.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but governor you know what the Republicans have some  problems of their own.  They're distancing themselves after the Steve Wynn  allegations, one of the top stories in the journal.  Wynn allegations  ripple as Republicans seek distance, in the wake of the Wall Street journal  report from former employees that there was constant or decades long  patterns of sexual misconduct.  What say you about that?  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, it is a horrible thing.  And I am glad that as these  things come to life, there's a severance between Steve Wynn and the  Republican Party.  But if they had known about it and it had been widely  known and then they continue the relationship that would be scandalous the  fact that they weren't aware of it, they became aware of it, they cut ties.   I am not sure what the scandal for the republicans is as much as it is a  scandal for Steve Wynn and the tragedy of the people that he abused.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we should point out that the Republicans have raised a lot  of money this year much more than on the democratic side.  But of course he  really was a kingpin in terms of raising money.  Governor, good to see you,  sir.  Thank you so much.  Stay with us tomorrow.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Thank you.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We are going to be live in Washington for the State of the  Union.  We'll be speaking with former DNC Chair Donna Brazil, past Majority  Leader Kevin McCarthy, Congressman Michael McCaul and the Head of Small  Business Administration Linda McMahon, plus former White House Chief of  Staff Josh Bolten with us as well.  We have a big show tomorrow live from  D.C. as we preview the State of the Union.  Back in a moment right here.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Explosions, gunfire, rocking a military base in  Afghanistan killing nearly a dozen soldiers, this is the latest in a wave  of terrorist attacks across the country.  Cheryl Casone with the details  there, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  That's right Maria.  So at  least 11 soldiers have been killed, 16 of those wounded in an early morning  assault on military compound in Kabul.  The Islamic State group is claiming  responsibility, this comes only two days after more than a hundred people  were killed in a suicide attack in the Afghan capital.  This month alone  more than 200 people have been killed, hundreds wounded in a series of  attacks unleashed by the Taliban and the rival Isis.  </p><p>Meanwhile, a popular fitness app is revealing top secret information about  the location of U.S. military bases.  The Washington post is reporting that  the app called Strava shows heat maps which pinpoints soldiers' workouts  that they're doing their undisclosed military base even spy out posts.   Their information is now out there, it's part of Strava's GPS gathering  that is available we should say on smartphones and more importantly the  Fitbit which a lot soldiers like to wear.  </p><p>Well, it is merger Monday in the the beverage industry Dr. Pepper Snapple  and Keurig Green Mountain are teaming up, it's a great accompany with the  combined revenue of $11 billion.  Dr. Pepper Snapple's shareholders getting  a special cash dividend nearly $104 per share they will hold a 13 percent  stake in the newly formed company.  The stock is soaring in the premarket  as you can see up about 30 -- nearly 38 percent right now, huge stock to  watch today.  Now you can basically -- I guess you can get Dr. Pepper out  of your machine, I made that up.  All right.  Just kidding.  A solid joke.   All right.  </p><p>And finally this, Apple is reportedly cutting its iPhone X production in  half in the first quarter, this move following disappointing holiday sales  in Europe, the West China.  Japan's Nikkei Asia reviews that Apple slashed  in production down to 20 million units.  The publications says part of the  problem here could be the iPhone's price tag which starts at about a  thousand dollars.  Shares of Apple down more than three percent over the  last week on concerns about those iPhone sales that stock, remember the  company is reporting earnings later this week.  </p><p>And then Japan based cryptocurrency exchange coin check has announced it's  going to refund customers about $400 million that was stolen by hackers.   About 260,000 people lost their holdings of NEM, this is the world's 10th  biggest cryptocurrency last week anyway.  Meanwhile, so the U.S. credit  card companies are now expected to restrict the purchase of  cryptocurrencies in general.  Citigroup, Bank of America are reviewing the  policies for this.  Capital One already deciding it will not allow  customers to use credit cards to buy any digital currency.  Right now, one  Bitcoin worth about $11,000 right now, you'll never know when it's going to  start over.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Down from 20,000 a couple -- a week ago.  Cheryl, thank  you.  Coming up, the Grammys get political, the controversy after Hillary  Clinton makes a cameo appearance and bashes President Trump.  Then made in  the USA, how a luxury eyewear company is changing the industry by  manufacturing their products domestically.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The eyewear industry, the glasses industry in  focus this morning while eyeglasses are in essential for millions of  Americans.  95 percent of all frames are made outside the United States  according to the Alliance for American Manufacturing.  But a company in  Chicago is looking to change that, State Optical assembles all of its  eyewear here in the United States and we love made in the USA so we are  happy to welcome Scott Shapiro to the program.  State Optical company CEO  and co-founder.  Scott, great to see you.</p><p>SCOTT SHAPIRO, CEO, STATE OPTICAL:  Thank you for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us.  So we are all trying on the  glasses.  I love the way those look on you, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I am blonde legally and so I need a new pair of glasses because  I fall asleep in them all the time and crush them and these are -- these  are beautifully made.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  They look great on you.</p><p>CARTER:  They look great on you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you get by manufacturing in the United States?  Where  here all day having a conversation about trade and about tariffs and tell  us how this is economically positive for you.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  So, first and foremost, you know, there is a lot of pride that  goes with making products here in United States.  We get to put Americans  back to work.  There is about 50 craftsmen working in our factory today  that wouldn't have those jobs if we were outsourcing that overseas.  But I  think much more importantly for our brand is it really connects the  patients or the customers with the craft of making eyewear.  You know, we  say in our factory it takes 70 steps to make one pair of glasses and over  50 percent of that has to be done by hand.  So, I think, you know, in our  industry, there is a lot of -- there is a large misconception about what a  pair of glasses should be worth, what really goes into making high quality  eyewear. And by making it here in the United States, it gives us the  opportunity to tell that story to really get people in touch with that  craft.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Scott, one of the things that we hear, see, and say all the  time and I'm curious about your perspective is finding talents.  So you  said you have 50 people in Chicago, is finding talent a challenge for your  business?</p><p>SHAPIRO:  Very, very difficult.  So I think what we don't talk about a lot  talk when we talk about bringing manufacturing back to United States is the  lack of infrastructure we have here in the U.S. to make things particularly  something like eyewear.  It is a skilled -- it's a very skilled labor.  And  so everyone of those 50 craftsmen that we trained in our factory have to be  trained from step one.  None of them have any experience doing that.  And  it generally takes about six months to get someone up and running before  they can do the job on their own.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Most to the high-end eyewear that would be in the same league as  your glasses is made in Japan and you mentioned earlier in Italy.  This  retail, the ones I've got on for about $400 dollars but is your profit  margin slimmer than those manufacturers overseas because your labor costs  are more expensive here?  </p><p>SHAPIRO:  So great question.  First and foremost, I should say that most of  the product that says -- or  I won't say that, a lot of the product that  says made in Italy, made in Japan is in fact made in China.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  A vast majority of product made in China and there's a lot of  ways to get around that country of origin.  But the product that is  genuinely made in Italy or made in Japan, you know, their workforce is  well-paid as well, those workers also get paid a similar wage to workers in  the United States.  So our profit margins aren't significantly worse than  theirs.  And in fact, there is a lot of benefits conveniences that we  benefit from by making frames here in United States.  So a lot of -- a lot  of advantages that offset that difference.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where do people get the glasses?</p><p>SHAPIRO:  So, we're in over 1100 retail locations currently.  All  independent eye care providers.  So, you mentioned you have an optometrist  across the street, they might carry the product but only independent  offices.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really great.  Scott, great to have you on the show today.   Thank you so much.  </p><p>SHAPIRO:  Thank you very much for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Scot Shapiro.  We love your glasses.  These are beautiful.  </p><p>SHAPIRO:  Yes.  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Coming up.  President Trump first State of the  Union and Trump for president senior adviser Lara Trump will weigh in on  what to expect.  That's next.  And Lockheed Martin reports fourth-quarter  results, beating earnings and revenue expectations.  We break down those  numbers.  Stock is up about three percent right now.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining me this Monday.  It is Monday, January 29th.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.   President Trump gears up for his first State of the Union Address tomorrow  night.  He is expected to tout the booming U.S. economy, infrastructure,  and trade.  We are taking the show live to Washington, D.C. for full  coverage tomorrow and Wednesday.  Join us live from D.C. as we preview and  analyze the president's first State of the Union.  Plus, Hillary Clinton  making a surprise appearance at the Grammy Awards last night, taking an  opportunity to slam the president.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  He had a long-time fear of  being poisoned.  One reason why he liked to like to eat at McDonald's,  nobody knew he was coming and the food was safely pre-made.  </p><p>JAMES CORDEN, HOST, GRAMMY AWARDS:  That's it.  We got it.  That's the one.</p><p>CLINTON:  You think so?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Reaction from Trump family members coming up, straight ahead.   Plus, futures pointing to a weaker opening for the broader averages today  as we kick off the new week on Wall Street after another record-setter last  week.  Personal income and spending just hit the wires, both measures  rising four-tenths of one percent in the month of December.  It is a big  week for the markets because the markets are looking lower but they've got  a lot to react to this week including an FOMC meeting on Wednesday.  The  State of the Union, Tuesday night.  Apple earnings as well as Amazon  earnings on Thursday and then the jobs number on Friday.  </p><p>This all after the major indices closed at another record- high on Friday  due to strong corporate earnings.  Take a look at that market.  Dow  Industrials up 223 points Friday, NASDAQ up 95 points.  Global markets this  morning are mixed.  Take a look, European indices are edging higher in  London and in Paris but the DAX in Germany is fractionally lower.  In Asia  overnight, markets closed mostly lower with the exception of Korea which is  up one percent.  Earnings in focus on Wall Street once again.  This is the  busiest week so far for fourth-quarter earnings.  Lockheed Martin kicked  off the busiest week for the fourth quarter with a beat on earnings and  revenue.  The stock is up 3-1/4 percent surging after the defense giant  also offer an upbeat outlook for 2018.</p><p>Intel under fire again this morning.  The chip giant reportedly telling  Chinese companies about a security flaw before disclosing it to the U.S.  government.  Making a legendary sports car more friendly, family friendly  as well.  We have a look at the new ride from Lamborghini as I speak with  the company's COO and he takes us inside those hot wheels.  All of that  coming up this morning.  But first, topping our news this half an hour.   Hillary Clinton's Grammy jab.  The former presidential candidate makes a  surprise appearance at the awards show last night to mock the president and  read from the book Fire and Fury.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CLINTON:  He had a longtime fear of being poisoned, one reason why he liked  to eat at McDonald's, nobody knew he was coming and the food was safely  pre-made.</p><p>CORDEN:  That's it.  We got it.  That's the one.</p><p>CLINTON:  You think so?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Joining me right now is Trump for President Senior  Adviser and the President's daughter-in-law, Laura Trump.  Great to see  you.  Thank you so much, Lara.</p><p>LARA TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP'S DAUGHTER-IN-LAW:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Your brother-in-law Donald Trump Jr. tweeted  this this morning after the Grammys.  The more Hillary goes on television  the more the American people realize how awesome it is to have Donald Trump  in office.  Lara?</p><p>L. TRUMP:  True.  It's so true.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Did you -- did you watch the Grammys?  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  You know what, Maria, I stopped watching all these shows a long  time ago for this exact reason and I think the American public as a whole  probably feels the same way.  I thought it was despicable, disgusting, and  quite frankly sad that Hillary Clinton obviously needs to validate herself  in some way.  If she's so keen on reading things, maybe she could read us  her 33,000 missing e-mails because I think I love to hear about those.  It  was just so disrespectful.  I'm so sad that this is the point that this  awards show has come to.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it's also -- from a marketing standpoint or a business  standpoint, not very smart because it's just making this assumption that  everybody agrees with you.  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Yes.  And obviously the country does not agree because Donald  Trump is our president, they chose him November 8th, 2016.  Look at where  this country has come in a year that he's been in office.  You know, the  economy is booming, people are back to work, unemployment is at, you know,  record-lows right now and we have so much to look forward to from this  president and I think even people that didn't vote are starting to get  onboard.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you make a lot of good point because the President does  have a great story to tell --  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- for the State of the Union tomorrow night.  He is preparing  for his first State of the Union tomorrow night and obviously the economy  is going to be a positive story that's going to be one thing to talk about  also foreign policy.  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How much are you expecting him to get into things like ISIS  being defeated.  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Well, I think he should talk about it because nobody does.  We  went from 44,000 ISIS fighters, just about a year ago to under 1,000 right  now and it's really under reported but that's huge, people in this country  as of even a year ago, we're very scared about how we were going to defeat  ISIS, is it possible?  I'm sure we're going to hear about that, were going  to hear about the fact that on the world stage, the United States has  reclaimed its place as the leader.  You know, you see my father-in-law  traveled to different countries, you see the respect that he's given -- the  welcome that he's given in these different countries.  It's so great that  we have our country back.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's what he said when he was in Davos, also talking  about the economic strength like jobs, like the unemployment rate, where it  is and also the regulatory framework which is rolled back.  You know, it  feels like there is a big runway to this because there's a number of  sectors that have not been impacted yet form the regulatory rollback.  Is  he expecting this 0-- the good times to get even better?  I mean, in 2018  and '19, he's talking about continued economic growth.  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Well, I think so, I mean, regulatory reform is obviously huge.   You're going to see these tax cuts kick in.  I mean, people next week are  going to see their paychecks higher in this country.  Thanks to Donald  Trump.  And I think he is right, this is super charged the economy, I think  2018, 2019 even there's opportunity for a lot of more growth in this  country.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So do we have it then, economic issues in the State of the  Union perhaps an infrastructure plan?  He's going to talk about that as  well, right?  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Well, I'm excited as you are, see here what he's going to talk  about, I'm sure immigration will be on there as well.  That's such a huge  topic, you know, it feels like it's on the one yard line, we'er almost  there and it's something that's so needed and necessary in this country.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will you be in the hall there tomorrow night?  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  We're hoping to be there.  Yes. I think so.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you this because of course, then there's some bad  news as well for the Republicans this morning and that is Las Vegas real  estate casino mogul Steve Wynn resigning as finance chair for the RNC after  reports of years of sexual misconduct here.  Wynn has denied wrongdoing we  should say but in a statement, he did not want to be a distraction, he said  to the Republican Party.  What's your take on this?  Shares of Wynn Resorts  down sharply as the company announced it will form a committee to  investigate these allegations, Lara.  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Yes.  Well, I don't know too much about it to be honest with  you.  I know he resigned and Ronna, the chairwoman of the RNC who's  amazing, accepted his resignation and she's going to do what's best for the  party.  And, you know, we're sad to see him go.  He was a great supporter  of the President.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, at the same time, the Republican Party has been raising a  lot of money, much more than the Democrats.  And so, as you see that nest  egg getting bigger, it must tell you that business and big donors out there  are seeing more opportunity on the RNC side.  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Well, not just -- not just big donors but a lot of the majority  of the money that we raised is small dollars, that means that the average  person in this country is supporting what the President is doing.  They  want to see him in office again for another four years in 2020 and I think  that speaks volumes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what are President's plans?  I mean, when you talk with him  sort of off-line, not an official capacity but as his daughter-in-law, what  does he want to get accomplished for the next three years?  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Well, I mean it's what you heard on the campaign trail which he  is delivering on.  He -- the economy was so big to him and obviously as a  businessman that was something that, you know, was his target from the very  beginning.  Let's reboot the economy, let's get it moving, you see where we  are now, the Dow hit all-time highs.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do we need as a business, look, get stuff done on time, get it  under budget.  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Yes. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's a really good lesson.  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  No.  It's so true.  I mean, you look at -- I always talk about  the Wollman Rink and the story there that the city had it for so long, they  couldn't get an ice skating rink though in Central Park.  Donald Trump came  in, ahead of schedule under budget and that's what he wants to do for this  country and I think we're seeing it happens.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's a great point that you make because I was talking  about somebody else with that regulations.  It took 13 years to build a  bridge in Bayonne, took another 25 years to do an infrastructure plan in  Alaska.  This rollback in regulations just sort of has unleashed animal  spirits.  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Yes.  Cut through the red tape, let's get it done and this  country deserves it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And -- but the detractors are still there, Lara.  How is the  President dealing with the media backlash, the backlash on the left when  you see Nancy Pelosi calling the $1,000 checks crumbs?  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Well, that's just -- that's plain sad and it's ridiculous.  I  think a lot of people in this country would be thrilled to have $1,000 and  it's sad that she thinks it's crumbs.  And listen, they proved themselves  wrong every single day, they lied about these tax cuts that people are  going to see next week that it's true that the majority of people in this  country, 91 percent of people are going to be making more money.  And I  think every single day, you know, those people on the left that have been  so harsh on Donald Trump, on our president, every day they discredit  themselves and they prove themselves wrong a little bit more.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are you doing in terms of the 2020 campaign at this point?   Do we have a sense of who will be running against your father-in-law?  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Well, I think we ruled out Oprah.  initially we thought that was  a -- well, like a week ago.  You know what, I don't know, I love to know  who it's going to be.  I think we are just -- we're raising money as you  said, you know, and I think the president is going to be able to run on,  you know, the great job that he is doing for this country.  His track  record is going to I think easily take him into another four years.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Actually since the Democrats are coming out with the resist  and, you know, pushing back instead of --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>L. TRUMP:  That's all they have.  They have no message, they have no  leader, they have no agenda  other than resist.  And it's very obvious,  it's very transparent to people I think.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Lara.  Great to see you.  Before you go, any updates  on baby Luke?</p><p>L. TRUMP:  Well, we had him on the pool down to Mar-a-Lago, so we're trying  to get him swimming.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's so great.  We have a picture, I wanted to share that  picture --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>L. TRUMP:  Oh, his first haircut.  Yes.  Down in Florida too.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Cute in his first hair cut.  Congratulations, Lara and Eric  Trump.  Good to see you.</p><p>L. TRUMP:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.  Coming up.  New concerns over Intel's computer  chip flaws.  Why the company reportedly warned Chinese companies it will  (INAUDIBLE) the U.S. government about the security vulnerabilities.  And  then the Lamborghini gets family friendly.  We've got the luxury  automaker's newest SUV in our plaza.  I'll talk with the COO of the  company.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Big week on Wall Street even technology earnings this week,  Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, all set to report their numbers  this week.  Joining us now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney to  look ahead.  Stu, good morning to you.  </p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  I've got  to two words.  Maybe three.  Don't disappoint because if any of these big  five and this Wednesday and Thursday when we get the big five results.  If  they really disappoint, I think you can put a crack in the market.  All the  --not all.  A backtrack again, a lot of the money going into the market has  gone into the five big tech stocks on expectation of stellar performances  each and every quarter.  If any of them falters, I think you'll see the  market overall falter, but you know, I think, Maria, there's another kind  of test coming here as well.  </p><p>What are the big tech companies going to do with the money that they're  bringing back to America and the money that they're going to get extra from  the tax cuts?  I suspect that a good chunk of it will go to stock buybacks,  and/or dividend increases.  And I think the left will go nuts about that,  that will be truly crumbs for the workers, crumbs for America, and  everything goes to the rich stockholders.  I don't agree with that point of  view, but I think that's what they're going to say.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I agree there's not a lot of room for error here.  These  stocks are up big time in the last year.  But, Stu, you know, my worry on  technology is the regulatory part of thing.  I think you're going to see as  Donald Trump is rolling back regulations for this economy, actually, I  think there's a new approach to technology, because these companies are  more powerful than we have ever known, today, and they're probably going to  see higher regulation, you see it happen in Europe, and I think you're  going to see it here in the U.S.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, but I want to know what kind of regulation.  It's very hard  to break up, say, an Amazon on antitrust grounds because basically what  they're doing is helping the everyday consumer and lowering prices, it's to  America's benefit that this company exists.  So, I'm not sure of what  framework they would use to regulate them and rein them in, but I do agree  with you that it's heavy pressure to do just that. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, because they had so much information on us.  They may be  helping the average person but we're giving something up in the process,  and that is privacy, that we've got all these data.  So, much is that data  worth to government that's overseeing all of this?  That's all I'm saying,  I just think that the regulatory environment is going to be an unknown for  these companies.</p><p>VARNEY:  And why don't I get a piece of the action?  If they know  everything about me and they sell that information to somebody else albeit  anonymously, I don't care.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  Where do I come in here?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You made my point.  That's exactly right.  Stu, we're going to  look at those numbers and we'll see if it cracks this market.  It's going  to be -- have to be really bad to do that.  Stuart, thank you, we'll see  you in about 10 minutes with more on \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" top of the hour  right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Join Stuart.  First though, Lockheed  Martin beats on fourth-quarter revenue, expects a rise in earnings this  year.  Good guidance has that stock up three percent right now.  Nicole  Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange watching Lockheed  and the broader market.  Nic?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hey, good morning, Maria.   You're absolutely right.  Taking a look at Lockheed Martin which is to the  upside.  They came out with a fourth-quarter revenue.  It beat the streak.   Stock is up almost three percent, 2.79, to be precise, 345 and change.   They did so well on the higher sales F-35 fighter jet program, also raising  guidance for 2018.  And don't forget, President Trump's administration, the  Defense Department is ready to fork it out, and in fact, ready to spend  about $391 billion over 15 years to develop and buy more than 2400 of the  supersonic warplanes.  So, a winner here for Lockheed Martin and going  forward, also upside potential.  </p><p>Then there's Intel, this is an ongoing story about the security flaws;  these are critical.  The question is why China's government may have known  more before about it before even the U.S. government because it seems that  they actually let notified a small group of customers, including some  Chinese technology customers and because China's government actually  monitors those types of conversations, in fact, the Chinese government may  have known before the USA, the left out the USA government to let them know  about these security flaws.  The stock is looking down about a half of one  percent, but it's up almost 32 percent in the last 52 weeks.  So, it has  been a great performer like many of the tech stocks.</p><p>And coming up, this is great.  I love it because I'm definitely into this.   A Lamborghini for your whole family, Maria.  Checking this one out.  Cool  features of the Italian automaker's newest luxury SUV, Lamborghini, with  Maria, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  As I come to you from the plaza right now, we've  got a set of hot wheels to show you because Lamborghini is roaring in and  rolling into the SUV market.  Joining me right now is the Chief Operating  Officer of Lamborghini America, Alessandro Farmeschi.  Good to see you,  sir.  Thank you so much for joining us, Alessandro.</p><p>ALESSANDRO FARMESCHI, CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, LAMBORGHINI AMERICA:  Good  morning.  Our pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're going to look at the car in a moment.  But first,  characterize what you're seeing out there in terms of -- in terms of  business and the market.  How is the reception for these new -- these new  cars?</p><p>FARMESCHI:  Oh, the reception is unbelievable.  I'd say that we have  already sold out entirely the 2018.  We are receiving great, great response  from our customers here in U.S. but also worldwide, I would say.  This is a  great news, the fastest SUV in the planet.  And so -- and the only one, by  the way.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let's talk about it.  This is the Urus.</p><p>FARMESCHI:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Urus.  And this is -- it goes 189 miles an hour?</p><p>FARMESCHI:  Yes, exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us about it.</p><p>FARMESCHI:  Yes, this is a super sports car, so it has all the feature of a  super sports car.  650 horsepower, 0-60 to -- in 3.6 seconds.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow!</p><p>FARMESCHI:  And it has all the technology to support the performances and  the agility and the emotion, I would say, of a pure Lamborghini.  Also, in  terms of design, of a super sports car.  Therefore, this car is conceived  also not to be just a super sports car but also an SUV.  So, it has the  (INAUDIBLE) agility.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Just the fact that you are into the SUV market.  I  mean, you said earlier, this can hold a couple of golf bags.  What was so  important -- why was it so important for a Lamborghini to be here, to be in  the SUV market?</p><p>FARMESCHI:  Basically, what we saw is that the SUV segment is expanding  every year.  And number one, United States is having a great success.   Before, we believed that not having anything in the super sports segment in  the SUV environment, we believe that this was the perfect package to also  families, our clients, a different way of living the Lamborghini every day,  living Lamborghini during the weekends, during the holidays with their  friends so because you can host four, five people, you space for three golf  bags.  And so, I mean, this the perfect combination.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you, Alessandro, I know that you reported global  sales up in the double digits, just recently you did.  You took the car at  the Detroit Auto Show.  How much does this cost?</p><p>FARMESCHI:  This cost $200,000.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  $200,000.</p><p>FARMESCHI:  Yes, we start from there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And how does that fit in the overall pricing of Lamborghini?</p><p>FARMESCHI:  This is, like we say, almost in line with our Huracan.  And is  positioned at the right level to -- let me say -- offer a different product  that's not just only a super sports car but something more.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It feels like a super sports car as well as a big family -- it  is very family friendly.  And this is gorgeous.  Tell us about the  interior.</p><p>FARMESCHI:  Here, you can see that you have --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, now, I feel like I'm in a Lamborghini.</p><p>FARMESCHI:  You immediately --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Immediately.  You're absolutely right.</p><p>FARMESCHI:  (INAUDIBLE) new seater.  So, the seats are sporty.  Also here,  the interior, you have here in the middle, all the commands like you are in  a aircraft or --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  You got my iPad right here, right?</p><p>FARMESCHI:  Yes.  These are two touchscreens and then you --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Two iPads.</p><p>FARMESCHI:  Yes, yes, yes.  Two iPads, all both touchscreen so you can go  and surf here in the navi system into the infotainment system, and you can  also with the sensor levers select the driving modes; you can drive in a  comfortable way, you can have a sporty way, race way, but also this is the  new speaker.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, it's almost like autonomous?</p><p>FARMESCHI:  It's not exactly autonomous.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's not exactly autonomous because you can't stop and not --  you can't control.</p><p>FARMESCHI:  (INAUDIBLE) the driver is always at the center, because we  speak about emotions, and for us, driving the Lamborghini is key, all of  our clients want to drive their Lamborghini.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's fantastic.</p><p>FARMESCHI:  And in terms of support, the driver, we also provide the  technology to help the driver, so recently in this car, we have a full  advance driver assistance system that helps the driver in case of a  imminent crash to break the car and talk to support in case (INAUDIBLE)  situation the driver.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, which is why we talked all about autos at the CES Show,  the technology show, because technology is in all of the cars.  Alessandro,  this is beautiful, the moment I stepped in the car, I could tell you I'm in  a Lamborghini.  It's absolutely gorgeous, it's the Urus, and Alessandro  Farmeschi, it is good to see you.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>FARMESCHI:  My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stay with us.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Once again, our thanks to Lamborghini and Alessandro Farmeschi,  thanks for showing me around this high-tech car.  Thank you, Dagen  McDowell, Mitch Roschelle, and Lee Carter.  We'll see you again tomorrow,  everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins right  now.  Stuart, over to you.</p><p>VARNEY:  Maria, thank you very much indeed.  Now, this is not the way we  usually open the show.

Happy  Monday, everybody, thank you so much.  Happy to be back in New York.  Good  morning and happy Monday, I am Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, January  29.  Your top stories right now, 6 a.m.  on the East Coast.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Getting tough on trade, President Trump's America First message already  being tested as Mexico and Canada are rejecting a proposal by the White  House to rework a key part of the North American Free Trade Agreement.   This comes as a commander in chief targets Europe signaling possible  payback over what he called unfair trade policies with the EU.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I've had a lot of problems  with the European Union.  And it may morph into something very big from  that standpoint, from a trade standpoint.  The European Union has treated  the United States very unfairly when it comes to trade.  The European Union  has been very, very unfair to the United States.  It will turn out to be  very much to their detriment.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The president will address the trade debate assaults the United  States economic boom during his first State of the Union address Tuesday  night.  That will be of course live, and we'll take it for you.  The  address comes as a major indices all close at record levels again on  Friday.  Take a look at Friday's performance up 223 points on the Dow, up  almost 1 percent.  26,616, a new record there.  S&amp;P 500 in unchartered  territory with a 33-point rally.  The Nasdaq as well.  </p><p>This morning a bit of a pull back from those numbers futures indicating a  lower open for the broader averages we have about 25 points on the Dow,  down about 18 on the Nasdaq.  We are watching the yield on the benchmark  10-year treasury.  It is as you can see rising, it broke 2.7 percent for  the first time since early 2014 building on Friday's again after the fourth  quarter GDP came out, and that was up 2.6 percent.  Yields on the rise and  stocks lower.</p><p>In Europe this morning, take a look at the indices, as we watch rates  moving higher even if fractionally, FT 100 it is up fraction, quarter of a  percent.  The CAC Quarante and the DAX index all over again fractional move  here.</p><p>In Asia, overnight stocks were mostly lower with the exception of Korea.   As you can see there, the worst performer was China, Shanghai composite  done about one percent.</p><p>Terror strikes in military school in Afghanistan.  The details on the  attack that left 11 dead, over a dozen injured.  And is technology putting  our troops in danger?  The new concern this morning or free fitness app  that is being used on devices like Fitbit better actually tracking our  military.  We will get into it.</p><p>Then Intel's morning over critical security flaws came after it first  flagged the issue to several Chinese businesses including Alibaba.  The  news leaving the United States government with a chip on its shoulder over  Intel.</p><p>Hillary Clinton using the Grammy stage to mock President Trump.  The  appearance that is leaving many feeling fire and fury of their own this  morning.  Although stories coming up this morning.  And joining me to talk  about it fox Business network's  Dagen McDowell.  PwC partner, Mitch Roschelle and Maslansky and Partners  president, Lee Carter.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great to see you.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY AND PARTNERS:  Great to see you welcome  back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Happy to be back.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CO-HOST:  Welcome back.  Amazing work.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, I missed you, it was a really good trip.  I can't  wait to get back here and talk about all the issues of the day we talk  about every morning.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Everything we are fired up about.  Fire and fury.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You were at the Grammys.</p><p>PWC PARTNER, MITCH ROSCHELLE:  I was at the Grammys.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you saw all of the readings of \"Fire and Fury\" up close and  personal.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  I did.  Yes, I was rolling my eyes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't know why they do that or they make an assumption  everybody agrees with them.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  The crowd there definitely did base upon a response.  I was  actually assuming.  My bet was Obama was going to be -- I knew something  was going on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes, that's a good point.  I am surprised Obama wasn't  there actually.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He can't run again.</p><p>CASONE:  I know I think your generally classier than that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, well, Hillary Clinton their reading right from the book.   And Cher as well.  I will get into it, a big night at the Grammys, coming  up this morning former senior advisor to the Clintons, the Stagwell Group,  president and managing partner, Mark Penn is with us this morning.</p><p>Former presidential candidate, Mike Huckabee is here, and Trump for  President senior advisor, Lara Trump making an appearance.  Plus, a Fox  News senior judicial analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano.  And Joy Villa was  at the Grammys last night, singer and songwriter, former Trump Campaign  Advisory Board member, Joy Villa.</p><p>And the COO of Lamborghini America, Alessandro Farmeschi, is joining us  this morning.  We've got some hot wheels on the plaza, don't miss a moment  of it, that's all coming up.  But first this top story this hour and that  is trade, Mexico and Canada now rejecting a proposal by the Trump  administration to rework the corporate arbitration system.  A key part of  the North American Free Trade Agreement also known as NAFTA.  It comes as  the president himself is speaking out an unfair trade practices with the  European Union even hinting at retaliation there.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  I have a lot of problems with the European Union.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You have done business with them.</p><p>TRUMP:  Not a question of doing business, but I will tell you representing  the United States.  It is a very unfair situation.  We cannot get our  product in.  It's very, very tough.   And yet they send their product to us.  No taxes, very little taxes.  Very  unfair.  I have a lot of problems with European Union and it may morph into  something very big from a trade standpoint.  The European Union has treated  the United States very unfairly when it came to trade.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  end of course trade expected to be one of the key elements in  the present state of the union speech tomorrow night, Dagen, I guess  infrastructure is the bigger headline.  And he is not going to withdraw  from NAFTA at the speech.  But were expected from the state of the union  tomorrow night?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  In \"The Wall Street Journal\" the headline about Canada and  Mexico rejecting a proposal which is kind of one of the linchpins in the  renegotiation of NAFTA, about how you handle corporate arbitration.</p><p>We would prefer it that these disputes go through domestic courts but again  this is one huge stumbling block.  I would say that trade in any foul-up  with trade with other nations around the world is one of the three biggest  risks to the market in our economy in the next year.  You have the 11  remaining countries in the Trans Pacific Partnership, which we withdrew  from, cutting a new deal last week, it will be signed in March.  </p><p>The European Union and Japan, the end of last year making giant trade deal  that will reduce scrap duties on cars coming in from Japan to Europe, scrap  duties on cheese and wine being imported into Japan.  This is one of the  great truths that we start cutting ourselves off from the rest of the  world.</p><p>I know that President Trump talks about bad trade deals, but how about some  trade deals.  We need to also deal with NAFTA and also ink that trade deal  with South Korea before we can move ahead with any other bilateral deals  with nations around the world.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, which is why last week, Mitch, there was some worry that  there will be some more to tariffs on solar panels and tariffs on washing  machines.  Maybe aluminum and steel are next and little by little discrete  creates a real trade issue.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  If you look at the GDP numbers that came out last week they  would've been a whole percentage point higher if it wasn't for trade  imbalance.  Obviously, the president is very focused on trade balance and  he campaigned on that, and he is pushing forward to try to make things a  little bit more fear around the planet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's a balance low.  I mean, Lee, the White House says that the  tone of the president's State of the Union message tomorrow night is going  to be one of bipartisanship.  One very forward-looking in terms of his  agenda.  How much of that includes these issues over trade remains to be  seen.</p><p>CARTER:  I think were going to see a lot about trade, immigration, I think  it's going talk about infrastructure, I think you will talk about jobs and  the economy, I think he is going to spend time talking about what he is  most comfortable with.  What I think is going to be notably absent from the  speech, healthcare.  The reason for that is that is a really partisan issue  right now and I think you can see the administration is making a lot of  progress in some of these other negotiations with Democrats on immigration.  </p><p>There was an interview last week with Chuck Schumer where he said he was  willing to talk to the president about these things.  Of course, they get  upset when the terms change, but I think that he is really going to focus  on those issues that are first and foremost in people's minds right now.   But I think it's really interesting that he is not going to be talking  about healthcare.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You would think infrastructure a sort of along both party  lines, and that would be a positive, but there debating over the cost,  right.  According to a new Politico Morning Consult poll, by the way, a  majority of voters want to hear the president talk about healthcare and  economy.  You don't think that is front and center.  You have got to  believe there is a lot on infrastructure though.  Isn't there a lot there  to talk about infrastructure?</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  In theory, and we have been talking about since the election,  infrastructure should be a bipartisan issue that everybody is going to get  behind.  But I don't think anything is bipartisan anymore.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  First it was supposed to be $1 trillion deal, now we are  talking about $1.7 trillion, but we should point out that the federal money  is 200 billion.  The number is largely expected private and public  partnerships.  We'll see.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It remains to be seen how those work out because public-private  partnerships work if it is for say a toll road, where there is revenue  generation from that project.  In terms of just throwing money, I think you  have 2.7 percent could hire on the 10-year yield.  That is related, so  watch tariffs driving up costs.  Watch talk about the weakening dollar  which imports inflation into this country.</p><p>I think the Trump administration, and this is a warning to them.  They need  to be careful of anything in terms of driving up inflation in the United  States borrowing costs at this point, and also how much more money you are  going to borrow after we doubled it out during the last administration.   Those are very, very big concerns because President Trump love talking  about the record breaking run in the stock market.  The one thing that will  throw cold water on it is much higher borrowing costs.  And 2.7, let that  be a warning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You are right, and we already saw a come back from South Korea,  LG comes out last week and says, oh, guess what we are going to raise  prices.  So that was as a result of the tariff.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to say really quickly one thing.  These are companies  like Samsung that have jobs in the United States.  They have a new  appliance plant in South Carolina.  Part of these tariffs on imported parts  above a certain level.  If you try to import parts into this country and  assemble washing machines and create jobs in the nation, the Republican  Governor of South Carolina is very concerned about these tariffs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They have to figure out a way, what's the cost because you  can't keep putting a terror retirement crosses the border, because reports  are coming from different places.  Same issue with autos.  Because the  parts are coming from different places, so you have got to come up with one  tariffs and not have overly done tariffs, if you will.</p><p>More to come on that.  Coming up terrorism strikes a military school in  Afghanistan.  We have got that story, the details on the attack that left  11 people dead.</p><p>Then the dangerous discovery that is putting our soldiers at risk.  A new  report shows the fitness devices are exposing sensitive military locations,  you've got to hear this.  And then Hillary Clinton surprise appearance at  the Grammys, the former presidential candidate's latest jab at the  commander-in-chief.  That is all ahead.  Back in a minute.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back another deadly attack in Afghanistan to report.   Militants reading a military Academy in Kabul.  Cheryl Casone with the  details in headlines.  Cheryl, good morning to you.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN:AM CO-HOST:  Good morning.  Maria, another attack to  talk about there.  At least seven soldiers have been killed, 16 others  wounded.  It was an early morning assault on a military compound in Kabul.   The Islamic State group claiming responsibility in this comes only two days  after more than 100 people were killed in a suicide attack in the afghan  capital.  This month alone, more than 200 people have been killed and  hundreds wounded in a series of attacks unleashed by the Taliban and their  rival, ISIS.</p><p>Meanwhile, this is interesting, a popular fitness app is revealing top- secret information about the location of the U.S.  military bases.  \"The  Washington Post\" reports that the apps draw heatmaps, pinpoint soldier's  workouts near previously undisclosed military bases, and some spy outposts.   This is part of Strava GPS dealer gathering available on smart phones and  yes, the Fitbit.  Which a lot of soldiers wear because it's Fitbit.</p><p>And there is more fallout today from security flaws that Intel found in its  chips.  \"The Wall Street Journal\" reporting that Intel told some Chinese  technology companies about the potential problems but not the U.S.   government.  Security experts say they may have given the Chinese  government a heads up about the flaws known as inspector and meltdown.   Remember those laws allow hackers to access personal data and researchers  say there's no sign the information was ever exploited, shares of Intel Laura new premarket right now more than half a percent.</p><p>Apple reportedly cutting its iPhone 10 production in half in the first  quarter, this is due to disappointing holiday sales in Europe, the U.S.   and China.  Japan's Nikkei is reporting that Apple is lowering its  production targets to 20 million units.  Part of the problem could be  Apple's price tag which starts at $1000.  Remember, guys, the stock took a  hit last week as well.  Shares of Apple trading slightly lower in the  premarket.  Almost half a percent they are reporting by the way later on in  the week, guys.</p><p>And then finally this, the Grammys.  Typically, it is all about music,  right.  Well, he got really political.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Hip-hop, real talk.  That is love, baby.  Jay for  president.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Tonight, in this room full music dreamers, we  remember this  country was built by dreamers, for dreamers chasing the American dream, and  all I know, it is just like dreams, these kids can't be forgotten.  And are  worth fighting for.</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE:  We have a longtime fear of  being poisoned.  One reason why he like to eat at McDonald's.  Nobody knew  he was coming, and the food was tastily made.</p><p>(END OF VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  And we should say United States Ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley,  was not happy about this.  Here's her tweet, she said I always loved the  Grammys, but how artists read the \"Fire and Fury\" book killed it.  Don't  ruin great music with trash, some of us love music without the politics  thrown in it.</p><p>Now back to the music, the big winner of the night was Bruno Mars, he  earned the top three awards, he got album of the year for \"24k Magic\", and  he won 6 Grammys told, singer and songwriter Joy Villa, by the way, wore a  make America great again dress, remember at the Grammys last year.  Well,  she's coming up later on the show you new dressed that she wore last night.   She is getting a lot of buzz, Maria, about her latest outfit.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, her purse said choose life, enter dress was another  extension of that.  So, she is going to join us and talk more about that.   You were the Grammys.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  I was.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us about it.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  It was awesome.  Bruno Mars, he was incredible.  That was  great.  But the highlight for me was Elton John, everybody my generation  was hanging on for Elton John's performance.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he did a duo with Miley Cyrus.  Right before that it's when  you saw the \"Fire and Fury\" book readings, and that's when I turned it off,  although my TV was still on and I did see it.</p><p>Once I saw the readings on \"Fire and Fury\", I was like, OK, that's it, I'm  done.  Did you watch it?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I watched some of it.  This is what we expect, music is  politics.  A lot of these musicians there, and for the last 50 years, the  music has been filled with political statements, so again that is what  you're going to get.  Kendrick Lamar, if he hadn't done what he did and  that opening number which was incredibly powerful, the people would've been  disappointed.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know what though, Bruno Mars did not get political.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But his music isn't political.  It's when a singer starts making  political statements that's out of character.  But U2 again, their entire  career has been tinged with making political statements.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Going into the show, Jay Z it's all about negatives about  President Trump.  The president actually fought back at them on Twitter.</p><p>CARTER:  I think it is interesting now that the new elites are in Grammys,  are in music or entertainment, in the are completely out of touch with the  American public.  In it continues.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Would they have been able to rally votes, Hillary would have  won.</p><p>CARTER:  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  If all the people who listen to their music would have gone out  there and voted, she might have won.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right, they didn't come out.  All right, we will take a  break, when we come back market momentum rages, the Dow, the Nasdaq, the  S&amp;P 500 trading at record highs even we're looking at a fractional pullback  this morning.  What if anything slows things down for going let take a look  at that, the risks.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BENIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID BURROUGHS, MECUM AUCTIONS AUTOMOBILE AUTHENTICATION EXPERT:  It's  about the size of the tip of a ballpoint pen.</p><p>JAMIE COLBY, FBN HOST:  David Burroughs, Mecum Auctions automobile  authentication expert, pinpoints the problem for me.</p><p>BURROUGHS:  So, if you count in 13 of these ribs would be right about in  the center of this little gutter.  </p><p>COLBY:  But it's missing.</p><p>BURROUGHS:  So restored cars could get all sanded off to make it pretty and  shiny, and found that little fingerprint gets obliterated, so that implies  that this car has either been restored or at least something is fishy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was a clip from tonight's all new \"Strange Inheritance\" on  Fox Business Network host Jamie Colby set out for Chicago to meet the son  of a Vietnam vet was left in mint condition Corvette, in joining us right  now, the host of \"Strange Inheritance,\" Jamie Colby.  Jamie, what a great  story, tell us about this.</p><p>COLBY:  What a cliffhanger that was.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  1967 Corvette Stingray.</p><p>COLBY:  And they have a little dimple under the hood that was part of the  original mold.  This car, it was missing.  With the son of this Vietnam  veteran who sent his combat pay home to give him an incentive to come out  alive and make it back, he treated this as well as his five children.  In  the son inherited it and realized he could not divided into three, for his  kids when he passed, so he finally decides to sell it.  But he only wanted  to go to a family that will appreciate story behind it about his father.  </p><p>And Mecum Auctions actually did propose that this car was special, not only  it sold $675,000 but it had incredible military story behind it, and what  an honor for me to pay tribute to our troops by telling the story of this  Vietnam veteran tonight.  But that little divot missing.  It is an  authentication issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  </p><p>COLBY:  You have to watch to find out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will.  It's a great story.  All of these stories are so  fascinating, I want to take a clip of the second episode airing at 9:30  eastern tonight.  What's this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHARLOTTE SMITH, COLLECTOR OF CLOTHES:  I just lost my job.  And I thought  I am actually a two homeowner because my collection actually cost me more  than maintaining my house.</p><p>COLBY:  Charlotte can only afford to keep one.  </p><p>SMITH:  It was awful, but you know what I just thought there is no way I  would inherit a collection like this for no reason.  I made the decision  I'd rather sell my house than my collection.  </p><p>COLBY:  Now, think about that.  First addresses cost her, her shop, next  the cost her, her husband, now for cost her, her house.</p><p>(END OF VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  She's giving everything up except the clothes.</p><p>COLBY:  Here's the amazing thing and we are learning a lot from viewers  writing us, her godmother was a Quaker.  The last fashionista that you  would imagine.  She got $25 from her parents and bought her first dress, in  turn it was out of control.</p><p>3000 dresses that were left to Charlotte Smith who was an antique shop  owner in Australia, and she has one of the most significant and historic  fashion collections. Her husband said, it's me or the clothes, babe.  And she said.  Bye bye.</p><p>And she has made a career, she said this is not just a collection, it is a  calling.  She has written a book on Dior, she has written a book on Chanel,  the collection is priceless we saw it here in New York at Parsons.  And  wait until you see what she's done with it, but a Quaker very unlikely, but  a great story of her and Matt, also the first gentleman who inherited the  Corvette wanted to do the right thing.  Twists and turns tonight, Maria.   If you watch one night of \"Strange Inheritance\" this season, this is it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'll be watching.  Jamie, great show.  Congrats.</p><p>COLBY:  Thank you, Maria, great to see you, don't forget that money  collection you have, the coins and the dollars.  I'm waiting.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I collect currency.  One of these days I'm going to bring it in  and show everybody.  Thank you so much, Jamie Colby there.  Check out  \"Strange Inheritance\" tonight.  </p><p>We had a great week last week, if you missed it, here are some of the top  moments from our program live from the World Economic Forum last week in  Davos, Switzerland.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  In Davos, welcome to this morning's panel.  </p><p>BRIAN MOYNIHAN, CEO, BANK OF AMERICA:  2018 it is going to be a little bit  about United States trying to make itself a bit more competitive, as that  changes the dynamic is going to reverberate a little bit in the world.  And  so, there is an attitude are you here from the administration about free  trade policy has to be fair trade, but that has to settle back to the real  question how do you get those imbalances straightened out.</p><p>TIDJANE THIAM, CEO, CREDIT SUISSE:  We have already portrayed recently  because actually investors in Europe trade grew more slowly than world GDP.   Which was very worrying.  But I remain optimistic, I think we are in an  exceptionally favorable context.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You said that there have always been trade wars, were you  suggesting that the United States is engaging somewhat in a trade war or  this is just the way the people look at it?</p><p>WILBUR ROSS, COMMERCE SECRETARY OF THE UNITED STATES:  What I meant was  this, every time someone violates trade rules that to me is an act of war.   Things are changing, I think they know we are not going to be suckers  anymore.</p><p>STEPHEN SCHWARZMAN, CEO, THE BLACKSTONE GROUP:  Countries outside the  United States are recognizing that the United States competitive posture  has changed quite dramatically.  And we are going to be seeing on  anticipated foreign investment into the United States because we will be  the best of developed market in the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Were you surprised at all to get all of this focus and  questions hammered about your comments that are weaker dollar is good for  trade.</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY OF THE UNITED STATES:  Again,  I am a bit surprises because my comments on the dollar has been completely  consistent going back for a number of years.  The Treasury Secretary has  just kind of commented on strong dollar, strong dollar, strong dollar.  And  again, my perspective is there is a free market, where it is a short-term  is not a concern of ours.</p><p>ELAINE CHAO, TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY:  The transformative nature of  technology in transportation is very exciting.  But it also cautions us to  address issues about safety, security, accessibility and also privacy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How soon before we see driverless cars on the road as the norm?  </p><p>CHAO:  I think it will come not as fast as some people say, but sooner than  many expect.  </p><p>GINNI ROMETTY, CEO, IBM:  I wish it wasn't called artificial intelligence,  Augmented intelligence.  That it is really going to propel the world  forward.  I think this is a really important inflection point in time for  companies but for the tech industry, society at large.  This idea that it  is our job to steward in these new technologies and guide them safely into  the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I've got to get your take on the employment situation right  now.  Because there is this whole debate about DACA.</p><p>BILL GATES, FOUNDER, MICROSOFT:  We got the country and immigrants.  We are  very lucky country where lots of highly energetic and talented people want  to come to our country.  I certainly believe that we should all want them  to stay and contribute.  We could get the Dreamers, solve them, we could  look at immigration more broadly.</p><p>KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY:  America first is not  America alone.  We need a partner.  You know, as I've said earlier, not one  of us has the ability to do this alone.  So we need to partner with private  sector, we need to partner with our allies.</p><p>RANIA AL ABDULLAH, QUEEN CONSORT OF JORDAN:  America being great again, it  comes from America engaging with the rest of the world and sharing its --  the principles that it represents.  I'm looking forward to seeing how the  United States will continue to set the -- to be the moral authority and  leader in the world.</p><p>RICK PERRY, SECRETARY, U.S. ENERGY:  You have to understand what America  first means to the president of the administration and it's really pretty  simple from my perspective.  This is about America being competitive around  the globe when folks are thinking about where you want to buy your energy  from, where do you want that next load of L&amp;G to come from.  We want you to  think about America, first.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Welcome back, good Monday  morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, it  is Monday, January 29th, your top stories right now 6:30 on the East Coast.  </p><p>One day away, President Trump's first State of the Union Address, this  Tuesday night, he's expected to bring up the booming economy, the soaring  market and an infrastructure plan.  We will have full coverage, live, from  our nation's capital, tomorrow and Wednesday, right here.  </p><p>And meanwhile, take a look at markets pulling back from another record- setter on Friday.  Futures pointing to weakness to kick off the week, as  interest rates move higher.  Dow Industrials now down 40 points.  Investors  are watching a very busy week.  It is the busiest week for fourth quarter  earnings.  For example, take a look at rates right here, 2.72 percent up 5  basis points.  </p><p>And we've got a slew of economic data leading up to the monthly job's  report on Friday, we've got the FOMC meeting and, of course, the State of  the Union, so yes, it is a very busy week for markets.  We are watching  yields and rates move higher, the 10-year treasury topping 2.7 percent,  first time receiving this level since 2014.  This after the major indices  closed at record highs on Friday due to strong corporate earnings that's  really been leading this market, Dow Industrials at 26,616, NASDAQ at 7505.  </p><p>Global action this morning, a little weaker, in Europe, mixed performances,  you've gor the FT 100 up a quarter of a percent, and the CAC Quarante up  fractionally but the DAX Index in Germany is lower by a fraction.  In Asia  overnight, markets closed mostly lower with the exception of Korea, the  KOSPI Index up almost one percent.  </p><p>Closer look at earnings this morning, a third of the Dow and more than 100  S&amp;P 500 companies will report this week.  On tap today, Lockheed Martin, we  will bring you the numbers as soon as they hit the tape.  These defense  contractors have been soaring in the last week and there's a chart just in  the last three months of Lockheed Martin.  </p><p>Our top story this half an hour, the red-hot start to 2018, markets have  only gained momentum through January building on last year's historic  rally.  Since January 1st, the Dow Industrials has seen 11 record closes,  the NASDAQ, 13 record closes and the S&amp;P 500 has seen its biggest gains in  more than 30 years with these markets up from the start of trading, not the  mention since the election.  Joining us right now SkyBridge Capital Senior  Portfolio Manager, Troy Gayeski, Troy, good to see you.</p><p>TROY GAYESKI, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, SKYBRIDGE CAPITAL:  Good to see you  too, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What takes this market off track?</p><p>GAYESKI:  Well, you know, this week, we're going to test the week with  rates backing up, so, you know, our opinion would be the rate move so far  as confirmation of better economic growth, better earnings, a rotation out  of bonds and to equities.  But you start seeing the 10-year approach, 2.8,  2.9 that would certainly decelerate the rate of gains at least, and maybe  cause a longer consolidation period.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen, what's the magic number?  I mean, when do investors go  out and say, OK, I can get a better deal if i put money in treasuries  because interest rates are at this level, I'm going the take my risk out  and take the money out of stocks?  Do you have a magic number?</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Since the financial crisis,  it's been pretty close to the yield that we see right now that when you get  a sustained move above 2 1/2 percent, this is the highest, 2.7 percent is  the highest we've seen the 10-year yield in four years.  </p><p>So this is always been -- but, again, this was in a very slow-growth  environment where the U.S. economy never grew in any one calendar year,  three -- even three percent since 2005, I think.  So it's more than a  decade.  There's -- I think that when you start to get closer to three  percent that that is danger zone at least in the short run.</p><p>GAYESKI: Yes, which should cause a pause, again, when you think about the  gains we've had, since the election last year, and in the la six weeks,  they've been historic.  So, you know, one of the justifications for the  strength of bull market has been how low rates were and how there's an  alternative, but now you have rates backing up, again, you get around,  three or above, that's when you could have at least a mild correction, but  by mild, several percent, not five, six, seven or eight.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC:  Troy, one of the things that I also worry  about is this, sort of, strategy around depressing the value of the  dollars, while it's good for corporate profits and multinationals, it may  not be good for our economy.  What are your thoughts on the cheap dollar  strategy?</p><p>GAYESKI:  Well, that's back to the capital flows argument, whether there's  enough inflows to fund their budget deficit but also to keep equities  trending higher.  And look -- I think -- you know, we are talking about  (INAUDIBLE) the comments that Mnuchin made, and those comments only weaken  the dollar buy a percent, percent and a half.  </p><p>I mean, in the big picture, don't forget the dollar had tremendous gains in  2013, '14 and early '15, since then, it's been weakness, in fact, the  dollar is actually weaker now than prior to when the fed first hiked back  in 2015.  So, you know, we don't want to get in a trade war.  </p><p>We don't want to see the dollar decline by five, six, seven, eight percent  from here, because that would start to set off, you know, concerns about  inflation.  But in the meanwhile, it's just trading weaker in a relatively  sustained range, so we don't see it as a huge threat right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know what?  I want to get your take on whether or not to  put money into this market right now or to take money out.</p><p>GAYESKI:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But first, let's give some context on the backdrop because  Blackstone Group Chairman and CEO and co-founder, Stephen Schwarzman, told  us about the next fundraising cycle for the Blackstone Group, listen to  what he had to say in the future of his business.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEPHEN SCHWARZMAN, CHAIRMAN AND CEO OF BLACKSTONE GROUP:  We started out  just doing the highest return-type of investing, in real estate, it's  called opportunity fund investing, in private equity.  It's like normal  private equity.  And those returns, sort of, have ended up close being to  20 percent after fees --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Every year.</p><p>SCHWARZMAN:  which is every year and this is in pre-fees, of course, you  know, just really pretty amazing, and what happened is that we've done that  and now we've discovered some interesting things, that there are investors  who don't necessarily want those types of returns.  </p><p>They are much more comfortable and are looking for returns in 11, 12, 13- type of area for different types of things, some as private equity that  compounds over the long-term, you don't sell it after four or five years,  you can hold it for 10 or 20, and some in the real estate area.  </p><p>There are also mezzanine securities that can get you in that type of area.   So what's happening is we are now developing products and aggressively  expanding in that 11 to 13 to 14 range.  Now, there's a lot more to do  there because it's easier to have lower returns if you're used to  manufacturing very high returns.  </p><p>So we continue to do the high-return business but all of the sudden, we've  got a much bigger potential market in these other lower returns and still,  there are people in the lower-rate environment who are quite happy making  seven, eight, nine, because they're exceeding what they need for pension  funds and other pools of capital.  And if you can do that in a secure way,  that market is even bigger.  So, what's happening is we used to just be at  the top and now we're addressing a pyramid, and it keeps getting bigger as  we go down.  And we develop those products, and then we take them around  the world.  So, Blackstone is going to be experiencing, I believe, a period  of very substantial growth for a very long time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They are about to go on a fundraising move, they're going to  raise $200 billion.  An incredible number.</p><p>GAYESKI:  It's remarkable.  Yes, remarkable firm, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>GAYESKI:  And, oh, back to the question you were going to ask, I mean, one  of the challenges for investors right now is, you know, equities have done  fantastically well, there's some nervousness creeping in and volatility has  been exceptionally low.  Everybody knows that, you know, this economic boom  won't continue forever and they'll be a correction, or at least a bear  market or mild correction.  So, where else are they going to put their  capital?  And back to the point on bonds, I mean, bonds, you're looking at  -1, -2 to up 1.  So, part of the growth for firms like Blackstones or  alternatives in general, how do you make, you know, a high single digit  return that's at least competitive with equities but has far less downside  in the event of the ultimate bear market.  So, you know, we're seeing some  people start to peel money off from equities.  For the last two years,  investors have been peeling money out of bonds, and that came alternatives  that way.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, would you put new money to work in stocks right here or  not?</p><p>GAYESKI:  Well, look, I mean, $600 billion has saved the year by consumers  has got to go somewhere, so you should continue to follow your asset  allocation.  I don't think you want to be hyper overweight stocks right  now.  You made good money, you have to be realistic, you're looking at low  to high single digits the next 12 months given where multiples are.  So,  you know, right now, we're advocating the clients, just take a little bit  of money off the table and allocate to alternatives.  And that way, you'll  have less downside when the ultimate correction comes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I've got to tell you, even though there's feeling of  complacency, worries about higher rates which you point out, worries about  inflation at some point, I could not find one person to say take money out  of the market in 2018.</p><p>GAYESKI:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because they think that the tax plan is going to have legs for  this year, that we're still going to see another good market.  I don't know  what that means and if it's a contrary indicator, but I can't find anybody  to say short this market in '18.</p><p>GAYESKI:  Yes, some of those people were also saying, if Trump got elected,  the market would collapse. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, good point.</p><p>GAYESKI:  So, I don't know how much you would them as future indicators  here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.</p><p>GAYESKI:  Great to see you.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great to see you, Troy, Troy Gayeski.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  To get a sense of the runway for telecom across  the world, this next company proves it, connecting emerging markets,  Channel I.T. helps under-developed regions for providing micro finance  lending solutions to mobile network subscribers.  I caught up with the  Chairman and CEO of Channel I.T. in Davos, Bassim Haidar, at the World  Economic Forum about business today in the emerging markets and how it's  opening up a whole new opportunity.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p>BASSIM HAIDER, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, CHANNEL I.T.:  We're emerging market  business and we're creating product that have a lot of pull, so customers  need the products.  We're not trying to push something onto someone they  you don't need.  When you have 2.5 billion people in emerging markets that  are unbanked, simply providing them a way into banking or into loans, or  into the financial systems, empowers them and allows us to actually sell  and cross sell more services.  So, take for example, we just launched in  Pakistan a mobile financial service.  The uptake has what we're supposed to  do in the first six months.  We've done already in one month after launch.   So, it just tells you that because all this lack of infrastructure lack of  focus from the very big global players, the cost of acquisition of  customers to bring them into the banking sector of small loans is very  high.  We do it via technology, via big data.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, tell me about that.  How do you connect the dots from  telecom services to micro finance lending?  </p><p>HAIDER:  So, basically for more than 25 years since GSM is out there,  there's been a huge amount of data gathered by the telcos.  This data was  never really used.  It was just dumped onto service and was never ever used  to say how do we understand these customers?  In a country where you have  no data on the consumer, the only way you can reach them is via their  behavior and usage of their mobile phones.  And the amount of data you can  actually get from that almost exceeds what you got on Twitter, for example,  and therefore taking that data, making sense out of it, scoring these  customers, and then, say, we're going to provide loans, services, we're  going to provide you content, digital content that you've never had access  to.  We do, for example, onto our big services today is we provide loans  for customers to go from a simple feature form onto a smartphone.  Can you  imagine what that brings to them?  It brings the whole world.  In countries  where you have no electricity, watching videos and getting onto YouTube,  and Facebook, and social media via your phone and enable you to do this at  any time anywhere is a very powerful proposition?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what kind of growth are you expecting in the coming years?  </p><p>HAIDAR:  This year, 60 percent growth.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow!  60 percent.  </p><p>HAIDAR:  60 percent growth in our business.  We closed the year with about  400 million people interacting with our platform this year.  We honestly  believe we're going to finish more than 620 million people interacting with  our platform by the end of this year, and it's already in sight -- we can  already see it happening the way we're growing.  So, we're probably going  to hit, probably, a billion in the next two years -- users in our  platforms.  </p><p>Geopolitical events don't affect us as much as I was saying earlier,  because even though when economies are affected, we're not even affected as  much.  I think the biggest concern for us is the lack of regulation in what  we're doing today, and perhaps maybe too much regulation coming in which  would slow down what we're doing, because it's a gray area; it sits between  the banking, the telco regulators, and so on.  So, it's an area we're  constantly watching and working very closely with the regulators on the  ground, trying to put laws actually in places.  </p><p>In Bangladesh, for example, there are no laws against -- or with -- for  data usage.  So, when we've met government officials, they're saying, OK,  we need to understand this a bit more and how it works and what it means  for us.  So, passing laws is even, for us, a big issue because then we  can't actually grow in that market because, you know, you're not sure  what's going to happen down the road.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  My thanks to Bassim Haidar for joining us.  We'll be right  back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Music's big night last night.  The Grammy's going into the  show.  I was able to catch with Will.i.am, he's the founder of I Am Plus,  the CEO of the foundation, will.i.am, in Davos last week where we spoke  everything from A.I. to new music.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The last time we talked, you were really lifting up the  neighborhood that you grew up in -- trying to inspire young people when it  comes to science and technology, how's that going?  </p><p>WILLIAM JAMES ADAMS, FOUNDER OF I AM PLUS AND CEO OF WILL.I.AM FOUNDATION:   It's going great and it's the reason why I started I Am Plus, because if  I'm going to inner cities and telling kids that they should apply  themselves down the path of science, technology, engineering, and  mathematics.  And then I go off, and, you know, go on stage, they're going  to look at me sideways, like, Will, you know, I want to do music like you.   So, I'm like, no, you want to do tech like me.  Like, this is the way not  out of the ghetto, but to change the ghetto forever.  </p><p>Since then, you know, the company that I have, we went from, you know, when  I acquired a company out of Bangla, India after we sold beats to Apple, we  were 40 employees.  Now, we're 300 employees across six different locations  around world.  We raised $117 million.  Our A.I., voice operating system is  being used by (INAUDIBLE 54:19) telecom to improve customer service,  working alongside customer service agents, so they have A.I. to augment and  enhance experience.  So, that's really exciting.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's the next big thing?  I know you're working a lot on  artificial intelligence, where is that leading you?  </p><p>ADAMS:  So, A.I. is the next big frontier.  Right now, your iPhone is the  Internet phone and there's a bunch of Internet devices.  A.I. devices are  around the corner.  We're about to deploy ours, shortly, this year, and  really excited for our launch.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you worry that A.I. and all this machine learning that we're  talking about is leading to a loss of jobs for people?  I mean, we're  really going high-tech here in terms of machines.  </p><p>ADAMS:  Imagine it's 1918 and your family were candle stick makers, and  they've been making it for years, thousands of years -- because candles  been around forever, and lanterns, and then Nikola Tesla and Edison are  fooling around with lights.  Imagine the fear of how many jobs it's going  to replace, but just look at how many jobs it created.  Imagine you were  horse and buggy, and you made buggies and you made equipment for the farm  in 1918.  And then, Hemi Ford came around with an automobile.  Imagine how  many people were afraid of how many jobs are going to be replaced, but look  how many jobs it created.  The same is going to happen with artificial  intelligence.  We just can't imagine the jobs yet -- and the jobs are going  to come from folks that have been left behind.  When you encourage kids and  educate them around these skill sets, they will create jobs.  Co</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There's a lot of conversation here in Davos about France, about  Europe coming back economically.  Will 2018 be the year of France, the  U.S., Europe, Asia?  What do you think? </p><p>ADAMS:  My eye is on 2030.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK, why?  </p><p>ADAMS:  Because, that's when my kids will be old enough to create jobs.   The ones that I'm focused on right now, 9-year-olds, right?  So, 2030 --  I'm looking further.  I'm committed further.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you going to go to the Grammy's this year?  </p><p>ADAMS:  I'm committed further.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You don't want to talk about the Grammy's?  </p><p>ADAMS:  That was the past.  I think that was like, 20 to 40 --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean, you have enough Grammy's under your belt to  basically do what you want.  </p><p>ADAMS:  Speaking of Grammy's people are going to get up there this year and  thank everybody and their mom and ignore Edison, who's responsible for the  grammaphone which is our Grammy award.  We forget the sciences, we forget  the innovators and the inventors.  We thank everybody, God, except for the  folks that are responsible for the innovation and bringing it to life.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will.i.am, thank you so much for joining us.

Check this out.  Markets were on fire, up 223 points on the Dow,  up 95 points on the Nasdaq, up 33 on the S&amp;P.</p><p>Futures this morning, a bit of a pullback.  Take a look at the tone being  set as interest rates move higher.  Dow Industrials down 27 points, S&amp;P 500  down 6, and the Nasdaq right now down 15 points.</p><p>We are watching interest rates, the yield on the benchmark, 10-year  treasury broke above 2.7 percent for the first time since early 2014  building on Friday's gain after the fourth quarter GDP was out and it  showed growth of 2.6 percent.</p><p>In Europe this morning, the major indices are mixed -- take a look.  You've  got the FT 100, the CAC 40 and the DAX index higher across the board  actually.  But the CAC 40 and the DAX index are really fractionally moving  this morning.

That's the one.</p><p>CLINTON:  You think so?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ah, yes.

Joining me to break it all down Fox Business  Network's Dagen McDowell; PWC Partner Mitch Roschelle and pollster and  Maslanski and Partners president Lee Carter.  Great to see everybody.   Great Monday.  </p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKI AND PARTNERS:  Great to be here.  Welcome  back.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Thank you so much.  </p><p>CARTER:  I know.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Missed you -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Missed you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- a whole bunch of bunch.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have a lot to talk about this morning with the State of the  Union tomorrow night.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNERS:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Big headlines.</p><p>CARTER:  There are some big headlines.  I really think that this State of  the Union address, if his Friday speech in Davos is any indication of his  tone, his mood I think it's going to be a great one.  I think he's really  going to be focused on the American people.  I think a lot of people are  expecting him to be very, very braggadocious but I think he's really going  to turn it back and say look at the American people, look how you're  benefitting.  I'm here to fight for you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And look at the performance.  You liked the Davos speech.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I thought it was very optimistic and it was about what his  policies are doing for everyday Americans.  And it really -- it gave me  that sense of lift and of optimism.  And it wasn't about President Trump's  stock market rally.  It was about the big beautiful waterfall of the bonus  checks that come from the tax reform play and that they didn't anticipate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We tried to explain that to E.U. leader Philip Jennings on  Friday, you and I.  I don't know -- it went over his head.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I thought about that all weekend long because when you have  union leaders, they talk about workers as if the people who aren't in  unions don't work for a living.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Their jobs are not relevant, how hard they work is not relevant.   That's where that really stuck in my neck.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We were good with him.  I'll also say that.</p><p>We've got a big show this morning, coming up.  Joining the conversation:  former presidential candidate and former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee is  with us.  Trump for President senior adviser and Erick Trump's wife Lara  Trump is here.  Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano.   And singer and songwriter who made waves with her \"make America great\"  dress at the Grammys last year Joy Villa will join us as well.  Plus the  COO of Lamborghini America Alessandro Farmeschi is here with some hot  wheels on the Plaza.  Don't miss a moment of it.</p><p>And let's kick it off right here in Washington.  Countdown to the State of  the Union.  President Trump's inaugural State of the Union address is  expected to focus on the economy, on infrastructure, trade, national  security and immigration.</p><p>House minority leader Nancy Pelosi has already dismissed the commander-in- chief's immigration plan as a way to make America white again ahead of the  address.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  That plan is a campaign  to make America white again.</p><p>SENATOR JOE MANCHIN (D), WEST VIRGINIA:  We don't need that type of  rhetoric on either side from Nancy, Paul Ryan or anybody else.  And I come  down this -- the President has laid out a template.  We're going to look at  that template and we're going to work with it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now from Washington is former senior adviser  to the Clinton, Stagwell Group president, managing partner and \"Microtrends  Squared\" author Mark Penn.  Mark -- good to see you.</p><p>MARK PENN, PRESIDENT, STAGWELL GROUP:  Good morning.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you've worked on six State of the Union speeches.  What do  you want to hear or expect to hear from President Trump tomorrow night.</p><p>PENN:  Well, remember the State of the Union speech is sort of the Super  Bowl of American politics.  You've got 45 million to 60 million people who  tune in.  and it's a chance not to really reinforce the base but the  President really has to reach out to those people.  You know, he's got  favorable personal approval ratings, 42 to 44.  He's got to reach out to  the next six or 10 percent of people with the speech otherwise it's not  going to do his presidency any good at all.</p><p>So I think he's got to definitely go ahead and reinforce his record.  He's  got to reach out, I think, with those people who don't like him to show  that he's not as reckless as they think particularly on foreign affairs.   And he's got to show that he's ready for bipartisan compromise on his  issues.</p><p>Those are the goals.  And he's got to then not kill his message with tweets  or talk anything about investigations.</p><p>CARTER:  Mark -- I'll agree with you on him not killing his message with  tweets.  But I do have a question.  I know you're saying the point of this  is to reach across the aisle and get more people on board with his message.   But traditionally we've seen that State of the Union addresses don't really  have that much impact on public opinion.</p><p>Do you think this president could be different because his approval ratings  are low?</p><p>PENN:  Well, I started with President Clinton in '96, we had a tremendous  impact and I think laying down a marker like the era of big government is  over had tremendous effect.  So I disagree.  I think most of them don't  have much effect because they are consistent with everything that the  President has done.</p><p>I think people are looking to see after a year in the presidency has Trump  matured in a way that he can show.  I think that was sort of the point of  Davos.  Or is he the Trump that people really, really don't like because  he's too reckless, too divisive.  And no matter how good the economy is if  he doesn't overcome being reckless and divisive he can't get their support.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mark -- it's Dagen McDowell.  Is the President though in his  message actually helped by the negativity that you hear from some of the  Democratic leaders?  The tsk-tsk-tsk finger-wagging of Nancy Pelosi talking  about these bonuses as pathetic crumbs for the little people.  And the  little pieces of cheese that people have gotten from big corporations.</p><p>I think that that really plays into the President's hands because it shows  a complete disconnect.  And as you pointed out the Democrats keep talking  down the economy rather than trying to lift it up.</p><p>PENN:  Well look, I thought it was fascinating that Manchin came out and  actually took Pelosi on.  It's the first time I've seen that.  It suggests  he's running for reelection in West Virginia and he means it.  I think --  look, I don't think the Democratic comments are neither here nor there.  I  think they see themselves as an opposition party when it comes to these  issues and I think they've successfully challenged Trump on healthcare and  questioned his legitimacy as a president.</p><p>And I think in -- you know, he's got to really give his response here that  he is working as President, that he is working on behalf of people, that he  is improving the economy.  And that's what the battle is all about.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wait a second -- I've got to follow up here because don't you  think that there is going to be some blowback here, the fact that not just  is Nancy Pelosi out calling it crumbs and Armageddon but we are actually  seeing the impact of it.</p><p>And you're seeing company after company -- 200 plus, give out thousand- dollar bonus checks.  You're seeing companies say, ok, we're going to earn  much more than we thought so we're going to cut prices, we're going to  invest in our business.</p><p>I mean at some point will the American people want answers to the fact that  Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats in general did not vote for the tax plan.   They voted no.  And they shut the government down.</p><p>I mean to you think people are going to say we're going to want answers  going into November.  Isn't this going to bite them for being resist,  resist and not having a plan of their own.</p><p>PENN:  Well, what we've seen in our polling is that attitudes are towards  the economy and optimism about it moved up about 5 percent in the last  month.  Attitudes towards the tax plan only about a third were for it when  it passed, moved to 47 percent.</p><p>So we've seen a lot of movement in that.  I think Trump's going to have an  opportunity to try to push that further.  Look, I agree.  I always thought  that some of the Democrats particularly those in Republican states  should've voted for the tax measure and the tax measure is going to play  likely to the advantage of the Republicans.</p><p>But healthcare really is now the number one issue.  Remember, when you  solve a problem, the American public doesn't look back, they look forward.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>PENN:  Overwhelmingly healthcare is the number one issue and that's where  Democrats have a big edge.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It will be interesting to see what's more important going into  the November midterms.  Is it healthcare?  Is it the more money in people's  pockets.</p><p>We've got to ask you about the Grammys.  What did you think of what  happened last night getting political again.  Former presidential candidate  Hillary Clinton making a surprise appearance in a skit that took a jab at  the President at the awards show last night reading from an excerpt from  Michael Wolff's \"Fire and Fury\" book.</p><p>Watch this -- Mark.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLINTON:  He had a longtime fear of being poisoned.  One reason why he  likes to eat at McDonald's.  Nobody knew he was coming and the food was  safely pre-made.</p><p>CORDEN:  That's it -- we've got it.  That's the one.</p><p>CLINTON:  You think so?</p><p>CORDEN:  Oh yes.</p><p>CLINTON:  The Grammy's in the bag.</p><p>CORDEN:  In the bag.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So Mark -- there's that.  And then there's this -- more  controversy because Hillary Clinton is facing some backlash this morning  after posting a video which thanked feminists for their activism.  Warning  to viewers -- the following video contains graphic language.  Listen to  this -- Mark.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLINTON:  Let me just say this is directed to the activist bitches  supporting bitches.  So let's go.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What did you think of that -- Mark.</p><p>PENN:  Look, I think that, as you could see the crowd -- the crowd loved  Hillary there.  And I think that she has been consistent, you know, in the  opposition that she has expressed to Trump and the belief that the election  was unfair.</p><p>Look, I suggest that I'm really at a loss to understand why the networks  let their award shows devolve into political shows.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I certainly agree with you.</p><p>PENN:  I think the American public likes political combat.  There is no  problem seeing Trump and Hillary go at it.  But the question is where.</p><p>And I just am at a loss to understand why networks think they're going to  get a bigger viewership if they let these shows devolve into political or,  you know, late night comedy shows.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's not just that though.  It's the other one -- the  video that she posted.  I don't know.  What did you think?</p><p>You are a message person and you know how things resonate.</p><p>CARTER:  Yes.  No -- well, I think it's just going to reinforce her base.   I don't think it's going to do anything.</p><p>I mean most candidates sort of go away in to the sunset after a loss.  She  is not letting it go.  But neither are the American people who voted for  her.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And what was on -- </p><p>CARTER:  And I think she's just hanging on -- hanging on to relevance.  We  think it's what you're saying -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mark -- you say she's upset about the election was unfair.   What do you mean?  What was unfair?</p><p>PENN:  Well look, I -- look, she wrote an entire book on that so I'm not  going to review it.  I think she's not running for anything.  So I think  she feels freed from having to go out and get votes and say exactly what  she thinks.  And I think she was right to take a plum opportunity like that  at the Grammy shows.</p><p>My question is whether the networks really want to turn every hour of every  minute into a political show.</p><p>CARTER:  So my question to you, Mark, though is if you think that these  kinds of award shows and these statements by artist had any sway on public  opinion and support of Democrats.</p><p>PENN:  No.  I mean I don't really think they do.  I think people know where  Hollywood stands.  I think -- look a lot of people question Hollywood,  question the morality of Hollywood.  After all Weinstein was Hollywood's  leader.</p><p>So I think they understand that and think that they're almost somewhat  puzzled by that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  A Hollywood leader who was notorious for his poor  treatment of women that they basically covered up for -- for almost 40  years -- Mark.  I just want to point that out.</p><p>PENN:  You're not going to get any disagreement from me on that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, absolute.</p><p>All right.  Mark -- good to see you, sir.  Thanks so much.</p><p>PENN:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mark Penn joining us.</p><p>Coming up, hackers hitting the jackpot -- get this, the world's largest ATM  makers are warning of a new heist to make the machines spit out cash like a  slot machine.  Why the attacks could get worse in the United States.  We've  got all the details and what to know.</p><p>Then new proof that Elon Musk is the highest name in technology.  The Tesla  co-founder now is selling flame throwers -- why his underground drilling  company is selling the dangerous new gadget.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>The United States Secret Service targeting a new type of bank robbery.  </p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details.  And this is a scary one -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  It's crazy -- Maria.</p><p>It is called jackpotting.  So get this -- criminals insert a wire into an  ATM using a medical scope.  Then they attach their laptop to it and then  they upload a virus into it.  This causes the ATM to spew cash out at a  rate of 40 bills every 23 seconds.  A group of thieves have already stolen  more than a million dollars here in the United States.  The Secret Service  has sent a warning to banks about these thieves.  This particular strain of  malware first spotted in Mexico back in 2013.  It's said to be very  sophisticated.</p><p>Well, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, has fined three  major European banks millions of dollars each for manipulation of the U.S.  futures market.  Reuters reporting the lenders are UBS, HSBC and Deutsche  Bank.  The banks were accused of spoofing where a buy or sell order is put  in on the futures contract but it's canceled right before the trade is  executed, hence its manipulation.  This is a criminal offense.</p><p>The fine is handed out after a multi-agency investigation that involves the  Justice Department and the FBI.  According to Reuters, we should say UBS  self-reported the manipulation they found within their own bank.  Shares of  UBS, we should say also up about 24 percent from a year ago.</p><p>Well, the long awaited Aramco IPO is going to have to wait a little bit  longer.  The hold-up appears to be that Saudi Arabia's state owned oil  producer isn't sure where to list.  \"Wall Street Journal\" says the crown  prince Muhammad bin Salman prefers the New York Stock Exchange but advisers  won.  And that could expose the Kingdom to lawsuits where shareholders are  9/11 victims.</p><p>Maria, of course -- Maria spoke to the crown prince back in October about  the future of oil.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MUHAMMAD BIN SALMAN, CROWN PRINCE OF SAUDI ARABIA:  Like we know the demand  is not only in energy.  Many of the other sectors use oil like the two  chemicals and many other sectors.  We believe that the demand for energy  increase dramatically in or the future.  So we don't think that it will  decrease the demand for oil.  It will increase between 230 to 240 -- 2030  to 2040.  And it will not immediately collapse.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Meanwhile shares of Prince Al Waleed's kingdom holding are  bouncing back this morning following the prince's release as part of a  government crackdown on corruption last year.  The stock has risen 15  percent since the Prince was allowed to leave the Ritz Carlton Hotel in  Riyadh on Saturday.  He and several other hundred people were, of course,  held here.  The Prince was set free after reaching a settlement with the  government ending the three month detention -- Maria.  You spoke with  Prince al Waleed over the weekend, we understand.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I did actually and he sounded good.  I spoke with him on  Saturday.  He had been home about.  And he said he wasn't mistreated.  He  stayed in the same suite and the Ritz Carlton was never moved to a high  security prison.  And he said that there were no charges and no money paid.  </p><p>Now, this is pretty extraordinary given the fact that we've seen other  princes and other royals having to give up part of their fortune.  And in  fact Prince Al Waleed told me in no uncertain words there is absolutely no  charges and there is no money being paid and he will keep control of  kingdom holdings.</p><p>It's extraordinary that he was able to do this.  He really held his ground.   And he says he agrees with the Crown Prince, what he's doing.  And he  supports the crown prince.  Obviously what is he going to say.  But he has  been in prison quote-unquote since early November and said that it was  never a high security prison and that he's fine.</p><p>I mean the pictures of him, I saw a picture of him in my mind.  He looked  obviously quite haggard but he said that in his suite at the Four Seasons  in Riyadh.  He had the meals that he wanted.  He was not mistreated.  What  else is he going to say, I guess?  I mean, you know.</p><p>CARTER:  Right.  I mean if you're going to be held it's not a place to be  held.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But there was no money charged.  It's extraordinary to me that  he did not have to give up any money or any power of his firms.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Maria -- after a week of incredible interviews, again, you're  still just -- we're in, working the phone.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I was texting on the plane when I knew that he was actually  home.  So I texted and everybody here at Fox said look I know and I can  confirm that Prince al Waleed is home.  He's been home for two hours.</p><p>And then by the time I e-mailed to everybody I texted.  But then I sent a  follow-up e-mail but then it was out.  I mean everybody knew that he had  gone home.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No one works harder than you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It was a big deal.  It was a big deal, I think because he's  sort of the face of the Mideast as it relates to the west.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he has made so much money so people will say what did he  do?  Why is he still in prison?  No doubt that was a little pressure on the  Crown Prince.  So it's fascinating.</p><p>Coming up, the Eagles have landed.  The team touching down in Minneapolis  ahead of the Super Bowl while pranksters turn a Philadelphia landmark in to  a Patriots fan.  Wait until you see this.</p><p>Plus Jeff Bezos going to the big game.  The Amazon founder and CEO taking a  starring role in the company's latest Super Bowl ad.  We have a first look  at the new gig.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>With the Super Bowl less than a week away, the Eagles have landed in  Minneapolis.  Jared Max with the story -- Jared.</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS:  Yes.  Maria -- Eagles land and the Patriots  fly today.  The Eagles have been underdogs this entire postseason but a lot  of money in Vegas going on Philly, the point-spread down from Patriots  minus 5.5 to Pats minus 4.5.</p><p>So the Eagles have landed and the Patriots will land today.  They held one  final practice in Foxboro, Mass yesterday.  Twelve stitches removed from  Tom Brady's hand.  Rob Gronkowski back in in practice from his concussion.   The Patriots are going to hold a rally today in Foxboro and then fly to  Minneapolis.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Go Adrian.</p><p>MAX:  What is this Tom Brady statue doing on the chest.  The sight of this  might not sit well with Eagles fans but, you know, somebody did the same  thing with the Vikings jersey in Philly before the NFC title game and the  Vikings got crushed by the Eagles.</p><p>For those who watch the Super Bowl primarily for the commercials here's a  sneak peek at an Amazon Echo spot with Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  So what do you want to (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  In Austin, it's 60 degrees -- </p><p>JEFF BEZOS, CEO, AMAZON:  Amazon' Alexa lost her voice this morning.</p><p>Alexa lost her voice.  How is that even possible?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We have the replacements ready, you just say the  word.</p><p>BEZOS:  Are you sure this is going to work?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX:  Hey Alexa -- did you see what Tiger Woods had to contend with while  putting on the 13th green yesterday?  Watch.</p><p>It's a golf tournament, not a beer pong blowout but it continues.  Tiger  missed the pot.  He birdied the next whole, finished even par yesterday at  the Farmer' Insurance Open.  Now Tiger minus three for the tournament.  The  first time since August 2015 he finishes four complete rounds at a PGA  event.</p><p>So Alex Norton and Jason Day are going to finish the longest playoff ever  at the history of this tournament today in its-67-year history.  They're  tied, going through a sixth playoff whole.</p><p>Instead of publicly criticizing his son's basketball coach for the Lakers  LeVar Ball coached his other two sons yesterday in Lithuania.  It was the  last game of the big baller challenge, the exhibition series.  LeVar  coached his boys LeAngelo and La Mello.

Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo and it is Monday, January 29th; your top stories right now, 7:30  a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>The battle over the secret FISA and memo may come to an end today, the  House Intelligence Committee could vote this afternoon over whether to  release the shocking memo that alleges FBI surveillance abuses.</p><p>Meanwhile questions over the Mueller probe, controversy is swirling over  the investigation a made a report that President Trump considered firing  Mueller over the summer.  Here's what House Judiciary Chairman, Congressman  Bob Goodlatte told me this Sunday on SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R-VA), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  He should  continue his investigation but it has to be done with propriety and it has  to be done with impartiality and there are a lot of questions that are not  answered at this point.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be following that.</p><p>Meanwhile Futures worsening right now, peak in (ph), pointing to weakness  at the start of trading, this is a low of the morning right here, Dow  Industrials down 60 points, a quarter of a percent; the NASDAQ down 25, a  third of a percent.</p><p>Lockheed Martin earnings just hit the tape and they are there better than  expected, the stock is up 2 1/2 percent.</p><p>The market moves to watch is interest rates and the - and bonds, the yield  on the 10-Year Treasury topping 2.7 percent for the first time since 2014,  that's one of the reasons that markets are having some trouble this  morning; there's the yield on the 10-year at 2.72 percent up five basis  points.</p><p>All this after another record-setter on Friday, strong corporate earnings  led the market then and as you see the Dow Industrials gained another 200  points, up almost one percent; the S&amp;P was up better than one percent; as  was the NASDAQ as at 1 1/4 percent, 95 points higher, that's on Friday.</p><p>This morning, pulling back, global markets are also mixed.  Take a look,  European indices are pretty much mixed, FT 100 up 15; CAC krone up just two  points; but the DAX Index in Germany down, a fraction, 18 points lower.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets closed mostly lower with the exception of Korea,  KOSPI Index up almost one percent.</p><p>Earnings in focus this morning, the busiest week of fourth-quarter earnings  season has begun and that is this week.</p><p>Lockheed Martin kicks things off with earnings which beat analysts'  expectations both on earnings and revenues as you can see, the stock is up  almost four percent right here on Lockheed Martin, that's after a great  year by the way of these Defense contracts just simply rallying.  Dr Pepper  Snapple also up 25 percent, as you can see.</p><p>Meanwhile Hillary Clinton makes a surprise appearance at the Grammys last  night, she appeared in a skit, slamming the president and now  administration officials are fighting back; they're angry.</p><p>Plus, Singer Joy Villa makes waves of her own on the red carpet again,  check out this dress; her dress gets political.</p><p>She's going to join us later to explain that dress and what she was trying  to do.</p><p>Plus, there is this, Elon Musk does it again, his offer to sell  flamethrowers going viral, thousands already sold on preorder.  </p><p>We will have (ph) - we have this breaking news and that is why we showed  you Dr Pepper's share; Dr Pepper Snapple and Keurig Green Mountain are  merging.  Dr Pepper Snapple shareholders will receive a $103 .75 share and  a special cash dividend and retain 13 percent of the combined company, the  current CEO of Keurig will serve as chief executive officer of the combined  company.</p><p>And Dr Pepper Snapple shares are jumping on the news, take a look, Dr  Pepper Snapple right now up 28 percent on this take out, Keurig Green  Mountain merging with Dr Pepper Snapple.</p><p>Meanwhile concerns over privacy, the House Intelligence Committee will meet  at 5:00 p.m. Eastern today and could potentially vote on releasing the FISA  memo which alleges government surveillance abuses.</p><p>Yesterday Congressman Trey Gowdy weighed in on whether the memo should be  made available to the public, he joins FOX NEWS SUNDAY, watch?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP.  HAROLD WATSON \"TREY\" GOWDY III (R-SC), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE  COMMITTEE:  If you think your viewers want to know whether or not the  dossier was used in court proceedings, whether or not it was vetted before  it was used, whether or not it has ever been vetted, if you're interested  in who paid for the dossier, if you're interested in Christopher Steele's  relationship with Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee,  then yes, you'll want the memo to come out.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, interesting questions there, FOX NEWS Senior Judicial  Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano joins us right now.</p><p>Do you agree Judge?</p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  I basically -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - good morning to you?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  - do agree but very interesting the manner in which he  answered Chris Wallace's question, is basically a summary of what's in the  dossier.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Now how does he know what's in there, he is one of the three  people that wrote it so it is -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Who read it.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  - 'wrote' it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  It is basically a four-page summary of hundreds and hundreds  of pages of raw intelligence data.</p><p>Last week at this time I was furious because we learned that the House  Intelligence Committee was aware of this for months and sat on it during  the debate on the Expansion of FISA and I argued that the rest of Congress,  all 535 members of both Houses, not just the 22 on the House Judiciary -  Intelligence Committee, should be aware that the NSA and the FBI according  to this memo have abused the FISA authorities we've - we've given them.</p><p>Congress should have been aware of that at the time he voted.</p><p>It wasn't, this came out the day President Trump signed the FISA Expansion  into law; fast-forward, can the Committee release it on its own?</p><p>\"No,\" because it is based on top-secret and secret materials, only the  president on his own can declassify.</p><p>So, after they vote, and they probably will, it's 13:9, Republicans over  Democrats on this Committee, after that - the Committee votes to release  it, it goes to the president who has already said, I don't know if he has  personally seen it but he's already said, 'he wants it out there' and he'll  declassify it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  That is going to provoke another memo, written by the  Democrats on the Committee based on the same documentation and we're going  to have two competing memos which causes me to say, 'let us see the data'  on which both memos, the one that exists, the one that the Democrats are  crafting, is based.</p><p>The government shouldn't treat us like children -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  - we have a right to see these documents and come to our own  conclusions, independently of what the Republicans want us to believe and  what the Democrats want us to believe.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It seems that the Democrats are trying to cloud the story with  another memo?</p><p>Let's face it, if that memo indicates that they used the dossier as  justification to wiretap Donald Trump and his entire campaign, American  people should know it.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Let's face it, if the memo shows that any of the 60,000  domestic spies that work for the NSA or the hundreds and hundreds of FBI  agents who work in the Intelligence Division of the FBI abused the  authority that the government has given them, we need to know who abused  the authority, we need to know who knows about it, we need to know who  looked the other way, and we need to know why nothing was done about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT MASLANSKY + PARTNERS &amp; POLLSTER:  Then how come -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right -</p><p>CARTER:  - (INAUDIBLE) -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - this story is outrageous to me because you know, who - if we  can't trust the FBI to actually be impartial to just do their job - and I  want to just say, a lot of the people at the FBI are great people and they  had no knowledge of any of this -</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Agreed.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - but the top of the FBI was clearly complicit.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Agreed, agreed and the public has the right to know it.</p><p>That if -- this really has very little to do with Mueller, although this  may give Bob Mueller as Trey Gowdy has said and Lindsey Graham has said  over the weekend, something else to investigate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well this is -</p><p>CARTER:  - Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - this is - you know, this is a really good point that you  bring up, I'm wondering how much of this Bob Mueller is looking at because  he could turn around and say, 'no, no, no, these texts are not my mandate,'  but these texts between these two FBI agents, Lisa Page and Peter Strauch  are so damning.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I read recently, I think it was last Thursday or Friday, the  charge that Bob Mueller has, it's only a page long, the language in it is  so vague, it would allow him to go almost anywhere, the -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  - House Committee can indict Paul Manafort for money- laundering in - </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But what about these two (ph) -</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -  2014.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - what about these two, are they going to be in accountability  (ph) you think, Peter Strauch, I mean they - they're -</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  (INAUDIBLE) -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - basically hiding evidence, destroying evidence, they - there  are more texts to come out.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  - I don't - I don't think they've committed a crime, they are  certainly subject to some sort of discipline -</p><p>Bartiromo, but what about the 'secret society,' what about the 'insurance  policy'?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  well they're going to - they're going to have to -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that that -</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  - explain that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - a crime?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  It is - it is not a crime to use those words and it's not a  crime to meet outside the Justice Department and say that 'we love Hillary,  we don't like Donald Trump.'</p><p>It would be a crime to hide evidence.</p><p>It would be a crime to exonerate somebody you know, there's evidence of  guilt a-la (ph) Mrs. Clinton -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  - so that might well be another area -- people that want  Mueller to go away but he - but they - we just keep finding treasure troves  of areas that compel investigation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right but no real evidence of any collusion between Donald  Trump and the Russians which is -</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  No (ph) -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - initially why -</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  - evidence (ph).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - Robert Mueller was hired.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  We have -</p><p>Bartiromo lots of new nuggets but nothing that he was actually supposed to  look at.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  - Right now he's interested in 'obstruction of justice' which  could only have occurred after Donald Trump became president, the alleged  collusion and the legal word is 'conspiracy' could only have occurred be -  during the campaign -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  - so, he's got two different areas he's now examining and it  looks like there may soon be a third.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Did you want to say something Lee?</p><p>CARTER:  I just -</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  (INAUDIBLE) -</p><p>CARTER:  - (INAUDIBLE) -</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  - (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  These are complicated subjects and we need -</p><p>CARTER:  - I just wanted -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  to talk to them now (ph).</p><p>CARTER:  - to know how Republicans and Democrats can interpret the same  data differently?</p><p>It's as if -</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>CARTER:  - just (ph) I mean -</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  (INAUDIBLE) -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  (INAUDIBLE) ignoring the FBI texts.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  - That's why we should be able to see the data and if they  don't reveal the data, I have encouraged some courageous member of the  Committee, I don't know who, to do what Senator Feinstein did with the  CIA's Torture Report that the House - that the Senate Intelligence  Committee voted not to reveal.</p><p>She brought it to the floor of the Senate and revealed it and we all  learned what happened with the CIA torture of people and the sun came up  the next day.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  The government didn't collapse.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  We have the right to know the intelligence data on which these  two different interpretations are based and because you can't be harmed,  prosecuted, or civilly sued for what you say on the floor of the House of  the Senate.</p><p>I want somebody to bring that stuff to the floor of the House and display  it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well Congressman Trey Gowdy is also suggesting that FBI  officials, Peter Strauch and Lisa Page should testify over these anti-Trump  text messages that they said to one another in response to lawmaker's  concerns that they could have protected Hillary Clinton from criminal  charges over her emails.</p><p>Congressman Goodlatte, weighed in with me yesterday on SUNDAY MORNING  FUTURES.  Here's what he said?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP.  HAROLD WATSON \"TREY\" GOWDY III (R-SC), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE OVERSIGHT AND  GOVERNMENT REFORM COMMITTEE &amp; CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:   These two witnesses need to come in and tell us what they meant by it and  everything they also said over the course of 18 months -</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R-VA), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  - because  there are tens of thousands of great men and women who every day keep us  safe, prevent terrorist attacks, solve crimes, at the FBI but they are  being besmirched by several people in the leadership of the FBI that have a  shocking contrast in the way they took - the approach they took to the  Clinton investigation and the one there've taken to the Trump investigation  -</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NAPOLITANO:   So, the FBI has three committees it answers to, you just saw  the chair - the chairs of two of them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, Goodlatte and -</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  They, right, they want -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - and Gowdy.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  - to know what was going on in the FBI at the time Mrs.  Clinton was being investigated.</p><p>It is absolutely proper for them to bring those FBI agents and others in  and say, 'what did you mean by this, how did you -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  - come to this decision?\"</p><p>The American public is entitled to know.</p><p>On top of that, I have said this before, I've said it before on your show,  Jeff Sessions, the Attorney General can and in my view, should re-examine  the evidence against her, assign it to a fresh team of FBI agents, and  federal prosecutors, and decide whether or not it should be presented to a  grand jury because the mechanism for exonerating her, every time you look  at it, appears to have been more and more corrupt.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It sure does.</p><p>And you know, what's the 'secret society'?  After Donald Trump wins, it's  time to get the 'secret society' de-texted (ph).</p><p>You know, what -- it's -</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - time for the 'insurance policy' - is the 'insurance policy'  the Mueller probe -</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  - I hope that -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - (INAUDIBLE) - </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  - stuff -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - investigation after investigation leading you nowhere?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  - Yes.  Having lived in the law enforcement community so to  speak when I was on the bench, I'm familiar with their 'gallows humor' and  sometimes candidly, I participated in it myself obviously, off the record  before the appellate courts run all over me, I hope that this is a joke,  this 'secret society' and 'insurance policy.' </p><p>But if it isn't, we have to know about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Nothing funny about any of this.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  A lot of jokes (INAUDIBLE) -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  'Trusting our agencies, in freedom.'</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  - Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Judge, thank you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Uh, a pleasure, thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Judge Napolitano.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>Striking a sour note at the Grammys, Hillary Clinton makes a surprise  appearance to sound off, how she sparks 'Fire and Fury' on the music  industry's biggest night.</p><p>And then first he set his sights on electric cars, then space travel, now  Elon Musk gets into the flame-throwing business, the dangerous new product  from his underground drilling company, back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Elon Musk now adding flame-thrower salesman to his resume.</p><p>Lauren Simonetti with all the details now, Lauren, good morning?</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  Remember the Scarface lines (ph), 'say  hello to my little friend,' Elon Musk is literally all fired up, here you  go, take a look at this quick video on his Instagram?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT:  **DO NOT DO THIS**</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  And then he captions it, \"Don't Do This,\" also I want to be  clear that a flame-thrower is a super terrible idea, definitely don't buy  one unless you like fun.</p><p>Well on his Twitter account, 7,000 people like fun because already in this,  hours, they've raised 3 1/2 million dollars by selling pre-orders for 7,000  of these $500 flamethrowers.</p><p>Why?</p><p>To raise money for another one of Elon Musk's companies, which is literally  called \"The Boring Company,\" as in to 'bore a tunnel.'</p><p>What he wants to do, he's very ambitious as you guys know, is he's doing  (ph) you know, flying cars, well how about taking transportation, getting  people literally from New York to Washington, D.C. in under half an hour by  building this underground road of - roadway of tunnels, and to do so in a  cheaper manner; the hat you were just looking at, another way that they  funded this company.</p><p>So, there you have it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I am - I'm glad you explained 'boring'- </p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER &amp; BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT LEADER:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - because I'll be honest with you, I didn't even realize that  was the name (INAUDIBLE) people calling it boring.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Because it's \"The Boring Company,\"-</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  - no; flamethrowers are not boring.</p><p>The other part of this story is, is because we're talking about this  company, he also has \"SpaceX,\" as you guys know and next week February 6th,  they are launching, this is five years in the making, the Falcon Heavy  Rocket, this is the most powerful rocket in the entire world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  During the launch they - they're going to launch a Tesla car, I  mean why not, right he's got that company too but eventually you know, the  Air Force plans to use this to bring satellites into orbit.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fascinating stuff.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  February 6th.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Incredible.</p><p>Lauren, thank you.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we'll take a break.</p><p>When we come back, music's biggest night gets political last night.</p><p>What a surprise, Hillary Clinton strikes a chord by taking a dig at  President Trump, the appearance sparking 'Fire and Fury' for some, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER FIRST LADY, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE, 2016  DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  He had a long-time fear of being  poisoned, one reason why he liked to eat at McDonald's, nobody knew he was  coming and the food was safely pre-made.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:   That's it.

I use activism for my own personal value  system.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good for you.</p><p>VILLA:  Yes.</p><p>CARTER:  I was going to ask you how you came up with that topic and that  theme for your dress, that is one of (ph) very, very, personal, now -</p><p>VILLA:  Absolutely.</p><p>CARTER:  -one of the things that I'm always curious about and you're saying  you get a lot of hate on that, and there are -</p><p>VILLA:  Yes.</p><p>CARTER:  - people who are saying that the Grammys in general were to  political.</p><p>VILLA:  Oh yes.</p><p>CARTER:  How do you feel about using that platform for politics?</p><p>VILLA:  Well I think that it can be great if it's for something  constructive.</p><p>The problem is most celebrities are using the red carpet, using the  Grammys, for something that is destructive you know, something that they  hate like Hillary Clinton reading, \"Fire and Fury,\" there is nothing  positive about that, it's not - she's not launching something that's pro- women or whatever she's you know, into which I'm frankly haven't heard  enough about her.</p><p>But you know, do something, use your platform to do something positive;  what are you doing for the inner cities, instead of just talking about  using a hashtag, using minorities as a prop, that's what we see from a lot  of liberals and a lot of self-obsessed elites, (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm encouraged, you (ph) stick your neck out like that Joy.</p><p>VILLA:  Thank you -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VILLA:  - so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It really does.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Joy, do you think the award shows in general are just sort of  gone over the edge in terms of how political they've become?</p><p>VILLA:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mitch was at the Grammys also, by the way.</p><p>VILLA:  Oh, you were?</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Your seat may have been better than mine though.</p><p>VILLA:  I missed you there.</p><p>We passed each other on the red carpet -</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  I was not -</p><p>VILLA:  - right?</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  - on the red carpet.</p><p>VILLA:  Not with a pro-life suit?</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  No.</p><p>VILLA:  That would've been cool.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  I wasn't (ph).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There were - I mean -</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - because people are mad, I mean -</p><p>VILLA:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - when you see all those politicizations and things like (ph) -</p><p>VILLA:  Oh yes -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  - that (ph).</p><p>VILLA:  - it takes us out of the fantasy, it takes us out of something that  was meant to be a relief from politics because there's so much in-fighting  in politics right but when we see that people get political, it takes us  away from something that should be a relief from the stress of life -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VILLA:  - and they're using it in a really negative way, there's nothing  positive about what they keep doing at these you know, award shows.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Does it stop you, does it - does it push you down in terms of,  'OK, you know, what?

Good Monday  morning everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and  it is Monday January 29th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the  East Coast.  Getting tough on trade, President Trump's America First  message already being tested as Mexico and Canada have rejected a proposal  by the White House to rework a key part of the North American Free Trade  Agreement.  This comes as the Commander-in-Chief  targets Europe this  morning signaling possible payback over what he calls unfair trade policies  with the European Union.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I had a lot of problems with  European Union and it may work into something very big from that  standpoint, from the trade standpoint.  The European Union has treated the  United States very unfairly when it came to trade.  The European Union has  been very, very unfair to the United States and I think it will turn out to  be very much to their -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The president will address the trade debate as well as the U.S.  economic boom during the first State of the Union Address since taking  office where it takes place tomorrow night.  We will have it for you live  9:00 p.m. Eastern right here on the Fox Business Network.  The address  comes as major indices all closed at record levels again on Friday.  </p><p>Take a look at the momentum, Dow Industrials up almost one percent, 223  points higher, S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ both up better than one percent on  Friday.  This morning a bit of a pullback from those record high levels  take a look Dow Industrials expected to be down about 55 points of the  opening of trading a quarter of a percent lower.  S&amp;P 500 also down almost  a third of a percent and the NASDAQ weaker by 22 points that's one-third of  one percent.  </p><p>It is a merger Monday of sorts on Wall Street Dr. Pepper Snapple and Keurig  Green Mountain announcing plans to merge.  Dr. Pepper Snapple shareholders  will receive 103.57 share in special cash dividends and retain 13 percent  of a combined company.  Check out the movement of stock Dr. Pepper Snapple  shares up to 35 percent right now.  Investors are also eyeing orange from  several key names this week, this is one of the busiest weeks so far for  the fourth quarter.  Lockheed Martin both earnings and revenue topped  expectations and the stock this morning is up 3 and quarter percent.  The  defense contract just have been soaring over last year.  </p><p>In Europe this morning, the market look like this, take a look, FTSE 100 up  a quarter of a percent, 16 points higher.  CAC Quarante is up a fraction  and the DAX index is down a fraction.  In Asia overnight, stocks were  mostly lower with the exception of Korea which is up one percent.  Apple  may take a bite out of the iPhone, a new report that claims the technology  giant may cut iPhone X production in half in the first quarter not doing as  well as they thought I guess.  </p><p>Is technology putting our troops in danger?  The new concern over a fitness  app that's used on devices like Fitbit.  They are basically indicating  exactly where our troops are in the Middle East plus Hillary Clinton uses  the Grammy stage to mock President Trump.  The appearance that's leaving  many feelings fire and fury this morning.  All the stories coming up this  Monday morning.</p><p>And joining me to break it all down, Dagen McDowell, Fox Business Network,  it's Dagen McDowell, PwC partner Mitch Roschelle, and Pollster and the  President of Maslansky and Partners, Lee Carter.  Good to see you.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  It's great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lots to talk about today and the State of the Union.  </p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER:  Oh yes.  Busy week.  </p><p>CARTER:  Whoo-hoo.  I'm really excited about the State of the Union, you  know.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, me too.  We have the State of the Union, we got the FOMC  coming out on Wednesday, no interest rate increases expected yet a huge  amount of earnings and then the jobs numbers are on Friday.  So yes it's a  busy week.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Right.  And we keep an eye on  the 10 year treasury yield because again it -- this is why trade policy and  interest rate policy inflation all of wraps up to create some concerns for  the market.  From here, you know, to talk down the dollar you heard that  from treasury secretary last week.  Again lower dollar means we are  importing inflation that means what does the federal reserve it, that means  that we could have higher interest rates this country cannot afford  significantly higher interest rates given the levels of debt that were  riding and therein lies the problem because Washington won't do anything  about these looming problems in terms of the national debt because we're  facing a tsunami.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you know, they're not going to do anything about it  during an election year, right?  Forget about that.  By the way, I know  that you don't want to have the treasury secretary talking down anything or  talking up anything for that matter.  And you mentioned the op-ed and the  journal the other day, but don't you in some ways Steven Mnuchin was saying  what was so obvious what every administration feels anyway from the  beginning of time that yes, a weaker dollar is better for trade, it's just  that they don't say it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You can say it if you're not the treasury secretary and you can  think it if you're the treasury secretary but when it comes to the United  States dollar our dear greenback, you just say we support a strong dollar  policy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is every administration has said but they don't do things  to indicate that's really how they feel that's what I am saying, I feel  like they all think it he just said it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And by the way President Trump can say whatever he wants but  maybe his cabinet members need to rethink that strategy.  </p><p>BARTIROMOR:  Yes, you don't think anybody believed the walk back, do you?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, not at all.  Not safe.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- this morning, former presidential candidate and former  Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee is joining us.  He'll be with us  momentarily, Eric Trump's wife, President Trump's daughter-in-law Lara  Trump for president, senior-adviser Lara Trump is here and the COO of  Lamborghini America Alessandro Farmeschi is joining us as well, host of  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney as well is here weighing in.  Don't miss a  moment of it.  First now, let's kick it off with the top stories this hour.   Trump administration's trade agenda Canada and Mexico are now rejecting a  proposal from the White House to rework a key part of NAFTA.  Meanwhile,  President Trump is hinting at retaliation against the E.U. from what he  says is very unfair trade practices.  Blake Burman is live at the White  House the very latest.  Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Well, so much for all  the niceties coming out of Davos.  Maria, good morning to you as well,  President Trump giving an interview to Piers Morgan that was shot during  world the economic forum but aired for the first time yesterday and in it  the president saying that he has a lot of problems with European Union.   The president saying on the trade standpoint that, we can't get our  products in and the U.S. products come in at a very low taxable rate.  The  president saying that this could quote morph into something very big from a  trade standpoint.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>D. TRUMP:  The European Union has treated the United States very unfairly  when it came to trade, they are not the only ones by the way, I could name  many countries and places that do -- but the European Union has been very,  very unfair to the United States and I think it will turn out to be very  much to their detriment.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  Meantime, the Wall Street journal is reporting Mexico and Canada  rejected a proposal from the U.S. to change the corporate arbitration  system that is wrapped into NAFTA, it's called the investor state dispute  settlement and that deals with arbitration claims from companies within all  three countries.  Maria, as you know when he spoke to the commerce  secretary, Wilbur Ross on set there in Davos last week.  He said things are  just beginning from the negotiating standpoint as it relates to NAFTA.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Blake, thanks very much.  We will keep following  that.  Joining us right now is former presidential candidate from Arkansas  Governor Fox News contributor Mike Huckabee.  Governor, it's good to see  you.  Thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR:  Well, thank you Maria.  Great to  be with you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, your reaction here as we know that Canada and Mexico are  rejecting this proposal to rework the arbitration part of the NAFTA  agreement.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, I'm sure they would but I think they also have to  understand that Donald Trump is elected in large measure because he said he  would renegotiate the trade deals make it more fair for the United States.   None of these trade deals came from Mount Sinai, they weren't on Two  Tablets of Stone, they all have the provision that they are made to be  changed and to be updated as the economy changes, as conditions change and  I think this president should be commended for saying you know what our job  is to protect America, American jobs, American economy, we are going to do  that, we want to trade that is all an important part of growth.  But it's  got to be where it's reciprocal and fair.  Bravo to the president for doing  exactly what he said something were not used to seeing politicians often  do.  </p><p>CARTER:  So governor, I have a question for you.  You know, there is so  much talk about how these trade policies -- if we don't get a deal on it  might harm U.S.  What about these other countries, if they don't do a deal  with us, is it going to hurt them as well? </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Of course it would Lee.  And I think that's something that maybe  needs to be said a whole lot more.  I don't hear a lot of people saying  what you just said and thank you for saying it because some of these  countries they've got a whole lot more to lose than we do.  Because they  are utterly dependent upon our dollars buying their products and if we  decide look, you guys aren't playing fair so, you know, we'll look  elsewhere.  It's going to put them in a world of hurt, it is really a  position of strength that the president looks at.  And this is not a  president who sees America as weak, a country we have to apologize for,  even our economic strength is not a weakness it is something that we should  be proud of and we got there by capitalism.  Capitalism is a good thing, it  empowers people, it helps poor people to become not so poor people and  without it we end up like Venezuela.  I think we got a great model to say  to the rest of the world you want to be better off?  Be capitalist, it  works.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Governor, it is Dagen McDowell but some of these policies that  the world doesn't exist in a vacuum that these other countries when you --  you have to say these tariffs that were slapped on solar cells and washing  machines just last week that actually does impact jobs here in the United  States.  The jobs created by companies like Samsung and the very red state  of South Carolina, you have higher prices on washing machines, you've  already heard that from L.G. Electronics so again this actually is done  poorly and this is kind of a little willy-nilly side thing with the small  tariffs.  It's not -- it's not the sky is falling.  But again it can hurt  Americans if executed improperly or poorly.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Short term that may be true but long term a trade deal where  everybody is playing with the same rules is like playing the Super Bowl  where everyone has to play within same rules.  If one team gets special  treatment and the other team doesn't that is not a fair game, you don't  know who the champion is.  So short term there may be some, you know, some  pain.  But the long term is the prices are more realistically reflecting  what it cost to produce something, it does mean that Americans have a  chance to compete to make those very things.  But Americans need to make  things, we always have to be able to do some things that if we don't we  can't be free.  Provide our own energy, make our own food, be able to feed  ourselves and to be able to fight for ourselves which means we manufacture  our weaponry and items of defense.  Manufacturing is a critical part not  just of our economy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  But quite frankly without it, we can't be free.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we already saw L.G. get back and say look we are going to  raise prices.  Now, obviously if there are going to be tariffs on certain  products these companies just going to raise prices.  So that's going to be  a negative for consumers having said that there is real impact from this  tax plan that's very positive.  And yet house minority leader Nancy Pelosi  continues to criticize it.  She's getting a criticism from even within her  own party governor after dismissing the president's immigration plan, she's  now calling it make America white again proposal.  Listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NANCY PELOSI, UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVE, MINORITY LEADER:  That  plan is a campaign to make America white again.  </p><p>SEN. JOE MANCHIN (D) WV:  We don't need that type of rhetoric either side.   From Nancy, Paul Ryan, or anybody else and I come down this, the president  has laid out a template.  We are going to look at that template and we are  going to work with it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know governor before we get your reaction, I got to get the  panel's reaction.  I mean what --she is not doing anything that is showing  progress for her party.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean she keeps -- making America white crumbs like you said  Armageddon.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Armageddon, this pathetic little crumbs, a thousand dollars is  pathetic crumbs to her.  It's a little piece of cheese.  I think that she  is doubling down but she doesn't -- she sounds moronic and she's doubling  down on these comments.  I don't understand in what universe she thinks  that this resonates with the American people.  Let me say this again, a  thousand dollars is more than 20 tanks of gas, a thousand dollars can feed  a family of four in this country for nearly a month and she lives in a  bubble that is San Francisco.  </p><p>CARTER:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's absolutely true.  Governor, your reaction?  Jump in here.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, I tell you Nancy Pelosi is making Marie Antoinette look  like Mary Poppins.  Oh my gosh, to say the things that she says that is so  condescending, so insulting to working class people.  Now that's a group of  people Nancy Pelosi doesn't relate to, doesn't understand because she lives  above them but as Dagen was pointing out and I think so very graphically, a  thousand dollars to a family who has a $50,000 annual income look that is a  huge amount of money and for most families that is significant, that is a  vacation, that is being able to go to the dentist that's a lot of things.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but governor you know what the Republicans have some  problems of their own.  They're distancing themselves after the Steve Wynn  allegations, one of the top stories in the journal.  Wynn allegations  ripple as Republicans seek distance, in the wake of the Wall Street journal  report from former employees that there was constant or decades long  patterns of sexual misconduct.  What say you about that?  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, it is a horrible thing.  And I am glad that as these  things come to life, there's a severance between Steve Wynn and the  Republican Party.  But if they had known about it and it had been widely  known and then they continue the relationship that would be scandalous the  fact that they weren't aware of it, they became aware of it, they cut ties.   I am not sure what the scandal for the republicans is as much as it is a  scandal for Steve Wynn and the tragedy of the people that he abused.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we should point out that the Republicans have raised a lot  of money this year much more than on the democratic side.  But of course he  really was a kingpin in terms of raising money.  Governor, good to see you,  sir.  Thank you so much.  Stay with us tomorrow.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Thank you.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We are going to be live in Washington for the State of the  Union.  We'll be speaking with former DNC Chair Donna Brazil, past Majority  Leader Kevin McCarthy, Congressman Michael McCaul and the Head of Small  Business Administration Linda McMahon, plus former White House Chief of  Staff Josh Bolten with us as well.  We have a big show tomorrow live from  D.C. as we preview the State of the Union.  Back in a moment right here.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Explosions, gunfire, rocking a military base in  Afghanistan killing nearly a dozen soldiers, this is the latest in a wave  of terrorist attacks across the country.  Cheryl Casone with the details  there, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  That's right Maria.  So at  least 11 soldiers have been killed, 16 of those wounded in an early morning  assault on military compound in Kabul.  The Islamic State group is claiming  responsibility, this comes only two days after more than a hundred people  were killed in a suicide attack in the Afghan capital.  This month alone  more than 200 people have been killed, hundreds wounded in a series of  attacks unleashed by the Taliban and the rival Isis.  </p><p>Meanwhile, a popular fitness app is revealing top secret information about  the location of U.S. military bases.  The Washington post is reporting that  the app called Strava shows heat maps which pinpoints soldiers' workouts  that they're doing their undisclosed military base even spy out posts.   Their information is now out there, it's part of Strava's GPS gathering  that is available we should say on smartphones and more importantly the  Fitbit which a lot soldiers like to wear.  </p><p>Well, it is merger Monday in the the beverage industry Dr. Pepper Snapple  and Keurig Green Mountain are teaming up, it's a great accompany with the  combined revenue of $11 billion.  Dr. Pepper Snapple's shareholders getting  a special cash dividend nearly $104 per share they will hold a 13 percent  stake in the newly formed company.  The stock is soaring in the premarket  as you can see up about 30 -- nearly 38 percent right now, huge stock to  watch today.  Now you can basically -- I guess you can get Dr. Pepper out  of your machine, I made that up.  All right.  Just kidding.  A solid joke.   All right.  </p><p>And finally this, Apple is reportedly cutting its iPhone X production in  half in the first quarter, this move following disappointing holiday sales  in Europe, the West China.  Japan's Nikkei Asia reviews that Apple slashed  in production down to 20 million units.  The publications says part of the  problem here could be the iPhone's price tag which starts at about a  thousand dollars.  Shares of Apple down more than three percent over the  last week on concerns about those iPhone sales that stock, remember the  company is reporting earnings later this week.  </p><p>And then Japan based cryptocurrency exchange coin check has announced it's  going to refund customers about $400 million that was stolen by hackers.   About 260,000 people lost their holdings of NEM, this is the world's 10th  biggest cryptocurrency last week anyway.  Meanwhile, so the U.S. credit  card companies are now expected to restrict the purchase of  cryptocurrencies in general.  Citigroup, Bank of America are reviewing the  policies for this.  Capital One already deciding it will not allow  customers to use credit cards to buy any digital currency.  Right now, one  Bitcoin worth about $11,000 right now, you'll never know when it's going to  start over.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Down from 20,000 a couple -- a week ago.  Cheryl, thank  you.  Coming up, the Grammys get political, the controversy after Hillary  Clinton makes a cameo appearance and bashes President Trump.  Then made in  the USA, how a luxury eyewear company is changing the industry by  manufacturing their products domestically.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The eyewear industry, the glasses industry in  focus this morning while eyeglasses are in essential for millions of  Americans.  95 percent of all frames are made outside the United States  according to the Alliance for American Manufacturing.  But a company in  Chicago is looking to change that, State Optical assembles all of its  eyewear here in the United States and we love made in the USA so we are  happy to welcome Scott Shapiro to the program.  State Optical company CEO  and co-founder.  Scott, great to see you.</p><p>SCOTT SHAPIRO, CEO, STATE OPTICAL:  Thank you for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us.  So we are all trying on the  glasses.  I love the way those look on you, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I am blonde legally and so I need a new pair of glasses because  I fall asleep in them all the time and crush them and these are -- these  are beautifully made.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  They look great on you.</p><p>CARTER:  They look great on you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you get by manufacturing in the United States?  Where  here all day having a conversation about trade and about tariffs and tell  us how this is economically positive for you.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  So, first and foremost, you know, there is a lot of pride that  goes with making products here in United States.  We get to put Americans  back to work.  There is about 50 craftsmen working in our factory today  that wouldn't have those jobs if we were outsourcing that overseas.  But I  think much more importantly for our brand is it really connects the  patients or the customers with the craft of making eyewear.  You know, we  say in our factory it takes 70 steps to make one pair of glasses and over  50 percent of that has to be done by hand.  So, I think, you know, in our  industry, there is a lot of -- there is a large misconception about what a  pair of glasses should be worth, what really goes into making high quality  eyewear. And by making it here in the United States, it gives us the  opportunity to tell that story to really get people in touch with that  craft.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Scott, one of the things that we hear, see, and say all the  time and I'm curious about your perspective is finding talents.  So you  said you have 50 people in Chicago, is finding talent a challenge for your  business?</p><p>SHAPIRO:  Very, very difficult.  So I think what we don't talk about a lot  talk when we talk about bringing manufacturing back to United States is the  lack of infrastructure we have here in the U.S. to make things particularly  something like eyewear.  It is a skilled -- it's a very skilled labor.  And  so everyone of those 50 craftsmen that we trained in our factory have to be  trained from step one.  None of them have any experience doing that.  And  it generally takes about six months to get someone up and running before  they can do the job on their own.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Most to the high-end eyewear that would be in the same league as  your glasses is made in Japan and you mentioned earlier in Italy.  This  retail, the ones I've got on for about $400 dollars but is your profit  margin slimmer than those manufacturers overseas because your labor costs  are more expensive here?  </p><p>SHAPIRO:  So great question.  First and foremost, I should say that most of  the product that says -- or  I won't say that, a lot of the product that  says made in Italy, made in Japan is in fact made in China.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>SHAPIRO:  A vast majority of product made in China and there's a lot of  ways to get around that country of origin.  But the product that is  genuinely made in Italy or made in Japan, you know, their workforce is  well-paid as well, those workers also get paid a similar wage to workers in  the United States.  So our profit margins aren't significantly worse than  theirs.  And in fact, there is a lot of benefits conveniences that we  benefit from by making frames here in United States.  So a lot of -- a lot  of advantages that offset that difference.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where do people get the glasses?</p><p>SHAPIRO:  So, we're in over 1100 retail locations currently.  All  independent eye care providers.  So, you mentioned you have an optometrist  across the street, they might carry the product but only independent  offices.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really great.  Scott, great to have you on the show today.   Thank you so much.  </p><p>SHAPIRO:  Thank you very much for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Scot Shapiro.  We love your glasses.  These are beautiful.  </p><p>SHAPIRO:  Yes.  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Coming up.  President Trump first State of the  Union and Trump for president senior adviser Lara Trump will weigh in on  what to expect.  That's next.  And Lockheed Martin reports fourth-quarter  results, beating earnings and revenue expectations.  We break down those  numbers.  Stock is up about three percent right now.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining me this Monday.  It is Monday, January 29th.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.   President Trump gears up for his first State of the Union Address tomorrow  night.  He is expected to tout the booming U.S. economy, infrastructure,  and trade.  We are taking the show live to Washington, D.C. for full  coverage tomorrow and Wednesday.  Join us live from D.C. as we preview and  analyze the president's first State of the Union.  Plus, Hillary Clinton  making a surprise appearance at the Grammy Awards last night, taking an  opportunity to slam the president.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  He had a long-time fear of  being poisoned.  One reason why he liked to like to eat at McDonald's,  nobody knew he was coming and the food was safely pre-made.  </p><p>JAMES CORDEN, HOST, GRAMMY AWARDS:  That's it.  We got it.  That's the one.</p><p>CLINTON:  You think so?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Reaction from Trump family members coming up, straight ahead.   Plus, futures pointing to a weaker opening for the broader averages today  as we kick off the new week on Wall Street after another record-setter last  week.  Personal income and spending just hit the wires, both measures  rising four-tenths of one percent in the month of December.  It is a big  week for the markets because the markets are looking lower but they've got  a lot to react to this week including an FOMC meeting on Wednesday.  The  State of the Union, Tuesday night.  Apple earnings as well as Amazon  earnings on Thursday and then the jobs number on Friday.  </p><p>This all after the major indices closed at another record- high on Friday  due to strong corporate earnings.  Take a look at that market.  Dow  Industrials up 223 points Friday, NASDAQ up 95 points.  Global markets this  morning are mixed.  Take a look, European indices are edging higher in  London and in Paris but the DAX in Germany is fractionally lower.  In Asia  overnight, markets closed mostly lower with the exception of Korea which is  up one percent.  Earnings in focus on Wall Street once again.  This is the  busiest week so far for fourth-quarter earnings.  Lockheed Martin kicked  off the busiest week for the fourth quarter with a beat on earnings and  revenue.  The stock is up 3-1/4 percent surging after the defense giant  also offer an upbeat outlook for 2018.</p><p>Intel under fire again this morning.  The chip giant reportedly telling  Chinese companies about a security flaw before disclosing it to the U.S.  government.  Making a legendary sports car more friendly, family friendly  as well.  We have a look at the new ride from Lamborghini as I speak with  the company's COO and he takes us inside those hot wheels.  All of that  coming up this morning.  But first, topping our news this half an hour.   Hillary Clinton's Grammy jab.  The former presidential candidate makes a  surprise appearance at the awards show last night to mock the president and  read from the book Fire and Fury.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CLINTON:  He had a longtime fear of being poisoned, one reason why he liked  to eat at McDonald's, nobody knew he was coming and the food was safely  pre-made.</p><p>CORDEN:  That's it.  We got it.  That's the one.</p><p>CLINTON:  You think so?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Joining me right now is Trump for President Senior  Adviser and the President's daughter-in-law, Laura Trump.  Great to see  you.  Thank you so much, Lara.</p><p>LARA TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP'S DAUGHTER-IN-LAW:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Your brother-in-law Donald Trump Jr. tweeted  this this morning after the Grammys.  The more Hillary goes on television  the more the American people realize how awesome it is to have Donald Trump  in office.  Lara?</p><p>L. TRUMP:  True.  It's so true.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Did you -- did you watch the Grammys?  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  You know what, Maria, I stopped watching all these shows a long  time ago for this exact reason and I think the American public as a whole  probably feels the same way.  I thought it was despicable, disgusting, and  quite frankly sad that Hillary Clinton obviously needs to validate herself  in some way.  If she's so keen on reading things, maybe she could read us  her 33,000 missing e-mails because I think I love to hear about those.  It  was just so disrespectful.  I'm so sad that this is the point that this  awards show has come to.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it's also -- from a marketing standpoint or a business  standpoint, not very smart because it's just making this assumption that  everybody agrees with you.  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Yes.  And obviously the country does not agree because Donald  Trump is our president, they chose him November 8th, 2016.  Look at where  this country has come in a year that he's been in office.  You know, the  economy is booming, people are back to work, unemployment is at, you know,  record-lows right now and we have so much to look forward to from this  president and I think even people that didn't vote are starting to get  onboard.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you make a lot of good point because the President does  have a great story to tell --  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- for the State of the Union tomorrow night.  He is preparing  for his first State of the Union tomorrow night and obviously the economy  is going to be a positive story that's going to be one thing to talk about  also foreign policy.  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How much are you expecting him to get into things like ISIS  being defeated.  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Well, I think he should talk about it because nobody does.  We  went from 44,000 ISIS fighters, just about a year ago to under 1,000 right  now and it's really under reported but that's huge, people in this country  as of even a year ago, we're very scared about how we were going to defeat  ISIS, is it possible?  I'm sure we're going to hear about that, were going  to hear about the fact that on the world stage, the United States has  reclaimed its place as the leader.  You know, you see my father-in-law  traveled to different countries, you see the respect that he's given -- the  welcome that he's given in these different countries.  It's so great that  we have our country back.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's what he said when he was in Davos, also talking  about the economic strength like jobs, like the unemployment rate, where it  is and also the regulatory framework which is rolled back.  You know, it  feels like there is a big runway to this because there's a number of  sectors that have not been impacted yet form the regulatory rollback.  Is  he expecting this 0-- the good times to get even better?  I mean, in 2018  and '19, he's talking about continued economic growth.  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Well, I think so, I mean, regulatory reform is obviously huge.   You're going to see these tax cuts kick in.  I mean, people next week are  going to see their paychecks higher in this country.  Thanks to Donald  Trump.  And I think he is right, this is super charged the economy, I think  2018, 2019 even there's opportunity for a lot of more growth in this  country.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So do we have it then, economic issues in the State of the  Union perhaps an infrastructure plan?  He's going to talk about that as  well, right?  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Well, I'm excited as you are, see here what he's going to talk  about, I'm sure immigration will be on there as well.  That's such a huge  topic, you know, it feels like it's on the one yard line, we'er almost  there and it's something that's so needed and necessary in this country.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will you be in the hall there tomorrow night?  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  We're hoping to be there.  Yes. I think so.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you this because of course, then there's some bad  news as well for the Republicans this morning and that is Las Vegas real  estate casino mogul Steve Wynn resigning as finance chair for the RNC after  reports of years of sexual misconduct here.  Wynn has denied wrongdoing we  should say but in a statement, he did not want to be a distraction, he said  to the Republican Party.  What's your take on this?  Shares of Wynn Resorts  down sharply as the company announced it will form a committee to  investigate these allegations, Lara.  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Yes.  Well, I don't know too much about it to be honest with  you.  I know he resigned and Ronna, the chairwoman of the RNC who's  amazing, accepted his resignation and she's going to do what's best for the  party.  And, you know, we're sad to see him go.  He was a great supporter  of the President.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, at the same time, the Republican Party has been raising a  lot of money, much more than the Democrats.  And so, as you see that nest  egg getting bigger, it must tell you that business and big donors out there  are seeing more opportunity on the RNC side.  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Well, not just -- not just big donors but a lot of the majority  of the money that we raised is small dollars, that means that the average  person in this country is supporting what the President is doing.  They  want to see him in office again for another four years in 2020 and I think  that speaks volumes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what are President's plans?  I mean, when you talk with him  sort of off-line, not an official capacity but as his daughter-in-law, what  does he want to get accomplished for the next three years?  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Well, I mean it's what you heard on the campaign trail which he  is delivering on.  He -- the economy was so big to him and obviously as a  businessman that was something that, you know, was his target from the very  beginning.  Let's reboot the economy, let's get it moving, you see where we  are now, the Dow hit all-time highs.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do we need as a business, look, get stuff done on time, get it  under budget.  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Yes. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's a really good lesson.  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  No.  It's so true.  I mean, you look at -- I always talk about  the Wollman Rink and the story there that the city had it for so long, they  couldn't get an ice skating rink though in Central Park.  Donald Trump came  in, ahead of schedule under budget and that's what he wants to do for this  country and I think we're seeing it happens.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's a great point that you make because I was talking  about somebody else with that regulations.  It took 13 years to build a  bridge in Bayonne, took another 25 years to do an infrastructure plan in  Alaska.  This rollback in regulations just sort of has unleashed animal  spirits.  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Yes.  Cut through the red tape, let's get it done and this  country deserves it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And -- but the detractors are still there, Lara.  How is the  President dealing with the media backlash, the backlash on the left when  you see Nancy Pelosi calling the $1,000 checks crumbs?  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Well, that's just -- that's plain sad and it's ridiculous.  I  think a lot of people in this country would be thrilled to have $1,000 and  it's sad that she thinks it's crumbs.  And listen, they proved themselves  wrong every single day, they lied about these tax cuts that people are  going to see next week that it's true that the majority of people in this  country, 91 percent of people are going to be making more money.  And I  think every single day, you know, those people on the left that have been  so harsh on Donald Trump, on our president, every day they discredit  themselves and they prove themselves wrong a little bit more.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are you doing in terms of the 2020 campaign at this point?   Do we have a sense of who will be running against your father-in-law?  </p><p>L. TRUMP:  Well, I think we ruled out Oprah.  initially we thought that was  a -- well, like a week ago.  You know what, I don't know, I love to know  who it's going to be.  I think we are just -- we're raising money as you  said, you know, and I think the president is going to be able to run on,  you know, the great job that he is doing for this country.  His track  record is going to I think easily take him into another four years.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Actually since the Democrats are coming out with the resist  and, you know, pushing back instead of --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>L. TRUMP:  That's all they have.  They have no message, they have no  leader, they have no agenda  other than resist.  And it's very obvious,  it's very transparent to people I think.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Lara.  Great to see you.  Before you go, any updates  on baby Luke?</p><p>L. TRUMP:  Well, we had him on the pool down to Mar-a-Lago, so we're trying  to get him swimming.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's so great.  We have a picture, I wanted to share that  picture --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>L. TRUMP:  Oh, his first haircut.  Yes.  Down in Florida too.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Cute in his first hair cut.  Congratulations, Lara and Eric  Trump.  Good to see you.</p><p>L. TRUMP:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.  Coming up.  New concerns over Intel's computer  chip flaws.  Why the company reportedly warned Chinese companies it will  (INAUDIBLE) the U.S. government about the security vulnerabilities.  And  then the Lamborghini gets family friendly.  We've got the luxury  automaker's newest SUV in our plaza.  I'll talk with the COO of the  company.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Big week on Wall Street even technology earnings this week,  Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, all set to report their numbers  this week.  Joining us now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney to  look ahead.  Stu, good morning to you.  </p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  I've got  to two words.  Maybe three.  Don't disappoint because if any of these big  five and this Wednesday and Thursday when we get the big five results.  If  they really disappoint, I think you can put a crack in the market.  All the  --not all.  A backtrack again, a lot of the money going into the market has  gone into the five big tech stocks on expectation of stellar performances  each and every quarter.  If any of them falters, I think you'll see the  market overall falter, but you know, I think, Maria, there's another kind  of test coming here as well.  </p><p>What are the big tech companies going to do with the money that they're  bringing back to America and the money that they're going to get extra from  the tax cuts?  I suspect that a good chunk of it will go to stock buybacks,  and/or dividend increases.  And I think the left will go nuts about that,  that will be truly crumbs for the workers, crumbs for America, and  everything goes to the rich stockholders.  I don't agree with that point of  view, but I think that's what they're going to say.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I agree there's not a lot of room for error here.  These  stocks are up big time in the last year.  But, Stu, you know, my worry on  technology is the regulatory part of thing.  I think you're going to see as  Donald Trump is rolling back regulations for this economy, actually, I  think there's a new approach to technology, because these companies are  more powerful than we have ever known, today, and they're probably going to  see higher regulation, you see it happen in Europe, and I think you're  going to see it here in the U.S.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, but I want to know what kind of regulation.  It's very hard  to break up, say, an Amazon on antitrust grounds because basically what  they're doing is helping the everyday consumer and lowering prices, it's to  America's benefit that this company exists.  So, I'm not sure of what  framework they would use to regulate them and rein them in, but I do agree  with you that it's heavy pressure to do just that. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, because they had so much information on us.  They may be  helping the average person but we're giving something up in the process,  and that is privacy, that we've got all these data.  So, much is that data  worth to government that's overseeing all of this?  That's all I'm saying,  I just think that the regulatory environment is going to be an unknown for  these companies.</p><p>VARNEY:  And why don't I get a piece of the action?  If they know  everything about me and they sell that information to somebody else albeit  anonymously, I don't care.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  Where do I come in here?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You made my point.  That's exactly right.  Stu, we're going to  look at those numbers and we'll see if it cracks this market.  It's going  to be -- have to be really bad to do that.  Stuart, thank you, we'll see  you in about 10 minutes with more on \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" top of the hour  right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Join Stuart.  First though, Lockheed  Martin beats on fourth-quarter revenue, expects a rise in earnings this  year.  Good guidance has that stock up three percent right now.  Nicole  Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange watching Lockheed  and the broader market.  Nic?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hey, good morning, Maria.   You're absolutely right.  Taking a look at Lockheed Martin which is to the  upside.  They came out with a fourth-quarter revenue.  It beat the streak.   Stock is up almost three percent, 2.79, to be precise, 345 and change.   They did so well on the higher sales F-35 fighter jet program, also raising  guidance for 2018.  And don't forget, President Trump's administration, the  Defense Department is ready to fork it out, and in fact, ready to spend  about $391 billion over 15 years to develop and buy more than 2400 of the  supersonic warplanes.  So, a winner here for Lockheed Martin and going  forward, also upside potential.  </p><p>Then there's Intel, this is an ongoing story about the security flaws;  these are critical.  The question is why China's government may have known  more before about it before even the U.S. government because it seems that  they actually let notified a small group of customers, including some  Chinese technology customers and because China's government actually  monitors those types of conversations, in fact, the Chinese government may  have known before the USA, the left out the USA government to let them know  about these security flaws.  The stock is looking down about a half of one  percent, but it's up almost 32 percent in the last 52 weeks.  So, it has  been a great performer like many of the tech stocks.</p><p>And coming up, this is great.  I love it because I'm definitely into this.   A Lamborghini for your whole family, Maria.  Checking this one out.  Cool  features of the Italian automaker's newest luxury SUV, Lamborghini, with  Maria, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  As I come to you from the plaza right now, we've  got a set of hot wheels to show you because Lamborghini is roaring in and  rolling into the SUV market.  Joining me right now is the Chief Operating  Officer of Lamborghini America, Alessandro Farmeschi.  Good to see you,  sir.  Thank you so much for joining us, Alessandro.</p><p>ALESSANDRO FARMESCHI, CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, LAMBORGHINI AMERICA:  Good  morning.  Our pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're going to look at the car in a moment.  But first,  characterize what you're seeing out there in terms of -- in terms of  business and the market.  How is the reception for these new -- these new  cars?</p><p>FARMESCHI:  Oh, the reception is unbelievable.  I'd say that we have  already sold out entirely the 2018.  We are receiving great, great response  from our customers here in U.S. but also worldwide, I would say.  This is a  great news, the fastest SUV in the planet.  And so -- and the only one, by  the way.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let's talk about it.  This is the Urus.</p><p>FARMESCHI:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Urus.  And this is -- it goes 189 miles an hour?</p><p>FARMESCHI:  Yes, exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us about it.</p><p>FARMESCHI:  Yes, this is a super sports car, so it has all the feature of a  super sports car.  650 horsepower, 0-60 to -- in 3.6 seconds.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow!</p><p>FARMESCHI:  And it has all the technology to support the performances and  the agility and the emotion, I would say, of a pure Lamborghini.  Also, in  terms of design, of a super sports car.  Therefore, this car is conceived  also not to be just a super sports car but also an SUV.  So, it has the  (INAUDIBLE) agility.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Just the fact that you are into the SUV market.  I  mean, you said earlier, this can hold a couple of golf bags.  What was so  important -- why was it so important for a Lamborghini to be here, to be in  the SUV market?</p><p>FARMESCHI:  Basically, what we saw is that the SUV segment is expanding  every year.  And number one, United States is having a great success.   Before, we believed that not having anything in the super sports segment in  the SUV environment, we believe that this was the perfect package to also  families, our clients, a different way of living the Lamborghini every day,  living Lamborghini during the weekends, during the holidays with their  friends so because you can host four, five people, you space for three golf  bags.  And so, I mean, this the perfect combination.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you, Alessandro, I know that you reported global  sales up in the double digits, just recently you did.  You took the car at  the Detroit Auto Show.  How much does this cost?</p><p>FARMESCHI:  This cost $200,000.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  $200,000.</p><p>FARMESCHI:  Yes, we start from there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And how does that fit in the overall pricing of Lamborghini?</p><p>FARMESCHI:  This is, like we say, almost in line with our Huracan.  And is  positioned at the right level to -- let me say -- offer a different product  that's not just only a super sports car but something more.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It feels like a super sports car as well as a big family -- it  is very family friendly.  And this is gorgeous.  Tell us about the  interior.</p><p>FARMESCHI:  Here, you can see that you have --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, now, I feel like I'm in a Lamborghini.</p><p>FARMESCHI:  You immediately --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Immediately.  You're absolutely right.</p><p>FARMESCHI:  (INAUDIBLE) new seater.  So, the seats are sporty.  Also here,  the interior, you have here in the middle, all the commands like you are in  a aircraft or --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  You got my iPad right here, right?</p><p>FARMESCHI:  Yes.  These are two touchscreens and then you --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Two iPads.</p><p>FARMESCHI:  Yes, yes, yes.  Two iPads, all both touchscreen so you can go  and surf here in the navi system into the infotainment system, and you can  also with the sensor levers select the driving modes; you can drive in a  comfortable way, you can have a sporty way, race way, but also this is the  new speaker.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, it's almost like autonomous?</p><p>FARMESCHI:  It's not exactly autonomous.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's not exactly autonomous because you can't stop and not --  you can't control.</p><p>FARMESCHI:  (INAUDIBLE) the driver is always at the center, because we  speak about emotions, and for us, driving the Lamborghini is key, all of  our clients want to drive their Lamborghini.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's fantastic.</p><p>FARMESCHI:  And in terms of support, the driver, we also provide the  technology to help the driver, so recently in this car, we have a full  advance driver assistance system that helps the driver in case of a  imminent crash to break the car and talk to support in case (INAUDIBLE)  situation the driver.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, which is why we talked all about autos at the CES Show,  the technology show, because technology is in all of the cars.  Alessandro,  this is beautiful, the moment I stepped in the car, I could tell you I'm in  a Lamborghini.  It's absolutely gorgeous, it's the Urus, and Alessandro  Farmeschi, it is good to see you.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>FARMESCHI:  My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stay with us.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Once again, our thanks to Lamborghini and Alessandro Farmeschi,  thanks for showing me around this high-tech car.  Thank you, Dagen  McDowell, Mitch Roschelle, and Lee Carter.  We'll see you again tomorrow,  everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins right  now.  Stuart, over to you.</p><p>VARNEY:  Maria, thank you very much indeed.  Now, this is not the way we  usually open the show.

It's a rigged, crooked system. First of all it's rigged. I'm afraid the election will be rigged.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DEIRDRE BOLTON, FBN HOST: The FBI is state officials about the possibility of hackers breaking into computer network.</p><p>This is Risk &amp; Reward. I'm Deirdre Bolton.</p><p>A Russian hackers gained access to log in credential used by Arizona state election officials. The system of Illinois was also breached.</p><p>So, it's worth noting that today in Arizona there is a primary with House and Senate candidates competing.</p><p>With me now, my colleague, Blake Burman. So, Blake, what is the latest?</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi there, Deirdre. Two well-known senators on the ballot tonight. You mentioned Arizona, Florida as well. But both are expected to defeat their primary challengers. We'll begin with John McCain, he is seeking the term in Arizona. He is being pushed especially hard on immigration by the state Senator Dr. Kelly Ward.</p><p>Also tonight, after repeatedly promising to not run for his Senate seat. Marco Rubio on the ballot, again in Florida. He is expected to breeze through despite $8 million worth of spending from business Carlos Beruff.</p><p>The race in Florida, though that is really gathering the national attention is the congressional fight in the Miami area, the ousted DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Shultz is now trying to fight off Tim Canova who was backed by <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders.</nameText></person></p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM CANOVA, FORMER CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE: Our campaigns are different. We don't take any money from any corporate interests. None of their PACS or super PACS, and it leaves us free to represent the people. I like to send bought and paid for by the people.</p><p>DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ, FORMER DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE CHAIRWOMAN: They want to know they have a fighter, and they want to know that if someone who knows their way of life that has been in the community like I have for 30 years.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: And, Deirdre, as you mentioned there are fresh concerns about the safety of our elections. Just this day the outgoing Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid has sent a letter to the head of the FBI James Comey asking him to investigated if Russia is trying to temper with our elections. Deirdre?</p><p>BOLTON: Yes. He sent that in a very strangely worded letter. We're going to talk more about that. Blake Burman, thank you very much. I know coming back to you in a little bit for an update on <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton's </nameText></person>e-mail.</p><p>But in the meantime, election say just two months away, So, November 8 on most voters' calendars, and before that, millions of voters can vote early in some states as early as September. No matter how and when you vote. There is a new report that shows that rigging the presidential elect would be easy.</p><p>Here is part of that report. \"The United States e-voting system is so vulnerable that a small group of one of a few dedicated individual could linchpin district of a swing state and sway the entire presidential election.\"</p><p>The co-author of that report is here now. He is a cyber-expert, James Scott. James, welcome to Risk &amp; Reward. So, with all due respect, are you exaggerating this claim? I mean, is it really that easy, and I'm taking the language from your report to rig an election?</p><p>JAMES SCOTT, CYBER SECURITY EXPERT: Yes. In the beginning we thought it would be more complicated. Hewlett-Packard security gave us this project and said to find if it is truly as this vulnerable as people are saying.</p><p>When we got into the cyber physical and technical aspects we found the entire system is rigged with vulnerabilities from the regional level to the state. So, yes, you know it is unfortunately.</p><p>BOLTON: So, James, let's just say for a hacker, one being the easiest, 10 being the hardest. I'm leaving all the amateurs out, what is the exact level of difficulty; just give us a sense of range.</p><p>SCOTT: Sure. A hacker can use to go in the deep web and go on the marketplace download a variant of malware that self-deletes. Take it, put it on an USB drive with acetone then take acetone a bump key and a razor blade, go into a church basement or a school boiler room where these voting machines are warehoused. Seamlessly get through the certified audit tag.</p><p>BOLTON: So, James, would you say more than half of the cyber expert out there could do this?</p><p>SCOTT: I think this is so easy a script kitty could do it.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. That's pretty frightening but I'm glad to have your perspective on that.</p><p>SCOTT: Yes. From a state perspective if you are looking larger, instead of going in and taking advantage of a local election, you could go in at the state level with more equipped malware and basic spear phishing attack with a product update for some type of technology. It could be Adobe even and that could deliver malicious payload there with the key logger that could record key strokes. Trojan which would create a back door. A remote access Trojan...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: And we've heard of all of these through businesses. And of course, part of the weakest link is that in a lot of these campaigns, especially at the local level, some are volunteer employees, they may innocently click on a link is filled with malware as you rightly point out.</p><p>James, come back.</p><p>SCOTT: Yes.</p><p>BOLTON: Chances are we're going to be talking about this again. We thank you in the meantime. Thanks for the report.</p><p>SCOTT: Thank you very much.</p><p>BOLTON: James Scott, cyber expert.</p><p>Hacks have many on edge. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid writing a letter to the FBI director James Comey calling on investigators to make any information that they find public. So here is one part of the letter. This is what Blake Burman, my colleague was just talking about.</p><p>\"The evidence of a direct connection between the Russian government and <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>presidential campaign continues to mount and has led Michael Morrell, former acting CIA director to call Trump an unwitting agent of Russia and the Kremlin.\"</p><p>Co-chairman of Trump's Great America PAC, Ed Rollins is with me now. Ed, wonderful to see you.</p><p>ED ROLLINS, TRUMP'S GREAT AMERICA PAC CO-CHAIR: Thank you. Nice to be with you.</p><p>BOLTON: So, Harry Reid is alleging that Russians essentially are attempting to help <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>win the presidential election. And this is a theory that some other democrats have put forward. But I want to be clear, the White House has not touched this, neither has the FBI, neither has the CIA. How far-fetched is this?</p><p>ROLLINS: Harry Reid over time has said some pretty far-fetched concept. And I think this is more political than it is anything with any real facts. Who knows who Putin wants? Would he want four more years of an Obama-type administration that's not been very powerful and certainly not done have much.</p><p>Or that he want Trump kind of an unknown. So, Trump says he's never met Putin, I take him at his word. So, I don't think they're playing in our politics although the story you just head-on to me as someone who has been in the game for 50 years, it's kind of frightening to think that you can go and alter a few states. I know in very close election it just...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: Well, I don't mean to be dismissive.</p><p>ROLLINS: No, no.</p><p>BOLTON: For example, call him, you know, something like Oliver Stone which is why I wanted to ask.</p><p>ROLLINS: As I was watching it, and I have a tendency to always kind of dismiss theories of election fraud although I've been certainly around enough to know that there are some of it. But when you'd know all of the things that have happened with computers and what have you, I just hope that you really do have the resources to go guard against this.</p><p>Because again, you're talking not about 50 state campaigns, you're talking about seven or eight states that will make the difference in this electoral and that probably comes down to 20 or 30 counties in those states that can make a difference. So, I hope there is due diligence and I'm sure there will be.</p><p>BOLTON: And I'm sure for people who remember the Cold War, the idea of Russia trying to influence what we're doing here is very real in a way that it may not be to millennials.</p><p>ROLLINS: Well, I think -- I think the reality is that the computer hacking has become such a part of our life and unfortunate part of life that we've just never thought about it coming in and trying to transform election job is very critical, very important.</p><p>BOLTON: Ed, let me ask you about something going on the other side of the aisle.</p><p>ROLLINS: Sure.</p><p>BOLTON: The New York Times editorial board have published key web states that \"<person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>must cut ties to the Clinton Foundation.\" Now the Trump campaign did make a statement. I'm going to read part of it. He says, the campaign says, \"The fact that even the liberal New York Times thinks the Clinton Foundation presents an unacceptable conflict of interest is a devastating rebuke of <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton's </nameText></person>poor judgment and broken ethical compass. At a minimum, <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>should help the growing calls for her corrupt foundation to seize accepting foreign and corporate contributions immediately. With each donation she becomes more and more compromised.\"</p><p>So, it does seem as if <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>should at the very least step away from this.</p><p>ROLLINS: Far away I never, could never understand why she joined the foundation after she was Secretary of State. She obviously could make a lot of money going out and doing speeches.</p><p>But I think to a certain extent she didn't think politically unless she was using that as a resource to basically build a political campaign to take care of friends and allies. She now has a liability that she shouldn't have.</p><p>And I think just a mere fact that if I become president I'm not going to take any funds there or have any funds. She promised that when she became Secretary of State and obviously violated it and it's a big, big issue to a lot of people out there.</p><p>BOLTON: Ed, let me ask you from the liberal side of the bench, the idea is that, oh, this foundation does such good work. That if she steps out, it loses its name work and it loses its founder. And I've heard people say, listen, look at Bill Gates. There are many people who run very successful foundations where she could give the money.</p><p>ROLLINS: There are billions and billions of dollars that are raised to do wonderful things around the world and the Clinton Foundation in some cases have. Its unfortunate it has tainted by foreign people who have come in and made enormous sums of money had gotten access to certain things, nuclear access, nuclear resources and what have you.</p><p>Certain people had a vested interest in becoming part of that. And I think that it's getting more and more exposed, and I think to a certain extent it's one of the liabilities that she has.</p><p>BOLTON: Yes. And I mean, if I were working on her campaign as a strategist, let's say you already have the e-mail...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROLLINS: Absolutely, you don't need this.</p><p>BOLTON: ... you don't need a second shadow over your shoulder.</p><p>ROLLINS: And particularly with this, there has always been a question of her integrity. The Clintons have always basically had everything up for pay.</p><p>BOLTON: You go back to the Lincoln bedrooms.</p><p>ROLLINS: Bedrooms and the rides on Air Force One and what have you. So, my sense it was foolish of her to get back into it. At this point in time she ought to clean it up and turn it over to one of these foundations to run and let the good stuff work its way out.</p><p>BOLTON: Speaking of turning over a new leaf, tomorrow in Arizona<person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is making a key speech on immigration. Former Mayor of New York City, Rudy Giuliani made this comment about Trump's stance. Here is the former mayor.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP).</p><p>RUDY GIULIANI, FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR: He is going to go after the most dangerous first, then the less dangerous criminals second. And by the time we get there then we'll see what our population is of non-criminal illegal immigrants.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: So, Ed, speaking of strategies some have criticized <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>in the past 10 days saying he's waffling a bit on his stance on immigration. So, tomorrow the speech comes. What does he need to say?</p><p>ROLLINS: He needs to be very clear in what he stets. I mean, he started off being the most anti-immigrant and obviously made distance between some of his other opponents in the primary. I would say he has waffled a little bit. I think it's a complex issue and I think he's finding out more and more about that and the difficulty of the task. But at the same time, as he goes in two months to go or 70 days to go. He has to be very clear what his positions are.</p><p>BOLTON: Because President Bush Sr. said read my lips, no new tax, it generate taxes and it really hurt him. So, it feels like this could be a comparable issue for <person><nameText>Donald Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>ROLLINS: He can say it's complicated. I'm going to to the Congress to ask for certain things, but at the end of the day, here are the things I believe I'm going to do.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Ed Rollins, clarity, we love it. Thank you.</p><p>ROLLINS: All right. My pleasure. Thank you.</p><p>BOLTON: Ed Rollins. Be sure to catch Fox Business Network's special coverage of <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>immigration speech. That starts tomorrow night at 7 p.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>Fox has confirmed the FBI will release <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>interview notes to the public. We're going to bring you all the details. And on a related note, the State Department says 30 Benghazi-related e-mails were in the batch of 15,000 that the FBI said <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>didn't turn over.</p><p>Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton sued the government under the Freedom of Information Act to get this data. He's with me next.</p><p>BOLTON: There are two new developments concerning <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton's </nameText></person>e- mails. So, one, the FBI is planning to release the notes from its closed door interview with <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton. </nameText></person>Second development, the State Department says about 30 e-mails were recovered, ones that involve references to the 2012 Benghazi attack.</p><p>Blake Burman back with me now with more. So, Blake, how are these two moving parts fitting together?</p><p>BURMAN: You're right, Deirdre, there are two different stories here. Let's start with the first. Where sources tell Fox that the FBI is repairing a release of some materials contained in the bureau's report of the <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>e-mail investigation.</p><p>You'll remember that this is a part of three and a half hour interview of the former Secretary of State that took place a couple of months ago over the 4th of July weekend. Now I could tell you there is no exact time frame for the release. But it is expected soon.</p><p>Earlier today, the White House Secretary Josh Earnest tried to distance the White House from the process. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOSH EARNEST, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I can tell you that the White House did not consult with the FBI about that decision or any of the other decisions that they've made in terms of handling some of the investigative material.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: Topic number two, this comes as at least 30 previously deleted e- mails from Clinton's State Department tenure relating to Benghazi will soon be released. <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>campaign reacting today with the statement that says in part, quote, \"If Clinton did not consider e-mails about something as important as Benghazi to be work-related, one has to wonder what is contained in the other e-mails she attempted to wipe from her server.\"</p><p>That's the statement today from the Trump campaign. Deirdre?</p><p>BOLTON: Blake, thank you as always. Blake Burman on both of those developing stories.</p><p>Well, when questioned as to why she didn't turn over these e-mails, here's what <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>HILLARY CLINTON, </nameText></person>(D) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I chose not to keep my private personal e-mails. E-mails about planning Chelsea's wedding or my mother's funeral arrangements, condolence notes to friends as well as yoga routines, family vacations.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: The State Department as we just talked about with Blake, confirming that 30 Benghazi-related e-mails have been found, have been recovered, it's the better way to put it.</p><p>Judicial Watch president, author of \"Clean House\" Tom Fitton is with me now. Tom, welcome and congratulations because you had to sue the government under the Freedom of Information Act to even get access to this data and provide essentially a service to the American public. So, do you feel you can do a victory lap or it is still too early?</p><p>TOM FITTON, JUDICIAL WATCH PRESIDENT: Well, it's kind of outrageous. They told us they found some Benghazi materials last week, and they said they give them to us in the beginning the end of September. We said how many e- mails are we talking about? They didn't want to tell us.</p><p>So, we had a court hearing to get that one piece of information. Thirty e- mails they wanted to the end of September within one e-mail a day to review and release them. And I'm not even sure all of them are necessarily responsive per se or it can be released.</p><p>It's just absurd and the court pressured the administration, given the national interests of this material to move more quickly and demanded a report, a status report on September 6 next week and denied the State Department's request for more time.</p><p>BOLTON: So, Tom, let me ask you to put on a different hat if you don't mind. Why do you think this drip, drip, drip approach somehow serves the other side? I don't even understand that.</p><p>FITTON: Well, by delaying, there is an effort to delay. I mean, this is in July they received these e-mails, these are the emails the FBI recovered that Mrs. Clinton tried to delete. Now it turns out they are not yoga e- mails in there, there may be, but now there is Benghazi e-mails in there and they've been sitting on those for a month, and they didn't want to tell us they had 30 e-mails. They want to take as long as two extra months to turn them over.</p><p>So, it's obviously a political delay. Mrs. Clinton never wanted anyone to see these e-mails because they were deleted. And that she deleted them. And the ones she did turn over and she never turned over voluntarily to begin with.</p><p>This is just a further an indication, and further indication that the Clinton-Obama crowd are allied and withholding and delaying the release of information about Mrs. Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State to the American people.</p><p>BOLTON: Tom, that is the e-mail, the Benghazi-related e-mails that were recovered separately as Blake Burman was just telling us. The FBI Is going to release the notes, most people were under the impression those notes. Previously most people already know the impression wouldn't be released. But from the private closed door interview that it had with <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton. </nameText></person>What do you think we are going to learn?</p><p>FITTON: We are going to learn what Mrs. Clinton told the FBI and how half- baked the FBI investigation was, given that the outcome. We've been asking for these notes as well and we were going to sue if we don't get them. And we may still sue because there were other interviews that took place that may not be released.</p><p>So, we'll see what's released in the end and what's withheld. On top of that we just submitted questions to Mrs. Clinton today, we sent it over to her lawyer that she's going to have to respond to under oath. So, you know, trust Judicial Watch to get some answers under oath from Mrs. Clinton presumably that the FBI was unable to get.</p><p>You know, she up ended the Freedom of Information Act in a way that we are still dealing with today. We had three government lawyers in federal court trying to tell the American people why they need to wait as long as two months for 30 or at least one month for 30 e-mails to be released. And thank you, Mrs. Clinton for setting that up.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Tom Fitton, thank you so much for the time and for your work as it highlighted many people...</p><p>FITTON: Thank you. You're welcome, Deirdre.</p><p>BOLTON: ... point out you are doing a service to the U.S. that no one else is.</p><p>The E.U. is trying to get Apple to pay more than $14 billion in back taxes. This is the biggest demand ever. My next guest says Apple and other American companies are keeping their money overseas because of a broken U.S. corporate tax policy.</p><p>Former Reagan economic adviser Art Laffer is with me.</p><p>BOLTON: The E.U. is charging Apple to pay more than $14 billion in back taxes. So, this is the biggest tax ruling ever for a single company. The charge? Apple artificially lowered its tax bill for more than 20 years with Ireland's permission.</p><p>So, both Apple and the Irish government say they will fight the ruling. U.S. Treasury Department also suggesting there would be consequences for the E.U. commission if the matter could not be resolved with all parties sitting around the same table.</p><p>Some say the issue looming in the background is a broken U.S. corporate tax policy. American corporate tax rates are near 40 percent compared to Irelands which total around 14 percent. Some democrats in the U.S. want corporate rates to go even higher.</p><p>Former economic adviser to President Reagan, Art Laffer is with me now. So, Art, are we forcing companies such as Apple, and Apple is not alone, there is also Amazon, there is also McDonald's, essentially are we forcing them to search for their own tax solutions?</p><p>ART LAFFER, FORMER REAGAN ECONOMIC ADVISER: Well, of course, I mean, that's what we're doing. I mean, we have the highest single tax rate on corporations in the OECD and obviously these companies want after-tax returns so they choose to move to different locations.</p><p>Now Ireland is the best in the world. I mean, very close to it. It's a 12.5 percent federal tax in Ireland, so it's very easy to speak English. They are wonderful people, some of us are even descended from them. So, it's just great!</p><p>And it's a terrific thing, and Ireland has made one huge mistake, and that's not leaving the E.U. It should leave the E.U. and join the U.K., they should be next in Brexit, and they could be the center focal point, the Interpol of the English speaking world. And, Deirdre, I think that would be just great.</p><p>BOLTON: Well, with a first name like Deirdre, I have to say I have in Dublin a few times and when you go into that before you come from...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LAFFER: Dublin (Ph) is wonderful.</p><p>BOLTON: Yes. And when you go into the airport, I mean, you see all these big tech companies and Ireland has made it their business to attract those companies but the E.U. is now mad. I'm glad you brought up Brexit.</p><p>LAFFER yes.</p><p>BOLTON: Many people say, you know what? Ireland pulls the trick...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LAFFER: Ireland should get out of there.</p><p>BOLTON: .. that the E.U. just didn't think of first and that group is seeking revenge.</p><p>LAFFER: yes, that's true. In fact I've got an old joke that I should you, do you know why everyone is investing in Ireland?</p><p>BOLTON: no.</p><p>LAFFER: Because the capital is always Dublin!</p><p>BOLTON: Yes. I love it, Art. I love it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LAFFER: Dublin never mind, Deirdre.</p><p>BOLTON: Jokes and economic sense all wrapped up in one brain. But let me ask you this.</p><p>LAFFER: Sure.</p><p>BOLTON: I mean, in order to prevent corporate inversions, that is to say U.S. companies from buying companies overseas just to move their headquarters benefit from lower tax rates, both candidates have very different plans.</p><p>Trump wants to offer a kind of amnesty, let companies bring money back, pay a onetime 10 percent fee and move on. <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>is more punitive.</p><p>LAFFER: Yes, <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>wants to punish them for being there. I mean, you know, you can't tax an economy into prosperity and that is Hillary's model. Now <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>wants to bring them back, but he has a very high tax and it should be much lower than 10 percent.</p><p>Ten percent in many cases would be the whole tax savings the companies have gotten garnered over there. So, it should be lower than 10 percent, but his point is correct. Bring them back, let them provide jobs, help with employment in America, why not?</p><p>BOLTON: Why not, indeed? Do you think <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>is being pushed to the left, obviously Senator Sanders no longer in the race, but I never heard her say anything like that before Sanders.</p><p>LAFFER: Well, she hasn't that I don't know of before. But, you know, it makes no sense whatsoever. You can't be pushed left if you don't believe left. I mean, you know, they can't push to you do something, Deirdre, that you don't believe in. And they can't push to you say a lie, can they?</p><p>I mean, no one can. And if she is repeating this type of stuff, she obviously has some portion in her down deep that sort of agrees with it and makes no sense to me. Let me just explain, if you have two locations a and b, Deirdre, and if you raise taxes in b and you lower in a, producers and manufacturers and people are going to move from, b to a.</p><p>It's not rocket surgery as Larry Gatlin says every now and then. It's just common sense! People go to where they have the best situation. And that's Ireland and the countries and that's in Tennessee in the states.</p><p>BOLTON: Art, let me shift gears if you don't mind.</p><p>LAFFER: Sure.</p><p>BOLTON: Ten thousand Syrian refugees have entered the U.S., so that reaches the Obama administration's goal. <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>and other republicans are calling for an end to the program. <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>calling for a 550 percent expansion based on figures that could mean a population of more than 600,000, so nearly the population of Detroit.</p><p>And in February, oddly enough, President Bill Clinton suggested that Syrian refugees move to Detroit and help revive the city, which many people don't understand the connection, but do you see it?</p><p>LAFFER: I don't see the connection at all. I mean, this Syrian refugee thing is way outside of my candor, Deirdre, and I didn't really know how to handle it.</p><p>Now, on illegal aliens down the southern border of the United States in Mexico and the U.S., these people are wonderful people who are here to work, to produce, they are high-quality labor at low cost and they really provide a lot of benefits to the U.S.</p><p>But that's people who come to the U.S. for economic reasons, and when you're talking about Syria and the Middle East and all these turmoil driven by war and driven by attacks and deaths and all, that it's a very different motive set and it's not one that I can talk to very easily, I really can't, Deirdre.</p><p>But the southern migration is all economic, all out of Nicaragua and Costa Rica and Mexico, and South America, these people are coming to the U.S. because we have jobs, high-paying jobs, they're needed here badly and they have high-quality skills.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Art Laffer, we thank you as always. Glad to have you.</p><p>LAFFER: Thank you very much, Deirdre.</p><p>BOLTON: A new report shows the Obama administration is taking billion dollar big bank settlement and funneling that money to favorite liberal political groups.</p><p>The Daily Caller's Christopher Bedford has the evidence. He's with me next.</p><p>BOLTON: A new report shows the Obama administration is funneling millions of dollars in banks settlement cash to approved liberal groups. So, big banks paid billions of dollars in settlements after the financial crisis. That combined amount close to $11 billion is apparently being funneled into liberal political groups such as La Raza, the National Urban League, and the National Community Reinvestment Coalition.</p><p>My next guest says this is an old trick, editor-in-chief of the Daily Caller news foundation, Christopher Bedford with me now. Chris, welcome back. So, where did we said, coming from the big banks, we showed people where it's going but how is it happening?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER BEDFORD, THE DAILY CALLER ASSOCIATE EDITOR: So, consumers and taxpayers may expect that when these millions of dollars or billions of dollars are taken from this bank because of promise -- problems with their business dealings, so that's going to go back to refunding the taxpayer or to giving them some kind of relief.</p><p>But it turns out no. There is actually a system that's really well put in place. To get this money to go to community outreach groups, places like they got council of La Raza, places like Catholic charities which is not a leftist group, that's an exception and the urban League.</p><p>And this is an old system. You have to remember that the president got his start before the Senate as a community organizer. And there's a lot of people, activists outside government and inside government that they funnel this money in, they find the banks, the money goes back to the left-wing groups, the left-wing group sue again and this is repudiate system where the banks lose but they don't want to fight back.</p><p>BOLTON: So, Chris, you mentioned this is an old trick. Where have you seen this before?</p><p>BEDFORD: The EPA is one place you should look for it all the time. Environmental groups which are largely the groups that they are alumni's, staffed the EPA. They sue the government over different regulations, things that they want.</p><p>The government responds by finding different groups, finding energy companies and then they send that money right back to the EPA or to the environmental activists groups to start it all over again. It's very common, especially in environmentalism.</p><p>BOLTON: And as you say, the visual of a cycle is apt. President Obama meeting with Health and Human Services today this scrambling huge put forth a 300-page fix to ObamaCare. There's a new report out that says nearly a third of U.S. counties will be left with only one insurance option on the ObamaCare exchanges next year.</p><p>So, that seems like dire news for anybody who needs to buy health insurance?</p><p>BEDFORD: It is absolutely dire news and it's going to affect more than 20 million people. There is even one county in the United States, it's not right now currently doesn't have any insurer that want to do this, and a large part is because ObamaCare hasn't hit its projections.</p><p>They're expecting over 20 million people to be signed up for ObamaCare, we're less than half of that. And as a consequence, the number of insurance companies are losing money and are pulling out of markets and it's going to leave people in a bind. Because when there's no competition in the marketplace, their premiums are going to go up, up, up.</p><p>BOLTON: So, Chris, one of the flaws that experts have talked to us about is that the Obama administration expected just as many young, healthy people to sign up, that's the mandates, as poorer, more sick people who needed more service to sign up and that didn't happen?</p><p>BEDFORD: That didn't happen; they haven't made a number of their projections. That's one example. Also they expected that businesses would push their employees off and push them into the marketplace, and that hasn't happened.</p><p>And then you're seeing right now that the White House is trying to spin this, like, oh, well, none of this happened so everything is failing. But it's a good thing that people haven't been pushed into the marketplace.</p><p>And you're seeing government economics at their most hysterical, when everyone's premiums are rising and rising and the government says, don't worry we'll just pay more for it, never actually realize that the reason why everything is becoming more expensive is because they've gotten involved in the first place.</p><p>BOLTON: Christopher Bedford, we thank you as always.</p><p>BEDFORD: Thank you.</p><p>BOLTON: Glad to have your insight.</p><p>A new report shows <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton's </nameText></person>team is getting advice from psychology experts to create a personality profile of <person><nameText>Donald Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>My next guest says the only person who needs a psychological profile is <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton. </nameText></person>Dr. Keith Ablow is with me next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID PLOUFFE, FORMER OBAMA CAMPAIGN MANAGER: I think the assessment was that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>would try and do some things to appeal to the middle of the electorate, to appeal to suburban college educated women, He's not. I mean, basically you have a psychopath running for president. I mean, he meets the clinical definition, OK?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: A new report shows that <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton's </nameText></person>campaign is getting advice from psychology experts to create a personality profile of <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>So, the Clinton campaign is supposedly looking for trigger points and compiling a strategy when <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>and <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>are one on one on a debate stage.</p><p>My next guest says <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>is the one in need of psychological profile. Fox News contributor, psychiatrist and author Dr. Keith Ablow is with me now. Dr. Ablow, welcome back.</p><p>KEITH ABLOW, FOX NEWS MEDICAL A-TEAM: Thanks for having me.</p><p>BOLTON: How would you evaluate <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton?</nameText></person></p><p>ABLOW: Well, listen, first of all, as to the psychological profile of <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>I can save them time, 30 seconds. The guy's addicted to the truth. He blurts it out. He's inelegant at times but that's because he really wants to address things in unadulterated, straightforward way and it does get him in trouble sometimes.</p><p>He says more in a dramatic way than his heart really means, right? He's a good and decent guy who goes overboard and says extreme things. OK, his psychological profile is over.</p><p>Now for hers, we have somebody who can be understood as wanting one thing and only one thing, power. She was willing to have a sham marriage to her husband which was riddled with his affections for other women throughout the marriage, and she was willing to demonize those women, why? And to stay with her husband, why? Power.</p><p>That's the only reason, that's all you need to understand for <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>is for some reason I leave this to her psychologist, God willing she gets one and her.</p><p>For some reason she feels disempowered to such an extent in her soul that she must get power in any possible way. Hence, when she's Secretary of State and people say, man, your performance led to the death of American servicemen, she says what difference does that make? But she's telling you the truth because the question is did it diminish my power in the world? No.</p><p>BOLTON: Such a different perspective.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ABLOW: And that's all that matters.</p><p>BOLTON: So, let me ask you this, speaking of power and speaking of political couples that are in the spotlight. A top Clinton aide Huma Abedin announcing she's leaving her husband Anthony Weiner, it is following his third sexting scandal.</p><p><person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>connected it to Hillary, actually put out a statement and it said, \"<person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>was careless and negligent in allowing Weiner to have close proximity to highly classified information. Who knows what he learned and who he told?\"</p><p>So, obviously the implication is that Huma Abedin may have left a phone, a Blackberry or files around that her spouse may have had access to. Do you think this shows bad judgment on a leader's part?</p><p>ABLOW: Well, it does because who knows what this lunatic was told, in other words. You know, this is a woman's husband, presumably, it's not something that you know you live with a wall inside your home, such that there's no communication, so we have someone who is very vulnerable who at any time can feel that his political or journalistic or business future is on the line, and that somebody holds the keys to it.</p><p>We know that people can be hacked. So, here's a very vulnerable person who is getting information or has access to information that may be classified or that may be misused and lead to Americans being in harm's way. Of course that's crazy carelessness.</p><p>But again, <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton, </nameText></person>the question isn't whether it's careless, it isn't whether we might suffer. The question is, is it going to lead to less power for me, <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>in the answer is no. I seem to be doing OK in the polls, I could get the corner office. I've been willing to swallow this horrible relationship with my husband, I've been willing to tolerate the deaths of American servicemen.</p><p>This is nothing, a separate server? I think I can get the corner office and be more powerful despite all of these negative detracting things for the American people. We're going to pay the price if she's elected for her having felt tremendously disempowered at some point in her life, probably very early in her life.</p><p>BOLTON: Well, she's even spoken about that. Dr. Keith Ablow, thank you very much for a different perspective. We're glad to have you.</p><p>ABLOW: All right. Well, thank you so much.</p><p>BOLTON: Conservative radio host, <person><nameText>Rush Limbaugh </nameText></person>calling out national anthem protesting 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick.

When Colin Kaepernick signed with the team, there were certain rules and presumably either he took his paycheck and went by them or he didn't.</p><p>Where I disagree and you didn't show this, was <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>reaction which is always looking through trying to pit blacks against whites and trying to kind of see through things to a kind of crass racial prism, which resulted in his tweet after Dwayne Wade's cousin and after the Orlando shooter.</p><p>It would never, ever dawn on <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>to actually address maybe whatever it is that Colin Kaepernick is protesting, which is why the Weekly Standard talked about his outreach to the black community as being cartoonish. So, yes, I kind of understand Rush's point.</p><p>BOLTON: So, Richard, hold the thought. Because we do have <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>reaction, here's his comment.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>(R) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think it's a terrible thing, and, you know, maybe you should find a country that works better for him. Let him try. It won't happen.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: So, Fred, by <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>standards, that was a very muted thoughtful response, many people say, even his critics said, you know what? That's pretty OK. If he wants to find a better country, let him go. What do you think?</p><p>FRED BARNES, WEEKLY STANDARD EXECUTIVE EDITOR: I don't think -- I don't think <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is the issue here at all. Kaepernick is, and I think you have to put -- I'm not that -- I'm not that upset about Kaepernick because you have to put it in perspective.</p><p>Go back to the Olympics. Remember the 12 basketball players standing while The Star-Spangled Banner was played because they've won the gold. Eleven African-Americans and the 12th was biracial all with hands over their hearts.</p><p>Remember the gymnast Gabby Douglas who got so criticized because she, when was standing there with some other gymnast for a gold medal gymnasts didn't have her hand over her heart. She said later she wasn't protesting. She was proud to be there to win the gold for herself and for her country, so.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: Yes. She said she was standing up straight, she has family members and service and she clarified the comments.</p><p>BARNES: Look, when you see those things, the basketball players and Gabby Douglas, I think this Kaepernick thing looms pretty small.</p><p>BOLTON: OK, looms pretty small. David, what is your take? I mean, he seems to be a bit younger and greener in many ways in the kindest of terms. I mean, there was a scuffle that he had last year with his teammates. There's a long list of...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DAVID WEBB, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, where he called his teammate the \"n\" word.</p><p>BOLTON: Yes, and apparently was screaming. I mean, it seems like he's just looking for trouble?</p><p>WEBB: Well, I don't know what he's looking for but at some point you're a grown man. I agree by the way, he has a right to do it, those that have raised their right hand they did defend anyone's right to do this. That's not the issue neither is Trump the issue.</p><p>The issue is the false narrative here. Kaepernick sits, he doesn't stand. Dwayne Wade's cousin, Nykea Aldridge is killed in Chicago by two black criminals, the Sorrels brothers, 22 and 26, Beyonc\u201a Black Lives Matters on stage, but are Beyonc\u201a calling Kaepernick and those mothers going to go to the funeral of Nykea Aldridge. There's the fair question. What's the action that follows?</p><p>BOLTON: How invested are you?</p><p>WEBB: How invested are you in the truth and the reality of dealing with this? So, Richard can try to make it about Trump. Frankly, let's make it about the issue and really talk about the issue of what's going on in black and frankly, economically disparate communities.</p><p>BOLTON: So, Richard, David just brought in Beyonc\u201a, the fact that she stole a bit of a production line from the DNC. She invited the moms of fallen citizens, those who sometimes, well, let's just say, had scuffles with police, ended up dead, some cases were dismissed. Some cases took...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WEBB: Two were outright criminals.</p><p>LEMON: Two were outright criminals. What is your sense on why this is such a big part of the conversation?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Well, I don't think it is a big part of the conversation. Look, I think - I think <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is actually trying to put the focus on the question of whose better for black community, democrats or republicans, and the fact of the matter is we've had a test case here.</p><p>Under the Bill Clinton administration, we actually had the biggest increase in wealth for the black community ever. Under the Bush administration, the biggest collapse, under Obama, 77 straight months of private sector growth. I would welcome that to be.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WEBB: So, I think revisionist history, Richard. I love revisionist history. Who was in charge of Congress under the Clinton administration?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Good. I'm giving -- I'm tipping my...</p><p>WEBB: So, what was that guy's name? Newt Gingrich in work there. It was the republican program that Dick Morris convinced Clinton to sign as President because Congress had it in inset, and that what led to warfare, that was what led to a rise and lower in poverty in the black community and a rise by over 44 percent. So, let's stop assigning the false narratives and deal with the facts at hand.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Bill Clinton was President, you will concede that, right?</p><p>WEBB: Yes, he was president, but it was a republican plan that he signed.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Thank you.</p><p>BOLTON: All right.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: It wasn't a republican plan in '93 when Bill Clinton decided to raise taxes. All the republicans Dick Armey said we were going to have a big collapse and we had the biggest economic growth ever. That was on republican plan.</p><p>BOLTON: All right.</p><p>BARNES: But, Richard, the issue is Kaepernick, it's not Trump or Clinton, it's Kaepernick. And we'll see what happens to him. You know, David Stern, when he had a basketball player, Chris Jackson in the NBA, wouldn't stand.</p><p>BOLTON: Right.</p><p>BARNES: You know what he told Chris Jackson, he said, look, you don't have to stand, but you'll get fined every game you don't stand for the Star- Spangled Banner.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: Right. That's a good reminder.</p><p>BARNES: You know what happened? He started to stand.</p><p>BOLTON: Fred, Richard, and David, thank you. We're back in a minute.</p><p>BOLTON: Fox Business Network has special coverage of <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>immigration speech tomorrow starting at 7 p.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>In the meantime, my colleague Liz Macdonald here for Charles Payne. Making Money starts now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

But that took 21 years - starting in 1890 and culminating in 1911 - and it was arguably rather less complex.</p><p>Although Standard Oil encompassed an astonishing variety of businesses - from oil production to pipelines, railways, refineries and distribution companies - this was a business assembled by a single man in a single industry - and efforts to dismember it were largely restricted to its operations in one country: the US.</p><p>For regulators, Big Tech is a far more amorphous and diverse target, composed of a variety of truly global companies whose alleged ills are far more extensive.</p><p>This is not just a fight about predatory pricing or monopolistic behaviour by powerful companies over a single industry. Google and Facebook exercise a vice-like grip over the global online ad market, of course. But they are also accused of spreading misinformation, abusing the privacy of customers and of amplifying the views of extreme Right-wing or terror groups.</p><p>These are all different concerns to some of those about Amazon and Apple, for example - neither of which can really be described as a monopoly. Amazon may be a huge company but it still only controls a 5pc share of the US retail market. That is why regulators need to rapidly decide what they intend to focus on and what their priorities should be.</p><p>At the moment, the approach seems muddled, giving the impression of a thoughtless all-out assault on an industry that has brought many benefits to consumers as well as potential harm.</p><p>So far, however, US lawmakers have shown little sign of being up to the challenge. When Mark Zuckerberg explained patiently to a hearing last year that \"Senator, we run ads\", he offered a revealing glimpse of Silicon Valley's real view of Washington DC. The subtext was clear: \"These ageing dopes really have no idea how our industry works.\" Nevertheless, the sense that Silicon Valley's biggest players are under siege - not just in Europe where Margrethe Vestager, the competition commissioner, has been levying big fines but now in the US too - is growing.</p><p>The US tech giants have traditionally shunned political lobbying - at least compared to other industries like pharmaceuticals or energy - but the industry is now tooling up for a fight.</p><p>Google, Amazon, and Facebook forked out record amounts to influence the US government in 2018. They spent a combined $48m (\u00a338m) on lobbying - up 13pc from 2017. The largest increase came from Google, which lifted its lobbying spending 18pc to over $21m. Facebook's spending rose 10pc to over $12m.</p><p>With the threat of US antitrust action looming, you can bet those figures are destined to shoot up again sharply in 2019, not least because the tech industry is now feeling the heat from all sides of the political spectrum.</p><p>Democrats such as Elizabeth Warren, the long-standing antitrust campaigner who is now running for the nomination for president, is agitating for a break-up of Big Tech.</p><p>But Donald Trump also has the industry in his sights, driven by a dislike of Silicon Valley's arch-liberal values and claims that conservative views are suppressed on social media.</p><p>With political pressure building, fireworks can be expected. Just don't expect a resolution any time soon.</p><p>'Google, Amazon, and Facebook forked out record amounts to influence the US government in 2018'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELEGR-149913379</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELEGR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8P-0T81-JCBW-N3XW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8109</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"899\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30219\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 6, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

A few weeks ago, BP cut the value of its assets by $17.5 billion. This is not just short-term reaction to the coronavirus crisis, but reaction to climate change and the need to cut global dependency on carbon based fuel.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last week, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Sunday Times</emphasis> published its expos\u00e9 of Boohoo, revealing both its below legal pay and appalling work conditions, increasing the risk of coronavirus infection. The share price has fallen 35%.</p><p>Last week, it was revealed that a major fund manager (Merian) was the second highest shareholder after the owner. The fund manager states that they were one of the first fund managers to understand the importance of ESG. This begs a question or two.</p><p>Last week, Motely Fool and Yahoo Finance suggested that Boohoo was now a good buy!</p><p>There are still those who believe ESG is merely a FAD, the current cool, maybe woke, trend that will disappear when we get back to normal. Not a chance.</p><p>ESG came about in 2004 when the UN Gobal Compact got together with the investment community. They devised PRI, principles for responsible investment, to achieve a more sustainable global financial future.</p><p>From the investor viewpoint, and the managers of $80 trillion who have signed up to PRI, the issue is one of risk. If you invest in a company that is forced to write down $billions of assets, the share price falls.</p><p>If you invest in a company that mistreats its employees (like Boohoo), the share price falls. If you invest in a company with great policies on recruitment and treatment of staff, shareholders, neighbours, product life cycle, and a great product, the chances are that you will receive a great return. In other words, it's about fear and greed.</p><p>The challenge for those promoting ESG investment is transparency and clarity. Why should you believe a manager who says his firm follows ESG principles unless you understand the basis of selection or exclusion of stocks and the source of the data employed? </p><p>Larger asset managers tend to use their own research, often in tandem with data providers such as Sustainalytics, MSCI or Refinitiv. That is not enough. We need to understand exactly how they do it. I have studied the process followed by Refintiv. I am not suggesting it is the right one to follow, but to its credit the process is fully disclosed and transparent.</p><p>The crucial message behind an ESG rating is to remember that it should not be judgemental. They may rate an oil company well because it is investing large amounts in non-carbon energy and behaves well in other respects. One analyst said to me: \"Our role is to find best in class.\"</p><p>There are those investors who wish to make very specific choices about where they place their money. Some wish to invest in companies that they believe will create a better world, e.g. carbon alternatives or innovate medical products.</p><p>Others wish to exclude what they perceive as non-ethical products. This is the most controversial and subjective area. Some will exclude pharmaceuticals because some behave extremely badly - true. Yet, the awareness of the need for drug companies and research has never been clearer than now. Some regard alcohol as unethical, whereas others, like me, regard it as an absolute essential.</p><p>What about banks? Do any banks behave well? Yet we need banks.</p><p>Sadly, it gets more complex. While some see the big tech companies as great example and all that is good for the future, others see them as beyond the pale. Look to Volkswagen, which was one of the most highly regarded companies in Europe - until they were found to cheat their customers.</p><p>For me, there are two options.</p><p>The first is where investors direct their money, following their wishes and helped by their advisers. This could lead to ethical, impact, thematic and similar funds or portfolios. There are fund managers and DFMs that specialise in these products and do a great job.</p><p>The second option is to invest across the investment landscape but with a form of screening that removes companies that are behaving badly. I use the present tense quite deliberately, because things change. A good example might be a tracker.</p><p>As a passive investor, I do not want to try to pick stock that will outperform, or back stock pickers. However, I would like to exclude the Boohoos of this world. Thus, my ideal fund is a tracker with an ESG screen that removes all stocks with an ESG score below an agreed level.</p><p>So, to be, perhaps, controversial, I very much believe in arms companies. I don't want to live in a world where Putin or Xi, for example, can get their wishes because nothing will stop them. I want to invest in an arms business that does not sell AR15s to white supremacists or Al Qaeda terrorists.</p><p>I do not wish to invest in a pharma business that buys a patent so that it can jack up the prices tenfold because it can. Moreover, I want the manager to move money as companies change their behaviour for better or worse.</p><p>We will not change the world purely by directing our money at nice companies. Indeed, if we cheapen the stock price, we make it more attractive to those without principles. If all nice people sell an arms manufacturer, there are plenty of hedge funds, private equity houses and sovereign wealth funds that will be delighted to pick up the shares at a discount - see earlier comment re Boohoo.</p><p>ESG is about rewarding good corporate behaviour and penalising the bad. Hopefully it will lead to a better, nicer world and be a check on climate change.</p><p>Very finally, both legislation and regulation will make adherence by business, investment managers and advisers compulsory.

Here in the States, the government is restricting access to the two apps in a battle between China and the U.S. that cent...</p><p>Sunday looms as a red-letter day for TikTok and Tencent\u2019s WeChat \u2013 and tens of millions of users who use the apps to conduct commerce.   Here in the States, the government is restricting access to the two apps in a battle between China and the U.S. that centers on national security.   The Commerce Department said on Friday (Sept. 18) that providers will be banned from distributing those apps, which of course impacts Google and Apple, the tech giants whose app stores are key access areas.   \"The only real change as of Sunday night will be [TikTok users] won't have access to improved apps, updated apps, upgraded apps or maintenance,\" Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Friday morning, as reported by The New York Times .   Drilling down into what a ban actually means, in terms of using the apps themselves, the Commerce Department order states in stark terms  that \u201cany transaction by any person, or with respect to any property, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, with ByteDance Ltd \u2026shall be prohibited to the extent permitted under applicable law.\u201d   The ban cites the May 15, 2019 executive order signed by President Donald Trump (known as Executive Order 13873) contending that foreign adversaries are \u201cincreasingly creating and exploiting vulnerabilities in information and communications technology and services (ICTS)\u201d to obtain sensitive information.   The Friday announcement is the latest chapter in an ongoing saga between ByteDance and companies such as Microsoft and Oracle, which are in talks to create a U.S.-based firm that would, ostensibly, allay those data security concerns.   Beyond the geopolitical saber-rattling, here\u2019s what it all means: The Trump administration\u2019s ban would restrict Apple and Google from letting users in the U.S. utilize those apps, while still letting users outside the U.S. use them.   That demarcation, we contend, divides the world into users who can transact and those who cannot, and has ripple effects for eCommerce. As of Sept. 20 for TikTok and Nov. 12 for WeChat, the Commerce Department is banning updates to the codes, the transmission of data and, as the order notes, \u201cany provision of internet hosting\u201d or \u201ccontent delivery network services enabling the functioning or optimization of the mobile application\u201d in the US.  The order seems a way to basically render the apps nonexistent in the U.S.   Interestingly, the order specifically states that the prohibition does not apply to TikTok\u2019s \u201cpayment of wages, salaries and benefit packages to employees or contractors.\u201d   A separate release by the Commerce Department noted that as of Sunday, prohibited transactions include \u201cany provision of services through the WeChat mobile application for the purpose of transferring funds or processing payments within the U.S.\u201d   As widely reported, TikTok\u2019s user base in the U.S. is around 100 million; WeChat\u2019s installed base here is 19 million, as  Reuters reported .   In terms of commerce, the impact on the apps\u2019 parent companies may be slight. As reported in The Wall Street Journal, Tencent garners less than 2 percent of its sales from the U.S. But the bans would quickly hobble commerce conducted by Chinese nationals living, working and studying here \u2013 and, of course, making payments here. And TikTok has caught on like wildfire in the States, especially among younger users.   And as  PYMNTS reported last month , as bans first loomed: There is the specter of an economic war of sorts conducted across borders (here, between China and the U.S.) that could ensnare Big Tech. Apple gets a mid-teens percentage revenue contribution from the country; the card giants have been trying to gain a foothold in China. If the U.S. bans hosting and transmission, as well as mobile conduits, the quarrel will quickly escalate, ensnaring merchants, payments processors and, of course, consumers.   It was unclear last month what scope of transactions the Trump administration would look to curtail \u2013 and now the scope has crystallized. The ban\u2019s extent is broad indeed \u2013 and what\u2019s left undefined, at least for now, is just how widespread the impact may be to eCommerce as a result of trade tensions.   \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014    LIVE PYMNTS TV OCTOBER SERIES: POWERING THE DIGITAL SHIFT \u2013 B2B PAYMENTS 2021      Banks, corporates and even regulators now recognize the imperative to modernize \u2014 not just digitize \u2014the infrastructures and workflows that move money and data between businesses domestically and cross-border.

The annual rate of inflation fell marginally to 0.9% in March versus 1.0% in February. That was much higher a year ago. Today's news gave the Fed a reason to stand pat on no rate hikes. The other good news is those pesky jobless claims showed the first drop in 3 weeks by 24,000 down to 456,000. Even the continuing claims (the long-lived army of the unemployed) fell 40,000 to 4,646,000. </p><p><br/>And despite more calls for more regulation from the Obama administration, stocks staged a much better close than they indicated this morning before the open, even if the Black-Red verdict was not evident until the final minutes of the day. <br/>Here were today's closing bell levels:<br/>Dow  11,134.29  +9.37  (0.08%) <br/>S&amp;P 500  1,208.67  +2.74  (0.23%) <br/>Nasdaq  2,519.07  +14.46  (0.58%)<br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://links.newstex.com/link?p=103308&amp;c=39&amp;s=AOLB-5174-44172317&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2F247wallst.com%2F2010%2F04%2F22%2Ftop-analyst-upgrades-and-downgrades-adbe-aa-aapl-arry-chk-cmg-emc-hov-mtg-sndk-spg%2F\">Top Day Trader Alerts</url><br/>Apple, Inc.(      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://links.newstex.com/link?p=103308&amp;c=39&amp;s=AOLB-5174-44172317&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailyfinance.com%2Fquotes%2Fapple-inc%2Faapl%2Fnas\">AAPL</url>) had another solid day with yet another all-time high, which may in part be due to a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://links.newstex.com/link?p=103308&amp;c=39&amp;s=AOLB-5174-44172317&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2F247wallst.com%2F2010%2F04%2F21%2Fapple-chart-320-to-330-target-aapl-msft%2F\">technical analyst call from last night</url> calling for much higher prices.

Earnings barely beat estimates last night and the guidance was soft to in-line at best.

It beat earnings, raised guidance, and saw margin expansion from its cost cuts and from its reorganization.

On July 29, the chief executives of Amazon, Apple, Google, and Facebook spent more than five hours fielding tough questions about their overwhelming market power from a bipartisan antitrust panel in the US House of Representatives. Is the end of an era approaching?</p><p><br/>In many ways, the Covid-19 pandemic has been a boon for tech companies. As Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Apple's Tim Cook, Google's Sundar Pichai, and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg all noted in their opening statements at the antitrust hearing, people appreciate the services their companies provide. Recent research indicates that the Covid-19 crisis has deepened this appreciation.<br/>This is not surprising. Digital technologies have enabled workers to do their jobs from home, students to continue their classes while schools are closed, and people to stay in touch with loved ones and entertain themselves while sheltering in place.<br/>Tech companies have been reaping enormous benefits from this shift. In the first half of 2020, while the global economy confronted an unprecedented recession, Amazon's share price rose by about 40%, fuelled by rising online purchases and increased used of cloud services. Zoom's market value has more than tripled since the start of the Covid-19 crisis, as it became a hub for remote meetings and online socialising.<br/>As for Google and Facebook, they suffered temporary losses from reduced advertising revenues. But they still account for an overwhelming share of the digital-advertising market \u2013 four-fifths in the United Kingdom, to cite one example. Moreover, while Google and Facebook are free to use, the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has concluded that consumers are effectively paying for their services indirectly through advertising revenues, at a rate of \u00a3500 ($656) per household annually \u2013 a testament to their market power.<br/>It is too early to say how much of people's lives will move online, or for how long. People may fear Covid-19, but they also suffer from Zoom fatigue. Nonetheless, it seems likely that work and social patterns will undergo some sustained changes, which will have far-reaching policy implications.<br/>For starters, closing the digital divide will become more urgent than ever. Of the many forms of inequality the pandemic is exposing and exacerbating, unequal access to the Internet and digital technologies is among the most prominent.<br/>All the services that have made lives so much better under social-distancing rules \u2013 from remote working to online shopping to streaming services \u2013 are available only to those with access to a reasonably fast and reliable Internet connection and suitable hardware. Many are also receiving healthcare and accessing government support online, further highlighting the critical importance of universal access.<br/>In recent years, governments have increasingly recognised this imperative. For example, in 2018, the US Federal Communications Commission made closing the digital divide a high priority. And yet about one in 20 people in the United States still have no high-speed Internet connection. In rural areas, about one-third of households are not connected. The figures are similarly bleak in the UK.<br/>Closing the gap will require large-scale investment in digital infrastructure, including broadband connectivity and 5G for mobile services. In both the US and the UK, governments are working to deliver on the first imperative, by making the low-return rural investments that cannot attract private capital. Progress on the second imperative may be more difficult, owing to political opposition to the Chinese telecoms giant and 5G leader Huawei.<br/>But Huawei may be turn out to be the tip of an iceberg, because the current shift online will lead to greater political and regulatory scrutiny of tech giants. For one thing, regulators are likely to pressure telecommunications companies to increase investment, spurring debates about license obligations and pricing (how much companies must invest, and how they will fund it). Past disputes about where along the value chain costs should fall \u2013 from physical network operators to streaming services \u2013 may re-emerge.<br/>But, as the recent US antitrust hearing suggests, the most contentious issue will probably be the market power of digital companies. Even in today's highly polarised political environment, growing concern about Big Tech \u2013 including the viability of small producers and the economy's dependence on digital market access \u2013 is broadly shared. And US regulators have already signalled their concern, with inquiries by both the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice.<br/>The European Union is far ahead of the US when it comes to regulating, taxing, and constraining Big Tech. The European Commission has pursued multiple antitrust cases against the tech giants, as well as broader initiatives such as the proposed Digital Services Act. Margrethe Vestager \u2013 previously the European commissioner for competition, and currently Executive Vice President of the European Commission for A Europe Fit for the Digital Age \u2013 has led the way on this front.<br/>In the UK, the CMA is working to implement the Furman Review, a government-commissioned report on digital-market competition published in March 2019. The panel recommended subjecting strategically important companies to targeted regulation, including a code of conduct that will likely cover issues such as favouring one's own services, changes in terms and conditions, and pre-notification of all mergers.<br/>It remains to be seen how such efforts will play out, especially in a US headed toward a highly contentious presidential election. But one thing is clear: Though the tech monopolists may capture significant short-term gains from the accelerating shift online, they can no longer avoid the harsh glare of the political spotlight. The writing may be on the wall. \u2013 Project Syndicate<br/><br/>* Diane Coyle, Professor of Public Policy at the University of Cambridge, is the author, most recently, of Markets, State, and People: Economics for Public Policy (Princeton University Press, 2020).</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/60/183/30/159632657290.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/60/183/30/159632657290.jpg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLFTMS-181108514</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLFTMS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GW-0931-F11P-X0Y0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">381159</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1032\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Gulf Times Newspaper Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

On one hand, it describes a firm trust in something or someone the kind of trust that people around the world, from Brazil to the United States to North Africa, increasingly lack in their leaders and even governance systems. On the other hand, confianza refers to confidence in oneself something that is in particularly short supply in Europe.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In fact, the European Union is suffering from a deficit of confianza in both senses. This is a uniquely dangerous mix, because a lack of trust and self-confidence is leading the EU not just to outsider politics and even outlaw politicians, but also to policy paralysis, public outrage and an utter inability to determine its own destiny. Both before and after next month's European Parliament election, which will precede a new European Commission and a new European Council president this deficit must urgently be addressed.</p><p>Public trust in EU leaders and institutions took a serious hit after the 2008 financial crisis. By then, the original purpose of the European project to support peace on the continent after the devastation of World War II had lost its purchase on public opinion. Europeans had gotten used to peace.</p><p>Meanwhile, \"Europe\" became focused on the broader and vaguer goal of championing \"shared values.\" That objective underpinned the establishment of the formal EU institutions.</p><p>For voters, however, lofty ideals were not the point. Europe had achieved peace through prosperity; mutually beneficial economic relations were the key to deterring conflict. But, as the memory of the war faded, the means became the ends. Prosperity was all that mattered.</p><p>So, when markets crashed in 2008, and Europe was engulfed by a series of crises (which were exacerbated by flaws in the European architecture), the public lost confidence that the European project was even viable, let alone desirable. These doubts intensified as other trends including globalization, automation and the emerging dominance of Big Tech transformed economies and societies, creating new sources of insecurity.</p><p>Economies had become much broader than societies, and thus lacked the social underpinnings of the past. Add to that the expansion of the regulatory state, and citizens felt a perceptible loss of agency.</p><p>The resulting uncertainty has produced fear and frustration, fueling popular anger not just at flaws in the system, but also at the system itself and the \"elites\" who had \"imposed\" it. Aided by opportunistic politicians, mainstream political parties have become the enemy, and experts have lost credibility. Truth itself is under attack.</p><p>An effective response to this challenge must be broad, multilayered, and robust. In European countries and in the Western democracies more broadly such a response requires political leaders to engage more deeply with citizens, together with efforts to build societal resilience. At the European level, it also demands the development of a clear raison d'\u00eatre that extends beyond prosperity.</p><p>But it also means the construction of a more effective, results-oriented institutional arrangement.</p><p>The EU has been an intergovernmental, rather than a transnational, endeavor since at least the financial crisis. Agenda-setting and decision-making authority lies with national governments, and, by default, powerful members, especially Germany, and disruptive mavericks, such as Hungary and Poland, dominate these processes.</p><p>During the financial crisis, Europeans looked to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, not then-European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, for a solution. Despite the declaration by Barroso's successor, Jean-Claude Juncker, that his commission represented a \"last chance\" for winning back the support of citizens, Merkel has also dominated decision-making these last five years. This is exemplified by migration, where time and again decisions impacting the EU as a whole, including the bloc's agreement with Turkey, were taken in Berlin with little or no consultation. This is the reality.</p><p>And yet the European Parliament and the commission have sought to increase their own powers.</p><p>This is the wrong way to achieve a meaningfully central place in policymaking. Instead of attempting to offset the power of member states by expanding their competencies, these institutions should focus on comparative advantage.</p><p>For the European Parliament, this could mean establishing itself as a source of facts, ideas, and vision, rather than as a co-legislator, given how little appetite there is for surrendering sovereignty even over the most practical issues. At a time of disinformation and confusion, the Parliament could conduct credible studies and disseminate authoritative research, much like the House of Lords does in the United Kingdom.</p><p>For the European Commission, the goal should be to strengthen its role as protector of the spirit and vision of the EU treaties, while taking responsibility for proper policy implementation. This would require the commission to stop trying to show at every opportunity that it is the captain of the ship. As these last years have shown, without political buy-in, it cannot follow through on any course it charts, whether on migration, energy independence, or defense. This failure undermines the EU's credibility, while wasting time and resources.</p><p>As for the European Council, it must act more as a collegium and less a loudspeaker for the views of certain capitals in setting direction. Here the role and personality of the council's incoming president, who will set the tone, is crucial.</p><p>By focusing on rebuilding confianza in both its forms, the next commission, Parliament and council can bolster the EU's legitimacy and facilitate progress in core areas, such as consolidating the euro and completing the single market and banking union. This new, stronger EU would be far better equipped to defend European interests and values on the world stage, which would bolster public trust further.</p><p>But if the EU institutions fail to show the needed humility and vision, no such virtuous circle will emerge. The European ship could continue to drift along aimlessly; worse, it will take on water until, ultimately, it sinks. In the stormy seas of escalating great power competition, that will happen more quickly than EU leaders seem to recognize.</p><p>Ana Palacio is former Minister of Foreign Affairs of Spain and former Senior Vice President and General Counsel of the World Bank Group.

On one hand, it describes a firm trust in something or someone \u2014 the kind of trust that people around the world, from Brazil to the US to North Africa, increasingly lack in their leaders and even governance systems. On the other hand, confianza refers to confidence in oneself \u2014 something that is in particularly short supply in Europe.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In fact, the EU is suffering from a deficit of confianza in both senses. This is a uniquely dangerous mix, because a lack of trust and self-confidence is leading the EU not just to outsider politics and even outlaw politicians, but also to policy paralysis, public outrage, and an utter inability to determine its own destiny. Both before and after next month's European Parliament elections \u2014 which will precede a new European Commission and a new European Council president \u2014 this deficit must urgently be addressed.</p><p>Public trust in EU leaders and institutions took a serious hit after the 2008 financial crisis. By then, the original purpose of the European project \u2014 to support peace on the continent after the devastation of the Second World War \u2014 had lost its purchase on public opinion. Europeans had gotten used to peace. Meanwhile, \"Europe\" became focused on the broader, and vaguer, goal of championing \"shared values.\" That objective underpinned the establishment of the formal EU institutions.</p><p>For voters, however, lofty ideals were not the point. Europe had achieved peace through prosperity; mutually beneficial economic relations were the key to deterring conflict. But, as the memory of the war faded, the means became the end. Prosperity was all that mattered.</p><p>So, when markets crashed in 2008 and Europe was engulfed by a series of crises (which were exacerbated by flaws in the European architecture), the public lost confidence that the European project was even viable, let alone desirable. These doubts intensified as other trends \u2014 including globalization, automation and the emerging dominance of Big Tech \u2014 transformed economies and societies, creating new sources of insecurity.</p><p>Economies had become much broader than societies, and thus lacked the social underpinnings of the past. Add to that the expansion of the regulatory state, and citizens felt a perceptible loss of agency.</p><p>By focusing on rebuilding confianza in both its forms, the next Commission, Parliament and Council can bolster the EU's legitimacy and facilitate progress in core areas, such as consolidating the euro and completing the single market and banking union.</p><p>Ana Palacio</p><p>The resulting uncertainty has produced fear and frustration, fueling popular anger not just at flaws in the system, but also at the system itself \u2014 and the \"elites\" who had \"imposed\" it. Aided by opportunistic politicians, mainstream political parties have become the enemy, and experts have lost credibility. Truth itself is under attack.</p><p>An effective response to this challenge must be broad, multilayered, and robust. In European countries \u2014 and in the Western democracies more broadly \u2014 such a response requires political leaders to engage more deeply with citizens, together with efforts to build societal resilience. At the European level, it also demands the development of a clear raison d'etre that extends beyond prosperity. But it also means the construction of a more effective, results-oriented institutional arrangement.</p><p>The EU has been an intergovernmental, rather than a transnational, endeavor since at least the financial crisis. Agenda-setting and decision-making authority lies with national governments and, by default, powerful members, especially Germany, and disruptive mavericks, such as Hungary and Poland, dominate these processes.</p><p>During the financial crisis, Europeans looked to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, not then-European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, for a solution. Despite the declaration by Barroso's successor, Jean-Claude Juncker, that his Commission represented a \"last chance\" for winning back the support of citizens, Merkel has also dominated decision-making these last five years. This is exemplified by migration, where time and again decisions impacting the EU as a whole, including the bloc's agreement with Turkey, were taken in Berlin with little or no consultation. This is the reality.</p><p>And yet the European Parliament and the Commission have sought to increase their own powers. This is the wrong way to achieve a meaningfully central place in policymaking. Instead of attempting to offset the power of member states by expanding their competencies, these institutions should focus on comparative advantage.</p><p>For the European Parliament, this could mean establishing itself as a source of facts, ideas, and vision, rather than as a co-legislator, given how little appetite there is for surrendering sovereignty over even the most practical issues. At a time of disinformation and confusion, the Parliament could conduct credible studies and disseminate authoritative research, much like the House of Lords does in the UK.</p><p>For the European Commission, the goal should be to strengthen its role as protector of the spirit and vision of the EU treaties, while taking responsibility for proper policy implementation. This would require the Commission to stop trying to show at every opportunity that it is the captain of the ship. As these last years have shown, without political buy-in, it cannot follow through on any course it charts, whether on migration, energy independence or defense. This failure undermines the EU's credibility, while wasting time and resources.</p><p>As for the European Council, it must act more as a collegium and less a loudspeaker for the views of certain capitals in setting direction. Here, the role and personality of the Council's next president, who will set the tone, is crucial.</p><p>By focusing on rebuilding confianza in both its forms, the next Commission, Parliament and Council can bolster the EU's legitimacy and facilitate progress in core areas, such as consolidating the euro and completing the single market and banking union. This new, stronger EU would be far better equipped to defend European interests and values on the world stage, which would bolster public trust further.</p><p>But if the EU institutions fail to show the needed humility and vision, no such virtuous circle will emerge. The European ship could continue to drift along aimlessly; worse, it will take on water until, ultimately, it sinks. In the stormy seas of escalating great power competition, that will happen more quickly than EU leaders seem to recognize.</p><p>Ana Palacio is former Minister of Foreign Affairs of Spain and former Senior Vice President and General Counsel of the World Bank Group.

In other metal futures, silver was down 0.15% to $29.28 a troy ounce while copper rose 0.41% to $4.28 a pound.</p><p>In company news:</p><p>Airline stocks are mixed in regular-session trading after bad weather on the East Coast closed airports and snarled travel around the country. Shares of AMR Corp. (AMR), parent of American Airlines, were up slightly, as were shares of Delta Airlines (DAL) and JetBlue Airways (JBLU). However, shares of Alaska Air Group (ALK) are down along with United Continental (UAL).</p><p>Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) fell after saying in a SEC filing U.S. regulators halted development of an experimental pain killer it's developing with Sanofi-Aventis SA (SNY) after a similar treatment caused the death of bone tissue in another drug maker's study.</p><p>American International Group (AIG) gained after it says it entered into 364-Day and 3-Year Bank Credit Facilities totaling $3 billion split evenly between the two. It also says Chartis has entered into a 1-Year $1.3 billion Letter of Credit Facility. Thirty-Six banks participated in the facilities. The facilities will be available upon the closing of the previously announced recapitalization plan with the United States Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the AIG Credit Facility Trust.</p><p>Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) was mostly flat as The New York Times reports that the retail giant and five other companies have invested $500 million in 360buy.com, a growing Chinese online retailer.

(NFLX) shares were down after Barron's said the stock could be poised for a drop, with the mail and online video rental service needs to soon negotiate new licensing agreements with Hollywood studios for content. Other potential worries are a recent spate of insider selling, along with the recent departure of the company's CFO, although the magazine suggests the stock could have a built-in floor -- the potential that a big tech firm could jump in to buy the company.</p><p>Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) fell as the company failed to get approval from U.S. health regulators for a new formulation of its multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone, reports Bloomberg.

The case, which concerns whether the US government may use a domestic US warrant to access emails held outside the US was the subject of a US supreme court hearing only weeks ago, still awaiting a judgment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The case, which began in a lower court in New York state in 2014, was widely seen as a potential landmark data privacy case with far-reaching effects on the future of cloud computing.</p><p>Microsoft had argued that judges should not have the right to use domestic warrants based on a pre-web 1986 US law, to seize data held internationally. Instead, the US government should use (and ideally, improve) the existing Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty structure, a system under which nations allow international law enforcement access to evidence.</p><p>But this week, the US department of justice (DoJ) - which had made the referral to the supreme court - submitted a motion to have the case declared \"moot\". At the end of March, President Donald Trump signed into law new legislation, the Cloud (Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data) Act, which removed the ambiguity over whether a US court could demand data held extraterritorially by creating a new type of warrant and allowing fresh handover agreements between nations.</p><p>Microsoft has stated it does not object to the case being declared moot. Indeed, in a blog post, company president Brad Smith said Microsoft welcomed the new law.</p><p>The Act had been backed by a number of big tech companies, mostly those with a focus on the cloud computing space. Along with Microsoft, Apple, Google, Facebook, and Oath Inc signed a letter in February stating their support.</p><h>Something or nothing </h><p>So all's well that ends well? Only if you prefer a somewhat improved, alarming something, to uncertainty and nothing.  </p><p>The Cloud Act is a law \"passed\" only in the most technical sense. The Act was never a properly considered piece of legislation before Congress. Instead, it was tacked on at the last minute to the sprawling and, infamously, largely undebated and controversial omnibus Congressional spending Bill signed into law last week.</p><p>And it wasn't universally supported, before or after becoming an afterthought on page 2,212 of the doorstop 2,232-page spending Bill. Kentucky Senator Rand Paul tweeted: \"But guess what? Congress can't vote to reject the Cloud Act, because it just got stuck onto the Omnibus, with no prior legislative action or review.\"</p><p>This was in reference to another of his tweets, in which he quoted from an opinion piece by American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) legislative counsel and former department of homeland security lawyer Neema Singh Guliani: \"Congress should reject the Cloud Act because it fails to protect human rights or Americans' privacy . . . gives up their constitutional role, and gives far too much power to the attorney general, the secretary of state, the president and foreign governments.\"</p><p>The Cloud Act was widely opposed by privacy organisations and activists, from the Electronic Frontier Foundation to the Centre for Democracy and Technology.</p><p>But the Act effectively allows a US president the right to access, say, emails held abroad. At the moment, that means Trump, his attorney general Jeff Sessions and his secretary of state presumptive, former CIA director Mike Pompeo, would have \"extensive and nearly unchecked power over global digital privacy rights\" according to Guliani.</p><p>That certainly focuses the mind.</p><p>Meanwhile, the DoJ swiftly issued a new warrant under the new system and Microsoft swiftly complied, handing over the Dublin-held emails.</p><p>Microsoft's capitulation is disappointing, but was all but inevitable given the company's long-time support for the Cloud Act. Nonetheless, the position sits at odds with many of the company's own pro-privacy arguments made in the case since 2014, which the act does not address.</p><p>While the new framework is in some limited ways, better than no framework, a structure that enables private, non-transparent data transfer agreements between the US and other nations hardly addresses privacy and human rights concerns.</p><p>But stay tuned. The Act seems likely to run up against existing European Court of Justice rulings on data protection, as well as the incoming EU General Data Protection Regulation.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.3450877</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S1M-3J61-JC8Y-8219-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"716\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 5, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>AAPL (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Securities Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Civil Actions</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUUwNTlCQTMwNkYxNDc0NkI0MThCNDgzQTU3RDBBODA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDIwQjUyMTIwMkE5NDc3Qjk5ODQyMUI1OThGMzk2OTE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N922110CC</classCode><className>LAW COURTS &amp;

This will allow each nation to access the data of the other country's citizens without congressional approval.Foreign governments are not required to satisfy any minimum privacy or human rights law standards as a condition of entering a data sharing agreement.The impact on existing Canadian privacy law remains to be seen.Impact on CanadaThe current data sharing agreement between the Canada Border Services Agency and Homeland Security allows the exchange of entry and exit information of travellers crossing the Canada-U.S. border on land. Additionally, Canada's Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act and Privacy Act allow private sector organizations and government to disclose personal information in order to aid lawful investigations in Canada or abroad.The introduction of the CLOUD Act may prompt the U.S. to approach Canada to establish another framework to facilitate data sharing between law enforcement agencies. </p><p>However, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) illustrates the growing trend among nations seeking to provide legislative guidance on how the data of their citizens is to be treated when being transferred cross borders. Canada will be focused on maintaining its status as a country the EU deems to provide adequate privacy protections following the introduction of GDPR in May so data can continue to flow freely between the regions. Any data sharing agreement with the U.S. involving a country that has not been deemed to provide adequate privacy protections by the EU will need to be carefully drafted to ensure it is not viewed as weakening Canada's data protection regime.Big Tech SupportWhile the CLOUD Act received support from technology giants such as Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft, its introduction was met with criticism by civil liberty activists, including the American Civil Liberties Union and Amnesty InternationalUSA, who expressed concern over potential privacy and human rights violations.The support of large American technology companies is not surprising. Tech giants who store personal information on servers around the world have been struggling with the uncertainty in the previous regimes regarding U.S. law enforcement requests for off-shore data. Notably, Microsoft's four-year challenge to whether a domestic U.S. warrant can be used to access emails held on a server in Ireland has been dismissed now the CLOUD Act is signed. During the hearing of that case before the Supreme Court of the United States, Justices Ginsburg, Sotomayor and Breyer hinted that Congress is better suited than the courts to reconcile the conflict between modern technology and older legislation.Alternative to MLATThe CLOUD Act provides an alternative to the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) regime. MLAT requires two or more nations to set out the terms on which information could be exchanged to assist an investigation happening in at least one of the countries party to the MLAT.In the U.S., each request under MLAT is voted on by the Senate and requires two-thirds approval to pass. In Canada, the Minister of Justice, by way of the International Assistance Group, grants approval of MLAT requests based on whether evidence of an offence or information that may reveal the whereabouts of a suspect will be found in Canada.The CLOUD Act grants law enforcement agencies streamlined access to data which may be relevant to crime prevention and investigation. This is a change from MLAT requests which took around 10 months to process, a delay long enough that could render the requested data obsolete.The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

What's more, the number of Internet of Things (IoT) connected devices is predicted to surge to 38.5 billion by 2020, a rise of over 285 percent.2</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is not new or surprising news, but it's significant when considering that software as a service (SaaS) will likely affect nearly all industries, and we are only at the dawn of this new age. The trickle down impact on the telecommunications and power industry is significant. The infrastructure capacity required to support cloud computing will undoubtedly become an increasingly critical component for companies and the communities and states in which they are located.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Moving to Cloud-Based Systems</p><p>According to The National Institute of Standards and Technology, \"Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (networks, servers, etc.) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.\"</p><p>Most industries have a keen interest in lowering costs through reducing expenses and streamlining technology operations to drive efficiency. Cloudbased applications can provide singleentry data capabilities and access to real-time data, and enable real-time collaboration and mobility. Reducing dependency on hardware, on-premises server rooms, cooling systems, and maintenance provides companies with tangible cost and time savings.</p><p>One of the key components to the cloud's success is the pooling or sharing of certain resources - similar to what occurs in the multitenant office building model. The cloud provider serves multiple customers with different physical and virtual resources by sharing storage, processing, memory, network bandwidth, servers, and other technology infrastructure. The real uniqueness, however, is the ability of the cloud provider to serve different customers and industries, all with different usage patterns. Patterns can vary due to physical location (i.e., customers from different countries, time zones, climates, etc.) or business practices. This can give the cloud provider, data centers, and their customers the best leverage for power and telecom- munications use. However, it also provides great opportunity for utility service to be one of the most scrutinized factors in the site selection process for those in the cloud computing industry.</p><p>In a traditional setting, information technology equipment (servers, storage, and communications gear) is stored on a system of racks. Computer room air conditioners (CRACs) deliver a cooling system to prevent the equipment from overheating. Data centers, however, have dedicated cooling systems and power delivery that typically has a high level of reliability. Uninterrupted power supply is available through a series of battery backups or flywheels. The power is distributed throughout, and backup generators are in place in the event of a power outage. Cloud-based application use allows any company or individual to eliminate the need for server rooms, A/C units, and the hardware investment necessary to run and maintain on-premises networks. Cloud computing gives the company the opportunity to only use what space is needed, as the servers are off-site, and the space to store data and rim the applications is leased on an as-needed basis. Utilizing SaaS applications reduces and, in some cases, eliminates the capital-intensive model of the on-premise servers, upgrades, and maintenance.</p><p>Locations are removed from consideration regularly in the site selection process due to inadequate utilities. A lack of water, electric, wastewater, or telecommunications infrastructure can toss a site from contention early in the location decision process. Even in a location where utilities are abundant, the cost of those utilities is of key importance when locating a cloud-based software company or data center. Ongoing operating expenses for power and telecom and robust infrastructure requirements for these industries consistently rank on the list of top important factors in making a location decision.</p><p>Telecom Infrastructure, Reliability</p><p>Access to fiber optics is an expectation for almost every industry. For those utilizing cloud-based services, fiber optics access is essential. For a community, the telecommunications infrastructure is critical in the retention and attraction of companies and the subsequent capital investment associated with them. Competitiveness and redundancy of the broadband services can make a location more attractive as well. Numerous options for providers and services drive down costs and increase broadband speeds.</p><p>It is possible that a company that has detailed energy requirements will need to also understand the fiber backbone structure of the locations under consideration. Depending on the cloud use and operational needs of a company, evaluating the number of Internet exchange points and network access points could become a component in the location decision-making process. Having access to multiple national or regional fiber backbone providers, including digital switches, is an important consideration for a company utilizing cloud services and a necessity to those providing cloud-based services. The ability to prioritize Internet traffic to avoid congestion and eliminate failure of cloud-based services is an ideal efficiency. A community that can offer multiple Tier 1 Internet service providers, and has the ability to seamlessly reroute traffic in the event of a failure, has a better opportunity to land projects operating with the use of cloudbased services.</p><p>Because of overlap between voice carriers and Internet backbone carriers, the largest voice carriers, such as AT&amp;T, Verizon, and Sprint, own some of the largest Internet backbone networks. In turn, they sell their services to the Internet service providers. Those providers that are considered Tier 1 have comprehensive telecommunications networks, access points, and redundancies. Communities with multiple Tier 1 Internet service providers can create a more costcompetitive marketplace with more opportunities to reduce downtime risk.</p><p>The reliability of the Internet is critical in site selection. Whether a company has made the move to the cloud or not, odds are high that it's dependent on Internet communications in order to continue to conduct everyday business. Understanding potential downtimes and redundancies will be key, as Internet connections are essential to company operations. And for the cloud provider, reliability is second only to security in the eyes of its customers. The risk of being offline must be minimal.</p><p>Energy Costs/Reliability</p><p>Power is one of the highest utility costs in operating any facility. For a cloud-based service provider, data center power consumption can easily total over half of the operating costs for the facility.</p><p>Electricity rates vary widely across the United States and are affected by many factors that impact site selection decisions. Fuel costs, power plant expenses, transmission and distribution costs, weather conditions, and regulations all affect the cost of energy. In 2014, the average price for commercial customers was 10.75 cents per kilowatt-hour. For industrial customers, the average price was 7.01 cents per kilowatt-hour.3 Rates can be lower for large energy consumers, such as data centers.</p><p>In a recent study by the National Resources Defense Council (NRDC), U.S. data centers consumed an estimated 91 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, equivalent to the annual output of 34 large (500-megawatt) coal-fired power plants. Data center electricity consumption is projected to increase to roughly 140 billion kilowatt-hours annually by 2020, the equivalent annual output of 50 power plants, costing American businesses $13 billion annually in electricity bills.4 If worldwide data centers were a country, they would be the globe's 12th-largest consumer of electricity, ranking between Spain and Italy.</p><p>There is a 26.38 cent span per kWh between the least expensive and the most expensive electrical rates in the United States. Some of the cost difference is tied to how energy is generated. As an example, states in the Mountain and Northwest regions benefit from hydro and wind power generation. The Midwest States fall closer in line with the national average - Indiana (8.97), Illinois (8.87), Iowa (8.24), Kentucky (8.13), and Ohio (9.97) - but are at risk for seeing their rates increase due to more restrictive federal environmental regulations impacting energy generated from coal.</p><p>Clean energy can be a factor for data center site selection. Google is using less than 1 percent of all data center energy used globally.5 Along with Apple and Facebook, Google is one of the most efficient consumers of energy. These companies are investing in renewable energy resources such as wind power to generate the electricity needed to help power their data centers. The same NRDC report states that 80-85 percent of energy consumption is not a product of the big data centers. This leaves a great number of organizations relying, at least in part, upon the cost and availability of nonrenewable energy resources, such as coal-powered electricity.</p><p>With the expectation that non-data center facilities will become more reliant on cloud-based software and services, it is natural to consider the necessity of the reliability of a community's power infrastructure. Much like telecommunications infrastructure, the redundancy and reliability of electricity is mission-critical to nearly all industries. Companies using cloud services, along with the cloud service providers, must be able to depend on the community where they are located to provide as minimal downtime risk as possible from the area's power grid. Companies simply cannot have their operations go down.</p><p>The infrastructure of the power grid, its redundancies and even accessibility to multiple grids, continues to be important in daily operations and production. The addition of cloud computing gives all industries something new to consider.</p><p>Incentives and More</p><p>There was a time when it was thought that a community needed to offer specific types of incentives in order to attract or retain businesses in the coveted technology industry. With the dawn of cloud computing, however, every company has, in some way, become a technology company. Over time, communities have come to realize that technology companies are looking for the same attributes as non-tech companies when site selecting: human capital, favorable tax rates, low energy costs, a good quality of life, available real estate, and incentives.</p><p>There is a reliance on telecommunications and energy infrastructure like never before. A community that understands how to implement, maintain, and continually improve its telecommunications infrastructure will become increasingly attractive to a wide variety of industries. Solid utility infrastructure and affordable energy costs will never go out of favor, especially in the world of increasing regulation.</p><p>As data center operators, service providers, and multitenant customers consider factors involved in selecting a site for new and growing businesses, a thorough evaluation of internal organizational structure and external contract arrangements, as they pertain to energy and telecom usage, will need to be conducted. Developing \"green\" contracts and investment in energy efficiency should be rewarded. Communities need to evaluate current and future plans for telecommunications and power infrastructure with the knowledge that shared data space and cloud-based computing will be increasing at a rapid pace. Nearly one-third of leased data center space in the United States is due to come up for renewal in the next few years. Nearly all of those leases are based on square footage. The optimum can be accomplished with collaboration between owners, tenants, and communities to ensure the infrastructure and end-user costs work to the advantage of all parties.</p><p>Notes:</p><p>1 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bvp.com/blog/state-cloud-2015\">https://www.bvp.com/blog/state-cloud-2015</url></p><p>2 <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.juniperresearch.com/press/press-releases/iot-connected-devices-to-tripIe-to38-bn-by-2020\">http://www.juniperresearch.com/press/press-releases/iot-connected-devices-to-tripIe-to38-bn-by-2020</url></p><p>3 <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.eia.gov\">www.eia.gov</url></p><p>4 <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nrdc.org\">www.nrdc.org</url></p><p>5 <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/emc/2014/07/10/why-big-tech-companies-are-investing-inrenewable-energy/#2715e4857aOb66b2daf676bc\">http://www.forbes.com/sites/emc/2014/07/10/why-big-tech-companies-are-investing-inrenewable-energy/#2715e4857aOb66b2daf676bc</url></p><p>By Larry Gigerich, Managing Director, Ginovus</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADEVFP-1777691014</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADEVFP2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5JFS-R431-JBHT-D0Y5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">315755</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2225\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2016 Halcyon Business Publications, Inc.

More and more gamers are preferring to rent hardware instead of buy it, to play games for free, to watch others play as a spectator sport and to play across different devices - all of which is on the horizon with cloud-based gaming. \"These new trends in the video game industry could make it much easier for the big cloud players to come in and start pulling away revenue,\" Citi analysts wrote. </p><p>That leaves game publishers finally feeling the disruptive power of the internet, years after it hit other media industries, including newspapers, radio and television. The potential upside for Big Tech comes as it faces scrutiny from U.S. regulators about whether the companies misuse their massive market power. The Federal Trade Commission and U.S. Department of Justice are expected to share duties in a possible antitrust probe of Amazon, Google, Apple Inc and Facebook Inc. Even so, their cloud services are poised to capitalize on the exploding popularity of video games. More American millennials now subscribe to a video game service than traditional paid television services, a survey showed on Monday. Much of the uptick is seen in casual gaming among amateurs. Esports - professional matches watched in person or online by throngs of fans - are also on the rise and expected to generate US$1.1 billion of revenue globally this year, data from Newzoo shows. How people play video games is also changing. In March, Google unveiled Stadia, its new browser-based game streaming service to launch this year through its cloud technology. The same month, Apple introduced a new digital video game subscription service called Apple Arcade. Pricing for such services has not yet been announced, but Citi analysts calculated that they could cost between US$9 to US$18 per month.
