The Board has been proactive - and will remain focused -- on closing the gap between the Company's stock price and book value. The Company's stock repurchase program and increased quarterly dividend announced earlier this week are the most recent proofs of this commitment. We also continue to believe the Company's current strategy of disposing real estate assets in a responsible manner and reallocating the balance sheet from primarily real estate to commercial loan investments are the best methods of maximizing net returns and eliminating the valuation gap. We would like to reiterate that the Board values and will continue to welcome and take into account the views and opinions of all of our stockholders.\"</p><p>16:28</p><p>WRAPX Closing Market Summary: Stocks Settle Lower on Thursday</p><p>Investors played it safe on Thursday as they continued to digest Wednesday's rate-hike announcement and some potentially concerning reports from Washington. The S&amp;P 500 (-0.2%) and the Dow (-0.1%) settled a step below their unchanged marks while the Nasdaq (-0.5%) underperformed, extending its week-to-date loss to 0.7%. For comparison, the benchmark index is flat for the week.</p><p>Equity indices opened Thursday's session solidly lower as investors continued to chew on Wednesday's policy announcement from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which was replete with a rate hike of 25 basis points, projections for an additional rate hike this year, and a specific plan for how the Fed will start to normalize its balance sheet.</p><p>The policy prescription left some market participants skeptical as it comes in the face of inflation readings that still remain below the Fed's longer-run target of 2.0%. Specifically, the fear is that the economic recovery effort could come to a halt if the U.S. central bank tightens policy too much and/or too soon.</p><p>In addition, investor sentiment was dampened by a Washington Post report that claimed Special Counsel Mueller's investigation of Russia's interference in the U.S. election is broadening in scope to examine whether President Trump tried to obstruct justice. It's worth clarifying that Mr. Trump hasn't been charged with obstruction of justice, rather, Mr. Mueller is examining the issue.</p><p>However, despite the lingering uncertainty, the major averages began retracing their opening losses in mid-morning action. The upward trend continued into the afternoon session, leaving the major averages near the top of the day's trading range. The tech-heavy Nasdaq showed relative weakness throughout the session as technology and biotechnology stocks underperformed.</p><p>The top-weighed technology sector (-0.5%) hovered with the consumer discretionary sector (-0.5%) at the bottom of the leaderboard for much of the day, but the two groups were able to reclaim a good portion of their early losses in the final stretch, eventually finishing just a step below the broader market.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the health care sector (-0.1%), biotechnology names underperformed, dragging the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB 293.80, -2.29) lower by 0.8%. The IBB dipped to a fresh session low around midday on reports that the White House is preparing an executive order aimed at lowering drug prices. However, the IBB retraced that dip by the day's close.</p><p>The energy sector (-0.7%) slipped to a new session low in the afternoon, eventually settling with the lightly-weighted materials group (-0.9%) at the bottom of the sector standings. Crude oil weighed on the energy group, dropping 0.8% to $44.45/bbl, as the commodity continued to face selling pressure following yesterday's bearish EIA inventory report. A strengthening dollar also worked against the energy component.</p><p>The U.S. Dollar Index (97.48, +0.57) rose 0.6% with the greenback adding 0.7% and 1.2%, respectively, on the euro (1.1145) and the yen (110.86). However, the British pound (1.2757) showed relative strength, adding 0.1% against the U.S. dollar, after the Bank of England decided to maintain its key rate and purchasing program in a split, 5-3 vote.</p><p>Back on Wall Street, four of the eleven sectors--industrials (+0.6%), utilities (+0.6%), real estate (+0.5%), and telecom services (unch)--settled in positive territory. The industrial sector benefited from broad strength with Dow components Caterpillar (CAT 106.40, +1.69), General Electric (GE 28.94, +0.49), and Boeing (BA 195.45, +3.07) leading the charge. The three added around 1.6% apiece.</p><p>Of the remaining sectors, the heavily-weighted financial group (-0.4%) settled a tick below the benchmark index while the consumer staples space (-0.2%) closed in line with the broader market.</p><p>In the bond market, U.S. Treasuries spent the day unwinding some of Wednesday's gains. The 10-yr yield climbed three basis points to 2.16% while the 2-yr yield (1.35%) moved higher by two basis points.</p><p>Reviewing Thursday's heavy dose of economic data, which included Initial Claims, June Philadelphia Fed, May Import/Export Prices, June Empire Manufacturing, May Industrial Production &amp; Capacity Utilization, and June NAHB Housing Market Index:</p><p>The latest weekly initial jobless claims count totaled 237,000 while the Briefing.com consensus expected a reading of 240,000. Today's tally was below the unrevised prior week count of 245,000. As for continuing claims, they rose to 1.935 million from the revised count of 1.929 million (from 1.917 million).The key takeaway from the report is that initial claims continue to hold steady at low levels that support the tight labor market claims advanced by the Federal Reserve.The Philadelphia Fed Survey for June declined to 27.6 from an unrevised 38.8 in May while economists polled by Briefing.com had expected a reading of 26.0.The key takeaway from the report is that it suggests continued growth for the region's manufacturing sector.Import prices excluding oil were unchanged (0.0%) in May after adding 0.3% in April. Export prices excluding agriculture decreased 0.6% in May after rising 0.3% in April (revised from 0.1%).The key takeaway from the report is that import and export prices are up year-over-year, yet inflation pressures overall remain modest for both import and export prices.The Empire Manufacturing Survey for June rose to 19.8 from the prior month's reading of -1.0. The Briefing.com consensus estimate was pegged at 6.0. Industrial Production was unchanged (0.0%) in May (Briefing.com consensus 0.0%) while Capacity Utilization ticked down to 76.6% (Briefing.com consensus 76.7%) from an unrevised reading of 76.7% in April. The Industrial Production reading for April was revised to 1.1% from 1.0%.The key takeaway from the report is that it didn't include a contribution from manufacturing output, which declined 0.4%.The NAHB Housing Market Index for June declined to 67 (Briefing.com consensus 70) from a revised reading of 69 in May (from 70).</p><p>On Friday, investors will receive May Housing Starts (Briefing.com consensus 1.227 million) and the preliminary reading of the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index for June (Briefing.com consensus 97.0). The two reports will cross the wires at 8:30 ET and 10:00 ET, respectively.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +14.5% YTDS&amp;P 500 +8.7% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +8.1% YTDRussell 2000 +3.9% YTD</p><p>16:22</p><p>BCRH Blue Capital Reinsurance Holdings provided a portfolio update; was able to construct an attractive portfolio with risk adjusted pricing down 3% (18.90 +0.05)</p><p>As of June 1, 2017 the Company bound indemnity reinsurance contracts with expected total annual premiums of $4.7 million, an increase of $2.0 million when compared to the same period in 2016. The business underwritten by the Company is expected to produce a net rate on line for the portfolio of 17.7%, which is an increase of 170 basis points when compared to the same period in 2016. The higher rate on line is a result of increased deployment in the June renewal period, which was primarily focused on Florida exposed accounts that have a higher rate on line than the portfolio average.</p><p>16:21</p><p>SLD Sutherland Asset Mgmt appoints Carole Mortensen as Chief Operating Officer (15.20 0.00)</p><p>Ms. Mortensen has worked for Waterfall Asset Management, the external manager of Sutherland, since 2011. Most recently, Carole served as Managing Director of the Capital Markets team focused on consumer asset-backed transactions and contributed to the successful reverse merger transaction resulting in Sutherland REIT going public.</p><p>16:18</p><p>WPC W.P. Carey approved a plan to exit all non-traded retail fundraising activities to focus exclusively on net lease investing for its balance sheet; affirming guidance; will host call today (67.78 +0.43)</p><p>Board of Directors believes this approach will create long-term value for shareholders by optimizing the cost of capital and enhancing its ability to grow Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) through a combination of single-asset investments and portfolio acquisitions. In conjunction with this decision, the Company will cease all non-traded retail fundraising activities carried out by its wholly-owned broker-dealer subsidiary, Carey Financial LLC, effective June 30, 2017. All existing Managed Programs will continue to be managed by the Company through to the end of their natural lifecycles.Company anticipates the following benefits: Elimination of costs associated with its retail fundraising platform; Increasingly stable and more predictable earnings as the contribution from variable structuring revenue further declines and earnings are ultimately derived entirely from long-term, recurring lease revenues generated by a high-quality, diversified portfolio of net lease assets; New net lease acquisition opportunities become exclusively available for the Company's balance sheet; Simplified disclosure and communication with the investment community; and Remains well-positioned to potentially acquire the net lease assets currently owned by the CPA REITs.The Company does not expect this decision to impact its 2017 guidance range and in conjunction with this announcement is affirming that for the full year it expects to report AFFO of between $5.10 and $5.30 per diluted share, subject to previously disclosed assumptions (vs $5.18 Cap IQ consensus).The company will host a conference call and live audio webcast to discuss this announcement at 5:30 p.m. Eastern Time today</p><p>16:17</p><p>TWO Two Harbors Investment increases quarterly dividend to $0.26/share from $0.25/share (10.27 0.00)</p><p>16:15</p><p>AMD Advanced Micro selected by the Department of Energy's Exascale Computing Project to accelerate critical computing technology research for the development of the nation's first exascale supercomputers (11.50 -0.27)</p><p>The new three-year PathForward program provides funding for research and development to drive critical advances of next-generation supercomputing hardware technologies.</p><p>16:08</p><p>KRC Kilroy Realty appoints Steve Rosetta as Chief Investment Officer (76.59 +0.18)</p><p>Mr. Rosetta joins Kilroy Realty from Cushman &amp; Wakefield where he most recently served as a Vice Chairman and was a member of the Global Advisory Board.</p><p>16:07</p><p>ICFI ICF Internationa has been selected by Southern Maryland Electric for a new contract to design and deliver its residential and commercial energy efficiency portfolio; the contract is valued at $18 million and has a term of three years (46.80 -0.50)</p><p>16:06</p><p>STAY Extended Stay America enters into a preferred share repurchase agreement with certain selling stockholders affiliated with Centerbridge Partners and The Blackstone Group in which the co repurchased directly 14,069 Series A Preferred shares (18.88 -0.03)</p><p>16:06</p><p>OXFD Oxford Immunotec announces favorable Markman claim construction ruling (15.13 +0.75)</p><p>The co announced a favorable Markman claim construction ruling by Judge Gorton of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts in the Company's patent infringement lawsuit against Qiagen (QGEN), Quest Diagnostics (DGX), and Laboratory Corporation of America (LH).

It's worth clarifying that Mr. Trump hasn't been charged with obstruction of justice, rather, Mr. Mueller is examining the issue.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the equity market opened Thursday's session solidly lower as investors sorted out the aforementioned headlines. The major averages have remained in the red throughout the session, but they have ticked up from their early-morning lows. Currently, the stock market hovers at the upper-end of the day's trading range.</p><p>Eight of the eleven sectors trade lower at midday with the information technology (-0.8%) and consumer discretionary (-0.8%) groups having led the retreat since the opening bell. Both sectors suffer from broad weakness with some of their most influential components, including Apple (AAPL 143.47, -1.68), Facebook (FB 148.63, -1.61), Alphabet (GOOGL 949.94, -17.99), and Amazon (AMZN 957.11, -19.36), holding losses between 1.1% and 2.0%.</p><p>On the flip side, the industrials (+0.2%), utilities (+0.2%), and real estate (+0.4%) sectors trade in positive territory with industrials' performance underpinned by names like Caterpillar (CAT 106.31, +1.60), General Electric (GE 28.75, +0.30), and Boeing (BA 195.15, +2.77). The three names hold gains between 1.0% and 1.5%.</p><p>In the bond market, U.S. Treasuries trade lower across the curve with the benchmark 10-yr yield climbing four basis points to 2.16%. The slip in U.S. sovereign debt is interesting as it conflicts with the equity market's current risk-off disposition. However, it's important to note that the Treasury market had a big day yesterday following the FOMC's decision to raise interest rates and a batch of relatively weak economic data.</p><p>Reviewing today's heavy dose of economic data, which included Initial Claims, June Philadelphia Fed, May Import/Export Prices, June Empire Manufacturing, May Industrial Production &amp; Capacity Utilization, and June NAHB Housing Market Index:</p><p>The latest weekly initial jobless claims count totaled 237,000 while the Briefing.com consensus expected a reading of 240,000. Today's tally was below the unrevised prior week count of 245,000. As for continuing claims, they rose to 1.935 million from the revised count of 1.929 million (from 1.917 million).The key takeaway from the report is that initial claims continue to hold steady at low levels that support the tight labor market claims advanced by the Federal Reserve.The Philadelphia Fed Survey for June declined to 27.6 from an unrevised 38.8 in May while economists polled by Briefing.com had expected a reading of 26.0.The key takeaway from the report is that it suggests continued growth for the region's manufacturing sector.Import prices excluding oil were unchanged (0.0%) in May after adding 0.3% in April. Export prices excluding agriculture decreased 0.6% in May after rising 0.3% in April (revised from 0.1%).The key takeaway from the report is that import and export prices are up year-over-year, yet inflation pressures overall remain modest for both import and export prices.The Empire Manufacturing Survey for June rose to 19.8 from the prior month's reading of -1.0. The Briefing.com consensus estimate was pegged at 6.0. Industrial Production was unchanged (0.0%) in May (Briefing.com consensus 0.0%) while Capacity Utilization ticked down to 76.6% (Briefing.com consensus 76.7%) from an unrevised reading of 76.7% in April. The Industrial Production reading for April was revised to 1.1% from 1.0%.The key takeaway from the report is that it didn't include a contribution from manufacturing output, which declined 0.4%.The NAHB Housing Market Index for June declined to 67 (Briefing.com consensus 70) from a revised reading of 69 in May (from 70).</p><p>12:03</p><p>NSRGY Nestle will explore strategic options for its US confectionery business, including a potential sale (83.91 +0.71)</p><p>The review covers the US market only and is expected to be completed by the end of this year.

That is, many have expected the big tech stocks -- and Amazon (AMZN 953.88, -22.59, -2.3%) -- to keep riding the momentum of a buy-the-dip trade, yet they have succumbed to renewed selling interest following a short-lived advance on the buy-the-dip front.</p><p>When paired with the weakness in the financial sector, the weakness in the information technology sector and the misgivings about the Fed's policy direction are making it difficult for the broader market to maintain a bullish swagger.</p><p>10:42</p><p>COMDX Natural gas storage data summary</p><p>Working gas in storage was 2,709 Bcf as of Friday, June 9, 2017, according to EIA estimates.

The FOMC raised rates 25 bps which was widely expected and marks the first time since 2007 that the rate is above 1.00%. But most thought that the recent soft data on inflation would lead to a 'dovish hike'. Instead, Fed Chair Janet Yellen provided the argument that the recent weakness in pricing was transitory (noting lower drug prices and cell phone packages in particular) and that the Fe continued to see an improving economy that would see inflation move back towards its target. In addition, the Fed presented a broad outline for how it expects to unwind its balance sheet nothing that the process could take place relatively soon. That language may have been a surprise for participants that were looking toward the end of 2017 for this process to start. The DXY has used the tone to rally back to 97.50. This sets up a key test of resistance. The euro has been offered in light of the strong dollar. The single currency has fallen below the 1.12 support level and is trading at June lows. Aiding the decline was a lower revision to the French CPI number (0.0% from +0.1%) which serves to highlight the weak inflation numbers in the region. Eurogroup Finance Ministers are meeting today and we would note that there have been positive headlines around the release of the latest Greek tranche. This should bolster expectations that the troubled country will receive the next leg of the bail out package in order to meet July obligations.The pound rallied from 1.2690 to 1.2795 in reaction to the latest Bank of England decision. The central bank left its asset purchase program and rates unchanged which was broadly expected. But what surprised markets was three votes in favor of the first rate hike since 2007. The central bank members are troubled by the recent increase in inflation. The issue being that wage prices are not moving higher with these figures which is impacting the countries buying power for products from abroad. Sterling has given up some of its gains but has so far been able to hold the 1.2730 area on pullbacks.The yen is sliding lower following the Fed decision. Yen would rally to a two month high ahead of the Fed but has reversed course to slide back to 110.60. It is now testing its 200-sma (110.62) for support.The yuan is holding steady at 6.80. The PBoC surprised some participants by holding its rates steady. The central bank had raised its rates in March following the Fed in order to keep step. But it decided against any action this time around. This suggests that the recent capital controls the bank has taken are providing it some autonomy in its decision. The spread between the China and U.S&gt; ten year remains near two year highs which should help against potential outflows from the region (BONDX, FOREX).</p><p>10:37</p><p>COMDX Natural gas EIA data</p><p>Natural gas inventory showed a build of 78 bcf vs a build of 106 bcf in the prior week</p><p>10:33</p><p>SUMRX Morning Commodities: Natural gas spikes, while crude and metals continue to slide</p><p>Commodities are beginning the day lower</p><p>Overall, commodities, as measured by the Bloomberg Commodity Index, are currently down 0.29% at 80.6595The dollar index is currently up 0.53% at 96.45Looking at energy...Crude continues to drop, trading in an area now that has not seen since early 2016.July WTI crude oil futures are now down $0.20 at $44.53/barrelIn other energy,June natural gas is down $0.017 at $2.95/MMBtuMoving on to metals...Aug gold is currently down $18.40 at $1257.60/oz, while July silver is $0.39 at $16.745/ozJuly copper is now $0.011 at $2.5625/lb</p><p>10:02</p><p>BGNE BeiGene presents updated data from an ongoing Phase 1 study of Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor BGB-3111 in patients with Waldenstrm's macroglobulinemia at the 14-ICML; 'continue to demonstrate that BGB-3111 is well tolerated' (39.43 -0.25)</p><p>\"The updated data continue to suggest that BGB-3111 is well tolerated in WM.

Market conditions for hot-rolled sheet products have been more challenging than the company had expected earlier in the quarter when it provided qualitative guidance due to aggressive competition.</p><p>As anticipated, its plate mills are expected to have improved profitability in Q2 relative to Q1. The performance of its downstream products segment is expected to improve in Q2 relative to Q1, but the co expects the performance of this segment in Q2 to be down YoY.Nonresidential construction markets continue an overall positive trend, but conditions in Q2 have not been as robust as previously expected. Imports continue to negatively impact the US steel industry. Through the first five months of 2017, finished steel imports have increased an estimated 14% compared to the same period last year and account for an estimated 26% share of the U.S. market. However, several recently completed and ongoing trade cases are helping to stop the flood of dumped and subsidized products from foreign producers. Final determinations in the cut-to-length plate trade cases are having a positive impact as steel imports of these products have decreased in the first five months of this year. Despite the guidance, co says its forecasted Q2 results would represent Nucor's best reported Q2 performance since 2008.Briefing.com note: Watch for potential weakness in other steel names: AKS, CMC, MT, RS, RYI, STLD, WOR, X, ZEUS.</p><p>08:50</p><p>WRAPX S&amp;P futures vs fair value: -16.30.

However three members of the committee voted for the first rate hike since 2007. The primary concern is concerns surrounding Brexit have led to selling pressure on sterling. This in turn is driving up pricing pressures on the consumer as the buying power of cable fades. The central bank is not seeing a corresponding rise in wages which is needed to keep consumer demand in place giving the rise in costs.</p><p>Key excerpts from BoE Statement:</p><p>At its meeting ending on 14 June 2017, the MPC voted by a majority of 5-3 to maintain Bank Rate at 0.25%. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at 10 billion. The Committee also voted unanimously to maintain the stock of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, at 435 billion. CPI inflation has been pushed above the 2% target by the impact of last year's sterling depreciation. It reached 2.9% in May, above the MPC's expectation. Inflation could rise above 3% by the autumn, and is likely to remain above the target for an extended period as sterling's depreciation continues to feed through into the prices of consumer goods and services.</p><p>The 2% fall in the exchange rate since the May Inflation Report, if sustained, will add to that imported inflationary impetus. In contrast, pay growth has moderated further from already subdued rates, even as the unemployment rate has fallen to 4.6%, its lowest in over 40 years. GDP growth declined markedly in the first quarter, in part reflecting weaker household spending. It remains to be seen how large and persistent this slowdown in consumption will prove. Outside the household sector, export indicators have strengthened, probably reflecting both the depreciation of sterling and increasingly robust global demand. Most surveys of investment intentions have remained above their historic averages. Attempting to offset fully the effect of weaker sterling on inflation would be achievable only at the cost of higher unemployment and, in all likelihood, even weaker income growth. For this reason, the MPC's remit specifies that, in such exceptional circumstances, the Committee must balance any trade-off between the speed at which it intends to return inflation sustainably to the target and the support that monetary policy provides to jobs and activity. The projections that the Committee published in May showed that the economy was expected to operate with a small degree of spare capacity for most of the three-year forecast period, justifying the tolerance of some degree of above-target inflation. The continued growth of employment could suggest that spare capacity is being eroded, lessening the trade-off that the MPC is required to balance and, all else equal, reducing the MPC's tolerance of above-target inflation. Looking ahead, key considerations in judging the appropriate stance of monetary policy are the evolution of inflationary pressures, the persistence of weaker consumption and the degree to which it is offset by other components of demand. In light of these considerations, five members thought that the current policy stance remained appropriate to balance the demands of the MPC's remitAll members agreed that any increases in Bank Rate would be expected to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent.</p><p>07:33</p><p>ADS Alliance Data reports average receivables at end of May 31 of $15.74 bln, +17% Y/Y; maintains its FY guidance of $7.7 bln in total revs, $18.5 in core EPS (243.31 )</p><p>07:32</p><p>SKLN Skyline Medical announces its European Authorized Representative, Emergo Europe B.V., has notified the Dutch Competent Authority that the Company's STREAMWAY System meets all requirements and can now be affixed with the CE mark (1.63 )</p><p>Co added, \"We are optimistic that we can record our first product sale under the CE mark before year-end, and ramp up STREAMWAY's availability throughout Europe by early 2018.\"</p><p>07:30</p><p>SELB Selecta Biosciences announces data from its ongoing Phase 2 trial of SEL-212 in chronic severe gout (16.52 )</p><p>Key observations and findings based upon the clinical data generated through June 12, 2017 from the 60 patients currently enrolled in this open-label, dose ranging Phase 2 trial include:</p><p>The prevention of ADAs in a dose-dependent manner resulted in durable control of serum uric acid (sUA) levels (defined as sUA &lt;6 mg/dl). The clinical data demonstrate a correlation between the prevention of ADAs and the maintenance of pegsiticase activity and serum uric acid control. A majority of patients in the minimum effective dose group maintained sUA control following three monthly injections of SEL-212 and two monthly \"challenge\" injections of pegsiticase alone. Maintenance of sUA in the challenge portion of the trial provides evidence at this stage that the use of SVP-Rapamycin is enabling immune tolerance, meaning a prevention of ADAs to pegsiticase, which is typically immunogenic when administered alone.In the control cohorts receiving pegsiticase alone, within the first month of treatment, 50% of patients reported experiencing a gout flare, which is a sudden and severe attack of pain, inflammation and tenderness of the joints. By comparison, only 15% of patients receiving SEL-212 reported a gout flare in the first month of treatment, with reports declining further in subsequent months. These data also appear to be in contrast with the increased incidence of flares reported in clinical trials involving other urate lowering therapies. A key objective of the Phase 2 trial was to determine a minimum effective monthly dose of the two components of SEL-212 (i.e. pegsiticase and SVP-Rapamycin) through an ascending dose matrix design. A majority of the initial patients dosed with 0.4 mg/kg of pegsiticase in combination with 0.08 mg/kg of SVP-Rapamycin maintained sUA control beyond five treatments. As a result, the company has determined this to be a minimum monthly effective dose of SEL-212. Additional patients are now being added to this cohort, and higher dose levels of SVP-Rapamycin are being tested to further determine the dose regimens that may be taken forward into Phase 3.Consistent with the expected reduction in immunogenicity of pegsiticase when SVP-Rapamycin doses increase, SEL-212 has been generally well tolerated at clinically active doses. There have been a total of eight serious adverse events (SAEs) reported in the trial through June 12, 2017. Seven were infusion reactions, four of which occurred in the cohorts receiving pegsiticase alone or the lowest dose of SVP-Rapamycin and two of which were due to dosing errors. One additional SAE, cholecystitis, was determined to not be related to the study drug. All of the SAEs were successfully treated and resolved without further issues.</p><p>\"First and foremost, the clinical data demonstrate SEL-212's potential to address substantial unmet needs for patients with chronic severe gout, a debilitating disease that has been associated with both increased morbidity and mortality. We believe that a reduction of serum uric acid levels to near zero during treatment, a reduction in the incidence of flares and the convenience of safe monthly dosing with SEL-212 would prove to be a compelling treatment option. Leveraging these data, we are beginning to prepare for a Phase 3 program that we plan to initiate in 2018 following further dialogue with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\"</p><p>07:28</p><p>SUMRX European Markets Update: DAX -0.8%, CAC -1.0%, FTSE -1.1%</p><p>Major European indices trade lower across the board with Spain's IBEX (-1.2%) falling behind other markets.

The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq settled lower by 0.1% and 0.4%, respectively, while the Dow closed higher by 0.2%.</p><p>The Fed's decision to raise the fed funds target range by 25 basis points to 1.00%-1.25% was nearly unanimous with Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari being the lone dissenter. The rate hike was attributed to realized and expected labor market conditions. In other words, it sounds as if the Fed is still expecting tight labor market conditions to produce stronger wage inflation that will presumably drive broader price inflation.</p><p>According to the Fed's dot plot, the median FOMC member expects one additional rate hike in 2017. However, the market doubts that a third rate hike will happen before the year's end with the CME FedWatch Tool assigning an implied probability of 47.0% to said event. In addition, the U.S. central bank plans to begin implementing a balance sheet normalization program sometime this year.</p><p>Going into the Fed's decision, equities were fairly flat as big losses from the financials, energy, and materials sectors were mitigated by modest gains from the remaining eight groups. The materials (-1.1%) and energy (-1.8%) groups never recovered, eventually settling the session at the bottom of the leaderboard.</p><p>Crude oil weighed on the energy group, dropping 3.5% to $44.79/bbl, after the Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported a smaller than expected draw of 1.7 million barrels (consensus -2.5 million barrels) in crude stocks and a build of 2.1 million barrels in gasoline inventories for the week ended May 9. The energy component settled at its lowest mark since mid-November.</p><p>Conversely, the heavily-weighted financial sector (+0.2%) retraced its earlier loss of 1.3% following the FOMC decision, settling higher for the sixth-consecutive session. However, a flattening of the yield curve, which is seen as a negative for the financial industry's bottom line, didn't make things easy on the sector.</p><p>Treasuries moved solidly higher following a weak batch of economic data, which included May CPI and May Retail Sales. Total CPI declined 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus 0.0%) in May while core CPI, which excludes food and energy, increased 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%). On a year-over-year basis, total CPI is up 1.9% and core CPI has increased 1.7%.</p><p>Separately, May retail sales decreased 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%) while the prior month's reading was left unrevised at 0.4%. Excluding autos, retail sales decreased 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) while the prior month's reading was revised higher to 0.4% from 0.3%.</p><p>The 10-yr and 2-yr yields traded at 2.11% and 1.29%, respectively, ahead of the Fed's policy statement, but ticked up from that level in the aftermath. The 2yr-10yr spread declined by four basis points with the 10-yr yield settling six basis points lower at 2.15% and the 2-yr yield dropping two basis points to 1.35%.</p><p>Back on Wall Street, the equity market was a little jumpy in the afternoon session, but eventually settled at the level it took into the FOMC rate decision. As noted above, the heavily-weighted financial sector flipped from negative to positive in the afternoon, however, the top-weighted technology sector did the opposite, exchanging a modest gain for a notable loss.</p><p>In conclusion, regardless of how Wednesday's session began, it ended with a risk-off tone as countercyclical sectors generally outperformed their cyclical peers, especially following the Fed's policy statement; the health care, consumer staples, utilities, telecom services, and real estate groups finished with gains between 0.3% and 0.6%.</p><p>Reviewing today's economic data, which included May CPI, May Retail Sales, April Business Inventories, and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index:</p><p>Total CPI declined 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus 0.0%) in May while core CPI, which excludes food and energy, increased 0.1% (Briefing.com consensus 0.2%). On a year-over-year basis, total CPI is up 1.9% and core CPI has increased 1.7%.The key takeaway from this report is that it shows a softening trend in consumer inflation, which should presumably be some cause for concern among Fed members.May retail sales decreased 0.3%, which is below the Briefing.com consensus of +0.1%. The prior month's reading was left unrevised at 0.4%. Excluding autos, retail sales decreased 0.3% while the Briefing.com consensus expected an increase of 0.2%. The prior month's reading was revised higher to 0.4% from 0.3%.The key takeaway from this report is that consumers clearly remain guarded with their discretionary spending activity, which is likely the result of seeing little, if any, wage growth. Business Inventories declined 0.2% in April while the Briefing.com consensus expected a downtick of 0.1%. The prior month's reading was left unrevised at 0.2%.The key takeaway from the report is that business inventories remain elevated relative to sales, which is standing in the way of restoring pricing power.The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index rose 2.8% to follow last week's 7.1% increase.</p><p>Tomorrow, investors will receive a slew of economic reports, including Initial Claims (Briefing.com consensus 240,000) at 8:30 ET, June Philadelphia Fed (Briefing.com consensus 26.0) at 8:30 ET, June Empire Manufacturing (Briefing.com consensus 6.0) at 8:30 ET, May Import/Export Prices at 8:30 ET, May Industrial Production (Briefing.com consensus 0.0%) and Capacity Utilization (Briefing.com consensus 76.7%) at 9:15 ET, and June NAHB Housing Market Index (Briefing.com consensus 70) at 10:00 ET.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +15.1% YTDS&amp;P 500 +8.9% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +8.2% YTDRussell 2000 +4.5% YTD</p><p>16:32</p><p>HAIN Hain Celestial confirms will conduct a call to discuss its financial results on Thursday, June 22, 2017 at 8am ET and expects to file Annual Report and Quarterly Reports on that day (34.67 -0.30)</p><p>It also expects to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016, as well as its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the first three quarters of fiscal 2017 on that day.

However, we do not have enough information to predict the feasibility of your plans.\"</p><p>The company has already initiated the work necessary to address this request and expects to have the data ready to submit to the FDA in the August timeframe. AveXis plans to initiate a pivotal study trial of AVXS-101 in SMA Type 1 in the U.S. and a Phase 1/2a trial of AVXS-101 in SMA Type 2 in the U.S. later in the third quarter of 2017, pending agreement from the FDA that these data are sufficient. Additionally, FDA is aligned with the company's proposed comparability protocol to assess the similarity of key characteristics of the Nationwide Children's Hospital (NCH) product, used in the Phase 1 SMA Type 1 study, with the product derived from the new GMP manufacturing process. Data from this comparability work is ongoing and will include the above-mentioned potency qualification data, which will be incorporated into the data package along with the full Phase 1 clinical data, that will be reviewed and discussed at the upcoming end-of-Phase 1 meeting, likely to be requested later in August.</p><p>Co will host a conference call and webcast at 4:30 p.m. EDT today, June 14, 2017.</p><p>16:01</p><p>IOTS Adesto Technologies intends to offer and sell shares of its common stock, subject to market and other conditions, in an underwritten public offering; size not disclosed (4.95 +0.35)</p><p>Adesto intends to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-279202144</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NT6-8BV1-JC8H-K3VK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"23736\"/><timeReceived>11:04 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Comtex News Network, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2017 Briefing.com, Inc.

These errors impacted certain balance sheet accounts as of June 30, 2016 and certain balance sheet accounts as reported in the first three quarters of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, but are not expected to have a significant impact on previously reported income statement accounts, including revenue. The Company is finalizing its review of these errors and has determined that the errors were the result of a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting. The Company is still evaluating the materiality of the errors to periodic reports on Form 10-Q filed for the periods ended September 30, 2018, December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019, and is completing an evaluation of its associated control procedures.</p><p>16:37</p><p>MUSA Murphy USA files for mixed securities shelf offering (89.40 -0.62)</p><p>16:35</p><p>FLGT Fulgent Genetics entered into $30 mln Equity Distribution Agreement with Piper Jaffray (11.41 -0.71)</p><p>16:21</p><p>FOCS Focus Financial files for mixed securities shelf offering (20.52 +0.37)</p><p>16:19</p><p>WRAPX Closing Stock Market Summary</p><p>The stock market finished little changed on Friday in a lackluster session before the holiday weekend. The S&amp;P 500 (+0.1%) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.2%) finished just above their flat lines, while the Nasdaq Composite (-0.1%) and Russell 2000 (-0.1%) finished slightly lower.</p><p>Stocks opened the session near their best levels of the day, supported by a reprieve in trade tensions and month-end rebalancing that tends to favor risk assets after four straight weekly declines -- that losing streak was snapped today. The early advance brought the S&amp;P 500 within five points of its 50-day moving average (2945), but the market quickly retreated and wavered between small gains and losses for the rest of the session.</p><p>The market struggled to find direction amid missing leadership from some of its biggest technology names within the S&amp;P 500 consumer discretionary (-0.6%), communication services (-0.1%), and information technology (unch) sectors. The materials (+0.7%), industrials (+0.4%), and financials (+0.4%) sectors did provide some support for the broader market.</p><p>Some negative considerations for the market included a stronger U.S. dollar that could pose a headwind for the earnings prospects of U.S. multinational companies; weaker oil prices ($55.06/bbl, -$1.61, -2.8%) that pressured oil-sensitive stocks; and a downward revision to consumer sentiment for August, reflecting a possible threat to discretionary spending amid the ongoing trade dispute.</p><p>In earnings news, shares of Ulta Beauty (ULTA 237.73, -99.72, -29.6%) tanked 30% after the company missed revenue estimates and lowered its full-year guidance. Workday (WDAY 177.28, -10.37, -5.5%) led the cloud software stocks lower despite positive results and upbeat guidance.</p><p>Notable standouts included Dell (DELL 51.53, +4.76, +10.2%) and Campbell Soup (CPB 45.00, +1.69, +3.9%) after both beat earnings expectations.</p><p>U.S. Treasuries finished slightly higher in a muted session. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 1.50%, and the 10-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.51%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.3% to 98.81.</p><p>Reviewing Friday's economic data, which included Personal Income and Spending for July, the PCE Price Index for July, the final University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment for August, and the Chicago PMI for August:</p><p>Personal income increased 0.1% m/m in July (Briefing.com consensus +0.4%), which was weaker than expected thanks to a 1.8% decline in personal interest income, but personal spending increased a stronger-than-expected 0.6% (Briefing.com consensus +0.5%). The PCE Price Index and core PCE Price Index, which excludes food and energy, were both up 0.2%, which was also expected.The key takeaway from the report is that consumer spending is solid and inflation is stable, albeit at below-target levels. All in all, there isn't a lot of ammunition in the report for the Fed to fire off a 50-basis points rate cut at its September meeting.The final reading for the University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment for August was revised down to 89.8 (Briefing.com consensus 92.4) from the preliminary reading of 92.1. The final reading for July was 98.4. The difference in final readings between July and June was the largest point drop since December 2012.</p><p>The key takeaway from the report is the understanding that tariff issues are weighing more heavily on consumer sentiment, which threatens to temper discretionary spending activity in the months ahead.The Chicago PMI increased to 50.4 in August (Briefing.com consensus 48.2) from 44.4 in July.</p><p>As a reminder, the market will be closed on Monday for Labor Day.

Treasuries started the day with slim losses after Treasury futures retreated during another largely positive overnight session. The overnight selling took place amid gains in most Asian and European equity markets, as investors were emboldened by the lack of negative developments on the trade front. Things did not look nearly as calm below the surface, considering Hong Kong police arrested several pro-democracy activists and lawmakers ahead of a rally and a march that were scheduled for Saturday. The events were banned by Hong Kong police and organizers cancelled the plans after a failed appeal to overturn the ban, according to Hong Kong Free Press. Treasuries advanced to fresh session highs in mid-morning trade, but there was no follow-through buying, allowing the complex to revisit its opening levels. The final hour of the session saw another push, which lifted all tenors to fresh highs. The U.S. Dollar Index jumped 0.5% to 98.96, setting a fresh high for the year. The relentless dollar strength will likely lead to renewed concerns about earnings prospects of multinational companies while also fueling worries about working capital needs of non-U.S. based entities that use dollars to conduct business. Yield Check: 2-yr: -2 bps to 1.50% 3-yr: -2 bps to 1.43% 5-yr: -2 bps to 1.39% 10-yr: -1 bp to 1.51% 30-yr: -1 bp to 1.97%News: Chinese authorities did not renew the press credentials of Wall Street Journal reporter, Chun Han Wong, who is known for writing a story about Australia's investigation into Xi Jinping's cousin's alleged involvement in a money-laundering operation. The Bank of Korea left its repurchase rate at 1.50%, but signaled that more easing is likely in the future. The Bank of Japan lowered its daily purchases of 5-10-yr JGBs, as expected. Japan's July Industrial Production increased 1.3% m/m (expected 0.3%; last -3.3%), July Retail Sales decreased 2.0% yr/yr (expected -0.6%; last 0.5%), July Housing Starts fell 4.1% yr/yr (expected -5.3%; last 0.3%). South Korea's July Industrial Production rose 2.6% m/m (expected 0.5%; last 0.2%), growing 0.6% yr/yr (expected -1.6%; last -2.6%). July Retail Sales decreased 0.9% m/m (last -1.6%). Australia's July HIA New Home Sales fell 7.2% m/m (last -12.4%) while July Building Approvals decreased 9.7% m/m (expected 0.0%; last -0.8%). New Zealand's July Building Consents decreased 1.3% m/m (last -4.0%). Italy's newly formed coalition is at a risk of collapse after M5S leader, Luigi Di Maio, presented a list of ultimatums to PD. PD member, Graziano Delrio, said that Mr. Di Maio's demands are unacceptable. Spain's PSOE has until September 23 to find a coalition partner or an election will be called for November 10. Germany's July Retail Sales decreased 2.1% m/m (expected -1.3%; last 3.0%) but rose 4.4% yr/yr (last -1.4%). U.K.'s July Mortgage Approvals totaled 67,310 (expected 66,170; last 66,510), Mortgage Lending totaled GBP4.61 bln (expected GBP3.70 bln; last GBP3.79 bln), and Net Lending to Individuals totaled GBP5.50 bln (expected GBP4.70 bln; last GBP4.80 bln). Spain's July Retail Sales increased 3.2% yr/yr (last 2.5%). Today's Data: Personal income increased 0.1% m/m in July (Briefing.com consensus +0.4%), which was weaker than expected thanks to a 1.8% decline in personal interest income, but personal spending increased a stronger-than-expected 0.6% (Briefing.com consensus +0.5%). The PCE Price Index and core PCE Price Index, which excludes food and energy, were both up 0.2%, which was also expected. The m/m changes in the price indexes left total PCE up 1.4% yr/yr, versus 1.3% in June, and the core PCE Price Index up 1.6%, which was unchanged from June. Both are running below the Fed's 2.0% longer-run target, yet both are trending in stable fashion. The key takeaway from the report is that consumer spending is solid and inflation is stable, albeit at below-target levels. All in all, there isn't a lot of ammunition in the report for the Fed to fire off a 50-basis points rate cut at its September meeting. The Chicago PMI increased to 50.4 in August (Briefing.com consensus 48.2) from 44.4 in July. The final reading for the University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment for August was revised down to 89.8 (Briefing.com consensus 92.4) from the preliminary reading of 92.1. The final reading for July was 98.4. The difference in final readings between July and June was the largest point drop since December 2012. The key takeaway from the report is the understanding that tariff issues are weighing more heavily on consumer sentiment, which threatens to temper discretionary spending activity in the months ahead.

The S&amp;P 500 (+0.03%) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.1%) trade just above their flat lines, while the Nasdaq Composite (-0.3%) and Russell 2000 (-0.1%) trade slightly lower.</p><p>Stocks opened near their best levels of the day on no specific catalyst. Presumably, the reprieve in trade tensions and the usual month-end rebalancing that favors risk assets after four straight weeks of losses supported the higher start. It's been a tough session for this week's rebound rally to continue, though.</p><p>Some hurdles have included a strengthening U.S. dollar (98.83, +0.32, +0.3%), weaker oil prices ($55.14, -1.57, -2.9%), a downward revision to consumer sentiment for August, and missing leadership from some of the market's biggest technology names. Evidently, the S&amp;P 500 was given little ammunition as it came within five points of its 50-day moving average (2945) in the early action.</p><p>Still, there isn't a concerted effort to sell in front of the holiday weekend. At this juncture, the financials (+0.7%), industrials (+0.7%), and materials (+0.6%) sectors give the market decent support. The consumer discretionary (-0.5%), communication services (-0.3%), and information technology (-0.2%) sectors currently underperform.</p><p>Ulta Beauty (ULTA 237.60, -99.83, -29.6%) has been an eyesore in the consumer discretionary space after it missed earnings estimates and lowered its full-year guidance. Workday (WDAY 173.81, -13.85, -7.4%) is leading the cloud software stocks lower despite reporting solid quarterly results.</p><p>Notable outperformers include Dell (DELL 49.88, +3.14, +6.7%) and Campbell Soup (CPB 46.93, +3.62, +8.3%) after both beat earnings estimates. Tesla (TSLA 225.66, +3.92, +1.8%) is seeing relative strength after Bloomberg reported China will exempt it from a 10% tax on vehicles Tesla sells in China.</p><p>The U.S. Treasury market has held steady today. Currently, the 2-yr yield is up one basis point to 1.53%, and the 10-yr yield is down is unchanged at 1.52%.</p><p>Reviewing today's economic data, which included Personal Income and Spending for July, the PCE Price Index for July, the Chicago PMI for August, and the final University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment report for August:</p><p>Personal income increased 0.1% m/m in July (Briefing.com consensus +0.4%), which was weaker than expected thanks to a 1.8% decline in personal interest income, but personal spending increased a stronger-than-expected 0.6% (Briefing.com consensus +0.5%). The PCE Price Index and core PCE Price Index, which excludes food and energy, were both up 0.2%, which was also expected.The key takeaway from the report is that consumer spending is solid and inflation is stable, albeit at below-target levels. All in all, there isn't a lot of ammunition in the report for the Fed to fire off a 50-basis points rate cut at its September meeting.The final reading for the University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment for August was revised down to 89.8 (Briefing.com consensus 92.4) from the preliminary reading of 92.1. The final reading for July was 98.4. The difference in final readings between July and June was the largest point drop since December 2012.</p><p>The key takeaway from the report is the understanding that tariff issues are weighing more heavily on consumer sentiment, which threatens to temper discretionary spending activity in the months ahead.The Chicago PMI for August came in at 50.4 (Briefing.com consensus 48.2), coming in above expectations and last month's 44.4 reading.</p><p>12:25</p><p>SCANX Small cap notable movers of interest -Technical-</p><p>The following are some of today's most notable small cap movers of interest ($300 mln - $2 bln market cap), ranked by % change (all stocks over 100K average daily volume).</p><p>Small Cap Gainers</p><p>AMBA (56.06 +18.34%): Delivered Q2 top- and bottom-line beat, offered upside Q3 outlook.

That down leg coincided with a pullback in the information technology (-0.5%) and communication services (-0.4%) sectors, yet there was also some notable slippage in the energy (-0.5%) and consumer discretionary (-0.7%) sectors.</p><p>There wasn't a piece of news to account for the downturn in the information technology and communication services sectors, yet the energy sector was hit with a report suggesting Russia overproduced in August, violating the spirit of the OPEC+ deal. That took some weak oil prices ($55.02, -$1.69, -3.0%) and made them weaker, which pressured related stocks.</p><p>The consumer discretionary sector, meanwhile, has seen a general pullback in most stocks that were higher earlier and continues to feel the weight of a modest loss in its largest component -- Amazon.com (AMZN 1770.36, -16.04, -0.9%) -- and a huge loss in Ulta Beauty (ULTA 239.75, -97.70, -29.0%) following its disappointing earnings report.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.1%; the S&amp;P 500 is down 0.1%; the Nasdaq Composite is down 0.4%; and the Russell 2000 is down 0.5%.</p><p>10:46</p><p>TALKX Market Briefing: Some spastic, but (still) positive action</p><p>The stock market started the session on a positive note without any clear news catalyst. The upside action was attributed to carryover buying interest, month-end rebalancing, and the lingering sense of relief that China and the U.S. sound like they're going to make an effort to keep their trade battle from getting any worse.</p><p>Since the opening bump, however, market action has been a little more spastic. That can be attributed in part to traders not wanting to be overly aggressive after a big week of gains already, knowing the market will be closed for an extended period due to the Labor Day holiday on Monday.</p><p>The impending arrival of Hurricane Dorian in Florida, brewing protest tension in Hong Kong, and a disappointing consumer sentiment report for August that was liked to tariff worries, are other elements contributing to a little of the buying hesitation after the opening rush.</p><p>Overall, though, the major indices are still standing their positive ground, supported by modest gains in every sector, with the exception of the consumer discretionary sector (-0.1%). The latter is feeling the heavy weight of losses in Ulta Beauty (ULTA 241.43, -96.03, -28.5%), which is crashing after missing Q2 earnings estimates and lowering its full-year EPS and same-store sales outlooks.</p><p>The Treasury market has had a roller-coaster session so far and is currently on the upswing, which is driving yields slightly lower across the curve. The 10-yr note yield is down one basis point to 1.51% while the 30-yr bond yield is down one basis point to 1.97%.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.4%; the S&amp;P 500 is up 0.3%; the Russell 2000 is up 0.2%; and the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.1%.</p><p>10:40</p><p>USO Oil prices drop after Russia says its production came in above plan August, but is still aiming for full compliance; OPEC+ is set to meet on September 12 (44.48 -0.30)</p><p>WTI crude oil is down nearly 2.6% at $55.24 -1.47, causing the energy sector (XLE +0.2%) to pare its gains.</p><p>10:24</p><p>SUMRX Economic Summary: Personal Spending outpaces incomes in July; Michigan Sentiment disappoints</p><p>Economic Data Summary:</p><p>July Personal Income 0.1% vs Briefing.com consensus of 0.3%; June was revised to 0.5% from 0.4% July Personal Spending 0.6% vs Briefing.com consensus of 0.5%; June was 0.3%The key takeaway from the report is that consumer spending is solid and inflation is stable, albeit at below-target levels.

Mr. Gao hoped discussions could help remove the new tariffs imposed by the U.S., although he refrained from answering if retaliatory measures were entirely off the table.</p><p>In either case, the market liked the underlying conciliatory tone ahead of trade talks planned for September. The futures market jumped on the comments, and the cash market maintained the bullish composure throughout the day. Leadership came from the S&amp;P 500 cyclical sectors.</p><p>Ten of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors finished in positive territory. The industrials (+1.8%) and information technology (+1.7%) sectors outperformed amid solid gains in the trade-sensitive transportation and semiconductor spaces. The Dow Jones Transportation Average increased 2.0%, and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index increased 2.3%. The consumer staples sector (unch) was unchanged.</p><p>The energy (+1.5%) and financials (+1.5%) sectors received an added boost from higher oil prices ($56.67/bbl, +0.91, +1.6%) and some yield-curve steepening, respectively. Some end-of-the-month rebalancing might have also contributed to their outperformance given their poor performances in August.</p><p>Improved sentiment pertaining to economic growth, supported by an upward revision to second-quarter consumer spending growth, helped contribute to the curve-steeping activity. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 1.52%, and the 10-yr yield increased five basis points to 1.52%.

The GDP Deflator was unrevised at 2.4%, as expected.The key takeaway from the report is that consumer spending growth was revised up to 4.7% from 4.3%, which was the strongest growth since the fourth quarter of 2014. Granted it's a backward-looking data point, yet it offers a nice reminder that the U.S. consumer, supported by a tight labor market, has remained in good shape.Initial claims for the week ending August 24 increased by 4,000 to 215,000, as expected. Continuing claims for the week ending August 17 increased by 22,000 to 1.698 million.The key takeaway from the report is that initial claims, which are an important leading indicator, remain low. That will perpetuate the belief that there remains a good underpinning in a tight labor market for continued consumer spending growth.The Advance report for International Trade in Goods for July showed a deficit of $72.3 billion following an unrevised deficit of $74.2 billion. Meanwhile, the Advance report for Wholesale Inventories for July increased 0.2%, and the Advance report for Retail Inventories for July increased 0.8%.Pending Home Sales declined 2.5% in July (Briefing.com consensus +0.1%).

We begin 2007 expecting that our operating activities will require some $10-$12 million in cash per quarter, with additional quarterly expenditures of approximately $2 million for payments against asset-backed installment debt and dividends on preferred stock. In addition, we are scheduled to make payments totaling $8 million in the second quarter of 2007 as the final remaining non-contingent payments against previously announced intellectual property agreements. We anticipate that our spending on internal development of pipeline product opportunities will be relatively modest in 2007, reflecting their early stage of development. Our spending on the additional clinical programs will also be modest because together they involve only about 50 new patients.

In his testimony, Grinstein also addressed the unsolicited takeover proposal made by US Airways (LLC). As previously stated, Delta's Board of Directors rejected the initial proposal made by US Airways on Nov. 15, 2006 and concluded that the company's standalone Plan of Reorganization will provide creditors with superior value as well as a faster recovery and much greater certainty of execution. Grinstein said that a primary reason for Congress to examine the competitive impact of the LLC proposal deal is that if the merger were to go forward, it would trigger broad industry consolidation. He said, \"if this anticompetitive proposed merger gains approval despite its substantial adverse impacts on competition, consumers, communities and employees, virtually any other airline merger would likely pass regulatory muster. In our view, the likely outcome of follow-on consolidation would be to leave the combined Delta and US Airways as the weakest carrier, with little West Coast and Asian presence and a staggering debt load.\"</p><p>11:26</p><p>TRMM TRM announces sale of european ATM business (3.10 +0.84)</p><p>Co announces it has sold T.R.M Limited, its subsidiary that owns all of its A.T.M business in the United Kingdom and Germany, to NoteMachine Limited, for 47.1 mln pounds Sterling or approx $92.6 mln at exchange rates in effect on Jan 24, 2007.

The dollar is suffering its session's weakest levels on the euro with the common currency nibbling at offers above 1.4760. The yen has softened up a little through the day after stalling at 109.5000.

The FDA has requested certain non-clinical information, including additional in vitro dissolution data, as a condition to final approval.

Because the NDA for Stavzor, submitted under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, references Abbott Laboratories' Depakote product, final approval is also subject to the expiration of any applicable exclusivity periods benefiting Depakote. Based on receipt of the approvable letter, interaction with Banner Pharmacaps (the NDA holder and developer of the product), and its understanding of Depakote exclusivity, Noven continues to expect Stavzor final approval, at the latest, by the end of July 2008. We are now working with Banner to satisfy the conditions to final approval as expeditiously as possible. Banner has advised that it expects to respond to the FDA's requests in the coming weeks.

Players are also looking out to the upcoming auction results, although interest is not too high, its about all trade has going for it today. There has been some support as concerns over further fall-out from the financial world's credit issues. There will be little impetus to make a run (barring a melt-down across the aisle) as trade stares down the double barrel of housing reports over the next few days.

Overnight, global equities followed their US counterpart on a slow path to stability which is now sapping the remaining positive momentum from treasuries. The 2-10-yr yield spread is still flattening at 55.3 with curve trade still bent on unwinding last week's steepeners. Bond prices in the EuroZone &amp; Japan were dented by the recovery in equities, but a nagging back-drop of slower global growth persists taking some of the sting out of the move. Treasuries are running on fumes still, mostly leftover from last week's big price run up. Trade will be looking to at least hold the range established yesterday but pressure may pick up to the downside should stocks rally. Treasury re-opens a 5-yr TIP note which will weigh but otherwise the calendars are empty providing little sustenance for trade. Technicals are neutral to slightly weak as the retracement that began yesterday may want another leg down. The buck is giving back ground against the euro after its recent rally while the yen is falling off as carry trades start to reinitiate. Gold has seen a bump as the buck backs off with spot now 759.04 (5.84). Crude has bounced as ongoing geopolitical issues raise concerns now 86.52 (+0.53). There are no numbers of consequence to play off &amp; no Fed-speak either, but there is a minor $6B TIPS auction, so likely an aimless day for trade. The euro is at 1.4255 &amp; the yen is at 114.7000 while the 10-yr yield is unchanged now at 4.409%.

The poster presentation of preclinical data shows that MSI-1436 demonstrated selective inhibition of PTP-1B but did not inhibit the activities of DDP-IV, TC-PTP or SHP-2 nor inhibit ligand binding to the CB1 or 5HT2C receptors. Additional in vitro testing demonstrated that MSI-1436 does not activate PPAR (alpha, beta/delta or gamma) nor bind to 250 different kinases. In an animal model, MSI-1436 was found to distribute to both the liver and brain upon peripheral administration and was observed to modify the phosphorylation status of downstream effectors of insulin signaling. The study confirmed that MSI-1436 is a selective inhibitor of PTP-1B, and its central and peripheral effects provide promise for the simultaneous treatment of both type 2 diabetes and obesity. Trodusquemine was found to be well-tolerated at likely clinical doses, and no serious adverse events were seen in healthy overweight and obese adults. GENR also announces that the co has designated 40 mg/m2 of trodusquemine as the maximum tolerated single dose for subjects in Study 101, as a result of nausea. The co plans to move forward with evaluations of single doses of trodusquemine within the likely clinically effective range for the drug in type 2 diabetics then proceed to study the safety and pharmacokinetics of the drug in several multiple dose scenarios.

Bentley plans to spin off the drug delivery business as an independent, publicly traded company to be known as CPEX Pharmaceuticals. Bentley's drug delivery business segment reported revenues of $8.4 mln in 2006. Bentley plans to implement the spin-off through a taxable stock dividend of all CPEX Pharmaceuticals common stock to Bentley shareholders. CPEX Pharmaceuticals plans to seek a listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the ticker symbol \"CPEX\" and Bentley will continue to trade on the NYSE under its current ticker symbol \"BNT.\" The generics pharmaceutical business is the larger of the two business segments of Bentley, with revenues in 2005 and 2006 of $91.6 million and $101.1 million, respectively. Following the consummation of the plan, Bentley will maintain its significant commercial and manufacturing presence in Europe and continue to develop, market and license current and pipeline pharmaceuticals. Following the spin-off, Bentley will employ approximately 425 individuals, including its current senior management team in Spain. Bentley will also continue to maintain corporate headquarters in Exeter, NH. The Company's current manufacturing, sales and marketing, and R&amp;D centers in Europe will be virtually unaffected by the spin-off.

Approximately 70% of Assured's unrealized mark-to-market loss on derivatives is due to a decline in the market value of high yield and investment grade corporate collateralized loan obligation transactions, with the balance generated by lower market values principally in the residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities markets. The mark-to-market loss does not reflect actual claims or credit losses, nor does it reduce Assured's claims-paying resources, rating agency capital requirements or regulatory capital position. The co's CDS exposures are substantially similar to its financial guaranty insurance contracts and provide for credit protection against payment default. They are contracts that are held to maturity and are not subject to margin or collateral calls due to changes in market value. The net gain or loss on CDS exposure will amortize to zero as the exposure approaches its maturity date, unless there is a payment default on the exposure.

Co also says \"As we have reported over the past several months, our consumer channel has been impacted by a combination of factors... While this quarter was certainly challenging, and while we still see pockets of inventory across our handgun and long gun channels that have yet to clear, we believe we are now beginning to see positive signs that our industry is improving....In October, distributors began to minimize purchases in order to reduce inventories, while we launched a number of consumer promotions to help stimulate consumer demand and pull our products through the distribution channel. Those programs, combined with an extended factory shutdown, showed positive impact on our inventories. Our inventory levels, which increased in November, began to decrease in both December and January and continued to decrease as we entered the fourth fiscal quarter. As inventories in the channel began to move down, we saw additional encouraging signs. Order activity at our seasonal buying group events in early calendar 2008, and order backlog levels for January and February, indicate that buying patterns continue to gradually improve and that our promotional programs continue to have positive impact.</p><p>16:09</p><p>WIND Wind River reports EPS in-line, revs in-line; guides Q1 EPS below consensus, revs below consensus; guides FY09 EPS below consensus, revs in-line (6.92 -0.11)</p><p>Reports Q4 (Jan) earnings of $0.09 per share, excluding non-recurring items, in-line with the First Call consensus of $0.09; revenues rose 10.8% year/year to $84.3 mln vs the $85.1 mln consensus.

The regulatory overhang has weighed on shares of Alphabet (GOOG 1134.00, -12.21, -1.1%), Facebook (FB 199.55, -2.81, -1.4%), and Amazon (AMZN 1976.60, -17.89, -0.9%) in pre-market action.</p><p>In earnings news, Dow components Visa (V 180.20, -0.70, -0.4%), Boeing (BA 370.50, -2.57, -0.7%), and Caterpillar (CAT 133.49, -4.61, -3.3%) were some blue-chip companies to report since yesterday's close. Shares of Caterpillar are getting hit following disappointing results and guidance, while shares of Boeing slip after the company continues to not provide full-year guidance.</p><p>Elsewhere, the eurozone flash July Manufacturing PMI declined below expectations, coming in at 46.4, amid weakness in Germany.

The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index declined 1.9% following a 1.1% decline in the prior week.</p><p>U.S. Treasuries have haven't reflected too much concern about the eurozone slowdown, perhaps on the understanding that the ECB is expected to take a dovish-minded stance at its policy meeting on Thursday. The 2-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.81%, and the 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 2.06%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 97.61. WTI crude is up 0.4% to $56.99/bbl.</p><p>In U.S. Corporate news:</p><p>Boeing (BA 370.50, -2.57): despite beating top and bottom-line estimates. Boeing reported an EPS loss, which was expected, but the company continues to not provide full-year guidance. Caterpillar (CAT 133.49, -4.61): -3.3% after missing earnings expectations and lowering its FY19 EPS guidance. Visa (V 180.20, -0.70): -0.4% despite beating top and bottom-line estimates and slightly raising its FY19 EPS guidance. Texas Instruments (TXN 126.33, +6.26): +5.2% after beating top and bottom-line estimates. AT&amp;T (T 31.53, -0.56): -1.8% despite releasing in-line results and raising its free cash flow guidance. UPS (UPS 108.00, +2.73): +2.6% after beating profit expectations.</p><p>Reviewing overnight developments:</p><p>Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region ended the midweek session on a mixed note.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%), Nasdaq Composite (+0.6%), and Russell 2000 (+0.7%) advanced in-line with the benchmark index.</p><p>It had been a tight-ranged session for a good part of the day despite positive earnings results and guidance from a diversified group of companies like Coca-Cola (KO 54.33, +3.11, +6.1%), United Technologies (UTX 134.94, +1.99, +1.5%), Sherwin-Williams (SHW 490.23, +35.64, +7.8%), and Biogen (BIIB 243.88, +11.40, +4.9%). Travelers (TRV 147.50, -2.21, -1.5%), however, did come up short of expectations.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, a positive trade headline helped energize the slow-moving market. Bloomberg reported that USTR Lighthizer and other senior officials will head to China next week to continue trade talks from Monday to Wednesday. Although this possibility had been reported earlier and many high-level talks in the past have yielded little progress, the good mood in the market flowing from earnings seemed to sway the market.</p><p>The news pushed the S&amp;P 500 back above the 3000 level, where it would stay above on a closing basis. Ten of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors finished higher, led by the trade-sensitive materials (+2.0%) and industrials (+1.2%) sectors. The utilities sector was the lone holdout, finishing lower by 0.6%.</p><p>Qualcomm (QCOM 74.12, -1.83, -2.4%) was also left out of the advance after The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple (AAPL 208.84, +1.62, +0.8%) is considering buying Intel's (INTC 51.75, +0.40, +0.8%) smartphone-modem chip business for around $1 billion. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index finished up 1.2%.</p><p>Separately, Congress reached a deal to increase the budget deficit and suspend the debt ceiling for two years. The news provided some relief for investors, but market reaction was mostly muted as the dilemma never appeared to hinder the market beforehand and it was reported yesterday that a deal was close.</p><p>U.S. Treasuries finished on a lower note, pushing yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.83%, and the 10-yr yield increased three basis points to 2.07%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.5% to 97.74, helped by some weakness in the euro. WTI crude rose 0.9% to $56.72/bbl.</p><p>Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included Existing Home Sales for June and the FHFA Housing Market Index for May:</p><p>Existing home sales decreased 1.7% month-over-month in June to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 5.27 million (Briefing.com consensus 5.30 million) from an upwardly revised 5.36 million (from 5.34 million) in May. Total sales were 2.2% lower than the same period a year ago.The key takeaway from the report is that the drop in mortgage rates has failed to spur a meaningful pickup in existing home sales, which continue to be constrained by the lack of available supply at lower price points.The FHFA Housing Price Index for May increased 0.1% after advancing 0.4% in June.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive New Home Sales for June and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +24.4% YTDS&amp;P 500 +19.9% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +17.2% YTDRussell 2000 +15.3% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1920/969. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1717/1330.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-348638716</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMY-WRM1-DYRK-92D3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1486\"/><timeReceived>8:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc.

The regulatory overhang has weighed on shares of Alphabet (GOOG 1134.00, -12.21, -1.1%), Facebook (FB 199.55, -2.81, -1.4%), and Amazon (AMZN 1976.60, -17.89, -0.9%) in pre-market action.</p><p>In earnings news, Dow components Visa (V 180.20, -0.70, -0.4%), Boeing (BA 370.50, -2.57, -0.7%), and Caterpillar (CAT 133.49, -4.61, -3.3%) were some blue-chip companies to report since yesterday's close. Shares of Caterpillar are getting hit following disappointing results and guidance, while shares of Boeing slip after the company continues to not provide full-year guidance.</p><p>Elsewhere, the eurozone flash July Manufacturing PMI declined below expectations, coming in at 46.4, amid weakness in Germany.

The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index declined 1.9% following a 1.1% decline in the prior week.</p><p>U.S. Treasuries have haven't reflected too much concern about the eurozone slowdown, perhaps on the understanding that the ECB is expected to take a dovish-minded stance at its policy meeting on Thursday. The 2-yr yield is down two basis points to 1.81%, and the 10-yr yield is down one basis point to 2.06%. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 97.61. WTI crude is up 0.4% to $56.99/bbl.</p><p>In U.S. Corporate news:</p><p>Boeing (BA 370.50, -2.57): despite beating top and bottom-line estimates. Boeing reported an EPS loss, which was expected, but the company continues to not provide full-year guidance. Caterpillar (CAT 133.49, -4.61): -3.3% after missing earnings expectations and lowering its FY19 EPS guidance. Visa (V 180.20, -0.70): -0.4% despite beating top and bottom-line estimates and slightly raising its FY19 EPS guidance. Texas Instruments (TXN 126.33, +6.26): +5.2% after beating top and bottom-line estimates. AT&amp;T (T 31.53, -0.56): -1.8% despite releasing in-line results and raising its free cash flow guidance. UPS (UPS 108.00, +2.73): +2.6% after beating profit expectations.</p><p>Reviewing overnight developments:</p><p>Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region ended the midweek session on a mixed note.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%), Nasdaq Composite (+0.6%), and Russell 2000 (+0.7%) advanced in-line with the benchmark index.</p><p>It had been a tight-ranged session for a good part of the day despite positive earnings results and guidance from a diversified group of companies like Coca-Cola (KO 54.33, +3.11, +6.1%), United Technologies (UTX 134.94, +1.99, +1.5%), Sherwin-Williams (SHW 490.23, +35.64, +7.8%), and Biogen (BIIB 243.88, +11.40, +4.9%). Travelers (TRV 147.50, -2.21, -1.5%), however, did come up short of expectations.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, a positive trade headline helped energize the slow-moving market. Bloomberg reported that USTR Lighthizer and other senior officials will head to China next week to continue trade talks from Monday to Wednesday. Although this possibility had been reported earlier and many high-level talks in the past have yielded little progress, the good mood in the market flowing from earnings seemed to sway the market.</p><p>The news pushed the S&amp;P 500 back above the 3000 level, where it would stay above on a closing basis. Ten of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors finished higher, led by the trade-sensitive materials (+2.0%) and industrials (+1.2%) sectors. The utilities sector was the lone holdout, finishing lower by 0.6%.</p><p>Qualcomm (QCOM 74.12, -1.83, -2.4%) was also left out of the advance after The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple (AAPL 208.84, +1.62, +0.8%) is considering buying Intel's (INTC 51.75, +0.40, +0.8%) smartphone-modem chip business for around $1 billion. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index finished up 1.2%.</p><p>Separately, Congress reached a deal to increase the budget deficit and suspend the debt ceiling for two years. The news provided some relief for investors, but market reaction was mostly muted as the dilemma never appeared to hinder the market beforehand and it was reported yesterday that a deal was close.</p><p>U.S. Treasuries finished on a lower note, pushing yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.83%, and the 10-yr yield increased three basis points to 2.07%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.5% to 97.74, helped by some weakness in the euro. WTI crude rose 0.9% to $56.72/bbl.</p><p>Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included Existing Home Sales for June and the FHFA Housing Market Index for May:</p><p>Existing home sales decreased 1.7% month-over-month in June to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 5.27 million (Briefing.com consensus 5.30 million) from an upwardly revised 5.36 million (from 5.34 million) in May. Total sales were 2.2% lower than the same period a year ago.The key takeaway from the report is that the drop in mortgage rates has failed to spur a meaningful pickup in existing home sales, which continue to be constrained by the lack of available supply at lower price points.The FHFA Housing Price Index for May increased 0.1% after advancing 0.4% in June.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive New Home Sales for June and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +24.4% YTDS&amp;P 500 +19.9% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +17.2% YTDRussell 2000 +15.3% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1920/969. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1717/1330.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-348638716</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMY-WPP1-JC8H-K2NS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1486\"/><timeReceived>8:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%), Nasdaq Composite (+0.6%), and Russell 2000 (+0.7%) advanced in-line with the benchmark index.</p><p>It had been a tight-ranged session for a good part of the day despite positive earnings results and guidance from a diversified group of companies like Coca-Cola (KO 54.33, +3.11, +6.1%), United Technologies (UTX 134.94, +1.99, +1.5%), Sherwin-Williams (SHW 490.23, +35.64, +7.8%), and Biogen (BIIB 243.88, +11.40, +4.9%). Travelers (TRV 147.50, -2.21, -1.5%), however, did come up short of expectations.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, a positive trade headline helped energize the slow-moving market. Bloomberg reported that USTR Lighthizer and other senior officials will head to China next week to continue trade talks from Monday to Wednesday. Although this possibility had been reported earlier and many high-level talks in the past have yielded little progress, the good mood in the market flowing from earnings seemed to sway the market.</p><p>The news pushed the S&amp;P 500 back above the 3000 level, where it would stay above on a closing basis. Ten of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors finished higher, led by the trade-sensitive materials (+2.0%) and industrials (+1.2%) sectors. The utilities sector was the lone holdout, finishing lower by 0.6%.</p><p>Qualcomm (QCOM 74.12, -1.83, -2.4%) was also left out of the advance after The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple (AAPL 208.84, +1.62, +0.8%) is considering buying Intel's (INTC 51.75, +0.40, +0.8%) smartphone-modem chip business for around $1 billion. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index finished up 1.2%.</p><p>Separately, Congress reached a deal to increase the budget deficit and suspend the debt ceiling for two years. The news provided some relief for investors, but market reaction was mostly muted as the dilemma never appeared to hinder the market beforehand and it was reported yesterday that a deal was close.</p><p>U.S. Treasuries finished on a lower note, pushing yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.83%, and the 10-yr yield increased three basis points to 2.07%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.5% to 97.74, helped by some weakness in the euro. WTI crude rose 0.9% to $56.72/bbl.</p><p>Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included Existing Home Sales for June and the FHFA Housing Market Index for May:</p><p>Existing home sales decreased 1.7% month-over-month in June to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 5.27 million (Briefing.com consensus 5.30 million) from an upwardly revised 5.36 million (from 5.34 million) in May. Total sales were 2.2% lower than the same period a year ago.The key takeaway from the report is that the drop in mortgage rates has failed to spur a meaningful pickup in existing home sales, which continue to be constrained by the lack of available supply at lower price points.The FHFA Housing Price Index for May increased 0.1% after advancing 0.4% in June.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive New Home Sales for June and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +24.4% YTDS&amp;P 500 +19.9% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +17.2% YTDRussell 2000 +15.3% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1920/969. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1717/1330.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-348641391</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMY-WRM1-DYRK-92D4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1471\"/><timeReceived>8:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc.

The regulatory overhang has weighed on shares of Alphabet (GOOG 1134.00, -12.21, -1.1%), Facebook (FB 199.55, -2.81, -1.4%), and Amazon (AMZN 1976.60, -17.89, -0.9%) in pre-market action.</p><p>In earnings news, Dow components Visa (V 180.20, -0.70, -0.4%), Boeing (BA 370.50, -2.57, -0.7%), and Caterpillar (CAT 133.49, -4.61, -3.3%) were some blue-chip companies to report since yesterday's close.

The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index declined 1.9% following a 1.1% decline in the prior week.</p><p>U.S. Treasuries haven't reflected too much concern about the eurozone slowdown, as yields are little changed.

Boeing reported an EPS loss, which was expected, but the company continues to not provide full-year guidance. Caterpillar (CAT 133.49, -4.61): -3.3% after missing earnings expectations and lowering its FY19 EPS guidance. Visa (V 180.20, -0.70): -0.4% despite beating top and bottom-line estimates and slightly raising its FY19 EPS guidance. Texas Instruments (TXN 126.33, +6.26): +5.2% after beating top and bottom-line estimates. AT&amp;T (T 31.53, -0.56): -1.8% despite releasing in-line results and raising its free cash flow guidance.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%), Nasdaq Composite (+0.6%), and Russell 2000 (+0.7%) advanced in-line with the benchmark index.</p><p>It had been a tight-ranged session for a good part of the day despite positive earnings results and guidance from a diversified group of companies like Coca-Cola (KO 54.33, +3.11, +6.1%), United Technologies (UTX 134.94, +1.99, +1.5%), Sherwin-Williams (SHW 490.23, +35.64, +7.8%), and Biogen (BIIB 243.88, +11.40, +4.9%). Travelers (TRV 147.50, -2.21, -1.5%), however, did come up short of expectations.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, a positive trade headline helped energize the slow-moving market. Bloomberg reported that USTR Lighthizer and other senior officials will head to China next week to continue trade talks from Monday to Wednesday. Although this possibility had been reported earlier and many high-level talks in the past have yielded little progress, the good mood in the market flowing from earnings seemed to sway the market.</p><p>The news pushed the S&amp;P 500 back above the 3000 level, where it would stay above on a closing basis. Ten of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors finished higher, led by the trade-sensitive materials (+2.0%) and industrials (+1.2%) sectors. The utilities sector was the lone holdout, finishing lower by 0.6%.</p><p>Qualcomm (QCOM 74.12, -1.83, -2.4%) was also left out of the advance after The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple (AAPL 208.84, +1.62, +0.8%) is considering buying Intel's (INTC 51.75, +0.40, +0.8%) smartphone-modem chip business for around $1 billion. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index finished up 1.2%.</p><p>Separately, Congress reached a deal to increase the budget deficit and suspend the debt ceiling for two years. The news provided some relief for investors, but market reaction was mostly muted as the dilemma never appeared to hinder the market beforehand and it was reported yesterday that a deal was close.</p><p>U.S. Treasuries finished on a lower note, pushing yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.83%, and the 10-yr yield increased three basis points to 2.07%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.5% to 97.74, helped by some weakness in the euro. WTI crude rose 0.9% to $56.72/bbl.</p><p>Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included Existing Home Sales for June and the FHFA Housing Market Index for May:</p><p>Existing home sales decreased 1.7% month-over-month in June to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 5.27 million (Briefing.com consensus 5.30 million) from an upwardly revised 5.36 million (from 5.34 million) in May. Total sales were 2.2% lower than the same period a year ago.The key takeaway from the report is that the drop in mortgage rates has failed to spur a meaningful pickup in existing home sales, which continue to be constrained by the lack of available supply at lower price points.The FHFA Housing Price Index for May increased 0.1% after advancing 0.4% in June.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive New Home Sales for June and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +24.4% YTDS&amp;P 500 +19.9% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +17.2% YTDRussell 2000 +15.3% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1920/969. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1717/1330.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-348641391</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMY-WPP1-JC8H-K2NT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1471\"/><timeReceived>8:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%), Nasdaq Composite (+0.6%), and Russell 2000 (+0.7%) advanced in-line with the benchmark index.</p><p>It had been a tight-ranged session for a good part of the day despite positive earnings results and guidance from a diversified group of companies like Coca-Cola (KO 54.33, +3.11, +6.1%), United Technologies (UTX 134.94, +1.99, +1.5%), Sherwin-Williams (SHW 490.23, +35.64, +7.8%), and Biogen (BIIB 243.88, +11.40, +4.9%). Travelers (TRV 147.50, -2.21, -1.5%), however, did come up short of expectations.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, a positive trade headline helped energize the slow-moving market. Bloomberg reported that USTR Lighthizer and other senior officials will head to China next week to continue trade talks from Monday to Wednesday. Although this possibility had been reported earlier and many high-level talks in the past have yielded little progress, the good mood in the market flowing from earnings seemed to sway the market.</p><p>The news pushed the S&amp;P 500 back above the 3000 level, where it would stay above on a closing basis. Ten of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors finished higher, led by the trade-sensitive materials (+2.0%) and industrials (+1.2%) sectors. The utilities sector was the lone holdout, finishing lower by 0.6%.</p><p>Qualcomm (QCOM 74.12, -1.83, -2.4%) was also left out of the advance after The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple (AAPL 208.84, +1.62, +0.8%) is considering buying Intel's (INTC 51.75, +0.40, +0.8%) smartphone-modem chip business for around $1 billion. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index finished up 1.2%.</p><p>Separately, Congress reached a deal to increase the budget deficit and suspend the debt ceiling for two years. The news provided some relief for investors, but market reaction was mostly muted as the dilemma never appeared to hinder the market beforehand and it was reported yesterday that a deal was close.</p><p>U.S. Treasuries finished on a lower note, pushing yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.83%, and the 10-yr yield increased three basis points to 2.07%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.5% to 97.74, helped by some weakness in the euro. WTI crude rose 0.9% to $56.72/bbl.</p><p>Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included Existing Home Sales for June and the FHFA Housing Market Index for May:</p><p>Existing home sales decreased 1.7% month-over-month in June to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 5.27 million (Briefing.com consensus 5.30 million) from an upwardly revised 5.36 million (from 5.34 million) in May. Total sales were 2.2% lower than the same period a year ago.The key takeaway from the report is that the drop in mortgage rates has failed to spur a meaningful pickup in existing home sales, which continue to be constrained by the lack of available supply at lower price points.The FHFA Housing Price Index for May increased 0.1% after advancing 0.4% in June.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive New Home Sales for June and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +24.4% YTDS&amp;P 500 +19.9% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +17.2% YTDRussell 2000 +15.3% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1920/969. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1717/1330.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-348643217</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMY-WPP1-JC8H-K2NV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1615\"/><timeReceived>8:50 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%), Nasdaq Composite (+0.6%), and Russell 2000 (+0.7%) advanced in-line with the benchmark index.</p><p>It had been a tight-ranged session for a good part of the day despite positive earnings results and guidance from a diversified group of companies like Coca-Cola (KO 54.33, +3.11, +6.1%), United Technologies (UTX 134.94, +1.99, +1.5%), Sherwin-Williams (SHW 490.23, +35.64, +7.8%), and Biogen (BIIB 243.88, +11.40, +4.9%). Travelers (TRV 147.50, -2.21, -1.5%), however, did come up short of expectations.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, a positive trade headline helped energize the slow-moving market. Bloomberg reported that USTR Lighthizer and other senior officials will head to China next week to continue trade talks from Monday to Wednesday. Although this possibility had been reported earlier and many high-level talks in the past have yielded little progress, the good mood in the market flowing from earnings seemed to sway the market.</p><p>The news pushed the S&amp;P 500 back above the 3000 level, where it would stay above on a closing basis. Ten of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors finished higher, led by the trade-sensitive materials (+2.0%) and industrials (+1.2%) sectors. The utilities sector was the lone holdout, finishing lower by 0.6%.</p><p>Qualcomm (QCOM 74.12, -1.83, -2.4%) was also left out of the advance after The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple (AAPL 208.84, +1.62, +0.8%) is considering buying Intel's (INTC 51.75, +0.40, +0.8%) smartphone-modem chip business for around $1 billion. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index finished up 1.2%.</p><p>Separately, Congress reached a deal to increase the budget deficit and suspend the debt ceiling for two years. The news provided some relief for investors, but market reaction was mostly muted as the dilemma never appeared to hinder the market beforehand and it was reported yesterday that a deal was close.</p><p>U.S. Treasuries finished on a lower note, pushing yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.83%, and the 10-yr yield increased three basis points to 2.07%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.5% to 97.74, helped by some weakness in the euro. WTI crude rose 0.9% to $56.72/bbl.</p><p>Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included Existing Home Sales for June and the FHFA Housing Market Index for May:</p><p>Existing home sales decreased 1.7% month-over-month in June to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 5.27 million (Briefing.com consensus 5.30 million) from an upwardly revised 5.36 million (from 5.34 million) in May. Total sales were 2.2% lower than the same period a year ago.The key takeaway from the report is that the drop in mortgage rates has failed to spur a meaningful pickup in existing home sales, which continue to be constrained by the lack of available supply at lower price points.The FHFA Housing Price Index for May increased 0.1% after advancing 0.4% in June.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive New Home Sales for June and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +24.4% YTDS&amp;P 500 +19.9% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +17.2% YTDRussell 2000 +15.3% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1920/969. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1717/1330.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-348643217</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMY-WRM1-DYRK-92D5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1615\"/><timeReceived>8:50 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%), Nasdaq Composite (+0.6%), and Russell 2000 (+0.7%) advanced in-line with the benchmark index.</p><p>It had been a tight-ranged session for a good part of the day despite positive earnings results and guidance from a diversified group of companies like Coca-Cola (KO 54.33, +3.11, +6.1%), United Technologies (UTX 134.94, +1.99, +1.5%), Sherwin-Williams (SHW 490.23, +35.64, +7.8%), and Biogen (BIIB 243.88, +11.40, +4.9%). Travelers (TRV 147.50, -2.21, -1.5%), however, did come up short of expectations.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, a positive trade headline helped energize the slow-moving market. Bloomberg reported that USTR Lighthizer and other senior officials will head to China next week to continue trade talks from Monday to Wednesday. Although this possibility had been reported earlier and many high-level talks in the past have yielded little progress, the good mood in the market flowing from earnings seemed to sway the market.</p><p>The news pushed the S&amp;P 500 back above the 3000 level, where it would stay above on a closing basis. Ten of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors finished higher, led by the trade-sensitive materials (+2.0%) and industrials (+1.2%) sectors. The utilities sector was the lone holdout, finishing lower by 0.6%.</p><p>Qualcomm (QCOM 74.12, -1.83, -2.4%) was also left out of the advance after The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple (AAPL 208.84, +1.62, +0.8%) is considering buying Intel's (INTC 51.75, +0.40, +0.8%) smartphone-modem chip business for around $1 billion. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index finished up 1.2%.</p><p>Separately, Congress reached a deal to increase the budget deficit and suspend the debt ceiling for two years. The news provided some relief for investors, but market reaction was mostly muted as the dilemma never appeared to hinder the market beforehand and it was reported yesterday that a deal was close.</p><p>U.S. Treasuries finished on a lower note, pushing yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.83%, and the 10-yr yield increased three basis points to 2.07%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.5% to 97.74, helped by some weakness in the euro. WTI crude rose 0.9% to $56.72/bbl.</p><p>Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included Existing Home Sales for June and the FHFA Housing Market Index for May:</p><p>Existing home sales decreased 1.7% month-over-month in June to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 5.27 million (Briefing.com consensus 5.30 million) from an upwardly revised 5.36 million (from 5.34 million) in May. Total sales were 2.2% lower than the same period a year ago.The key takeaway from the report is that the drop in mortgage rates has failed to spur a meaningful pickup in existing home sales, which continue to be constrained by the lack of available supply at lower price points.The FHFA Housing Price Index for May increased 0.1% after advancing 0.4% in June.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive New Home Sales for June and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +24.4% YTDS&amp;P 500 +19.9% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +17.2% YTDRussell 2000 +15.3% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1920/969. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1717/1330.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-348643615</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMY-WPP1-JC8H-K2NW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2024\"/><timeReceived>8:55 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%), Nasdaq Composite (+0.6%), and Russell 2000 (+0.7%) advanced in-line with the benchmark index.</p><p>It had been a tight-ranged session for a good part of the day despite positive earnings results and guidance from a diversified group of companies like Coca-Cola (KO 54.33, +3.11, +6.1%), United Technologies (UTX 134.94, +1.99, +1.5%), Sherwin-Williams (SHW 490.23, +35.64, +7.8%), and Biogen (BIIB 243.88, +11.40, +4.9%). Travelers (TRV 147.50, -2.21, -1.5%), however, did come up short of expectations.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, a positive trade headline helped energize the slow-moving market. Bloomberg reported that USTR Lighthizer and other senior officials will head to China next week to continue trade talks from Monday to Wednesday. Although this possibility had been reported earlier and many high-level talks in the past have yielded little progress, the good mood in the market flowing from earnings seemed to sway the market.</p><p>The news pushed the S&amp;P 500 back above the 3000 level, where it would stay above on a closing basis. Ten of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors finished higher, led by the trade-sensitive materials (+2.0%) and industrials (+1.2%) sectors. The utilities sector was the lone holdout, finishing lower by 0.6%.</p><p>Qualcomm (QCOM 74.12, -1.83, -2.4%) was also left out of the advance after The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple (AAPL 208.84, +1.62, +0.8%) is considering buying Intel's (INTC 51.75, +0.40, +0.8%) smartphone-modem chip business for around $1 billion. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index finished up 1.2%.</p><p>Separately, Congress reached a deal to increase the budget deficit and suspend the debt ceiling for two years. The news provided some relief for investors, but market reaction was mostly muted as the dilemma never appeared to hinder the market beforehand and it was reported yesterday that a deal was close.</p><p>U.S. Treasuries finished on a lower note, pushing yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.83%, and the 10-yr yield increased three basis points to 2.07%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.5% to 97.74, helped by some weakness in the euro. WTI crude rose 0.9% to $56.72/bbl.</p><p>Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included Existing Home Sales for June and the FHFA Housing Market Index for May:</p><p>Existing home sales decreased 1.7% month-over-month in June to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 5.27 million (Briefing.com consensus 5.30 million) from an upwardly revised 5.36 million (from 5.34 million) in May. Total sales were 2.2% lower than the same period a year ago.The key takeaway from the report is that the drop in mortgage rates has failed to spur a meaningful pickup in existing home sales, which continue to be constrained by the lack of available supply at lower price points.The FHFA Housing Price Index for May increased 0.1% after advancing 0.4% in June.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive New Home Sales for June and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +24.4% YTDS&amp;P 500 +19.9% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +17.2% YTDRussell 2000 +15.3% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1920/969. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1717/1330.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-348643615</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMY-WRM1-DYRK-92D6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2024\"/><timeReceived>8:55 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc.

The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.6%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.9%. The small-cap Russell 2000 underperformed with a 1.5% decline.</p><p>Ten of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors closed lower, but the health care (-1.1%) and information technology (-1.2%) sectors were the only sectors to decline more than 1.0%. Note, the tech sector was down as much as 2.7% intraday, while the consumer discretionary sector gained 0.3% as shares of Amazon (AMZN 3008.91, +22.36, +0.8%) recovered an early 3.3% decline.</p><p>Intel (INTC 50.59, -9.81, -16.2%) did very little recovering, with shares falling 16% after the company announced a six-month delay in its next-generation 7nm chip technology. While disappointing for Intel investors, the news was welcomed by investors of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 69.40, +9.83, +16.5%).</p><p>Other negative factors today included China ordering the U.S. to close its consulate in Chengdu in response to the U.S. ordering China to close its consulate in Houston and a delay in the Republican coronavirus relief bill until next week.</p><p>On a more positive note, new home sales surged 13.8% m/m in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 776,000 (Briefing.com consensus 680,000).

The 2-yr yield declined one basis point to 0.14%, and the 10-yr yield was flat at 0.58%. Gold futures rose 0.4% to $1897.50/ozt -- its highest settlement price ever amid continued weakness in the U.S. Dollar Index (94.39, -0.30, -0.3%). WTI crude futures settled little changed at $41.08/bbl.</p><p>Reviewing Friday's economic data:</p><p>New home sales surged 13.8% m/m in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 776,000 (Briefing.com consensus 680,000). That was the strongest pace of sales since July 2007 and higher than the pre-pandemic pace of 774,000 seen in January. On a yr/yr basis, new home sales were up 13.7%.The key takeaway from the report is that sales activity in the new home market is quite healthy given the tight supply of existing homes for sale, low mortgage rates, pent-up demand, and an emerging, coronavirus-driven shift by city dwellers to suburban settings.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive Durable Goods Orders for June on Monday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +15.5% YTDS&amp;P 500 -0.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -7.3% YTDRussell 2000 -12.0% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 992/1937. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 868/2356.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-368497880</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FN-SV41-JC8H-K05C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1766\"/><timeReceived>9:17 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Briefing.com, Inc.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%), Nasdaq Composite (+0.6%), and Russell 2000 (+0.7%) advanced in-line with the benchmark index.</p><p>It had been a tight-ranged session for a good part of the day despite positive earnings results and guidance from a diversified group of companies like Coca-Cola (KO 54.33, +3.11, +6.1%), United Technologies (UTX 134.94, +1.99, +1.5%), Sherwin-Williams (SHW 490.23, +35.64, +7.8%), and Biogen (BIIB 243.88, +11.40, +4.9%). Travelers (TRV 147.50, -2.21, -1.5%), however, did come up short of expectations.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, a positive trade headline helped energize the slow-moving market. Bloomberg reported that USTR Lighthizer and other senior officials will head to China next week to continue trade talks from Monday to Wednesday. Although this possibility had been reported earlier and many high-level talks in the past have yielded little progress, the good mood in the market flowing from earnings seemed to sway the market.</p><p>The news pushed the S&amp;P 500 back above the 3000 level, where it would stay above on a closing basis. Ten of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors finished higher, led by the trade-sensitive materials (+2.0%) and industrials (+1.2%) sectors. The utilities sector was the lone holdout, finishing lower by 0.6%.</p><p>Qualcomm (QCOM 74.12, -1.83, -2.4%) was also left out of the advance after The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple (AAPL 208.84, +1.62, +0.8%) is considering buying Intel's (INTC 51.75, +0.40, +0.8%) smartphone-modem chip business for around $1 billion. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index finished up 1.2%.</p><p>Separately, Congress reached a deal to increase the budget deficit and suspend the debt ceiling for two years. The news provided some relief for investors, but market reaction was mostly muted as the dilemma never appeared to hinder the market beforehand and it was reported yesterday that a deal was close.</p><p>U.S. Treasuries finished on a lower note, pushing yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.83%, and the 10-yr yield increased three basis points to 2.07%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.5% to 97.74, helped by some weakness in the euro. WTI crude rose 0.9% to $56.72/bbl.</p><p>Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included Existing Home Sales for June and the FHFA Housing Market Index for May:</p><p>Existing home sales decreased 1.7% month-over-month in June to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 5.27 million (Briefing.com consensus 5.30 million) from an upwardly revised 5.36 million (from 5.34 million) in May. Total sales were 2.2% lower than the same period a year ago.The key takeaway from the report is that the drop in mortgage rates has failed to spur a meaningful pickup in existing home sales, which continue to be constrained by the lack of available supply at lower price points.The FHFA Housing Price Index for May increased 0.1% after advancing 0.4% in June.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive New Home Sales for June and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +24.4% YTDS&amp;P 500 +19.9% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +17.2% YTDRussell 2000 +15.3% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1920/969. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1717/1330.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-348645510</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN0-J2W1-JC8H-K3YG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2221\"/><timeReceived>9:15 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc.

The small-cap Russell 2000 underperformed with a 1.5% decline.</p><p>Ten of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors closed lower, but the health care (-1.1%) and information technology (-1.2%) sectors were the only sectors to decline more than 1.0%. Note, the tech sector was down as much as 2.7% intraday, while the consumer discretionary sector gained 0.3% as shares of Amazon (AMZN 3008.91, +22.36, +0.8%) recovered an early 3.3% decline.</p><p>Intel (INTC 50.59, -9.81, -16.2%) did very little recovering, with shares falling 16% after the company announced a six-month delay in its next-generation 7nm chip technology. While disappointing for Intel investors, the news was welcomed by investors of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 69.40, +9.83, +16.5%).</p><p>Other negative factors today included China ordering the U.S. to close its consulate in Chengdu in response to the U.S. ordering China to close its consulate in Houston and a delay in the Republican coronavirus relief bill until next week.</p><p>On a more positive note, new home sales surged 13.8% m/m in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 776,000 (Briefing.com consensus 680,000).

The 2-yr yield declined one basis point to 0.14%, and the 10-yr yield was flat at 0.58%. Gold futures rose 0.4% to $1897.50/ozt -- its highest settlement price ever amid continued weakness in the U.S. Dollar Index (94.39, -0.30, -0.3%). WTI crude futures settled little changed at $41.08/bbl.</p><p>Reviewing Friday's economic data:</p><p>New home sales surged 13.8% m/m in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 776,000 (Briefing.com consensus 680,000). That was the strongest pace of sales since July 2007 and higher than the pre-pandemic pace of 774,000 seen in January. On a yr/yr basis, new home sales were up 13.7%.The key takeaway from the report is that sales activity in the new home market is quite healthy given the tight supply of existing homes for sale, low mortgage rates, pent-up demand, and an emerging, coronavirus-driven shift by city dwellers to suburban settings.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive Durable Goods Orders for June on Monday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +15.5% YTDS&amp;P 500 -0.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -7.3% YTDRussell 2000 -12.0% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 992/1937. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 868/2356.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-368498915</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FN-SV41-JC8H-K05F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1981\"/><timeReceived>9:47 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Briefing.com, Inc.

The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.6%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.9%. The small-cap Russell 2000 underperformed with a 1.5% decline.</p><p>Ten of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors closed lower, but the health care (-1.1%) and information technology (-1.2%) sectors were the only sectors to decline more than 1.0%. Note, the tech sector was down as much as 2.7% intraday, while the consumer discretionary sector gained 0.3% as shares of Amazon (AMZN 3008.91, +22.36, +0.8%) recovered an early 3.3% decline.</p><p>Intel (INTC 50.59, -9.81, -16.2%) did very little recovering, with shares falling 16% after the company announced a six-month delay in its next-generation 7nm chip technology. While disappointing for Intel investors, the news was welcomed by investors of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 69.40, +9.83, +16.5%).</p><p>Other negative factors today included China ordering the U.S. to close its consulate in Chengdu in response to the U.S. ordering China to close its consulate in Houston and a delay in the Republican coronavirus relief bill until next week.</p><p>On a more positive note, new home sales surged 13.8% m/m in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 776,000 (Briefing.com consensus 680,000). That was the strongest pace of sales since July 2007 and higher than the pre-pandemic pace of 774,000 seen in January.</p><p>In other corporate news, Goldman Sachs (GS 201.47, -1.66, -0.8%) settled its 1MDB case for $3.9 billion, Verizon (VZ 56.85, +1.00, +1.8%) beat top and bottom-line estimates, American Express (AXP 95.33, -1.34, -1.4%) reported mixed quarterly results, and Walt Disney (DIS 117.61, -0.51, -0.4%) reportedly delayed several blockbuster movies by a year.</p><p>U.S. Treasuries finished little changed. The 2-yr yield declined one basis point to 0.14%, and the 10-yr yield was flat at 0.58%. Gold futures rose 0.4% to $1897.50/ozt -- its highest settlement price ever amid continued weakness in the U.S. Dollar Index (94.39, -0.30, -0.3%). WTI crude futures settled little changed at $41.08/bbl.</p><p>Reviewing Friday's economic data:</p><p>New home sales surged 13.8% m/m in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 776,000 (Briefing.com consensus 680,000). That was the strongest pace of sales since July 2007 and higher than the pre-pandemic pace of 774,000 seen in January. On a yr/yr basis, new home sales were up 13.7%.The key takeaway from the report is that sales activity in the new home market is quite healthy given the tight supply of existing homes for sale, low mortgage rates, pent-up demand, and an emerging, coronavirus-driven shift by city dwellers to suburban settings.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive Durable Goods Orders for June on Monday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +15.5% YTDS&amp;P 500 -0.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -7.3% YTDRussell 2000 -12.0% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 992/1937. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 868/2356.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-368498710</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FN-SV41-JC8H-K05D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1906\"/><timeReceived>9:42 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Briefing.com, Inc.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%), Nasdaq Composite (+0.6%), and Russell 2000 (+0.7%) advanced in-line with the benchmark index.</p><p>It had been a tight-ranged session for a good part of the day despite positive earnings results and guidance from a diversified group of companies like Coca-Cola (KO 54.33, +3.11, +6.1%), United Technologies (UTX 134.94, +1.99, +1.5%), Sherwin-Williams (SHW 490.23, +35.64, +7.8%), and Biogen (BIIB 243.88, +11.40, +4.9%). Travelers (TRV 147.50, -2.21, -1.5%), however, did come up short of expectations.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, a positive trade headline helped energize the slow-moving market. Bloomberg reported that USTR Lighthizer and other senior officials will head to China next week to continue trade talks from Monday to Wednesday. Although this possibility had been reported earlier and many high-level talks in the past have yielded little progress, the good mood in the market flowing from earnings seemed to sway the market.</p><p>The news pushed the S&amp;P 500 back above the 3000 level, where it would stay above on a closing basis. Ten of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors finished higher, led by the trade-sensitive materials (+2.0%) and industrials (+1.2%) sectors. The utilities sector was the lone holdout, finishing lower by 0.6%.</p><p>Qualcomm (QCOM 74.12, -1.83, -2.4%) was also left out of the advance after The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple (AAPL 208.84, +1.62, +0.8%) is considering buying Intel's (INTC 51.75, +0.40, +0.8%) smartphone-modem chip business for around $1 billion. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index finished up 1.2%.</p><p>Separately, Congress reached a deal to increase the budget deficit and suspend the debt ceiling for two years. The news provided some relief for investors, but market reaction was mostly muted as the dilemma never appeared to hinder the market beforehand and it was reported yesterday that a deal was close.</p><p>U.S. Treasuries finished on a lower note, pushing yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.83%, and the 10-yr yield increased three basis points to 2.07%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.5% to 97.74, helped by some weakness in the euro. WTI crude rose 0.9% to $56.72/bbl.</p><p>Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included Existing Home Sales for June and the FHFA Housing Market Index for May:</p><p>Existing home sales decreased 1.7% month-over-month in June to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 5.27 million (Briefing.com consensus 5.30 million) from an upwardly revised 5.36 million (from 5.34 million) in May. Total sales were 2.2% lower than the same period a year ago.The key takeaway from the report is that the drop in mortgage rates has failed to spur a meaningful pickup in existing home sales, which continue to be constrained by the lack of available supply at lower price points.The FHFA Housing Price Index for May increased 0.1% after advancing 0.4% in June.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive New Home Sales for June and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +24.4% YTDS&amp;P 500 +19.9% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +17.2% YTDRussell 2000 +15.3% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1920/969. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1717/1330.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-348649119</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN0-J2W1-JC8H-K3YK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2497\"/><timeReceived>10:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%), Nasdaq Composite (+0.6%), and Russell 2000 (+0.7%) advanced in-line with the benchmark index.</p><p>It had been a tight-ranged session for a good part of the day despite positive earnings results and guidance from a diversified group of companies like Coca-Cola (KO 54.33, +3.11, +6.1%), United Technologies (UTX 134.94, +1.99, +1.5%), Sherwin-Williams (SHW 490.23, +35.64, +7.8%), and Biogen (BIIB 243.88, +11.40, +4.9%). Travelers (TRV 147.50, -2.21, -1.5%), however, did come up short of expectations.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, a positive trade headline helped energize the slow-moving market. Bloomberg reported that USTR Lighthizer and other senior officials will head to China next week to continue trade talks from Monday to Wednesday. Although this possibility had been reported earlier and many high-level talks in the past have yielded little progress, the good mood in the market flowing from earnings seemed to sway the market.</p><p>The news pushed the S&amp;P 500 back above the 3000 level, where it would stay above on a closing basis. Ten of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors finished higher, led by the trade-sensitive materials (+2.0%) and industrials (+1.2%) sectors. The utilities sector was the lone holdout, finishing lower by 0.6%.</p><p>Qualcomm (QCOM 74.12, -1.83, -2.4%) was also left out of the advance after The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple (AAPL 208.84, +1.62, +0.8%) is considering buying Intel's (INTC 51.75, +0.40, +0.8%) smartphone-modem chip business for around $1 billion. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index finished up 1.2%.</p><p>Separately, Congress reached a deal to increase the budget deficit and suspend the debt ceiling for two years. The news provided some relief for investors, but market reaction was mostly muted as the dilemma never appeared to hinder the market beforehand and it was reported yesterday that a deal was close.</p><p>U.S. Treasuries finished on a lower note, pushing yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.83%, and the 10-yr yield increased three basis points to 2.07%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.5% to 97.74, helped by some weakness in the euro. WTI crude rose 0.9% to $56.72/bbl.</p><p>Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included Existing Home Sales for June and the FHFA Housing Market Index for May:</p><p>Existing home sales decreased 1.7% month-over-month in June to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 5.27 million (Briefing.com consensus 5.30 million) from an upwardly revised 5.36 million (from 5.34 million) in May. Total sales were 2.2% lower than the same period a year ago.The key takeaway from the report is that the drop in mortgage rates has failed to spur a meaningful pickup in existing home sales, which continue to be constrained by the lack of available supply at lower price points.The FHFA Housing Price Index for May increased 0.1% after advancing 0.4% in June.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive New Home Sales for June and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +24.4% YTDS&amp;P 500 +19.9% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +17.2% YTDRussell 2000 +15.3% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1920/969. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1717/1330.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-348648290</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN0-J2W1-JC8H-K3YH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2409\"/><timeReceived>9:50 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%), Nasdaq Composite (+0.6%), and Russell 2000 (+0.7%) advanced in-line with the benchmark index.</p><p>It had been a tight-ranged session for a good part of the day despite positive earnings results and guidance from a diversified group of companies like Coca-Cola (KO 54.33, +3.11, +6.1%), United Technologies (UTX 134.94, +1.99, +1.5%), Sherwin-Williams (SHW 490.23, +35.64, +7.8%), and Biogen (BIIB 243.88, +11.40, +4.9%). Travelers (TRV 147.50, -2.21, -1.5%), however, did come up short of expectations.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, a positive trade headline helped energize the slow-moving market. Bloomberg reported that USTR Lighthizer and other senior officials will head to China next week to continue trade talks from Monday to Wednesday. Although this possibility had been reported earlier and many high-level talks in the past have yielded little progress, the good mood in the market flowing from earnings seemed to sway the market.</p><p>The news pushed the S&amp;P 500 back above the 3000 level, where it would stay above on a closing basis. Ten of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors finished higher, led by the trade-sensitive materials (+2.0%) and industrials (+1.2%) sectors. The utilities sector was the lone holdout, finishing lower by 0.6%.</p><p>Qualcomm (QCOM 74.12, -1.83, -2.4%) was also left out of the advance after The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple (AAPL 208.84, +1.62, +0.8%) is considering buying Intel's (INTC 51.75, +0.40, +0.8%) smartphone-modem chip business for around $1 billion. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index finished up 1.2%.</p><p>Separately, Congress reached a deal to increase the budget deficit and suspend the debt ceiling for two years. The news provided some relief for investors, but market reaction was mostly muted as the dilemma never appeared to hinder the market beforehand and it was reported yesterday that a deal was close.</p><p>U.S. Treasuries finished on a lower note, pushing yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.83%, and the 10-yr yield increased three basis points to 2.07%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.5% to 97.74, helped by some weakness in the euro. WTI crude rose 0.9% to $56.72/bbl.</p><p>Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included Existing Home Sales for June and the FHFA Housing Market Index for May:</p><p>Existing home sales decreased 1.7% month-over-month in June to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 5.27 million (Briefing.com consensus 5.30 million) from an upwardly revised 5.36 million (from 5.34 million) in May. Total sales were 2.2% lower than the same period a year ago.The key takeaway from the report is that the drop in mortgage rates has failed to spur a meaningful pickup in existing home sales, which continue to be constrained by the lack of available supply at lower price points.The FHFA Housing Price Index for May increased 0.1% after advancing 0.4% in June.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive New Home Sales for June and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +24.4% YTDS&amp;P 500 +19.9% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +17.2% YTDRussell 2000 +15.3% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1920/969. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1717/1330.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-348648682</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN0-J2W1-JC8H-K3YJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2488\"/><timeReceived>9:55 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc.

The small-cap Russell 2000 underperformed with a 1.5% decline.</p><p>Ten of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors closed lower, but the health care (-1.1%) and information technology (-1.2%) sectors were the only sectors to decline more than 1.0%. Note, the tech sector was down as much as 2.7% intraday, while the consumer discretionary sector gained 0.3% as shares of Amazon (AMZN 3008.91, +22.36, +0.8%) recovered an early 3.3% decline.</p><p>Intel (INTC 50.59, -9.81, -16.2%) did very little recovering, with shares falling 16% after the company announced a six-month delay in its next-generation 7nm chip technology.

That was the strongest pace of sales since July 2007 and higher than the pre-pandemic pace of 774,000 seen in January. On a yr/yr basis, new home sales were up 13.7%.The key takeaway from the report is that sales activity in the new home market is quite healthy given the tight supply of existing homes for sale, low mortgage rates, pent-up demand, and an emerging, coronavirus-driven shift by city dwellers to suburban settings.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive Durable Goods Orders for June on Monday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +15.5% YTDS&amp;P 500 -0.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -7.3% YTDRussell 2000 -12.0% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 992/1937. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 868/2356.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-368499950</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FN-SV41-JC8H-K05G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2094\"/><timeReceived>10:02 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Briefing.com, Inc.

On a yr/yr basis, new home sales were up 13.7%.The key takeaway from the report is that sales activity in the new home market is quite healthy given the tight supply of existing homes for sale, low mortgage rates, pent-up demand, and an emerging, coronavirus-driven shift by city dwellers to suburban settings.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive Durable Goods Orders for June on Monday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +15.5% YTDS&amp;P 500 -0.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -7.3% YTDRussell 2000 -12.0% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 992/1937. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 868/2356.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-368500679</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FN-SV41-JC8H-K05H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2097\"/><timeReceived>10:17 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Briefing.com, Inc.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%), Nasdaq Composite (+0.6%), and Russell 2000 (+0.7%) advanced in-line with the benchmark index.</p><p>It had been a tight-ranged session for a good part of the day despite positive earnings results and guidance from a diversified group of companies like Coca-Cola (KO 54.33, +3.11, +6.1%), United Technologies (UTX 134.94, +1.99, +1.5%), Sherwin-Williams (SHW 490.23, +35.64, +7.8%), and Biogen (BIIB 243.88, +11.40, +4.9%). Travelers (TRV 147.50, -2.21, -1.5%), however, did come up short of expectations.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, a positive trade headline helped energize the slow-moving market. Bloomberg reported that USTR Lighthizer and other senior officials will head to China next week to continue trade talks from Monday to Wednesday. Although this possibility had been reported earlier and many high-level talks in the past have yielded little progress, the good mood in the market flowing from earnings seemed to sway the market.</p><p>The news pushed the S&amp;P 500 back above the 3000 level, where it would stay above on a closing basis. Ten of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors finished higher, led by the trade-sensitive materials (+2.0%) and industrials (+1.2%) sectors. The utilities sector was the lone holdout, finishing lower by 0.6%.</p><p>Qualcomm (QCOM 74.12, -1.83, -2.4%) was also left out of the advance after The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple (AAPL 208.84, +1.62, +0.8%) is considering buying Intel's (INTC 51.75, +0.40, +0.8%) smartphone-modem chip business for around $1 billion. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index finished up 1.2%.</p><p>Separately, Congress reached a deal to increase the budget deficit and suspend the debt ceiling for two years. The news provided some relief for investors, but market reaction was mostly muted as the dilemma never appeared to hinder the market beforehand and it was reported yesterday that a deal was close.</p><p>U.S. Treasuries finished on a lower note, pushing yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.83%, and the 10-yr yield increased three basis points to 2.07%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.5% to 97.74, helped by some weakness in the euro. WTI crude rose 0.9% to $56.72/bbl.</p><p>Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included Existing Home Sales for June and the FHFA Housing Market Index for May:</p><p>Existing home sales decreased 1.7% month-over-month in June to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 5.27 million (Briefing.com consensus 5.30 million) from an upwardly revised 5.36 million (from 5.34 million) in May. Total sales were 2.2% lower than the same period a year ago.The key takeaway from the report is that the drop in mortgage rates has failed to spur a meaningful pickup in existing home sales, which continue to be constrained by the lack of available supply at lower price points.The FHFA Housing Price Index for May increased 0.1% after advancing 0.4% in June.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive New Home Sales for June and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +24.4% YTDS&amp;P 500 +19.9% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +17.2% YTDRussell 2000 +15.3% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1920/969. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1717/1330.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-348649618</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN0-J2W1-JC8H-K3YM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2556\"/><timeReceived>10:05 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc.

The small-cap Russell 2000 underperformed with a 1.5% decline.</p><p>Ten of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors closed lower, but the health care (-1.1%) and information technology (-1.2%) sectors were the only sectors to decline more than 1.0%. Note, the tech sector was down as much as 2.7% intraday, while the consumer discretionary sector gained 0.3% as shares of Amazon (AMZN 3008.91, +22.36, +0.8%) recovered an early 3.3% decline.</p><p>Intel (INTC 50.59, -9.81, -16.2%) did very little recovering, with shares falling 16% after the company announced a six-month delay in its next-generation 7nm chip technology.

That was the strongest pace of sales since July 2007 and higher than the pre-pandemic pace of 774,000 seen in January. On a yr/yr basis, new home sales were up 13.7%.The key takeaway from the report is that sales activity in the new home market is quite healthy given the tight supply of existing homes for sale, low mortgage rates, pent-up demand, and an emerging, coronavirus-driven shift by city dwellers to suburban settings.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive Durable Goods Orders for June on Monday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +15.5% YTDS&amp;P 500 -0.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -7.3% YTDRussell 2000 -12.0% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 992/1937. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 868/2356.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-368500929</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FN-SV41-JC8H-K05J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2190\"/><timeReceived>10:26 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Briefing.com, Inc.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%), Nasdaq Composite (+0.6%), and Russell 2000 (+0.7%) advanced in-line with the benchmark index.</p><p>It had been a tight-ranged session for a good part of the day despite positive earnings results and guidance from a diversified group of companies like Coca-Cola (KO 54.33, +3.11, +6.1%), United Technologies (UTX 134.94, +1.99, +1.5%), Sherwin-Williams (SHW 490.23, +35.64, +7.8%), and Biogen (BIIB 243.88, +11.40, +4.9%). Travelers (TRV 147.50, -2.21, -1.5%), however, did come up short of expectations.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, a positive trade headline helped energize the slow-moving market. Bloomberg reported that USTR Lighthizer and other senior officials will head to China next week to continue trade talks from Monday to Wednesday. Although this possibility had been reported earlier and many high-level talks in the past have yielded little progress, the good mood in the market flowing from earnings seemed to sway the market.</p><p>The news pushed the S&amp;P 500 back above the 3000 level, where it would stay above on a closing basis. Ten of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors finished higher, led by the trade-sensitive materials (+2.0%) and industrials (+1.2%) sectors. The utilities sector was the lone holdout, finishing lower by 0.6%.</p><p>Qualcomm (QCOM 74.12, -1.83, -2.4%) was also left out of the advance after The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple (AAPL 208.84, +1.62, +0.8%) is considering buying Intel's (INTC 51.75, +0.40, +0.8%) smartphone-modem chip business for around $1 billion. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index finished up 1.2%.</p><p>Separately, Congress reached a deal to increase the budget deficit and suspend the debt ceiling for two years. The news provided some relief for investors, but market reaction was mostly muted as the dilemma never appeared to hinder the market beforehand and it was reported yesterday that a deal was close.</p><p>U.S. Treasuries finished on a lower note, pushing yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.83%, and the 10-yr yield increased three basis points to 2.07%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.5% to 97.74, helped by some weakness in the euro. WTI crude rose 0.9% to $56.72/bbl.</p><p>Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included Existing Home Sales for June and the FHFA Housing Market Index for May:</p><p>Existing home sales decreased 1.7% month-over-month in June to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 5.27 million (Briefing.com consensus 5.30 million) from an upwardly revised 5.36 million (from 5.34 million) in May. Total sales were 2.2% lower than the same period a year ago.The key takeaway from the report is that the drop in mortgage rates has failed to spur a meaningful pickup in existing home sales, which continue to be constrained by the lack of available supply at lower price points.The FHFA Housing Price Index for May increased 0.1% after advancing 0.4% in June.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive New Home Sales for June and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +24.4% YTDS&amp;P 500 +19.9% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +17.2% YTDRussell 2000 +15.3% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1920/969. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1717/1330.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-348652972</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN0-J2W1-JC8H-K3YN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2742\"/><timeReceived>10:45 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc.

The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.6%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.9%. The small-cap Russell 2000 underperformed with a 1.5% decline.</p><p>Ten of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors closed lower, but the health care (-1.1%) and information technology (-1.2%) sectors were the only sectors to decline more than 1.0%. Note, the tech sector was down as much as 2.7% intraday, while the consumer discretionary sector gained 0.3% as shares of Amazon (AMZN 3008.91, +22.36, +0.8%) recovered an early 3.3% decline.</p><p>Intel (INTC 50.59, -9.81, -16.2%) did very little recovering, with shares falling 16% after the company announced a six-month delay in its next-generation 7nm chip technology. While disappointing for Intel investors, the news was welcomed by investors of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 69.40, +9.83, +16.5%).</p><p>Other negative factors today included China ordering the U.S. to close its consulate in Chengdu in response to the U.S. ordering China to close its consulate in Houston and a delay in the Republican coronavirus relief bill until next week.</p><p>On a more positive note, new home sales surged 13.8% m/m in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 776,000 (Briefing.com consensus 680,000). That was the strongest pace of sales since July 2007 and higher than the pre-pandemic pace of 774,000 seen in January.</p><p>In other corporate news, Goldman Sachs (GS 201.47, -1.66, -0.8%) settled its 1MDB case for $3.9 billion, Verizon (VZ 56.85, +1.00, +1.8%) beat top and bottom-line estimates, American Express (AXP 95.33, -1.34, -1.4%) reported mixed quarterly results, and Walt Disney (DIS 117.61, -0.51, -0.4%) reportedly delayed several blockbuster movies by a year.</p><p>U.S. Treasuries finished little changed. The 2-yr yield declined one basis point to 0.14%, and the 10-yr yield was flat at 0.58%. Gold futures rose 0.4% to $1897.50/ozt -- its highest settlement price ever amid continued weakness in the U.S. Dollar Index (94.39, -0.30, -0.3%). WTI crude futures settled little changed at $41.08/bbl.</p><p>Reviewing Friday's economic data:</p><p>New home sales surged 13.8% m/m in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 776,000 (Briefing.com consensus 680,000). That was the strongest pace of sales since July 2007 and higher than the pre-pandemic pace of 774,000 seen in January. On a yr/yr basis, new home sales were up 13.7%.The key takeaway from the report is that sales activity in the new home market is quite healthy given the tight supply of existing homes for sale, low mortgage rates, pent-up demand, and an emerging, coronavirus-driven shift by city dwellers to suburban settings.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive Durable Goods Orders for June on Monday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +15.5% YTDS&amp;P 500 -0.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -7.3% YTDRussell 2000 -12.0% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 992/1937. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 868/2356.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-368501979</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FN-SV41-JC8H-K05N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2312\"/><timeReceived>11:17 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Briefing.com, Inc.

The small-cap Russell 2000 underperformed with a 1.5% decline.</p><p>Ten of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors closed lower, but the health care (-1.1%) and information technology (-1.2%) sectors were the only sectors to decline more than 1.0%. Note, the tech sector was down as much as 2.7% intraday, while the consumer discretionary sector gained 0.3% as shares of Amazon (AMZN 3008.91, +22.36, +0.8%) recovered an early 3.3% decline.</p><p>Intel (INTC 50.59, -9.81, -16.2%) did very little recovering, with shares falling 16% after the company announced a six-month delay in its next-generation 7nm chip technology. While disappointing for Intel investors, the news was welcomed by investors of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 69.40, +9.83, +16.5%).</p><p>Other negative factors today included China ordering the U.S. to close its consulate in Chengdu in response to the U.S. ordering China to close its consulate in Houston and a delay in the Republican coronavirus relief bill until next week.</p><p>On a more positive note, new home sales surged 13.8% m/m in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 776,000 (Briefing.com consensus 680,000).

That was the strongest pace of sales since July 2007 and higher than the pre-pandemic pace of 774,000 seen in January. On a yr/yr basis, new home sales were up 13.7%.The key takeaway from the report is that sales activity in the new home market is quite healthy given the tight supply of existing homes for sale, low mortgage rates, pent-up demand, and an emerging, coronavirus-driven shift by city dwellers to suburban settings.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive Durable Goods Orders for June on Monday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +15.5% YTDS&amp;P 500 -0.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -7.3% YTDRussell 2000 -12.0% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 992/1937. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 868/2356.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-368501466</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FN-SV41-JC8H-K05K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2306\"/><timeReceived>10:56 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Briefing.com, Inc.

Bloomberg reported that USTR Lighthizer and other senior officials will head to China next week to continue trade talks from Monday to Wednesday.

The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.83%, and the 10-yr yield increased three basis points to 2.07%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.5% to 97.74, helped by some weakness in the euro.

Total sales were 2.2% lower than the same period a year ago.The key takeaway from the report is that the drop in mortgage rates has failed to spur a meaningful pickup in existing home sales, which continue to be constrained by the lack of available supply at lower price points.The FHFA Housing Price Index for May increased 0.1% after advancing 0.4% in June.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive New Home Sales for June and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +24.4% YTDS&amp;P 500 +19.9% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +17.2% YTDRussell 2000 +15.3% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1920/969. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1717/1330.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-348654189</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN0-J2W1-JC8H-K3YP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2895\"/><timeReceived>11:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc.

The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.6%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.9%. The small-cap Russell 2000 underperformed with a 1.5% decline.</p><p>Ten of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors closed lower, but the health care (-1.1%) and information technology (-1.2%) sectors were the only sectors to decline more than 1.0%. Note, the tech sector was down as much as 2.7% intraday, while the consumer discretionary sector gained 0.3% as shares of Amazon (AMZN 3008.91, +22.36, +0.8%) recovered an early 3.3% decline.</p><p>Intel (INTC 50.59, -9.81, -16.2%) did very little recovering, with shares falling 16% after the company announced a six-month delay in its next-generation 7nm chip technology. While disappointing for Intel investors, the news was welcomed by investors of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 69.40, +9.83, +16.5%).</p><p>Other negative factors today included China ordering the U.S. to close its consulate in Chengdu in response to the U.S. ordering China to close its consulate in Houston and a delay in the Republican coronavirus relief bill until next week.</p><p>On a more positive note, new home sales surged 13.8% m/m in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 776,000 (Briefing.com consensus 680,000).

The 2-yr yield declined one basis point to 0.14%, and the 10-yr yield was flat at 0.58%. Gold futures rose 0.4% to $1897.50/ozt -- its highest settlement price ever amid continued weakness in the U.S. Dollar Index (94.39, -0.30, -0.3%).

That was the strongest pace of sales since July 2007 and higher than the pre-pandemic pace of 774,000 seen in January. On a yr/yr basis, new home sales were up 13.7%.The key takeaway from the report is that sales activity in the new home market is quite healthy given the tight supply of existing homes for sale, low mortgage rates, pent-up demand, and an emerging, coronavirus-driven shift by city dwellers to suburban settings.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive Durable Goods Orders for June on Monday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +15.5% YTDS&amp;P 500 -0.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -7.3% YTDRussell 2000 -12.0% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 992/1937. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 868/2356.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-368502203</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FN-SV41-JC8H-K05P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2440\"/><timeReceived>11:27 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Briefing.com, Inc.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%), Nasdaq Composite (+0.6%), and Russell 2000 (+0.7%) advanced in-line with the benchmark index.</p><p>It had been a tight-ranged session for a good part of the day despite positive earnings results and guidance from a diversified group of companies like Coca-Cola (KO 54.33, +3.11, +6.1%), United Technologies (UTX 134.94, +1.99, +1.5%), Sherwin-Williams (SHW 490.23, +35.64, +7.8%), and Biogen (BIIB 243.88, +11.40, +4.9%). Travelers (TRV 147.50, -2.21, -1.5%), however, did come up short of expectations.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, a positive trade headline helped energize the slow-moving market. Bloomberg reported that USTR Lighthizer and other senior officials will head to China next week to continue trade talks from Monday to Wednesday. Although this possibility had been reported earlier and many high-level talks in the past have yielded little progress, the good mood in the market flowing from earnings seemed to sway the market.</p><p>The news pushed the S&amp;P 500 back above the 3000 level, where it would stay above on a closing basis. Ten of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors finished higher, led by the trade-sensitive materials (+2.0%) and industrials (+1.2%) sectors. The utilities sector was the lone holdout, finishing lower by 0.6%.</p><p>Qualcomm (QCOM 74.12, -1.83, -2.4%) was also left out of the advance after The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple (AAPL 208.84, +1.62, +0.8%) is considering buying Intel's (INTC 51.75, +0.40, +0.8%) smartphone-modem chip business for around $1 billion. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index finished up 1.2%.</p><p>Separately, Congress reached a deal to increase the budget deficit and suspend the debt ceiling for two years. The news provided some relief for investors, but market reaction was mostly muted as the dilemma never appeared to hinder the market beforehand and it was reported yesterday that a deal was close.</p><p>U.S. Treasuries finished on a lower note, pushing yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.83%, and the 10-yr yield increased three basis points to 2.07%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.5% to 97.74, helped by some weakness in the euro. WTI crude rose 0.9% to $56.72/bbl.</p><p>Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included Existing Home Sales for June and the FHFA Housing Market Index for May:</p><p>Existing home sales decreased 1.7% month-over-month in June to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 5.27 million (Briefing.com consensus 5.30 million) from an upwardly revised 5.36 million (from 5.34 million) in May. Total sales were 2.2% lower than the same period a year ago.The key takeaway from the report is that the drop in mortgage rates has failed to spur a meaningful pickup in existing home sales, which continue to be constrained by the lack of available supply at lower price points.The FHFA Housing Price Index for May increased 0.1% after advancing 0.4% in June.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive New Home Sales for June and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +24.4% YTDS&amp;P 500 +19.9% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +17.2% YTDRussell 2000 +15.3% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1920/969. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1717/1330.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-348656953</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN0-J2W1-JC8H-K3YR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3048\"/><timeReceived>11:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc.

The small-cap Russell 2000 underperformed with a 1.5% decline.</p><p>Ten of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors closed lower, but the health care (-1.1%) and information technology (-1.2%) sectors were the only sectors to decline more than 1.0%. Note, the tech sector was down as much as 2.7% intraday, while the consumer discretionary sector gained 0.3% as shares of Amazon (AMZN 3008.91, +22.36, +0.8%) recovered an early 3.3% decline.</p><p>Intel (INTC 50.59, -9.81, -16.2%) did very little recovering, with shares falling 16% after the company announced a six-month delay in its next-generation 7nm chip technology. While disappointing for Intel investors, the news was welcomed by investors of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 69.40, +9.83, +16.5%).</p><p>Other negative factors today included China ordering the U.S. to close its consulate in Chengdu in response to the U.S. ordering China to close its consulate in Houston and a delay in the Republican coronavirus relief bill until next week.</p><p>On a more positive note, new home sales surged 13.8% m/m in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 776,000 (Briefing.com consensus 680,000).

The 2-yr yield declined one basis point to 0.14%, and the 10-yr yield was flat at 0.58%. Gold futures rose 0.4% to $1897.50/ozt -- its highest settlement price ever amid continued weakness in the U.S. Dollar Index (94.39, -0.30, -0.3%). WTI crude futures settled little changed at $41.08/bbl.</p><p>Reviewing Friday's economic data:</p><p>New home sales surged 13.8% m/m in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 776,000 (Briefing.com consensus 680,000). That was the strongest pace of sales since July 2007 and higher than the pre-pandemic pace of 774,000 seen in January. On a yr/yr basis, new home sales were up 13.7%.The key takeaway from the report is that sales activity in the new home market is quite healthy given the tight supply of existing homes for sale, low mortgage rates, pent-up demand, and an emerging, coronavirus-driven shift by city dwellers to suburban settings.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive Durable Goods Orders for June on Monday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +15.5% YTDS&amp;P 500 -0.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -7.3% YTDRussell 2000 -12.0% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 992/1937. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 868/2356.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-368502669</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FN-SV41-JC8H-K05R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2549\"/><timeReceived>11:57 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Briefing.com, Inc.

That move has been instrumental in lending support to the broader market.</p><p>One can sense, however, that selling activity in the broader market might pick up some steam if the semiconductor shares start to roll over, so this will be a closely-watched area as the day progresses.</p><p>Overall, there aren't any standout moves from a sector standpoint. Six sectors are up, and five sectors are down, with the performance range spanning -0.5% (health care) to +0.3% (energy).</p><p>Separately, Treasuries continue to hold modest gains, with yields down one to three basis points in maturities ranging from the 2-yr note to the 30-yr bond.</p><p>11:25 ET</p><p>Dow -129.99 at 27219.2, Nasdaq +7.03 at 8258.44, S&amp;P -1.62 at 3003.85</p><p>[BRIEFING.COM] It's currently a mixed market with six S&amp;P 500 sectors trading lower and five sectors trading higher.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%), Nasdaq Composite (+0.6%), and Russell 2000 (+0.7%) advanced in-line with the benchmark index.</p><p>It had been a tight-ranged session for a good part of the day despite positive earnings results and guidance from a diversified group of companies like Coca-Cola (KO 54.33, +3.11, +6.1%), United Technologies (UTX 134.94, +1.99, +1.5%), Sherwin-Williams (SHW 490.23, +35.64, +7.8%), and Biogen (BIIB 243.88, +11.40, +4.9%). Travelers (TRV 147.50, -2.21, -1.5%), however, did come up short of expectations.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, a positive trade headline helped energize the slow-moving market. Bloomberg reported that USTR Lighthizer and other senior officials will head to China next week to continue trade talks from Monday to Wednesday. Although this possibility had been reported earlier and many high-level talks in the past have yielded little progress, the good mood in the market flowing from earnings seemed to sway the market.</p><p>The news pushed the S&amp;P 500 back above the 3000 level, where it would stay above on a closing basis. Ten of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors finished higher, led by the trade-sensitive materials (+2.0%) and industrials (+1.2%) sectors. The utilities sector was the lone holdout, finishing lower by 0.6%.</p><p>Qualcomm (QCOM 74.12, -1.83, -2.4%) was also left out of the advance after The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple (AAPL 208.84, +1.62, +0.8%) is considering buying Intel's (INTC 51.75, +0.40, +0.8%) smartphone-modem chip business for around $1 billion. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index finished up 1.2%.</p><p>Separately, Congress reached a deal to increase the budget deficit and suspend the debt ceiling for two years. The news provided some relief for investors, but market reaction was mostly muted as the dilemma never appeared to hinder the market beforehand and it was reported yesterday that a deal was close.</p><p>U.S. Treasuries finished on a lower note, pushing yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.83%, and the 10-yr yield increased three basis points to 2.07%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.5% to 97.74, helped by some weakness in the euro. WTI crude rose 0.9% to $56.72/bbl.</p><p>Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included Existing Home Sales for June and the FHFA Housing Market Index for May:</p><p>Existing home sales decreased 1.7% month-over-month in June to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 5.27 million (Briefing.com consensus 5.30 million) from an upwardly revised 5.36 million (from 5.34 million) in May. Total sales were 2.2% lower than the same period a year ago.The key takeaway from the report is that the drop in mortgage rates has failed to spur a meaningful pickup in existing home sales, which continue to be constrained by the lack of available supply at lower price points.The FHFA Housing Price Index for May increased 0.1% after advancing 0.4% in June.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive New Home Sales for June and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +24.4% YTDS&amp;P 500 +19.9% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +17.2% YTDRussell 2000 +15.3% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1920/969. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1717/1330.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-348659371</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN0-J2W1-JC8H-K3YT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3190\"/><timeReceived>12:10 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc.

While disappointing for Intel investors, the news was welcomed by investors of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 69.40, +9.83, +16.5%).</p><p>Other negative factors today included China ordering the U.S. to close its consulate in Chengdu in response to the U.S. ordering China to close its consulate in Houston and a delay in the Republican coronavirus relief bill until next week.</p><p>On a more positive note, new home sales surged 13.8% m/m in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 776,000 (Briefing.com consensus 680,000). That was the strongest pace of sales since July 2007 and higher than the pre-pandemic pace of 774,000 seen in January.</p><p>In other corporate news, Goldman Sachs (GS 201.47, -1.66, -0.8%) settled its 1MDB case for $3.9 billion, Verizon (VZ 56.85, +1.00, +1.8%) beat top and bottom-line estimates, American Express (AXP 95.33, -1.34, -1.4%) reported mixed quarterly results, and Walt Disney (DIS 117.61, -0.51, -0.4%) reportedly delayed several blockbuster movies by a year.</p><p>U.S. Treasuries finished little changed. The 2-yr yield declined one basis point to 0.14%, and the 10-yr yield was flat at 0.58%. Gold futures rose 0.4% to $1897.50/ozt -- its highest settlement price ever amid continued weakness in the U.S. Dollar Index (94.39, -0.30, -0.3%). WTI crude futures settled little changed at $41.08/bbl.</p><p>Reviewing Friday's economic data:</p><p>New home sales surged 13.8% m/m in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 776,000 (Briefing.com consensus 680,000). That was the strongest pace of sales since July 2007 and higher than the pre-pandemic pace of 774,000 seen in January. On a yr/yr basis, new home sales were up 13.7%.The key takeaway from the report is that sales activity in the new home market is quite healthy given the tight supply of existing homes for sale, low mortgage rates, pent-up demand, and an emerging, coronavirus-driven shift by city dwellers to suburban settings.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive Durable Goods Orders for June on Monday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +15.5% YTDS&amp;P 500 -0.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -7.3% YTDRussell 2000 -12.0% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 992/1937. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 868/2356.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-368503892</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FN-SV41-JC8H-K05S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2651\"/><timeReceived>12:32 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Briefing.com, Inc.

Travelers (TRV 147.50, -2.21, -1.5%), however, did come up short of expectations.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, a positive trade headline helped energize the slow-moving market. Bloomberg reported that USTR Lighthizer and other senior officials will head to China next week to continue trade talks from Monday to Wednesday. Although this possibility had been reported earlier and many high-level talks in the past have yielded little progress, the good mood in the market flowing from earnings seemed to sway the market.</p><p>The news pushed the S&amp;P 500 back above the 3000 level, where it would stay above on a closing basis. Ten of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors finished higher, led by the trade-sensitive materials (+2.0%) and industrials (+1.2%) sectors. The utilities sector was the lone holdout, finishing lower by 0.6%.</p><p>Qualcomm (QCOM 74.12, -1.83, -2.4%) was also left out of the advance after The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple (AAPL 208.84, +1.62, +0.8%) is considering buying Intel's (INTC 51.75, +0.40, +0.8%) smartphone-modem chip business for around $1 billion. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index finished up 1.2%.</p><p>Separately, Congress reached a deal to increase the budget deficit and suspend the debt ceiling for two years. The news provided some relief for investors, but market reaction was mostly muted as the dilemma never appeared to hinder the market beforehand and it was reported yesterday that a deal was close.</p><p>U.S. Treasuries finished on a lower note, pushing yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.83%, and the 10-yr yield increased three basis points to 2.07%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.5% to 97.74, helped by some weakness in the euro. WTI crude rose 0.9% to $56.72/bbl.</p><p>Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included Existing Home Sales for June and the FHFA Housing Market Index for May:</p><p>Existing home sales decreased 1.7% month-over-month in June to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 5.27 million (Briefing.com consensus 5.30 million) from an upwardly revised 5.36 million (from 5.34 million) in May. Total sales were 2.2% lower than the same period a year ago.The key takeaway from the report is that the drop in mortgage rates has failed to spur a meaningful pickup in existing home sales, which continue to be constrained by the lack of available supply at lower price points.The FHFA Housing Price Index for May increased 0.1% after advancing 0.4% in June.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive New Home Sales for June and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +24.4% YTDS&amp;P 500 +19.9% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +17.2% YTDRussell 2000 +15.3% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1920/969. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1717/1330.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-348660383</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN0-J2W1-JC8H-K3YV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3323\"/><timeReceived>12:30 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc.

Still, losses in five of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors, including consumer staples (-0.7%), have kept the broader market in check.</p><p>The market is also missing the influential leadership from some of its largest tech companies, which are currently holding modest losses after the Department of Justice announced an antitrust review into the \"market-leading online platforms.\"</p><p>Big-tech scrutiny is nothing new, but it does show legitimate efforts to oversee the influence of market leaders like Facebook (FB 201.40, -0.94, -0.5%), Amazon (AMZN 1991.50, -2.99, -0.2%), Alphabet (GOOG 1133.77, -12.44, -1.1%), and Apple (AAPL 208.13, -0.70, -0.3%).

UPS (UPS 114.00, +8.73, +8.3%) and Northrop Grumman (NOC 337.20, +13.22, +4.1%), however, have provided strong support for the sector after pleasing investors with their results.</p><p>Similarly, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is up 2.5%, rising on the back of solid results from Texas Instruments (TXN 127.99, +7.92, +6.6%).

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%), Nasdaq Composite (+0.6%), and Russell 2000 (+0.7%) advanced in-line with the benchmark index.</p><p>It had been a tight-ranged session for a good part of the day despite positive earnings results and guidance from a diversified group of companies like Coca-Cola (KO 54.33, +3.11, +6.1%), United Technologies (UTX 134.94, +1.99, +1.5%), Sherwin-Williams (SHW 490.23, +35.64, +7.8%), and Biogen (BIIB 243.88, +11.40, +4.9%). Travelers (TRV 147.50, -2.21, -1.5%), however, did come up short of expectations.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, a positive trade headline helped energize the slow-moving market. Bloomberg reported that USTR Lighthizer and other senior officials will head to China next week to continue trade talks from Monday to Wednesday. Although this possibility had been reported earlier and many high-level talks in the past have yielded little progress, the good mood in the market flowing from earnings seemed to sway the market.</p><p>The news pushed the S&amp;P 500 back above the 3000 level, where it would stay above on a closing basis. Ten of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors finished higher, led by the trade-sensitive materials (+2.0%) and industrials (+1.2%) sectors. The utilities sector was the lone holdout, finishing lower by 0.6%.</p><p>Qualcomm (QCOM 74.12, -1.83, -2.4%) was also left out of the advance after The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple (AAPL 208.84, +1.62, +0.8%) is considering buying Intel's (INTC 51.75, +0.40, +0.8%) smartphone-modem chip business for around $1 billion. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index finished up 1.2%.</p><p>Separately, Congress reached a deal to increase the budget deficit and suspend the debt ceiling for two years. The news provided some relief for investors, but market reaction was mostly muted as the dilemma never appeared to hinder the market beforehand and it was reported yesterday that a deal was close.</p><p>U.S. Treasuries finished on a lower note, pushing yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.83%, and the 10-yr yield increased three basis points to 2.07%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.5% to 97.74, helped by some weakness in the euro. WTI crude rose 0.9% to $56.72/bbl.</p><p>Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included Existing Home Sales for June and the FHFA Housing Market Index for May:</p><p>Existing home sales decreased 1.7% month-over-month in June to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 5.27 million (Briefing.com consensus 5.30 million) from an upwardly revised 5.36 million (from 5.34 million) in May. Total sales were 2.2% lower than the same period a year ago.The key takeaway from the report is that the drop in mortgage rates has failed to spur a meaningful pickup in existing home sales, which continue to be constrained by the lack of available supply at lower price points.The FHFA Housing Price Index for May increased 0.1% after advancing 0.4% in June.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive New Home Sales for June and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +24.4% YTDS&amp;P 500 +19.9% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +17.2% YTDRussell 2000 +15.3% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1920/969. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1717/1330.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-348661985</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN1-HMD1-JC8H-K18M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3798\"/><timeReceived>1:00 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc.

The major indices, led by a 2.3% gain in the Russell 2000, are all up at least 1.8% and trading at session highs.</p><p>Today's move began in earnest at the sound of the opening bell, as market participants reacted favorably to headlines that seemingly cooled down the temperature surrounding the trade dispute with China, and provided some cover to think the tariff on imported goods from Mexico could be averted, either due to a deal with the U.S. ahead of the June 10 deadline or a possible vote in Congress to forestall the action, according to the Washington Post.</p><p>In reality, the mood of the market had been lifted on Monday when the S&amp;P 500 exhibited some relative strength in the face of large losses suffered by Alphabet (GOOG 1051.22, +14.99, +1.5%), Facebook (FB 166.54, +2.39, +1.5%), Amazon.com (AMZN 1723.80, +31.11, +1.8%), and Apple (AAPL 178.68, +5.37, +3.1%), which fell prone to some regulatory angst on the part of investors.</p><p>Those mega-cap stocks have managed to bounce back some today on the belief that any investigation into their business practices is likely to be a drawn out one; moreover, there is some underlying hope that none of the companies would eventually be broken up by the government.</p><p>Their gains today have helped bolster the broader market, yet the buying interest has been widespread. The information technology (+2.6%), financials (+2.3%), industrials (+2.1%), and consumer discretionary (+2.1%) sectors are all up at least 2.0%. The only sectors not participating today are the defensive-oriented real estate (-1.1%) and utilities (-1.0%) sectors.</p><p>Some of the fallout for the latter two sectors hearkens back to the Treasury market, where yields have risen noticeably across the curve on a counter-trade rooted in the idea that Treasuries were primed for a pullback from a short-term overbought condition.</p><p>The 2-yr note yield has spiked seven basis points to 1.90% while the 10-yr note yield has jumped five basis points to 2.14%.</p><p>The losses in the Treasury market have unfolded despite some softening CPI data out of the eurozone and a 0.8% decline in U.S. factory orders for April.</p><p>The non-response in the Treasury market to otherwise disappointing economic data and some seemingly supportive remarks from Fed Chair Powell and Chicago Fed President Evans, both of whom are FOMC voters, underscores how the Treasury market is succumbing to the overbought perspective.</p><p>Neither Mr. Powell nor Mr. Evans promised a rate cut soon while speaking at a conference in Chicago, yet both paid heed to the risks of undershooting the 2.0% inflation target and the risks of the trade uncertainty, which has been construed by some today as a dovish policy leaning.</p><p>Separately, there was no mistaking the leaning in the analyst community with respect to Uber (UBER 42.17, +0.92, +2.2%). No fewer than 20 firms initiated coverage of the stock after its IPO, 16 of which had the equivalent of a Buy recommendation.</p><p>12:25 ET</p><p>Dow +403.11 at 25222.89, Nasdaq +141.44 at 7474.43, S&amp;P +42.97 at 2787.42</p><p>[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages hover near their recently established session highs. The Nasdaq (+1.9%) remains in the lead while the S&amp;P 500 (+1.6%) follows a bit behind. The Nasdaq's outperformance comes after the tech-heavy index displayed relative weakness on Monday.</p><p>Accordingly, the Nasdaq's outperformance has been supported by a 2.3% gain in the technology sector. The top-weighted group is today's best performer with chipmakers doing their part. The PHLX Semiconductor Index is up 3.0% with all 30 components trading in the green. NVIDIA (NVDA 140.84, +7.06, +5.3%) is up 5.3%, pacing the group's advance after recording eight consecutive losses.</p><p>Treasuries sit a bit above their morning lows with the 10-yr yield up five basis points at 2.14%.</p><p>11:55 ET</p><p>Dow +422.01 at 25241.79, Nasdaq +150.99 at 7483.98, S&amp;P +44.89 at 2789.34</p><p>[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to push higher with the S&amp;P 500 up 1.7%, the Nasdaq up 2.1%, and the Dow up 1.7%. Contributing to today's bullish bias are supportive comments from Fed Chair Powell and Chicago Fed President Evans, both of whom are FOMC voters.</p><p>Mr. Powell said that the Fed will act appropriately to sustain the economic expansion. Mr. Evans said the \"fundamentals\" of the economy remain in good footing and is open to a change in policy if necessary. There was no promise of a rate cut, but both did acknowledge concerns about low inflation.</p><p>Separately, shares of Box (BOX 16.61, -1.33) have dropped 7.4% after the company guided Q2 revenue below consensus and lowered its FY20 revenue below consensus. On a related note, the stock was downgraded to Hold from Buy at Canaccord Genuity with a price target of $16.</p><p>11:25 ET</p><p>Dow +419.65 at 25239.43, Nasdaq +137.40 at 7470.39, S&amp;P +41.50 at 2785.95</p><p>[BRIEFING.COM] The S&amp;P 500 currently trades near session highs with a gain of 1.5%. Most of the FAANG stocks that were indicated in potential antitrust probes yesterday have turned it around today.</p><p>Shares of Apple (AAPL 1748.91, +5.60) have bounced 3.2% after declining 1.0% yesterday. Amazon (AMZN 1715.83, +23.15, +1.4%) and Alphabet (GOOG 1046.54, +10.31, +1.0%) have recouped some of their losses, while Facebook (FB 163.74, -0.50, -0.3%) has succumbed to follow-through selling interest.</p><p>Separately, shares of Uber (UBER 41.84, +0.58) are up 1.6% after the stock was initiated with a Buy rating, or its equivalent thereof, by a host of firms.</p><p>10:55 ET</p><p>Dow +325.92 at 25145.7, Nasdaq +94.54 at 7427.53, S&amp;P +29.79 at 2774.24</p><p>[BRIEFING.COM] The S&amp;P 500 is up 1.1% and is flirting with its 200-day moving average (2775).</p><p>The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+2.3%) has been one of today's best-performing groups. Nearly all of its components are up and some have provided solid support for the S&amp;P 500 information technology sector (+1.9%).</p><p>Retail stocks, too, have shown some strength, evident by 2.3% gain in the SPDR S&amp;P Retail ETF (XRT 41.25, +0.95). Shares of Tiffany &amp; Co (TIF 92.93, +2.76, +3.2%) have given the group a boost after the stock initially traded lower by more than 4% in pre-market action.

The other eight S&amp;P 500 sectors finished higher, led by materials (+3.4%), to provide offsetting support.</p><p>Persisting concerns about trade and growth helped restrain buying conviction throughout the day. China blamed the U.S. for the setback in trade talks, which reinforced fears that a protracted trade war will squeeze global growth, and earnings, prospects. Global manufacturing PMI data, including in the U.S., revealed slower or flat growth in May.</p><p>On a related note, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard (FOMC Voter) said that slower economic growth could be sharper-than-expected due to the trade uncertainty. Mr. Bullard added that a rate cut may soon be warranted to boost inflation.</p><p>Growing expectations for a rate cut, and general growth concerns, helped send the 2-yr yield down 12 basis points to 1.83%.

Travelers (TRV 147.50, -2.21, -1.5%), however, did come up short of expectations.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, a positive trade headline helped energize the slow-moving market. Bloomberg reported that USTR Lighthizer and other senior officials will head to China next week to continue trade talks from Monday to Wednesday. Although this possibility had been reported earlier and many high-level talks in the past have yielded little progress, the good mood in the market flowing from earnings seemed to sway the market.</p><p>The news pushed the S&amp;P 500 back above the 3000 level, where it would stay above on a closing basis. Ten of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors finished higher, led by the trade-sensitive materials (+2.0%) and industrials (+1.2%) sectors. The utilities sector was the lone holdout, finishing lower by 0.6%.</p><p>Qualcomm (QCOM 74.12, -1.83, -2.4%) was also left out of the advance after The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple (AAPL 208.84, +1.62, +0.8%) is considering buying Intel's (INTC 51.75, +0.40, +0.8%) smartphone-modem chip business for around $1 billion. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index finished up 1.2%.</p><p>Separately, Congress reached a deal to increase the budget deficit and suspend the debt ceiling for two years. The news provided some relief for investors, but market reaction was mostly muted as the dilemma never appeared to hinder the market beforehand and it was reported yesterday that a deal was close.</p><p>U.S. Treasuries finished on a lower note, pushing yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.83%, and the 10-yr yield increased three basis points to 2.07%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.5% to 97.74, helped by some weakness in the euro. WTI crude rose 0.9% to $56.72/bbl.</p><p>Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included Existing Home Sales for June and the FHFA Housing Market Index for May:</p><p>Existing home sales decreased 1.7% month-over-month in June to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 5.27 million (Briefing.com consensus 5.30 million) from an upwardly revised 5.36 million (from 5.34 million) in May. Total sales were 2.2% lower than the same period a year ago.The key takeaway from the report is that the drop in mortgage rates has failed to spur a meaningful pickup in existing home sales, which continue to be constrained by the lack of available supply at lower price points.The FHFA Housing Price Index for May increased 0.1% after advancing 0.4% in June.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive New Home Sales for June and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +24.4% YTDS&amp;P 500 +19.9% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +17.2% YTDRussell 2000 +15.3% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1920/969. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1717/1330.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-348664663</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN1-HMD1-JC8H-K18N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3951\"/><timeReceived>1:30 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc.

The major indices, led by a 2.3% gain in the Russell 2000, are all up at least 1.8% and trading at session highs.</p><p>Today's move began in earnest at the sound of the opening bell, as market participants reacted favorably to headlines that seemingly cooled down the temperature surrounding the trade dispute with China, and provided some cover to think the tariff on imported goods from Mexico could be averted, either due to a deal with the U.S. ahead of the June 10 deadline or a possible vote in Congress to forestall the action, according to the Washington Post.</p><p>In reality, the mood of the market had been lifted on Monday when the S&amp;P 500 exhibited some relative strength in the face of large losses suffered by Alphabet (GOOG 1051.22, +14.99, +1.5%), Facebook (FB 166.54, +2.39, +1.5%), Amazon.com (AMZN 1723.80, +31.11, +1.8%), and Apple (AAPL 178.68, +5.37, +3.1%), which fell prone to some regulatory angst on the part of investors.</p><p>Those mega-cap stocks have managed to bounce back some today on the belief that any investigation into their business practices is likely to be a drawn out one; moreover, there is some underlying hope that none of the companies would eventually be broken up by the government.</p><p>Their gains today have helped bolster the broader market, yet the buying interest has been widespread. The information technology (+2.6%), financials (+2.3%), industrials (+2.1%), and consumer discretionary (+2.1%) sectors are all up at least 2.0%. The only sectors not participating today are the defensive-oriented real estate (-1.1%) and utilities (-1.0%) sectors.</p><p>Some of the fallout for the latter two sectors hearkens back to the Treasury market, where yields have risen noticeably across the curve on a counter-trade rooted in the idea that Treasuries were primed for a pullback from a short-term overbought condition.</p><p>The 2-yr note yield has spiked seven basis points to 1.90% while the 10-yr note yield has jumped five basis points to 2.14%.</p><p>The losses in the Treasury market have unfolded despite some softening CPI data out of the eurozone and a 0.8% decline in U.S. factory orders for April.</p><p>The non-response in the Treasury market to otherwise disappointing economic data and some seemingly supportive remarks from Fed Chair Powell and Chicago Fed President Evans, both of whom are FOMC voters, underscores how the Treasury market is succumbing to the overbought perspective.</p><p>Neither Mr. Powell nor Mr. Evans promised a rate cut soon while speaking at a conference in Chicago, yet both paid heed to the risks of undershooting the 2.0% inflation target and the risks of the trade uncertainty, which has been construed by some today as a dovish policy leaning.</p><p>Separately, there was no mistaking the leaning in the analyst community with respect to Uber (UBER 42.17, +0.92, +2.2%). No fewer than 20 firms initiated coverage of the stock after its IPO, 16 of which had the equivalent of a Buy recommendation.</p><p>12:25 ET</p><p>Dow +403.11 at 25222.89, Nasdaq +141.44 at 7474.43, S&amp;P +42.97 at 2787.42</p><p>[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages hover near their recently established session highs. The Nasdaq (+1.9%) remains in the lead while the S&amp;P 500 (+1.6%) follows a bit behind. The Nasdaq's outperformance comes after the tech-heavy index displayed relative weakness on Monday.</p><p>Accordingly, the Nasdaq's outperformance has been supported by a 2.3% gain in the technology sector. The top-weighted group is today's best performer with chipmakers doing their part. The PHLX Semiconductor Index is up 3.0% with all 30 components trading in the green. NVIDIA (NVDA 140.84, +7.06, +5.3%) is up 5.3%, pacing the group's advance after recording eight consecutive losses.</p><p>Treasuries sit a bit above their morning lows with the 10-yr yield up five basis points at 2.14%.</p><p>11:55 ET</p><p>Dow +422.01 at 25241.79, Nasdaq +150.99 at 7483.98, S&amp;P +44.89 at 2789.34</p><p>[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to push higher with the S&amp;P 500 up 1.7%, the Nasdaq up 2.1%, and the Dow up 1.7%. Contributing to today's bullish bias are supportive comments from Fed Chair Powell and Chicago Fed President Evans, both of whom are FOMC voters.</p><p>Mr. Powell said that the Fed will act appropriately to sustain the economic expansion. Mr. Evans said the \"fundamentals\" of the economy remain in good footing and is open to a change in policy if necessary. There was no promise of a rate cut, but both did acknowledge concerns about low inflation.</p><p>Separately, shares of Box (BOX 16.61, -1.33) have dropped 7.4% after the company guided Q2 revenue below consensus and lowered its FY20 revenue below consensus. On a related note, the stock was downgraded to Hold from Buy at Canaccord Genuity with a price target of $16.</p><p>11:25 ET</p><p>Dow +419.65 at 25239.43, Nasdaq +137.40 at 7470.39, S&amp;P +41.50 at 2785.95</p><p>[BRIEFING.COM] The S&amp;P 500 currently trades near session highs with a gain of 1.5%.

Amazon (AMZN 1715.83, +23.15, +1.4%) and Alphabet (GOOG 1046.54, +10.31, +1.0%) have recouped some of their losses, while Facebook (FB 163.74, -0.50, -0.3%) has succumbed to follow-through selling interest.</p><p>Separately, shares of Uber (UBER 41.84, +0.58) are up 1.6% after the stock was initiated with a Buy rating, or its equivalent thereof, by a host of firms.</p><p>10:55 ET</p><p>Dow +325.92 at 25145.7, Nasdaq +94.54 at 7427.53, S&amp;P +29.79 at 2774.24</p><p>[BRIEFING.COM] The S&amp;P 500 is up 1.1% and is flirting with its 200-day moving average (2775).</p><p>The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+2.3%) has been one of today's best-performing groups. Nearly all of its components are up and some have provided solid support for the S&amp;P 500 information technology sector (+1.9%).</p><p>Retail stocks, too, have shown some strength, evident by 2.3% gain in the SPDR S&amp;P Retail ETF (XRT 41.25, +0.95).

The other eight S&amp;P 500 sectors finished higher, led by materials (+3.4%), to provide offsetting support.</p><p>Persisting concerns about trade and growth helped restrain buying conviction throughout the day. China blamed the U.S. for the setback in trade talks, which reinforced fears that a protracted trade war will squeeze global growth, and earnings, prospects. Global manufacturing PMI data, including in the U.S., revealed slower or flat growth in May.</p><p>On a related note, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard (FOMC Voter) said that slower economic growth could be sharper-than-expected due to the trade uncertainty. Mr. Bullard added that a rate cut may soon be warranted to boost inflation.</p><p>Growing expectations for a rate cut, and general growth concerns, helped send the 2-yr yield down 12 basis points to 1.83%. The 10-yr yield declined six basis points to 2.08%. The U.S. Dollar Index fell 0.5% to 97.22. WTI crude decreased 0.5% to $53.25/bbl, giving up an intraday rebound effort.</p><p>In other corporate news, German company Infineon announced plans to acquire Cypress Semiconductor (CY 22.07, +4.25, +23.9%) for approximately $10 billion, or $23.85 per share, in cash. The offer represents a 33.8% premium to CY's Friday closing price. Humana (HUM 250.32, +5.46, +2.2%) said it will not make a competing bid to acquire Centene (CNC 51.82, -5.93, -10.3%).</p><p>Reviewing Monday's economic data, which included the ISM Manufacturing Index for May and Construction Spending for April:</p><p>The ISM Manufacturing Index for May checked in at 52.1% (Briefing.com consensus 52.6%), down from 52.8% in April. The May reading is the lowest since October 2016. The May reading is the lowest since October 2016.The key takeaway from the report is that it reflects a deceleration in national manufacturing activity that will contribute to the burgeoning growth concerns for the U.S. economy. According to the ISM, the past relationship between the PMI and the overall economy indicates the PMI for May corresponds to a 2.7% increase in real GDP on an annualized basis.Total construction spending was unchanged in April (Briefing.com consensus +0.4%) following an upwardly revised 0.1% increase (from -0.9%) in March.The key takeaway from the report is that it was better than the headline suggests, after accounting for the March revision, yet that still didn't change the fact that total construction spending is soft, evidenced by the 1.2% yr/yr decline that was driven by an 11.2% yr/yr decline in residential spending.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive the Factory Orders report for April on Tuesday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +10.5% YTDS&amp;P 500 +9.5% YTDRussell 2000 +9.0% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +6.4% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1860/990. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1654/1418.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-345207426</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8C-0J11-JC8H-K1NV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3672\"/><timeReceived>1:30 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%), Nasdaq Composite (+0.6%), and Russell 2000 (+0.7%) advanced in-line with the benchmark index.</p><p>It had been a tight-ranged session for a good part of the day despite positive earnings results and guidance from a diversified group of companies like Coca-Cola (KO 54.33, +3.11, +6.1%), United Technologies (UTX 134.94, +1.99, +1.5%), Sherwin-Williams (SHW 490.23, +35.64, +7.8%), and Biogen (BIIB 243.88, +11.40, +4.9%). Travelers (TRV 147.50, -2.21, -1.5%), however, did come up short of expectations.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, a positive trade headline helped energize the slow-moving market. Bloomberg reported that USTR Lighthizer and other senior officials will head to China next week to continue trade talks from Monday to Wednesday. Although this possibility had been reported earlier and many high-level talks in the past have yielded little progress, the good mood in the market flowing from earnings seemed to sway the market.</p><p>The news pushed the S&amp;P 500 back above the 3000 level, where it would stay above on a closing basis. Ten of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors finished higher, led by the trade-sensitive materials (+2.0%) and industrials (+1.2%) sectors. The utilities sector was the lone holdout, finishing lower by 0.6%.</p><p>Qualcomm (QCOM 74.12, -1.83, -2.4%) was also left out of the advance after The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple (AAPL 208.84, +1.62, +0.8%) is considering buying Intel's (INTC 51.75, +0.40, +0.8%) smartphone-modem chip business for around $1 billion. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index finished up 1.2%.</p><p>Separately, Congress reached a deal to increase the budget deficit and suspend the debt ceiling for two years. The news provided some relief for investors, but market reaction was mostly muted as the dilemma never appeared to hinder the market beforehand and it was reported yesterday that a deal was close.</p><p>U.S. Treasuries finished on a lower note, pushing yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.83%, and the 10-yr yield increased three basis points to 2.07%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.5% to 97.74, helped by some weakness in the euro. WTI crude rose 0.9% to $56.72/bbl.</p><p>Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included Existing Home Sales for June and the FHFA Housing Market Index for May:</p><p>Existing home sales decreased 1.7% month-over-month in June to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 5.27 million (Briefing.com consensus 5.30 million) from an upwardly revised 5.36 million (from 5.34 million) in May. Total sales were 2.2% lower than the same period a year ago.The key takeaway from the report is that the drop in mortgage rates has failed to spur a meaningful pickup in existing home sales, which continue to be constrained by the lack of available supply at lower price points.The FHFA Housing Price Index for May increased 0.1% after advancing 0.4% in June.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive New Home Sales for June and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +24.4% YTDS&amp;P 500 +19.9% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +17.2% YTDRussell 2000 +15.3% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1920/969. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1717/1330.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-348667085</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN1-HMD1-JC8H-K18P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4042\"/><timeReceived>2:00 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc.

The major indices, led by a 2.3% gain in the Russell 2000, are all up at least 1.8% and trading at session highs.</p><p>Today's move began in earnest at the sound of the opening bell, as market participants reacted favorably to headlines that seemingly cooled down the temperature surrounding the trade dispute with China, and provided some cover to think the tariff on imported goods from Mexico could be averted, either due to a deal with the U.S. ahead of the June 10 deadline or a possible vote in Congress to forestall the action, according to the Washington Post.</p><p>In reality, the mood of the market had been lifted on Monday when the S&amp;P 500 exhibited some relative strength in the face of large losses suffered by Alphabet (GOOG 1051.22, +14.99, +1.5%), Facebook (FB 166.54, +2.39, +1.5%), Amazon.com (AMZN 1723.80, +31.11, +1.8%), and Apple (AAPL 178.68, +5.37, +3.1%), which fell prone to some regulatory angst on the part of investors.</p><p>Those mega-cap stocks have managed to bounce back some today on the belief that any investigation into their business practices is likely to be a drawn out one; moreover, there is some underlying hope that none of the companies would eventually be broken up by the government.</p><p>Their gains today have helped bolster the broader market, yet the buying interest has been widespread. The information technology (+2.6%), financials (+2.3%), industrials (+2.1%), and consumer discretionary (+2.1%) sectors are all up at least 2.0%. The only sectors not participating today are the defensive-oriented real estate (-1.1%) and utilities (-1.0%) sectors.</p><p>Some of the fallout for the latter two sectors hearkens back to the Treasury market, where yields have risen noticeably across the curve on a counter-trade rooted in the idea that Treasuries were primed for a pullback from a short-term overbought condition.</p><p>The 2-yr note yield has spiked seven basis points to 1.90% while the 10-yr note yield has jumped five basis points to 2.14%.</p><p>The losses in the Treasury market have unfolded despite some softening CPI data out of the eurozone and a 0.8% decline in U.S. factory orders for April.</p><p>The non-response in the Treasury market to otherwise disappointing economic data and some seemingly supportive remarks from Fed Chair Powell and Chicago Fed President Evans, both of whom are FOMC voters, underscores how the Treasury market is succumbing to the overbought perspective.</p><p>Neither Mr. Powell nor Mr. Evans promised a rate cut soon while speaking at a conference in Chicago, yet both paid heed to the risks of undershooting the 2.0% inflation target and the risks of the trade uncertainty, which has been construed by some today as a dovish policy leaning.</p><p>Separately, there was no mistaking the leaning in the analyst community with respect to Uber (UBER 42.17, +0.92, +2.2%). No fewer than 20 firms initiated coverage of the stock after its IPO, 16 of which had the equivalent of a Buy recommendation.</p><p>12:25 ET</p><p>Dow +403.11 at 25222.89, Nasdaq +141.44 at 7474.43, S&amp;P +42.97 at 2787.42</p><p>[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages hover near their recently established session highs. The Nasdaq (+1.9%) remains in the lead while the S&amp;P 500 (+1.6%) follows a bit behind. The Nasdaq's outperformance comes after the tech-heavy index displayed relative weakness on Monday.</p><p>Accordingly, the Nasdaq's outperformance has been supported by a 2.3% gain in the technology sector. The top-weighted group is today's best performer with chipmakers doing their part. The PHLX Semiconductor Index is up 3.0% with all 30 components trading in the green. NVIDIA (NVDA 140.84, +7.06, +5.3%) is up 5.3%, pacing the group's advance after recording eight consecutive losses.</p><p>Treasuries sit a bit above their morning lows with the 10-yr yield up five basis points at 2.14%.</p><p>11:55 ET</p><p>Dow +422.01 at 25241.79, Nasdaq +150.99 at 7483.98, S&amp;P +44.89 at 2789.34</p><p>[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to push higher with the S&amp;P 500 up 1.7%, the Nasdaq up 2.1%, and the Dow up 1.7%. Contributing to today's bullish bias are supportive comments from Fed Chair Powell and Chicago Fed President Evans, both of whom are FOMC voters.</p><p>Mr. Powell said that the Fed will act appropriately to sustain the economic expansion. Mr. Evans said the \"fundamentals\" of the economy remain in good footing and is open to a change in policy if necessary. There was no promise of a rate cut, but both did acknowledge concerns about low inflation.</p><p>Separately, shares of Box (BOX 16.61, -1.33) have dropped 7.4% after the company guided Q2 revenue below consensus and lowered its FY20 revenue below consensus. On a related note, the stock was downgraded to Hold from Buy at Canaccord Genuity with a price target of $16.</p><p>11:25 ET</p><p>Dow +419.65 at 25239.43, Nasdaq +137.40 at 7470.39, S&amp;P +41.50 at 2785.95</p><p>[BRIEFING.COM] The S&amp;P 500 currently trades near session highs with a gain of 1.5%. Most of the FAANG stocks that were indicated in potential antitrust probes yesterday have turned it around today.</p><p>Shares of Apple (AAPL 1748.91, +5.60) have bounced 3.2% after declining 1.0% yesterday. Amazon (AMZN 1715.83, +23.15, +1.4%) and Alphabet (GOOG 1046.54, +10.31, +1.0%) have recouped some of their losses, while Facebook (FB 163.74, -0.50, -0.3%) has succumbed to follow-through selling interest.</p><p>Separately, shares of Uber (UBER 41.84, +0.58) are up 1.6% after the stock was initiated with a Buy rating, or its equivalent thereof, by a host of firms.</p><p>10:55 ET</p><p>Dow +325.92 at 25145.7, Nasdaq +94.54 at 7427.53, S&amp;P +29.79 at 2774.24</p><p>[BRIEFING.COM] The S&amp;P 500 is up 1.1% and is flirting with its 200-day moving average (2775).</p><p>The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (+2.3%) has been one of today's best-performing groups. Nearly all of its components are up and some have provided solid support for the S&amp;P 500 information technology sector (+1.9%).</p><p>Retail stocks, too, have shown some strength, evident by 2.3% gain in the SPDR S&amp;P Retail ETF (XRT 41.25, +0.95). Shares of Tiffany &amp; Co (TIF 92.93, +2.76, +3.2%) have given the group a boost after the stock initially traded lower by more than 4% in pre-market action.

Lingering trade and growth concerns also helped curb risk sentiment and underpin the strength in U.S. Treasuries. A swarm of buyers in the last 30 minutes of action, however, helped the broader market close off its session lows.</p><p>The tech-sensitive Nasdaq Composite fell 1.6%. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.02%) finished fractionally higher, and the small-cap Russell 2000 increased 0.3%.</p><p>Facebook (FB 164.15, -13.32, -7.5%), Alphabet (GOOG 1036.23, -67.40, -6.1%), Amazon (AMZN 1692.69, -82.38, -4.6%), and Apple (AAPL 173.30, -1.77, -1.0%) were all singled out in various reports indicating that the companies could face antitrust scrutiny by the Department of Justice and/or Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>These companies represent some of the most widely-held stocks in the U.S., and their out-sized losses weighed heavily on the Nasdaq and on the S&amp;P 500 communication services (-2.8%), information technology (-1.8%), and consumer discretionary (-1.2%) sectors. The other eight S&amp;P 500 sectors finished higher, led by materials (+3.4%), to provide offsetting support.</p><p>Persisting concerns about trade and growth helped restrain buying conviction throughout the day. China blamed the U.S. for the setback in trade talks, which reinforced fears that a protracted trade war will squeeze global growth, and earnings, prospects. Global manufacturing PMI data, including in the U.S., revealed slower or flat growth in May.</p><p>On a related note, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard (FOMC Voter) said that slower economic growth could be sharper-than-expected due to the trade uncertainty. Mr. Bullard added that a rate cut may soon be warranted to boost inflation.</p><p>Growing expectations for a rate cut, and general growth concerns, helped send the 2-yr yield down 12 basis points to 1.83%. The 10-yr yield declined six basis points to 2.08%. The U.S. Dollar Index fell 0.5% to 97.22. WTI crude decreased 0.5% to $53.25/bbl, giving up an intraday rebound effort.</p><p>In other corporate news, German company Infineon announced plans to acquire Cypress Semiconductor (CY 22.07, +4.25, +23.9%) for approximately $10 billion, or $23.85 per share, in cash. The offer represents a 33.8% premium to CY's Friday closing price. Humana (HUM 250.32, +5.46, +2.2%) said it will not make a competing bid to acquire Centene (CNC 51.82, -5.93, -10.3%).</p><p>Reviewing Monday's economic data, which included the ISM Manufacturing Index for May and Construction Spending for April:</p><p>The ISM Manufacturing Index for May checked in at 52.1% (Briefing.com consensus 52.6%), down from 52.8% in April. The May reading is the lowest since October 2016. The May reading is the lowest since October 2016.The key takeaway from the report is that it reflects a deceleration in national manufacturing activity that will contribute to the burgeoning growth concerns for the U.S. economy. According to the ISM, the past relationship between the PMI and the overall economy indicates the PMI for May corresponds to a 2.7% increase in real GDP on an annualized basis.Total construction spending was unchanged in April (Briefing.com consensus +0.4%) following an upwardly revised 0.1% increase (from -0.9%) in March.The key takeaway from the report is that it was better than the headline suggests, after accounting for the March revision, yet that still didn't change the fact that total construction spending is soft, evidenced by the 1.2% yr/yr decline that was driven by an 11.2% yr/yr decline in residential spending.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive the Factory Orders report for April on Tuesday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +10.5% YTDS&amp;P 500 +9.5% YTDRussell 2000 +9.0% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +6.4% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1860/990. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1654/1418.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-345209362</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8C-0J11-JC8H-K1NW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3750\"/><timeReceived>2:00 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc.

The major indices, led by a 2.3% gain in the Russell 2000, are all up at least 1.8% and trading at session highs.</p><p>Today's move began in earnest at the sound of the opening bell, as market participants reacted favorably to headlines that seemingly cooled down the temperature surrounding the trade dispute with China, and provided some cover to think the tariff on imported goods from Mexico could be averted, either due to a deal with the U.S. ahead of the June 10 deadline or a possible vote in Congress to forestall the action, according to the Washington Post.</p><p>In reality, the mood of the market had been lifted on Monday when the S&amp;P 500 exhibited some relative strength in the face of large losses suffered by Alphabet (GOOG 1051.22, +14.99, +1.5%), Facebook (FB 166.54, +2.39, +1.5%), Amazon.com (AMZN 1723.80, +31.11, +1.8%), and Apple (AAPL 178.68, +5.37, +3.1%), which fell prone to some regulatory angst on the part of investors.</p><p>Those mega-cap stocks have managed to bounce back some today on the belief that any investigation into their business practices is likely to be a drawn out one; moreover, there is some underlying hope that none of the companies would eventually be broken up by the government.</p><p>Their gains today have helped bolster the broader market, yet the buying interest has been widespread. The information technology (+2.6%), financials (+2.3%), industrials (+2.1%), and consumer discretionary (+2.1%) sectors are all up at least 2.0%. The only sectors not participating today are the defensive-oriented real estate (-1.1%) and utilities (-1.0%) sectors.</p><p>Some of the fallout for the latter two sectors hearkens back to the Treasury market, where yields have risen noticeably across the curve on a counter-trade rooted in the idea that Treasuries were primed for a pullback from a short-term overbought condition.</p><p>The 2-yr note yield has spiked seven basis points to 1.90% while the 10-yr note yield has jumped five basis points to 2.14%.</p><p>The losses in the Treasury market have unfolded despite some softening CPI data out of the eurozone and a 0.8% decline in U.S. factory orders for April.</p><p>The non-response in the Treasury market to otherwise disappointing economic data and some seemingly supportive remarks from Fed Chair Powell and Chicago Fed President Evans, both of whom are FOMC voters, underscores how the Treasury market is succumbing to the overbought perspective.</p><p>Neither Mr. Powell nor Mr. Evans promised a rate cut soon while speaking at a conference in Chicago, yet both paid heed to the risks of undershooting the 2.0% inflation target and the risks of the trade uncertainty, which has been construed by some today as a dovish policy leaning.</p><p>Separately, there was no mistaking the leaning in the analyst community with respect to Uber (UBER 42.17, +0.92, +2.2%). No fewer than 20 firms initiated coverage of the stock after its IPO, 16 of which had the equivalent of a Buy recommendation.</p><p>12:25 ET</p><p>Dow +403.11 at 25222.89, Nasdaq +141.44 at 7474.43, S&amp;P +42.97 at 2787.42</p><p>[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages hover near their recently established session highs. The Nasdaq (+1.9%) remains in the lead while the S&amp;P 500 (+1.6%) follows a bit behind. The Nasdaq's outperformance comes after the tech-heavy index displayed relative weakness on Monday.</p><p>Accordingly, the Nasdaq's outperformance has been supported by a 2.3% gain in the technology sector. The top-weighted group is today's best performer with chipmakers doing their part. The PHLX Semiconductor Index is up 3.0% with all 30 components trading in the green. NVIDIA (NVDA 140.84, +7.06, +5.3%) is up 5.3%, pacing the group's advance after recording eight consecutive losses.</p><p>Treasuries sit a bit above their morning lows with the 10-yr yield up five basis points at 2.14%.</p><p>11:55 ET</p><p>Dow +422.01 at 25241.79, Nasdaq +150.99 at 7483.98, S&amp;P +44.89 at 2789.34</p><p>[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages continue to push higher with the S&amp;P 500 up 1.7%, the Nasdaq up 2.1%, and the Dow up 1.7%. Contributing to today's bullish bias are supportive comments from Fed Chair Powell and Chicago Fed President Evans, both of whom are FOMC voters.</p><p>Mr. Powell said that the Fed will act appropriately to sustain the economic expansion. Mr. Evans said the \"fundamentals\" of the economy remain in good footing and is open to a change in policy if necessary. There was no promise of a rate cut, but both did acknowledge concerns about low inflation.</p><p>Separately, shares of Box (BOX 16.61, -1.33) have dropped 7.4% after the company guided Q2 revenue below consensus and lowered its FY20 revenue below consensus. On a related note, the stock was downgraded to Hold from Buy at Canaccord Genuity with a price target of $16.</p><p>11:25 ET</p><p>Dow +419.65 at 25239.43, Nasdaq +137.40 at 7470.39, S&amp;P +41.50 at 2785.95</p><p>[BRIEFING.COM] The S&amp;P 500 currently trades near session highs with a gain of 1.5%.

Nearly all of its components are up and some have provided solid support for the S&amp;P 500 information technology sector (+1.9%).</p><p>Retail stocks, too, have shown some strength, evident by 2.3% gain in the SPDR S&amp;P Retail ETF (XRT 41.25, +0.95).

Lingering trade and growth concerns also helped curb risk sentiment and underpin the strength in U.S. Treasuries. A swarm of buyers in the last 30 minutes of action, however, helped the broader market close off its session lows.</p><p>The tech-sensitive Nasdaq Composite fell 1.6%. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.02%) finished fractionally higher, and the small-cap Russell 2000 increased 0.3%.</p><p>Facebook (FB 164.15, -13.32, -7.5%), Alphabet (GOOG 1036.23, -67.40, -6.1%), Amazon (AMZN 1692.69, -82.38, -4.6%), and Apple (AAPL 173.30, -1.77, -1.0%) were all singled out in various reports indicating that the companies could face antitrust scrutiny by the Department of Justice and/or Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>These companies represent some of the most widely-held stocks in the U.S., and their out-sized losses weighed heavily on the Nasdaq and on the S&amp;P 500 communication services (-2.8%), information technology (-1.8%), and consumer discretionary (-1.2%) sectors. The other eight S&amp;P 500 sectors finished higher, led by materials (+3.4%), to provide offsetting support.</p><p>Persisting concerns about trade and growth helped restrain buying conviction throughout the day. China blamed the U.S. for the setback in trade talks, which reinforced fears that a protracted trade war will squeeze global growth, and earnings, prospects. Global manufacturing PMI data, including in the U.S., revealed slower or flat growth in May.</p><p>On a related note, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard (FOMC Voter) said that slower economic growth could be sharper-than-expected due to the trade uncertainty. Mr. Bullard added that a rate cut may soon be warranted to boost inflation.</p><p>Growing expectations for a rate cut, and general growth concerns, helped send the 2-yr yield down 12 basis points to 1.83%. The 10-yr yield declined six basis points to 2.08%. The U.S. Dollar Index fell 0.5% to 97.22. WTI crude decreased 0.5% to $53.25/bbl, giving up an intraday rebound effort.</p><p>In other corporate news, German company Infineon announced plans to acquire Cypress Semiconductor (CY 22.07, +4.25, +23.9%) for approximately $10 billion, or $23.85 per share, in cash. The offer represents a 33.8% premium to CY's Friday closing price. Humana (HUM 250.32, +5.46, +2.2%) said it will not make a competing bid to acquire Centene (CNC 51.82, -5.93, -10.3%).</p><p>Reviewing Monday's economic data, which included the ISM Manufacturing Index for May and Construction Spending for April:</p><p>The ISM Manufacturing Index for May checked in at 52.1% (Briefing.com consensus 52.6%), down from 52.8% in April. The May reading is the lowest since October 2016. The May reading is the lowest since October 2016.The key takeaway from the report is that it reflects a deceleration in national manufacturing activity that will contribute to the burgeoning growth concerns for the U.S. economy. According to the ISM, the past relationship between the PMI and the overall economy indicates the PMI for May corresponds to a 2.7% increase in real GDP on an annualized basis.Total construction spending was unchanged in April (Briefing.com consensus +0.4%) following an upwardly revised 0.1% increase (from -0.9%) in March.The key takeaway from the report is that it was better than the headline suggests, after accounting for the March revision, yet that still didn't change the fact that total construction spending is soft, evidenced by the 1.2% yr/yr decline that was driven by an 11.2% yr/yr decline in residential spending.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive the Factory Orders report for April on Tuesday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +10.5% YTDS&amp;P 500 +9.5% YTDRussell 2000 +9.0% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +6.4% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1860/990. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1654/1418.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-345211527</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8C-0J11-JC8H-K1NX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3892\"/><timeReceived>2:30 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc.

The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.6%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.9%. The small-cap Russell 2000 underperformed with a 1.5% decline.</p><p>Ten of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors closed lower, but the health care (-1.1%) and information technology (-1.2%) sectors were the only sectors to decline more than 1.0%. Note, the tech sector was down as much as 2.7% intraday, while the consumer discretionary sector gained 0.3% as shares of Amazon (AMZN 3008.91, +22.36, +0.8%) recovered an early 3.3% decline.</p><p>Intel (INTC 50.59, -9.81, -16.2%) did very little recovering, with shares falling 16% after the company announced a six-month delay in its next-generation 7nm chip technology. While disappointing for Intel investors, the news was welcomed by investors of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 69.40, +9.83, +16.5%).</p><p>Other negative factors today included China ordering the U.S. to close its consulate in Chengdu in response to the U.S. ordering China to close its consulate in Houston and a delay in the Republican coronavirus relief bill until next week.</p><p>On a more positive note, new home sales surged 13.8% m/m in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 776,000 (Briefing.com consensus 680,000). That was the strongest pace of sales since July 2007 and higher than the pre-pandemic pace of 774,000 seen in January.</p><p>In other corporate news, Goldman Sachs (GS 201.47, -1.66, -0.8%) settled its 1MDB case for $3.9 billion, Verizon (VZ 56.85, +1.00, +1.8%) beat top and bottom-line estimates, American Express (AXP 95.33, -1.34, -1.4%) reported mixed quarterly results, and Walt Disney (DIS 117.61, -0.51, -0.4%) reportedly delayed several blockbuster movies by a year.</p><p>U.S. Treasuries finished little changed. The 2-yr yield declined one basis point to 0.14%, and the 10-yr yield was flat at 0.58%. Gold futures rose 0.4% to $1897.50/ozt -- its highest settlement price ever amid continued weakness in the U.S. Dollar Index (94.39, -0.30, -0.3%). WTI crude futures settled little changed at $41.08/bbl.</p><p>Reviewing Friday's economic data:</p><p>New home sales surged 13.8% m/m in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 776,000 (Briefing.com consensus 680,000). That was the strongest pace of sales since July 2007 and higher than the pre-pandemic pace of 774,000 seen in January. On a yr/yr basis, new home sales were up 13.7%.The key takeaway from the report is that sales activity in the new home market is quite healthy given the tight supply of existing homes for sale, low mortgage rates, pent-up demand, and an emerging, coronavirus-driven shift by city dwellers to suburban settings.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive Durable Goods Orders for June on Monday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +15.5% YTDS&amp;P 500 -0.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -7.3% YTDRussell 2000 -12.0% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 992/1937. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 868/2356.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-368507725</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FP-SBJ1-JC8H-K0Y2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3425\"/><timeReceived>2:32 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Briefing.com, Inc.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.7%), Nasdaq Composite (+0.6%), and Russell 2000 (+0.7%) advanced in-line with the benchmark index.</p><p>It had been a tight-ranged session for a good part of the day despite positive earnings results and guidance from a diversified group of companies like Coca-Cola (KO 54.33, +3.11, +6.1%), United Technologies (UTX 134.94, +1.99, +1.5%), Sherwin-Williams (SHW 490.23, +35.64, +7.8%), and Biogen (BIIB 243.88, +11.40, +4.9%). Travelers (TRV 147.50, -2.21, -1.5%), however, did come up short of expectations.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, a positive trade headline helped energize the slow-moving market. Bloomberg reported that USTR Lighthizer and other senior officials will head to China next week to continue trade talks from Monday to Wednesday. Although this possibility had been reported earlier and many high-level talks in the past have yielded little progress, the good mood in the market flowing from earnings seemed to sway the market.</p><p>The news pushed the S&amp;P 500 back above the 3000 level, where it would stay above on a closing basis. Ten of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors finished higher, led by the trade-sensitive materials (+2.0%) and industrials (+1.2%) sectors. The utilities sector was the lone holdout, finishing lower by 0.6%.</p><p>Qualcomm (QCOM 74.12, -1.83, -2.4%) was also left out of the advance after The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple (AAPL 208.84, +1.62, +0.8%) is considering buying Intel's (INTC 51.75, +0.40, +0.8%) smartphone-modem chip business for around $1 billion. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index finished up 1.2%.</p><p>Separately, Congress reached a deal to increase the budget deficit and suspend the debt ceiling for two years. The news provided some relief for investors, but market reaction was mostly muted as the dilemma never appeared to hinder the market beforehand and it was reported yesterday that a deal was close.</p><p>U.S. Treasuries finished on a lower note, pushing yields higher across the curve. The 2-yr yield increased two basis points to 1.83%, and the 10-yr yield increased three basis points to 2.07%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.5% to 97.74, helped by some weakness in the euro. WTI crude rose 0.9% to $56.72/bbl.</p><p>Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included Existing Home Sales for June and the FHFA Housing Market Index for May:</p><p>Existing home sales decreased 1.7% month-over-month in June to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 5.27 million (Briefing.com consensus 5.30 million) from an upwardly revised 5.36 million (from 5.34 million) in May. Total sales were 2.2% lower than the same period a year ago.The key takeaway from the report is that the drop in mortgage rates has failed to spur a meaningful pickup in existing home sales, which continue to be constrained by the lack of available supply at lower price points.The FHFA Housing Price Index for May increased 0.1% after advancing 0.4% in June.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive New Home Sales for June and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index on Wednesday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +24.4% YTDS&amp;P 500 +19.9% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average +17.2% YTDRussell 2000 +15.3% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 1920/969. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 1717/1330.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-348668571</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN1-HMD1-JC8H-K18R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4134\"/><timeReceived>2:30 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Briefing.com, Inc.

The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.6%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.9%. The small-cap Russell 2000 underperformed with a 1.5% decline.</p><p>Ten of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors closed lower, but the health care (-1.1%) and information technology (-1.2%) sectors were the only sectors to decline more than 1.0%. Note, the tech sector was down as much as 2.7% intraday, while the consumer discretionary sector gained 0.3% as shares of Amazon (AMZN 3008.91, +22.36, +0.8%) recovered an early 3.3% decline.</p><p>Intel (INTC 50.59, -9.81, -16.2%) did very little recovering, with shares falling 16% after the company announced a six-month delay in its next-generation 7nm chip technology. While disappointing for Intel investors, the news was welcomed by investors of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 69.40, +9.83, +16.5%).</p><p>Other negative factors today included China ordering the U.S. to close its consulate in Chengdu in response to the U.S. ordering China to close its consulate in Houston and a delay in the Republican coronavirus relief bill until next week.</p><p>On a more positive note, new home sales surged 13.8% m/m in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 776,000 (Briefing.com consensus 680,000).

The 2-yr yield declined one basis point to 0.14%, and the 10-yr yield was flat at 0.58%. Gold futures rose 0.4% to $1897.50/ozt -- its highest settlement price ever amid continued weakness in the U.S. Dollar Index (94.39, -0.30, -0.3%). WTI crude futures settled little changed at $41.08/bbl.</p><p>Reviewing Friday's economic data:</p><p>New home sales surged 13.8% m/m in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 776,000 (Briefing.com consensus 680,000). That was the strongest pace of sales since July 2007 and higher than the pre-pandemic pace of 774,000 seen in January. On a yr/yr basis, new home sales were up 13.7%.The key takeaway from the report is that sales activity in the new home market is quite healthy given the tight supply of existing homes for sale, low mortgage rates, pent-up demand, and an emerging, coronavirus-driven shift by city dwellers to suburban settings.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive Durable Goods Orders for June on Monday.</p><p>Nasdaq Composite +15.5% YTDS&amp;P 500 -0.5% YTDDow Jones Industrial Average -7.3% YTDRussell 2000 -12.0% YTD ..NYSE Adv/Dec 992/1937. ..NASDAQ Adv/Dec 868/2356.</p><p>Briefing.com is the leading Internet provider of live market analysis for U.S. Stock, U.S. Bond and world FX market participants. 1-800-752-3013 or <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.briefing.com\">http://www.briefing.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRFCOM-368509066</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRFCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FP-SBJ1-JC8H-K0Y3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258878</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3539\"/><timeReceived>3:02 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Briefing.com, Inc.
