But the US small business owner is now battling Apple for the right to use a pear in the logo on her recipe app...</p><p>When Natalie Monson started her food blog 11 years ago, she didn't expect to end up embroiled in a fight with the world's most valuable company.   But the US small business owner is now battling Apple for the right to use a pear in the logo on her recipe app.   In a patent filing, Apple said the image was too similar to its own logo and would hurt its brand.   Ms Monson says the tech giant is simply \"bullying\" and she feels a \"moral obligation\" to fight back.   More than 43,000 people have already signed the petition she and her husband Russ, owners of the Super Healthy Kids website, created last week to try to pressure the company to back down.   McDonald's loses second 'Mc' trademark case  Lindt defeats Haribo over gold bear   \"This is a real world example of a small business being destroyed by a giant monopoly because they don't have accountability,\" Mr Monson told the BBC. \"That was so frustrating to us that we thought we had to do something. We can't just be the next victim on the list.\"   Apple did not respond to a request for comment.  'Similar commercial impression'  In its filing with the US patent office, the firm says the Monsons' pear logo \"consists of a minimalistic fruit design with a right-angled leaf, which readily calls to mind Apple's famous Apple Logo and creates a similar commercial impression, as shown in the following side-by-side comparison\".   It asks regulators to reject the Monsons' trademark application, which the couple first filed in 2017 on behalf of their recipe and meal planning app, Prepear.   Ms Monson said the comparison took them by surprise. The shape of the pear and leaf, which they worked on with a designer, was supposed to allude to the letter \"P\" in the app's name, she said.   \"We had no intention or any awareness that it was copying any logo at all,\" she said. \"We thought it was very unique and designed it to be so.\"   \"First we were very surprised and then I would say our second reaction was definitely scared,\" she added. \"Like, 'ok where do we go from here? What does this mean?'\"  'You wonder if it's a joke'  When the couple started planning Prepear five years ago, they envisioned the app as a platform where food bloggers could upload recipes, which subscribers could access to plan meals shopping lists.   They now have about 21,000 monthly active users, including 3,000 customers who pay the annual $59 fee, according to Mr Monson, an accountant by training. The app, along with the Super Health Kids site, supports five staff, including the couple.   Mr Monson said he initially thought it was a misunderstanding and the two sides would be able to resolve the dispute amicably. The logo has been approved in other countries, including the UK, without dispute and American patent officials hadn't found a problem, he noted.   As a final step before approval, the patent office published their application in late 2019 drawing Apple's objection.   \"It just seems so ridiculous on its face,\" he said. \"You wonder if it's a joke.\"   Last week, as it became clear that it was not, the couple spoke out on social media, drawing attention to other instances of Apple's trademark objections and noting that concerns about legal costs had prompted them to let go one of their employees.     Skip Instagram post  by superhealthykids      View this post on Instagram      Dear Instagram Friends- I NEED YOUR HELP!  I know there are a lot of heavy things going on in the world right now, and this is nothing in comparison, but I need your help in a situation that is affecting me, my family, and my coworkers. Please help! Many of you know that I started a business called Prepear almost 5 years ago. It is an app that you can store all your recipes in one place, plan your meals, make grocery lists, and get your groceries delivered all in one place. Recently @apple yes, The trillion dollar Apple, has decided to oppose and go after our small business\u2019 trademark saying our pear logo is too close to their apple logo and supposedly hurts their brand? This is a big blow to us at Prepear. To fight this it will cost tens of thousands of dollars. The CRAZY thing is that Apple has done this to dozens of other other small business fruit logo companies, and many have chosen to abandon their logo, or close doors. While the rest of the world is going out of their way to help small businesses during this pandemic, Apple has chosen to go after our small business.  I\u2019m not trying to get anyone to stop using or buying Apple products. I feel a moral obligation to take a stand against Apple's aggressive legal action against small businesses and fight for the right to keep our logo. We are defending ourselves against Apple not only to keep our logo, but to send a message to big tech companies that bullying small businesses has consequences.

Were you laughing at me?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(CROSSTALK)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">PETER KIERNAN, NEW YORK TIMES BEST-SELLING AUTHOR: Glad to be with you.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know, you had your coat on at the break (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's a little chilly, and I'm still getting over that flu I had, like, two weeks ago.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That is right.</p><p>KIERNAN: Youth comes back fast. Youth comes back fast, you've bounced right back.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Youth? Yes. That's -- I don't even -- I'm so beyond that. I don't even know what that word means anymore.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Come on. We got -- we got a big show ahead. Look, we've seen the markets trade to the flat this year on the heels of the big rally after election night. We're going to talk with the chief investment officer CalPERS coming up, how he's allocating hundreds of billions of dollars right now, and you wonder if in fact he's expecting the strength in the market to continue. What we need to hear from President Trump and his administration.</p><p>So, Ted Eliopoulos will weigh in. He's the CIO of CalPERS. Plus, Ohio<person><nameText>Congressman Tim Ryan </nameText></person>is with us this morning. Of course, he tried to go up against Nancy Pelosi and lost that bid. We'll talk with <person><nameText>Tim Ryan </nameText></person>about the Democratically Party. And the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney weighing in as always. Along with former NFL Star Jack Brewer. You don't want to miss a moment of it. We got a big hour ahead so stay with us this morning.</p><p>And we kick it off with those violent protests last night erupting at the University of California, Berkeley Campus, over a speech from conservative editor, Milo Yiannopoulos. Rioters started fires, they broke windows -- look at this, they confronted police, ultimately causing the event to be canceled. Joining us right now is the University of Virginia Center for Politics Director Larry Sabato. Larry, thanks very much for joining us. And what do you have to say about this violence?</p><p>LARRY SABATO, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA CENTER FOR POLITICS DIRECTOR: Well, as Peter Kiernan knows, I'm from the University of Virginia. I've been associated with university for 47 years, it is Thomas Jefferson's University. We believe in free speech, I've had literally a hundreds of speakers that I've brought in to the university from right to left and everything in between, I've never had a single problem. So obviously, what happened at Berkeley was wrong.</p><p>You've got lots of choices, you can boycott an event you don't like, you can peacefully protester it, you can go and ask questions during the Q and A period, you hold a counter event, what you should not do is to shut down the actual event and deny someone the right to speak, if they've been invited by a group and it's follow the rules of that university. So, this is not a good thing, but let's not overgeneralize, this is one university, I'm sure it's happened elsewhere but there are plenty of universities, like the University of Virginia not nearly as good but like they're like the University of Virginia and that they welcome speakers.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, we don't -- we don't want to generalize about universities across the board but there is a thread that goes through universities across the board frankly, I mean, not cutting off free speech but you said that so, I -- what I really wanted to say to you was who's accountable, who do you guys think is accountable? Should leadership from University of Berkeley U.C. have come and put an end to it? What could have been done to stop this?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. Right. That it ultimately falls into the hands of the leadership of the university, and quite frankly, it leads to anecdotally there is this move -- this thread among universities particularly with a lot of professors that there is -- there's no room in the classroom for a differing opinion.</p><p>SABATO: Well, you know, I can't speak for every university or every professor or every classroom. I sure know my students don't fear me at all and they constantly object to this, that, and the other, and raise contrary opinions and I encourage it and that's what you should do in a classroom. So, when you say there's a --</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you said Peter Kiernan knows that.</p><p>KIERNAN: Yes. Well --</p><p>SABATO: He knows that. He knows that.</p><p>KIERNAN: Larry has taught all four of my children and in the process he's taught me a heck of a lot too. And I think, you know, what we're talking about here though is I think a shared community obligation. It can't just be that something that the president does alone or the faculty does alone or the students. There are many stakeholders here and I think what UVA does uniquely well and could be a -- I think a magnet for other people to watch is bring all these forces together in a way useful that it's useful. And I think what you're seeing in going on in Berkeley and U.C. Davis is not useful in any way and the person ultimately harmed frankly is the student.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. It's true.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, MAVERICK PAC NATIONAL CO-CHAIR: Well, why not hold the student -- if you peacefully protest, that's fine. You have every right to peacefully previous as much as you do to have free speech. But how about holding the students who are violent and accountable in some many sort of punishment so that other students know you can peacefully protest that you can't -- you can't burn building and break windows, I mean, that's just silly. And you're responsible.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>KIERNAN: No. It's true. Absolutely, you have to hold --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. We all live free on this but unfortunately this bias continues throughout the university.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I had it at Wake Forest for a shoot, I had it down in Wake Forest in the late 80s where it was like my speech was only was free if it agreed with some of my professors and I was targeted because I was in a sorority and some of my professors didn't like that. And so, I think that this has gotten away from itself because there's a lack of leadership, I'm not talking about the University of Virginia but it's certainly a lack of leadership or it's just a control of the liberal left.</p><p>KIERNAN: Professor Sabato, I want to if I could ask you one question and that is you've seen -- you've seen them come and go, you've seen contentious elections, you've seen contentious campaigns but what is the -- what is the way for us to evaluate and think about Trump's start, he's done some great things, he's had speed bumps. Where do you see him in continuum of things and what should we be taking from this is just starting out and rough spots and what should be longer term concerns if there are any?</p><p>SABATO: Well, he's been in office for 14 days. It is a four-year term. I told people, you know, suspend judgment, you give anybody a reasonable trial period. Whenever we start a new job, often we have a rough period, so, you know, his supporters are pleased, they're focusing on the things they like, and his opponents, their disbeliefs, they're focusing on things they don't like. Let's see how this turns out as we move into, you know, a six-month period or the first 100 days ends which ends at the end of April. That seems like a much fair trial period.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Let me switch gears and ask you about the president's cabinet, I mean, obviously another member was added yesterday, former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, Larry was confirmed and sworn in as secretary of state but there are other nominees that are facing real roadblocks. Two republican senators say they will vote against Trump's pick for education secretary, that's Betsy DeVos, If these senators follow through, republicans would only need one more no vote to block DeVos' appointment, what do you think here? That the White House administration shared their confidence that Betsy DeVos would be confirmed and listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEAN SPICER, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I have one hundred percent confidence she will be next secretary of education. She is unbelievably qualified educator, an advocate for students, teachers, parents. It will be, you know, I think that the games that are being played with Betsy DeVos are sad.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: How do you see it, Larry? Do you think she will get confirmed?</p><p>SABATO: Well, obviously it's a -- it's a close call. Let's remember, historically a president losses on one cabinet member, either the person is forced to withdraw or doesn't pass the senate. Something happens usually to at least one some have two or three, I think DeVos might be the only one, I don't know whether she will lose another republican or not or whether she will gain one democratic vote, you know, there's always Senator Joe Manchin from West Virginia, I haven't heard him speak yet on how he's going to vote, maybe he issued a statement and I missed it.</p><p>But, you know, the broader picture is -- I think represented by someone like Rex Tillerson. I've had the opportunity to meet Mr. Tillerson talk with him in his prior role over the years on a number of occasions. I think he will make a very good secretary, I think people will be surprised that how well-trained he has become, thanks to being CEO of ExxonMobil which is big and has its own foreign policy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Larry.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Larry, in terms of how the democrats handle four years of the Trump administration because there is so much outrage on social media about the Hillary Clinton loss, about Donald Trump, and they're really pushing the leadership whether it's Nancy Pelosi or Chuck Schumer to fight the Trump administration at every single step. Is this what we're going to get for four years and will it get worse?</p><p>SABATO: I don't think you will and I certainly don't think it's wise to do that simply because you can't fight everything, I mean, that's -- it's absurd to even try to do that, you have to focus your attention on items or individuals that really concern you. And actually the Supreme Court nominee is going to be a good test, do you -- do you really spend all of your limited ammunition on somebody who's almost certain to be confirmed?</p><p>And it's a pretty impressive person when you listen to him, you read his credentials, whether you agree with him or not, I mean, that's not -- that's beside the point. Or do you wait for that critical change that's coming when Ginsburg or Kennedy or Briar steps aside, that's when the court will change. That's when to use your ammunition. Don't lose the filibuster on Gorsuch.</p><p>So there are important distinctions here and it's up to the leadership, you mentioned, leadership in universities, it's up to party leadership to make that case to the rank and file. If they're angry, they're angry but they also have to -- have to use sense.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. But I mean, what about all the other be pushback from these -- from, you know, on these nominees? I mean, do you think this is obstruction by the democrats or is this just politics as usual?</p><p>SABATO: Well, it's -- this is a continuum. If you look back over, you know, 30 years, you'll see that it's gotten worse and worse and worse just as polarization has gotten worse. So I would say with each do administration we seem to go a step or two or three further along this line of division which is not healthy for the country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: No. It isn't.</p><p>SABATO: I don't have much optimism that it's going to change any time soon.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Larry. We'll leave it there. Good to see you. Thanks so much. Larry Sabato.</p><p>SABATO: Thanks a lot. Take care.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll take a short break. When we come back we are awaiting remarks from President Trump at the National Prayer Breakfast, you see that on the bottom of your screen here. And then coming up. First Lady Melania Trump getting ready for a big change as she's gearing up for move to the White House, that's next. And then investors hoping for a belated Christmas gift on Amazon's 4th quarter earnings. What to expect from the Ecommerce retailer straight ahead.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Market this morning expected to open lower, stocks soared after the presidential election of course, but the Trump rally has been slowing down, this year, leading investors to look into Trump policy before they make their next move. Joining me right now is CalPERS Chief Investment Officer Ted Eliopoulos joining us right now. And Ted, it's great to have you on the show today..</p><p>TED ELIOPOULOS, CALPERS CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER: Maria, thank you --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>ELIOPOULOS: Thank you for having me. It's so nice to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know, it's important to check in with you because you are overseeing such a massive amount of capital, $306 billion, is that right? The AUM at CalPERS right now?</p><p>ELIOPOULOS: That's exactly right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How are you allocating that and has it changed with the new administration coming in?</p><p>ELIOPOULOS: Well, we're allocating it according to our long-term strategic asset allocation of course and we're heavily waited to equities in our strategic allocation. And really going into this U.S. election, we position the portfolio to -- take into account both the hopes for equity allocations in the future but also the risks of this election. Post- election is really the same story. There is much hope and optimism for growth in the U.S. in positioning of portfolios to take advantage of that growth. CalPERS benefited immensely from the run-up in equity markets over the last month and a half for sure. Now the question really is as you know, what happens in the future?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, I think this market was really rallying on the idea that we would see corporate tax reform, obviously a 15 percent corporate tax rate or a 20 percent corporate tax rate, would do a lot for earnings, yes?</p><p>ELIOPOULOS: Yes, it would. As well as regulatory reform.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>ELIOPOULOS: Both would be very productive for growth in the U.S. and translate to better earnings, better equity returns for the future. But there are also some risks to take into account. One is what impact on inflation, we have been on a -- in a very low inflation -- inflationary environment and what impact could be on inflation is something to keep an eye on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How do you prepare yourself as an asset manager for that? I mean when you look at inflation perhaps on the horizon, does that change your assessment of what to do with bonds versus stocks?</p><p>ELIOPOULOS: Well, it's very difficult spot for investors right now because you have to prepare for some divergent outcomes is -- are we having inflationary environment going forward or continue to have a deflationary environment? There is no one portfolio that's going to be maximized in each of those environment. So, for CalPERS, we have such a dominate equity position in our portfolio, almost 48 percent of the portfolio today. We have bought some inflation protective securities and repositioned the portfolio as well as commodities in the run-up to the election.</p><p>BARTIROMO: In terms of 48 percent in equities, is that through index funds, ETFs or specific names?</p><p>ELIOPOULOS: We're direct in the -- in that global index of stocks, so we are predominantly an index investor with enhancements that we do mostly internally with our internal global equity.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What are the enhancements? Tell us about that because today, you can buy an index with whatever combination you want, right?</p><p>ELIOPOULOS: That's right. So, we have several factors we look at, it could be momentum, value, quality, low volatility, maximum diversification, there are risk factors that allow us to tilt the portfolio slightly in directions that we see benefit.</p><p>BARTIROMO: When you look at overall areas that you have to allocate capital, we talked in the past about hedge funds and you've been vocal about -- look, the fees are something to watch, and it's not as, you know, a profitable thing anymore as well as private equity. You're developing plans to shift somewhat, $30 billion in terms of private equity away from - - what are you doing in terms of shifting?</p><p>ELIOPOULOS: Sure, yes</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're going to move in-house as pensions cut fees.</p><p>ELIOPOULOS: Yes. We're trying to bring as much in-house as we can, we have over 70 percent of our portfolio we managed internally. Most of that is in a public asset classes. We have added a new allocation to actually opportunistic credit, to new credit strategy, structured credit, private, we think that's an opportunity for the future. And that bringing -- we have that talent in-house, we have active fixed income managers within our staff that are able to execute those strategies with confidence.</p><p>In the private market much is a much tougher assessment whether you can bring in-house, those strategies, and we're not sure right now on the private equity side that we could effectuate a strategy to compete with the external managers that are our partners that have done extraordinarily well for us overtime. The fees are high but the returns and the performance net of all those fees have been quite robust, and persistent for over 20 years for now -- for us now. So, it is a very important calculus to try and adjust the external internal model internally.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you have any concern that we're not going to see the tax cuts and the rollback of regulations instituted this year and would that dictate a change in the way you invest in all those equities?</p><p>ELIOPOULOS: Well, we'll stay heavily invested in equities for the long term, we are a long-term investor, we'll be watching quite closely over the next six months to see how difficult and how swift these policy changes may come.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Because people are wondering if in fact, you know, there's money for this. I mean, yes, they want it revenue neutral and one of the president's underlying Mick Mulvaney says, look, we got to take a chopping block to the entitlements as the guy running who's running the largest pension fund, CalPERS out there in the country, what's your take on cutting entitlements?.</p><p>ELIOPOULOS: Well, you know, these are -- these are promises that have been made to -- ordinary pensioners, that's our -- that's our view. For CalPERS, our duty is to pensioners and we have hardworking policemen, firemen firewomen --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Going to keep those promises.</p><p>ELIOPOULOS: You have to keep those promises, so the key to make sure you price them and you save for them in order to keep those promises for the long term.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ted, it's great to have you on the show today.</p><p>ELIOPOULOS: Thank you for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Ted Eliopoulos is the chief investment officer of CalPERS. We have breaking news right now, the hostage situation at a Delaware Prison. The prison is now secure, one hostage has been found dead, another has been hospitalized. This breaking news just happening, we are going to have details for you when we come right back after this. You see the lineup of people there, we'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The hostage situation at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center in Delaware ended tragically. Lauren Simonetti with details right now.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER: Hey, Maria. So state police rushed into the building when the two hostages were still being held from last night into early this morning. One of them, a prison officer was found dead, they were taken hostage by the inmates. The other one fortunately was rescued. The correctional officers union president said, \"It is a sad day for Delaware Correctional Officers,\" well, a sad day indeed. Inmates had told a local newspaper that concerns about their treatment and the leadership of the U.S. prompted their actions.</p><p>All right. Let's move to markets here. Big day for earnings, Merck's report just coming in. Quarterly profit in line with estimates. The company posted and adjusted profit of 89 cents a share, revenue however narrowly missed the estimate, hurt by weak sales of its key Immuno-oncology drug KEYTRUDA as well as its diabetes medicine. And it was a record Christmas for Ecommerce sales, that is expected to boost Amazon earnings when the company reports after the closing bell today, Amazon did say that this holiday season, it was its best one ever.</p><p>ChipotleMexican Grill also reports after the close, the company still working to recover from those big losses from foodborne bacteria that actually made some customers sick. That was back in 2015. Chipotle has already said that sales for the holiday quarter probably fell five percent. And visa reporting after the close today as well, analysts expected the company to post a profit 78 cents a share. Well, it's February 2nd, groundhog day and Punxsutawney Phil says, \"I'm sorry, six more weeks of winter.\"</p><p>A short time ago he happened to see his shadow and according to legend that means spring's arrival is going to have wait a little bit longer, how accurate is Phil? Well, according to reports, going back to 1988, he's been correct 46 percent at the time. And finally, First Lady Melania Trump will be moving to White House at the start of summer. Aides say she will be settling in at the end of the school year and splitting her time between New York and D.C. The White House also announced Lindsey Reynolds will be joining the first lady's team as chief of staff, apart from that job, Reynolds is also an assistant to President Donald Trump. Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Thank you so much, Lauren. Coming up, Tex Tillerson taking the helm as secretary of state despite delays caused by democrats. The future of the party next when we take a look at confirmation process, where do we stand? Then Tasca losing a part of its title as it looks to expand beyond cars, the changes to the automaker coming up. Back in a moment. .</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. happy Thursday everybody.

Tillerson just latest confirmation fight between the president and democrats.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: -- very demeaning on other side. And they want to make you look as bad as possible, I think there is a certain dishonesty if they go against -- from not very long ago and he did get a unanimous endorsement.</p><p>REX TILLERSON, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE: I'm not concerned about that and I can tell you why, because I think that their record of obstruction is going to wear same with the people. We didn't obstruct and so we think that our -- republican president ought to have the same consideration.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>MARIA BARTIROMO, </nameText></person>FOX BUSINESS NETWORK MORNINGS WITH MARIA HOST: The very latest on the tensions coming up this morning.

Blake Burman with the very latest right now at the White House, Blake.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Hi there, Maria. Good morning to you. Despite reservations really on both sides of the aisle with past business dealings with Russia, the Senate yesterday did indeed confirmed Rex Tillerson to become the next Secretary of State. A very narrow nomination but it passed, nonetheless.</p><p>He then came here to the White House, the Former ExxonMobil CEO did and with the President and Vice President by his side, he was officially sworn in. The president also turned some heads yesterday at the White House earlier in the day in which he appeared to give the OK for the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to change the Senate rules, should it get to that point with another nomination. That being the Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch.</p><p>(BEHIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: If we end up with the same gridlock that they've had in Washington for the last -- longer than eight years in all fairness to President Obama -- a lot longer than eight years. Then we end up with that gridlock, I would say if you can Mitch, don't go near. Because that would be an absolute shame if a man of this quality was caught up in the web.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: You heard the president there say go nuclear. That refers to the so-called Nuclear Option, which would eliminate the 60 votes filibuster threshold that Democrats are calling for and bring it down to 51. I asked the White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer about this yesterday Maria, whether the White House would be comfortable going forward with that path, Spicer told me that it's not the president's preference at this point, and that essentially, it would Mitch McConnell's call. We'll see if it gets to that point, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Blake. Thank you so much. Blake Burman at the White House. Joining us right now is the man who ran against Nancy Pelosi for Minority Leader. Ohio<person><nameText>Congressman Tim Ryan </nameText></person>is with us. And congressman, it's good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p><person><nameText>TIM RYAN, </nameText></person>UNITED STATES CONGRESSMAN OF OHIO: Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, your reaction to all of these stall tactics on the side of Democrats, Sir, I mean, obviously, they are stopping and trying to do whatever they can to stall President Trump from having his cabinet in place.</p><p>RYAN: Well, I mean, that's the process. I mean, we're not messy democracy, that's where we live. You know, you saw it happen during President Obama's tenure where the Republicans were literally blocking every single thing he tried to do. Jobs, bill of Supreme Court Nominee, so now there is some real disagreement I think, whether it's with the Supreme Court Justice or some of his nominees that violates some of the basic values that, I think, Democrats have.</p><p>So, it's important for us to stand up, Republicans have the majority, they are getting some of their nominees through, but this is all part of the process, and I don't think it's anything unnecessary is happening but we get - we have to stand up for what we believe in too.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What specific values are being violated?</p><p>RYAN: Well, I think if you look at The Supreme Court Nominee, Trump, you know, campaigned about draining the swamp. The Supreme Court Nominee is not for any kind of campaign finance reform at all. I think if you look, you know, at DeVos for example, the Secretary of Education absolutely no experience in public education and also owes Ohio $5 million from fines that she got a few years ago, when she was involved in another organization that she hasn't paid. I mean, these are legitimate things that -</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well wait a second -</p><p>RYAN: Obviously, we need to talk about.</p><p>BARTIROMO: When you say Judge Gorsuch, I mean, this is the individual who was confirmed unanimously just 10 years ago by Republicans and Democrats. So, what changed other than him being Donald Trump's pick?</p><p>RYAN: Well, I think the fact that Donald Trump campaigned on draining the swamp, that he is not for draining the swamp, he is for, you know, unfettered money coming into politics with many, many people are against. President Trump campaigned --</p><p>Maria: Yes. I want to ask you about draining the swamp.</p><p>RYAN: Hold on. Hold on, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Go ahead.</p><p>RYAN: He also campaigned on helping working class people where the Supreme Court Nominee is against right to work which would allow working class people to organize. So, I think these are legitimate things that we are going to have fights over. Let's not make too big a of a deal out of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK, all right. Well, the problem is that the president needs a team in place in order to execute some of the promises he's made. I got to get my team in here for you but I have one more question on draining the swamp for you because there's an article right now, saying Nancy Pelosi is leading her party into oblivion. I mean, Nancy Pelosi said that the -- Judge Gorsuch is hostile to women's productive rights, hostility toward children and school, children with autism, hostile appointments. And as far as President Trump, she says he's been wreck less and incompetent in his recent Executive Order. I mean, does she not understand what just happened in terms of the election? She is going against what the people just voted for.</p><p>RYAN: Well, I mean Democrats, not to be too frank, but we are in oblivion as we speak now. I mean, we are completely wiped out in the election so we're trying to work our way back. But I think Donald Trump also campaigned, Maria, on stability and he's doing everything in his power to make the globe more unstable at this point.</p><p>You see, the rally with the stock market has subsided a bit because he is picking fights, he's doing things with -- the Muslim ban and immigration that makes us look hostile to our allies in Muslim countries and Muslims here in the United States when we know that these are very important things that the kind of stability that we need.</p><p>He campaigned on bringing us that stability. And he is making things unstable, he campaigned on making us stronger and the Muslim ban makes it harder for us to prosecute the war on terrorism.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Congressman, I have to push back. It's not a Muslim ban. These are seven countries that were identified by the Obama Administration. And the restrictions are based on country, not religion, first and foremost. But I want to get back to Nancy Pelosi and the loss of the Democrats in rebuilding the party and making a comeback is -- but is the way to do that, this kind of fierce rhetoric and opposition that you're getting from not only Nancy Pelosi, but also Chuck Schumer. Is that how you win over voters over the next two to four years?</p><p>RYAN: Well, you know, you have to take a stand on things that you believe in, and it may not always be popular in the moment. I'm not into real hostile rhetoric. I'm not into inflaming the situation. We have enough of that in Washington. We need to reach out to each other and see if we can find some common ground. But</p><p>I will tell you, that it is the Chief Executive's responsibility to do that. I mean, he hasn't even reached out to his own national security people, for example, with the immigration issue that we were just talking about. He even didn't talk to his own people. They're not talking to Democrats, that's the responsibility of the President of The United States. President Obama did a lot of reaching out to Republicans, early on, through a lot of the affordable care stuff. He was always reaching out.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, come on. The Affordable Care Act? Don't go there. He don't care and he pushed through and he had absolutely no support on the Republican side at all.</p><p>RYAN: Are you kidding me? He had no support? I'm saying he reached out for months and months. And including in the Stimulus Bill, incorporated the tax cuts into the Stimulus Bill that many Democrats didn't want. We wanted straight infrastructure spending to juice up the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Why did he have to do so many Executive Orders, then? Then how come he had to do so many Executive Orders?</p><p>RYAN: OK. Because the Republicans were blocking every single thing he did. He had no choice. But if he wants to get anything done to do Executive Orders, you know it and I know it -</p><p>BARTIROMO: No. I don't know that. I don't know that at all.</p><p>RYAN: Mitch McConnell said that his number one goal -- Mitch McConnell said his number one goal was to make sure President Obama didn't have a second term.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, I think -</p><p>RYAN: They blocked his jobs bill, they didn't vote, not one vote for health care, their whole M.O. was to destroy Obama and make him a one termer. So, don't turn around two weeks into Trump's presidency and say, \"Boy, you guys are being really unfair.\" Look, this is not the rotary club. This is politics. It's a full contact support. If you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ryan, I think it's also important to know that part of the reason Donald Trump won the election is because of those Executive Orders. It was as much a repudiation against President Obama, as it was the fact that there was no message from your candidate.</p><p>RYAN: Well, look.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let's not forget what the reality is. Your team lost.</p><p>RYAN: And I like some of his Executive Orders. Small business regulations, I agree with it. Re-negotiating TPP, I agree with it. Finding a way to make NAFTA work for places like Youngstown in Warren Akron, Ohio sit? Let's sit down and do that. I'm not here to butt heads with him at every turn. I'm here to work with him if we can. But as I said, he's not even reaching out to his own people on policy decisions, he's certainly not reaching out the Democrats. But when we stand ready if there is something we can work on.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Congressman, one final question. Are the Democrats going to put anybody under 70 years old in power? In leadership?</p><p>RYAN: Well -- I did my part I did my part to try to try. You know, I think we do need new faces in the democratic party and I think we need a solid approach that reaches out to all corners of the country. I think we have a good agenda that we need to just push and get out. We need to rebuild the country, we need broadband in every corner of the country to unlock certain communities that just can't compete in the new economy because they don't have the new America 2.0 infrastructure like broadband. And, you know, education reform and all the rest. So we have an agenda but we've got to be willing to sit down and try to get it through.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, part of that issue is the party is being hijacked by the extreme left. Is that a fair statement?</p><p>RYAN: Well, we're in an era in the country of extreme partisanship and I think President Trump needs to do a better job of figuring out how to do things without inciting everybody in the country and in the world. Now you look at what is going on with refugees and people coming over here.</p><p>Look, no bureaucratic system is perfect. If there's things we need to do to sit down and some, fine. But the reality is, if we're going to be real concerned with refugees coming over here or people coming over here as terrorists, they're probability not going to come from Yemen. They're probably not going to come from Syria. &gt;</p><p>BARTIROMO: Why not?</p><p>RYAN: They're probably going to be smart enough to come through a European country into the United States. And so let's sit down and figure out how we can work with our European allies to tighten things up to make sure that we are covering the entire ground. We have a really strong vetting process, of course it can be improved but he didn't need to do it in a way that makes it hostile to where tech companies are freaking out because, you know, they have Muslim workers to where a doctor at the Cleveland clinic is getting stopped and not allowed back into the country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>RYAN: You don't need to do this. It just - there's too much chaos with Trump, too much drama. Sit down, relax, breathe in through nose and let's figure out how to work together and get the country going again.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Real quick. Peter Kiernan.</p><p>PETER KIERNAN, NEW YORK TIMES BEST-SELLING AUTHOR: Well I have to say I watched you closely when you were running your campaign for -- excuse me -- minority leader. I think you would have made a great one. I don't believe you would have fought at every single step, at every single turn, the way Schumer and Nancy Pelosi are. Do you have a reaction to that?</p><p>RYAN: I think we do need to pick our spots. I think we've got to find points of agreement and -- but there are people are -- excited about a couple of these nominees. I think that the immigration issue, the Muslim issue, insight a lot of people's sensibilities including mine that, you know, you're going to put Muslims back in the line trying to get in the country. You're going to tell refugees who want to come into a safe haven, sometimes United States, sometimes other countries that are coming from a war that we started guys. I mean, we started this war. So we have some responsibility. So, no. I don't think you fight on every turn, I think you try to find some common ground.</p><p>But when there are basic issues that violate our values, you stand up and you fight. And we're giving him, I think, will give him a lot more hearings for Supreme Court justice than the Republicans gave the President Obama. So, it's important for us to remember that as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congressman, it's good to have you on the program this morning. We'll be watching. Thanks so much.</p><p>RYAN: Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: <person><nameText>Congressman Tim Ryan, </nameText></person>joining us there. Coming up, we are waiting remarks from President Trump at the National Breakfast. The Prayer Breakfast. We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. 45 minutes away from the opening bell. Markets are looking lower this morning. We are at the lows of the morning right now. And the DOW Industrials average now expecting a decline of about 60 points. NASDAQ, down in 11. Couple of names are watching Macy's. The stock is looking higher this morning reportedly considering a possible sale. The New York Post is reporting that longtime CEO Terry Lundgren is set to be weighing the move before he steps down later this quarter. Macy's shares and we're seeing a bit off. Tesla Motors dropping the motors. The name change to Tesla Inc. chose the company's ambition to move beyond just selling high end electric cars and shifting into energy products like solar panels and home batteries. Tesla agreed to acquire Solar City, remember, for $2.6 billion. That was back in November.</p><p>Blowout earnings from big technology names like Microsoft, Apple, Facebook. Amazon is reporting tonight. And the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\", Stuart Varney joins me. Taking a look at tech in the spotlight, Stu. Good morning.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK VARNEY &amp; COMPANY HOST: I continue my astonishment at the financial performance of America's big tech companies. As you point out, Apple, $246 billion in cash, Facebook last night, 1.8 billion monthly users and a ton of money coming over every year. And tonight, it's Amazon. I don't know whether they're going to disappoint or what. But I do know that if you look at the numbers, it will be a shock.</p><p>Maria, you and I have covered financial news for a few years. I have covered it for decades longer than you have and I have never, ever seen such a concentration of financial power among the four or five top American big name technology companies. Never seen this before. And remember, they are now in opposition to President Trump. Both on ideologic grounds and on trade grounds, on visa grounds, this is quite a confrontation that's coming here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's incredible. Part of the issue, I think, is because technology is seeped into so many other industries, Stu. Right? I mean, tech has changed transportation, it's changed health care, it's changed retailing. So, one of the reasons for power base is that it's not just traditional tech, it's technology changing so many other industries.</p><p>VARNEY: That is very true. I mean, it seeped into the automobile industry.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That, too.</p><p>VARNEY: I mean, I don't know what percentage of a car these days comes from Silicon Valley or is computer oriented. It's big and it's growing. I just -- I don't think I've ever seen that kind of concentration of financial power. The money these guys have, the influence that brings, is really astonishing. I love it, by the way.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We know President Trump doesn't like monopolies. So, we'll see where that goes.</p><p>VARNEY: Who wants a monopoly?</p><p>BARTIROMO: See you in about 10 minutes, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY: You will.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you. \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" again at the top of the hour right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA. Join Stuart, 9:00 a.m. Eastern this morning.</p><p>Coming up, the NFL takes its Super Bowl patrons on the ride of their life. Our own Cheryl Casone is on the ground in Houston with former NFL Star, Jack Brewer. Check it out. We're going to join them momentarily. back in a minute.</p><p>Then, they took an interstellar journey that made even jack brewer scream.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Houston, of course home to NASA's Johnson Space Center so it should come as no surprise that the space travel agency will play a part in the pre-Super Bowl festivities. Our own Cheryl Casone and Former NFL Star Jack Brewer took a ride on NASA's 90-foot virtual reality simulated trip to mars and back. And they lived to tell the tale. Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTOR: Maria, good morning. Yes, it was a two-minute ride but it was full of thrills. NASA does, someday, want go to mars. They're working with Boeing and race it on to make it happen. But as far as the ride itself, Jack, how would you describe what we went through yesterday for Maria?</p><p>JACK BREWER, FORMER NFL STAR: I was freaked out.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BREWER: Whoa.</p><p>CASONE: We're ready. Let's do this.</p><p>BREWER: Let's do this.</p><p>CASONE: We're about to go up 90 feet so we can drop 90 feet. Jack, you are afraid of heights. Right?</p><p>BREWER: I can't believe you talked me into this.</p><p>CASONE: We're standing in the middle of the field in NRG Stadium.</p><p>BREWER: Maria, the only thing missing here is you.</p><p>CASONE: Oh, boy. We're above the Earth.</p><p>BREWER: Oh, my God.</p><p>CASONE: We're in space, Jack. We're on the Orion Spacecraft.</p><p>BREWER: Yes.</p><p>CASONE: We're approaching Mars.</p><p>BREWER: It's kind of beautiful, actually.</p><p>CASONE: Yes.</p><p>BREWER: Wow.</p><p>BREWER: I did not say anything that was not on T.V. It was amazing.</p><p>CASONE: That was cool. That was cool. Jack, here we go.</p><p>BREWER: Oh, man.</p><p>CASONE: That was crazy. Are you OK?</p><p>BREWER: Yes. I was just happy that I -</p><p>CASONE: I'm a little dizzy. Look, we just want to mars, Maria. you owe us.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: What we do for you, Maria. Right, Jack?</p><p>BREWER: That is right. We love you.</p><p>CASONE: We love you. It was a lot of fun. It was a bit crazy out there but all the fans can come in and experience that today. If they're in Texas, come on down in the Super Bowl live.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You guys have real spunk. Dagen and I were just talking about when you went on that roller-coaster ride, Cheryl. Wow.</p><p>Meanwhile, how about this, guys? Former President George H.W. Bush and his wife Barbara are flipping the coin before the 2017 Super Bowl according to their spokesperson. Jack, what do you think about that? Who do you think the former president is rooting for?</p><p>BREWER: Well, I mean. I am sure he's already a fan. But down deeply in his heart, he wishes he was watching the Dallas Cowboys. But you know, President Bush is a very, very admired person in Texas, you know. I am a Texan as well as Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Yes. This is our home state, Maria. But you know, the thing is, this is his hometown and there's so much buzz because there's just so many well wishes from him that are coming from all over just on a local perspective. But I can't imagine what that stadium is going to be like when he comes out to do that coin toss on Sunday. We are going to be there so we will let you know.</p><p>BREWER: No question.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, guys. Thank you, Cheryl and jack. We will see you later, thanks for that. And remember you can watch Super Bowl only on one network live on the Fox Network. This Sunday night, 6:30 pm Eastern. We will be watching.</p><p>CASONE: Yes, we will.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We'll take a short break. Final thoughts from our all-star panel when we come right back. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We're awaiting comments from President Trump at the National Prayer Breakfast. We want to get some final thoughts are we're all scratching our heads trying to figure out what <person><nameText>Congressman Tim Ryan </nameText></person>just said about we started this war. Twitter's going nuts about it too. Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I just -- to push back on that, I don't know exactly what he's talking about as if we asked for 9/11 going down that road, but in terms of Syria and the refugee crisis, Trump -- President Trump is now trying to deal with. The situation in Syria erupted because of the vacuum by President Obama. There was a red line that wasn't honored. And Assad and Putin, essentially took over. So, let's blame and put blame where it needs to lie.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And that's the bottom line. Thank you Morgan Ortagus, Peter Kiernan, Dagen McDowell. It's a pleasure. We'll see you tomorrow, everybody. Here's Stuart.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2017020203cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5MSN-N1G1-DXH2-6002-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7703\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"02\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>February 2, 2017 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS523930 INVESTMENT ADVICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS523920 PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS523110 INVESTMENT BANKING &amp; SECURITIES DEALING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>SIC6289 SERVICES ALLIED WITH THE EXCHANGE OF SECURITIES OR COMMODITIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>SIC6282 INVESTMENT ADVICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>SIC6211 SECURITY BROKERS, DEALERS, &amp; FLOTATION COMPANIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>GS (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Punxsutawney Phil</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>CalPERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Milo Yiannopoulos</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Amazon</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>James T.

It's only black and white, which makes it an interesting time to be an investor.\"</p><p>Who's correct on the data will not be known until the economic impact is felt, which could take months or even years. But for investors, any plan based on waiting or wishing is not ideal.</p><p>After all, even before President Trump began to shake up economic norms, with his criticism of the Federal Reserve, threats of tariffs and nonchalance about government debt, investors were skeptical of the economic expansion, which has run, with a few minor dips, from March 2009 to the present.</p><p>A wait-and-see approach on investing can be costly, but moving too quickly at this stage could be ruinous if the market goes into a correction. Advisers to some of the country's wealthiest people say to keep investing but to do it wisely.</p><p>Here are four tips for investors in a time of caution:</p><p>Diversify Your Portfolio</p><p>Mr. Trump has made many comments that in a different time would have caused the economy to tank. Military threats against North Korea and Iran, tariffs against the United States' largest trading partners, all manner of statements about Russia - none of them has caused a market correction.</p><p>Instead, the opposite has happened this year, as investors find opportunities in market fluctuations. \"We've seen cash come in to buy on the dips,\" Mr. Crowell said.</p><p>And for a seemingly sound reason: Companies continue to grow. The Republican tax cut that was enacted last year and a rollback of financial regulations have helped, but so have strong earnings that have outpaced price increases.</p><p>\"The stimulative measures have bolstered confidence that growth and the economy is going to be strong over the next couple of years,\" Mr. Crowell said.</p><p>Advisers agree that the recovery has been running for some time and is near the point where bull markets typically begin to falter. But that does not mean the run will end this year or next or even the year after that.</p><p>\"Consumer wealth is at all-time highs when you factor in home prices and the stock market,\" said Henry B. Smith, co-chief investment officer at the Haverford Trust Company, which manages $8 billion. \"One of the lacking ingredients throughout this has been business investment, and that is starting to pick up.\"</p><p>Mr. Smith is advising his clients to have the maximum exposure to equities that they can stomach. But he is also telling them to think more broadly about equities.</p><p>Investors often overlook the moderating role of value stocks, which are steady, dividend-paying stocks that can help weather various economic storms. Instead, they often pursue the higher returns of growth stocks, which are expected to grow at an above-average rate.</p><p>Mr. Smith said investors should think about trimming back investments in manufacturing, technology and financial services to increase holdings of consumer staples, health care, telecommunication and utility stocks, the basics of value investing.</p><p>He cited last week's sudden drop in the value of Facebook as reason to broaden your view of equities. \"Last week was a good reminder that stocks that go up sharply can also come down sharply,\" he said.</p><p>Be Aware of Opportunities</p><p>Many investors seem willing to forget that the returns of the past decade have been strong and that replicating them going forward may be difficult. In other words, stay invested in riskier assets while they continue to run, because selling them too early could hurt your portfolio.</p><p>\"When we look at demographics and economic projections, there isn't going to be as much population growth and consumption,\" said Anthony Roth, chief investment officer at Wilmington Trust. \"Most of the world has a population moving to slower consumption as they age. While this economic cycle is continuing, the risk of missing out is even greater.\"</p><p>Mr. Roth pointed to the reaction over the flattening of the yield curve, which tracks the difference between the interest rate on short-term bonds and long-term bonds. He said talk about the yield curve inverting - which means long-term borrowing costs become less than those in the short term - was premature.</p><p>\"The strongest period of the market cycle is from the time of yield curve inversion to the peak of the equity market, which is usually nine to 12 months after that,\" Mr. Roth said. \"We haven't even gotten to the inversion yet, which would suggest there's significant opportunity right now.\"</p><p>Yet investors need to pay attention. \"The alarm is when the yield curve inverts,\" he said. \"It's a predictor of both recessions and returns in the market.\"</p><p>Actively monitoring economic data and what it presages is a smart strategy.</p><p>Pick Recession-Resistant Stocks</p><p>Most analysts believe that Mr. Trump is bluffing on tariffs and that they are being used as a negotiating tool. This comes from the school of thought that favors what the president does over what he says.</p><p>For instance, after saying so many harsh things about European trading partners, Mr. Trump embraced Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, just last week.</p><p>\"The worst case is, Trump just gets in a fight with China, Europe and everyone else and we see an escalation of tariffs that slows world trade and has a significant impact on the U.S. economic cycle, increases inflationary pressures and ultimately reduces output,\" said John S. Osterweis, chairman and chief investment officer of Osterweis Capital Management, which manages about $7 billion.</p><p>That would be crushing, but it is not the only possible outcome.</p><p>\"The flip side is, Trump really is a master negotiator and what he's doing is trying to move away from multilateral trade agreements to bilateral agreements,\" Mr. Osterweis said. That may produce better trade deals, he said.</p><p>Lacking any idea as to which outcome to expect, Mr. Osterweis has been encouraging clients to invest in companies whose outlooks are less dependent on the economy or a particular industry, he said.</p><p>\"You could think of a Google, where people's search habits aren't going to change dramatically if there's a recession and there's already an inexorable migration of ad dollars to that company,\" he said. \"You could look at a drug company with a blockbuster drug coming through the pipeline or a Disney, where they have the next unbelievably popular movie coming out.\"</p><p>The opposite would be manufacturing companies like automakers that stockpile inventory and could struggle to sell it in a recession. Still, some combination of different types of companies is the more prudent bet.</p><p>Consider the Tax Implications</p><p>Facebook's loss of nearly 20 percent of its value in one day was substantial. But Mr. Crowell said it should not cause people to run from the Big Tech stocks like Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook and Netflix.</p><p>What it should do is get people thinking about the need to examine their portfolios. \"It's prudent to be mindful that those four names don't define a diversified portfolio,\" he said.</p><p>Another reason not to sell off stocks that have appreciated greatly is taxes. People who have held those stocks for a long time have watched them run up in value, which means they are going to owe a lot of money in taxes when they sell them.</p><p>Todd Morgan, chairman of Bel Air Investment Advisors, which manages about $8 billion for high-net-worth families, said he shows clients how much the stock of a fundamentally strong company would have to fall before selling it made sense.</p><p>\"People don't look at the after-tax returns,\" Mr. Morgan said. \"I've had several calls about tech stocks the past few days, all asking, 'Should we stay in or get out?'\"</p><p>If an investor thinks a company is going to drop below what would be owed in capital gains taxes, then it is time to get out.</p><p>Investors need to keep paying attention to company fundamentals and economic indicators focused on inflation and wages. If either of those runs too high, the Federal Reserve is likely to raise interest rates, which could bring the equity party to an end.</p><p>Since neither is happening now, the best advice is to stay invested and stay alert.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000006036089</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T0S-B821-DYR7-C194-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1568\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 5, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>CC00026CX</classCode><className>D A DAVIDSON &amp;

Still, some combination of different types of companies is the more prudent bet.</p><p>Consider the Tax Implications</p><p>Facebook\u2019s loss of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/26/business/facebook-stock-earnings-call.html\">nearly 20 percent of its value</url> in one day was substantial. But Mr. Crowell said it should not cause people to run from the Big Tech stocks like Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook and Netflix.</p><p>What it should do is get people thinking about the need to examine their portfolios. \u201cIt\u2019s prudent to be mindful that those four names don\u2019t define a diversified portfolio,\u201d he said.</p><p>Another reason not to sell off stocks that have appreciated greatly is taxes. People who have held those stocks for a long time have watched them run up in value, which means they are going to owe a lot of money in taxes when they sell them.</p><p>Todd Morgan, chairman of Bel Air Investment Advisors, which manages about $8 billion for high-net-worth families, said he shows clients how much the stock of a fundamentally strong company would have to fall before selling it made sense.</p><p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t look at the after-tax returns,\u201d Mr. Morgan said. \u201cI\u2019ve had several calls about tech stocks the past few days, all asking, \u2018Should we stay in or get out?\u2019\u201d</p><p>If an investor thinks a company is going to drop below what would be owed in capital gains taxes, then it is time to get out.</p><p>Investors need to keep paying attention to company fundamentals and economic indicators focused on inflation and wages. If either of those runs too high, the Federal Reserve is likely to raise interest rates, which could bring the equity party to an end.</p><p>Since neither is happening now, the best advice is to stay invested and stay alert.</p><p>PHOTO: Most investment advisers believe President Trump is bluffing on tariffs and using them as a negotiating tool.

But the good news is tempered by  investors' heavy reliance on five giant companies for a third of the gains over the past quarter, reflecting the digital economy's remarkable growth and its potential for fragility. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Three of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index leaders - Facebook, Apple and Amazon - have come under scrutiny from regulators and politicians in the last several months for their consumer dominance. Microsoft and Walt Disney round out the big five performers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(Amazon founder and chairman Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>The five companies together are worth more than $3.4 trillion as measured by the price of their stock. That is 14 percent of the combined value of all the companies in the S&amp;P 500, according to Howard Silverblatt of S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.</p><p>\"I would prefer broader market leadership and not such a narrow focus,\" said Charlie Toole, portfolio manager at Adviser Investments. \"When you have one or two or four names leading the market, you worry that if they trip up, it's going to trip up the entire market.\"</p><p>All three indexes are up on the year, with the S&amp;P 500 climbing 17 percent in the first six months, the Dow Jones industrial average registering a 14 percent gain and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index leading everybody with 20 percent.  </p><p>The Dow closed at 26,599, up 73 points on Friday to finish the month with a gain of7.1 percent, It was  its best first half since 1999 and best June since 1938, when it surged 24 percent. The S&amp;P 500 closed at 2,941, up 16 points on the day and up6.89 percent for June. The broad market posted its best June since 1955, when it climbed 8.2 percent. The Nasdaq composite finished up 38 points at 8,006, pushing its June rally to 7.4 percent. That's the Nasdaq's best June since 2000, when it gained 16.6 percent.</p><p>Stocks got a boost on several fronts toward the end of the week. The Federal Reserve signed off on stock buybacks and dividends for 18 big banks, spurring a rally in financial stocks. U.S. consumer spending in May increased moderately, feeding hopes for an interest rate cut. Consumer sentiment rose slightly above forecasts, although the measure has slipped since early May, when it posted a 15-year high.</p><p>High-tech dominance has been the story of the past several years of the bull market, with Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple nudging out legacy names like General Electric, Walmart and Exxon.</p><p>Money managers say investors need to own the big technology stocks or lose out.</p><p>\"Technology is where you have the revenue and profitability growth, and that's where stocks would be going up,\" said Krishna Memani, vice chair of Investments at Invesco.\"The number of stocks that have been able to do that has been narrow, so investors are willing to pay a high premium for those stocks rather than for a paper company .\"</p><p>The technology and communications service sectors, which cover four of the five leaders, together make up 30 percent of the S&amp;P, according to Silverblatt. Technology is up 26 percent this year.</p><p>\"I don't want to talk down the stock rally because there's only two or three stocks behind it,\" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank. \"A lot of times, the companies that are increasing at a greater rate naturally slow down and other companies come along and pick up the slack.\"</p><p>Technology companies have been under increased attention from Republican and Democratic leaders and from government regulators in the U.S. and abroad who say Big Tech has become too powerful.</p><p>Facebook co-founder and former spokesman Chris Hughes has called for the break-up of the social media giant. The U.S. Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission have put Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google parent Alphabet under heightened antitrust scrutiny.</p><p>Apple chief executive Tim Cook earlier this month disagreed with politicians such as presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, who called for the company's breakup. Cook said in an interview on \"CBS This Morning\" that Apple is not a monopoly, but he said \"scrutiny is fair.\"</p><p>Investor Michael Farr, president of the wealth management firm Farr, Miller &amp; Washington, said today's market leaders will sooner or later run out of steam, prompting investors to look for new faces or even to latch on to some old names that have been ignored and are cheap.</p><p>\"Everybody wants to bet on yesterday's fastest horse,\" Farr said. \"They don't care if they are healthy. But you have horses dropping dead and you've got to find a fresh one to ride.\"</p><p>Aerospace giant Boeing was among the Dow's best performers in 2018, but its stock has dropped around 20 percent in the last four months over its 737 Max problems. Disney shares, on the other hand, have risen more than 25 percent in the last two months, boosting its market cap by around $50 billion.</p><p>             Memani, Rupkey and others see big upside in stocks through the rest of 2019, even as anxiousness prevailed Friday ahead of a critical meeting between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the Group of 20 meeting in Japan.</p><p>Trump's obsession with rising stock prices has been one of the hallmarks of his presidency.          </p><p>              He even tweeted about the bull market, now in its 10th year, from the G-20:          </p><p>\"The Stock Market went up massively from the day after I won the Election, all the way up to the day that I took office, because of the enthusiasm for the fact that I was going to be President. That big Stock Market increase must be credited to me. If Hillary won - a Big Crash!\"</p><p>Rupkey said Trump \"will do whatever it takes to get stocks on track coming out of the weekend. The lesson of recent months is whatever the negative headline, somehow the trade talks get resurrected. So try not to hit the sell button.\"</p><p>Between Trump's stock market obsession and the Federal Reserve's willingness to use the money supply to bolster returns, some investors believe there is a safety net under the stock market.</p><p>\"We have to recognize the power of the Fed,\" said Kristina Hooper, global market strategist at Invesco. \"The Fed has placed a 'put' under the stock market over the past decade and could do so once again.\"</p><p>Hooper said investors might be concerned that the market is fragile because of its narrow leadership. \"But that has occurred in the past, and it doesn't have to end calamitously. The baton can get passed to other names.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:thomas.heath@washpost.com\">thomas.heath@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-4124d74e9a0811e98d0a5edd7e2025b1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WFT-BPJ1-JCDY-T16B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1099\"/><timeReceived>12:56 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 30, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002LO7</classCode><className>WALT DISNEY CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0001Y2C</classCode><className>DOW JONES &amp;

But the good news is tempered by  investors' heavy reliance on five giant companies for a third of the gains over the past quarter, reflecting the digital economy's remarkable growth and its potential for fragility.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Three of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index leaders - Facebook, Apple and Amazon - have come under scrutiny from regulators and politicians in the last several months for their consumer dominance. Microsoft and Walt Disney round out the big five performers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(Amazon founder and chairman Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>The five companies together are worth more than $3.4 trillion as measured by the price of their stock. That is 14 percent of the combined value of all the companies in the S&amp;P 500, according to Howard Silverblatt of S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.</p><p>\"I would prefer broader market leadership and not such a narrow focus,\" said Charlie Toole, portfolio manager at Adviser Investments. \"When you have one or two or four names leading the market, you worry that if they trip up, it's going to trip up the entire market.\"</p><p>All three indexes are up on the year, with the S&amp;P 500 climbing 17 percent in the first six months, the Dow Jones industrial average registering a 14 percent gain and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index leading everybody with 20 percent.</p><p>The Dow closed at 26,599, up 73 points on Friday to finish the month with a gain of   7.1 percent, It was  its best first half since 1999 and best June since 1938, when it surged 24 percent. The S&amp;P 500 closed at 2,941, up 16 points on the day and up6.89 percent for June. The broad market posted its best June since 1955, when it climbed 8.2 percent. The Nasdaq composite finished up 38 points at 8,006, pushing its June rally to 7.4 percent. That's the Nasdaq's best June since 2000, when it gained 16.6 percent.</p><p>Stocks got a boost on several fronts toward the end of the week. The Federal Reserve signed off on stock buybacks and dividends for 18 big banks, spurring a rally in financial stocks. U.S. consumer spending in May increased moderately, feeding hopes for an interest rate cut. Consumer sentiment rose slightly above forecasts, although the measure has slipped since early May, when it posted a 15-year high.</p><p>High-tech dominance has been the story of the past several years of the bull market, with Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple nudging out legacy names like General Electric, Walmart and Exxon.</p><p>Money managers say investors need to own the big technology stocks or lose out.</p><p>\"Technology is where you have the revenue and profitability growth, and that's where stocks would be going up,\" said Krishna Memani, vice chair of Investments at Invesco.\"The number of stocks that have been able to do that has been narrow, so investors are willing to pay a high premium for those stocks rather than for a paper company .\"</p><p>The technology and communications service sectors, which cover four of the five leaders, together make up 30 percent of the S&amp;P, according to Silverblatt. Technology is up 26 percent this year.</p><p>\"I don't want to talk down the stock rally because there's only two or three stocks behind it,\" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank. \"A lot of times, the companies that are increasing at a greater rate naturally slow down and other companies come along and pick up the slack.\"</p><p>Technology companies have been under increased attention from Republican and Democratic leaders and from government regulators in the U.S. and abroad who say Big Tech has become too powerful.</p><p>Facebook co-founder and former spokesman Chris Hughes has called for the break-up of the social media giant. The U.S. Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission have put Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google parent Alphabet under heightened antitrust scrutiny.</p><p>Apple chief executive Tim Cook earlier this month disagreed with politicians such as presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, who called for the company's breakup. Cook said in an interview on \"CBS This Morning\" that Apple is not a monopoly, but he said \"scrutiny is fair.\"</p><p>Investor Michael Farr, president of the wealth management firm Farr, Miller &amp; Washington, said today's market leaders will sooner or later run out of steam, prompting investors to look for new faces or even to latch on to some old names that have been ignored and are cheap.</p><p>\"Everybody wants to bet on yesterday's fastest horse,\" Farr said. \"They don't care if they are healthy. But you have horses dropping dead and you've got to find a fresh one to ride.\"</p><p>Aerospace giant Boeing was among the Dow's best performers in 2018, but its stock has dropped around 20 percent in the last four months over its 737 Max problems. Disney shares, on the other hand, have risen more than 25 percent in the last two months, boosting its market cap by around $50 billion.</p><p>Memani, Rupkey and others see big upside in stocks through the rest of 2019, even as anxiousness prevailed Friday ahead of a critical meeting between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the Group of 20 meeting in Japan.</p><p>Trump's obsession with rising stock prices has been one of the hallmarks of his presidency.</p><p>He even tweeted about the bull market, now in its 10th year, from the G-20:</p><p>\"The Stock Market went up massively from the day after I won the Election, all the way up to the day that I took office, because of the enthusiasm for the fact that I was going to be President. That big Stock Market increase must be credited to me. If Hillary won - a Big Crash!\"</p><p>Rupkey said Trump \"will do whatever it takes to get stocks on track coming out of the weekend. The lesson of recent months is whatever the negative headline, somehow the trade talks get resurrected. So try not to hit the sell button.\"</p><p>Between Trump's stock market obsession and the Federal Reserve's willingness to use the money supply to bolster returns, some investors believe there is a safety net under the stock market.</p><p>\"We have to recognize the power of the Fed,\" said Kristina Hooper, global market strategist at Invesco. \"The Fed has placed a 'put' under the stock market over the past decade and could do so once again.\"</p><p>Hooper said investors might be concerned that the market is fragile because of its narrow leadership. \"But that has occurred in the past, and it doesn't have to end calamitously. The baton can get passed to other names.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:thomas.heath@washpost.com\">thomas.heath@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-4124d74e-9a08-11e9-8d0a-5edd7e2025b1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WFV-FHT1-DXXY-316B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1091\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Every Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 30, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002LO7</classCode><className>WALT DISNEY CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0001Y2C</classCode><className>DOW JONES &amp;

He's Allianz Global Investor's portfolio manager, and by our very own macro man, Cameron Crise of Bloomberg, who has a piece out on the Bloomberg right now that includes those congressional investigations of Facebook and Twitter as part of what he calls a larger regulatory arbitrage of the tech company. So, take us through this regularly arbitrage, because it's not just loaned (ph) to the United States.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRISE</emphasis>: Well, it's a - if you look at tech, there's many - and it's not just technology companies in terms of tax, but there are many ways in which they sort of not necessarily break the rules but avoid them or skirt some of the more oppressive regulations. Now, right now recently in Europe we've had issues of the EU imposing tax bills on Apple, Google and most recently Amazon for again, legal evasion - but, things that they're not terribly happy with.  </p><p>      The social media thing is really the interesting one in the sense that the business model with social media companies is very similar to a commercial broadcaster in the sense that they provide content in exchange for advertising revenue.   </p><p>      Now, obviously here on commercial broadcasting we have certain limitations, we're regulated by the FCC, Ofcom in the U.K. and that means that we have a duty to provide sort of fair and truthful news and we - you know, we can't use industrial language and things like that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>: And, also can't hide behind anonymity. I mean, if we say something we can be sued for it because people know we said it.  When you have a Facebook and you -  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CRISE</emphasis>: Well, yes. There's one sort of historical (inaudible) of commercial medial doing fake news and that's the - in the U.S. in the 1930s, the War of the Worlds where Orson Wells did a radio broadcast of the HG Wells book. Basically they got shut down, the broadcast, because it was causing - sort of panic on the streets.  The latter day equivalent in terms of social media companies and these - you know, the ads or the stories that are pushed, there's no repercussions as it were.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>: Alix, you saw one of the Facebook ads actually supposedly said John McCain was a founder of ISIS.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>: Oh, my gosh.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WESTIN</emphasis>: For example. I mean, that's the sort of stuff they were putting up.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>: Right. So, you think you've got to get something going on with that.   </p><p>      So, Burns, when you take a look at the tech sector, you have to kind of start incorporating that into your view of Big Tech, don't you? </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCKINNEY</emphasis>: You absolutely have to consider it. And, in many ways, what's going on with the regulatory environment for Big Tech is the exact opposite we face for financials right now. Under the current administration financials really probably face regulatory tailwinds and likewise deregulation versus on the tech side you have an administration that came in that was always a little bit antagonistic toward the tech sector. You saw that late last year.   </p><p>      I think one of the reasons the tech names have done very well this year has just simply been playing catch-up from the fact that they lagged late last year. So, it's something that has to be considered. That said, you know, from our perspective as value investors, you know, technology - you can't just lump it altogether. You know, the FANG stocks are some of the ones that I think really might be those that are most subject to this. They're also some of the ones that are most over-valued, whereas if you look at the sector as a whole, you still see really attractive valuations. You see it's one of the few sectors that trades at a discount to its 25-year average and really trades about in-line with the S&amp;P, for a place where you have good dividend growth.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>: Yes. Burns, they are also radically different companies. Amazon for instance, isn't even weighted as a tech stock on the S&amp;P 500. It's retail.  </p><p>      And, if you look at the situation with say an Amazon versus a Facebook, the regulatory hurdles that they could face are going to be radically different.  Who do you think is in the toughest spot at the moment out of those two companies?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCKINNEY</emphasis>: Yes.  I would say that probably that Amazon is probably a little bit better positioned to deal with this.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FERRO</emphasis>: Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCKINNEY</emphasis>: I think it's just that they've been a shake (ph) shifter. They have been able to really transition time after time after time to something new. And, as a result, they've really demonstrated - the management there has demonstrated the ability to quickly adapt in today's world, whereas you know, with Facebook, I think the challenges are probably going to be ongoing.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEEL</emphasis>: Bloomberg's Cameron Crise and Burns McKinney of Allianz Global, thank you very much.      </p><p>      ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  </p><p>      THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100 percent ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

He's Allianz Global Investor's portfolio manager, and by our very own macro man, Cameron Crise of Bloomberg, who has a piece out on the Bloomberg right now that includes those congressional investigations of Facebook and Twitter as part of what he calls a larger regulatory arbitrage of the tech company. So, take us through this regularly arbitrage, because it's not just loaned (ph) to the United States.</p><p>CAMERON CRISE, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Well, it's a - if you look at tech, there's many - and it's not just technology companies in terms of tax, but there are many ways in which they sort of not necessarily break the rules but avoid them or skirt some of the more oppressive regulations. Now, right now recently in Europe we've had issues of the EU imposing tax bills on Apple, Google and most recently Amazon for again, legal evasion - but, things that they're not terribly happy with.</p><p>The social media thing is really the interesting one in the sense that the business model with social media companies is very similar to a commercial broadcaster in the sense that they provide content in exchange for advertising revenue.</p><p>Now, obviously here on commercial broadcasting we have certain limitations, we're regulated by the FCC, Ofcom in the U.K. and that means that we have a duty to provide sort of fair and truthful news and we - you know, we can't use industrial language and things like that.</p><p>WESTIN: And, also can't hide behind anonymity. I mean, if we say something we can be sued for it because people know we said it. When you have a Facebook and you -</p><p>CRISE: Well, yes. There's one sort of historical (inaudible) of commercial medial doing fake news and that's the - in the U.S. in the 1930s, the War of the Worlds where Orson Wells did a radio broadcast of the HG Wells book. Basically they got shut down, the broadcast, because it was causing - sort of panic on the streets. The latter day equivalent in terms of social media companies and these - you know, the ads or the stories that are pushed, there's no repercussions as it were.</p><p>WESTIN: Alix, you saw one of the Facebook ads actually supposedly said John McCain was a founder of ISIS.</p><p>ALIX STEEL, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Oh, my gosh.</p><p>WESTIN: For example. I mean, that's the sort of stuff they were putting up.</p><p>STEEL: Right. So, you think you've got to get something going on with that.</p><p>So, Burns, when you take a look at the tech sector, you have to kind of start incorporating that into your view of Big Tech, don't you?</p><p>BURNS MCKINNEY, CO-CIO, ALLIANZ GLOBAL INVESTORS: You absolutely have to consider it. And, in many ways, what's going on with the regulatory environment for Big Tech is the exact opposite we face for financials right now. Under the current administration financials really probably face regulatory tailwinds and likewise deregulation versus on the tech side you have an administration that came in that was always a little bit antagonistic toward the tech sector. You saw that late last year.</p><p>I think one of the reasons the tech names have done very well this year has just simply been playing catch-up from the fact that they lagged late last year. So, it's something that has to be considered. That said, you know, from our perspective as value investors, you know, technology - you can't just lump it altogether. You know, the FANG stocks are some of the ones that I think really might be those that are most subject to this. They're also some of the ones that are most over-valued, whereas if you look at the sector as a whole, you still see really attractive valuations. You see it's one of the few sectors that trades at a discount to its 25-year average and really trades about in-line with the S&amp;P, for a place where you have good dividend growth.</p><p>JONATHAN FERRO, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Yes. Burns, they are also radically different companies. Amazon for instance, isn't even weighted as a tech stock on the S&amp;P 500. It's retail.</p><p>And, if you look at the situation with say an Amazon versus a Facebook, the regulatory hurdles that they could face are going to be radically different. Who do you think is in the toughest spot at the moment out of those two companies?</p><p>MCKINNEY: Yes. I would say that probably that Amazon is probably a little bit better positioned to deal with this.</p><p>FERRO: Yes.</p><p>MCKINNEY: I think it's just that they've been a shake (ph) shifter. They have been able to really transition time after time after time to something new. And, as a result, they've really demonstrated - the management there has demonstrated the ability to quickly adapt in today's world, whereas you know, with Facebook, I think the challenges are probably going to be ongoing.</p><p>STEEL: Bloomberg's Cameron Crise and Burns McKinney of Allianz Global, thank you very much.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

He's Allianz Global Investor's portfolio manager, and by our very own macro man, Cameron Crise of Bloomberg, who has a piece out on the Bloomberg right now that includes those congressional investigations of Facebook and Twitter as part of what he calls a larger regulatory arbitrage of the tech company. So, take us through this regularly arbitrage, because it's not just loaned (ph) to the United States.</p><p>CAMERON CRISE, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Well, it's a - if you look at tech, there's many - and it's not just technology companies in terms of tax, but there are many ways in which they sort of not necessarily break the rules but avoid them or skirt some of the more oppressive regulations. Now, right now recently in Europe we've had issues of the EU imposing tax bills on Apple, Google and most recently Amazon for again, legal evasion - but, things that they're not terribly happy with.</p><p>The social media thing is really the interesting one in the sense that the business model with social media companies is very similar to a commercial broadcaster in the sense that they provide content in exchange for advertising revenue.</p><p>Now, obviously here on commercial broadcasting we have certain limitations, we're regulated by the FCC, Ofcom in the U.K. and that means that we have a duty to provide sort of fair and truthful news and we - you know, we can't use industrial language and things like that.</p><p>WESTIN: And, also can't hide behind anonymity. I mean, if we say something we can be sued for it because people know we said it. When you have a Facebook and you -</p><p>CRISE: Well, yes. There's one sort of historical (inaudible) of commercial medial doing fake news and that's the - in the U.S. in the 1930s, the War of the Worlds where Orson Wells did a radio broadcast of the HG Wells book. Basically they got shut down, the broadcast, because it was causing - sort of panic on the streets. The latter day equivalent in terms of social media companies and these - you know, the ads or the stories that are pushed, there's no repercussions as it were.</p><p>WESTIN: Alix, you saw one of the Facebook ads actually supposedly said John McCain was a founder of ISIS.</p><p>ALIX STEEL, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Oh, my gosh.</p><p>WESTIN: For example. I mean, that's the sort of stuff they were putting up.</p><p>STEEL: Right.

He's  Allianz Global Investor's portfolio manager, and by our very own macro man,  Cameron Crise of Bloomberg, who has a piece out on the Bloomberg right now  that includes those congressional investigations of Facebook and Twitter as  part of what he calls a larger regulatory arbitrage of the tech company.  So, take us through this regularly arbitrage, because it's not just loaned  (ph) to the United States.</p><p>CAMERON CRISE, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Well, it's a - if you look at tech,  there's many - and it's not just technology companies in terms of tax, but  there are many ways in which they sort of not necessarily break the rules  but avoid them or skirt some of the more oppressive regulations. Now, right  now recently in Europe we've had issues of the EU imposing tax bills on  Apple, Google and most recently Amazon for again, legal evasion - but,  things that they're not terribly happy with.</p><p>The social media thing is really the interesting one in the sense that the  business model with social media companies is very similar to a commercial  broadcaster in the sense that they provide content in exchange for  advertising revenue.</p><p>Now, obviously here on commercial broadcasting we have certain limitations,  we're regulated by the FCC, Ofcom in the U.K. and that means that we have a  duty to provide sort of fair and truthful news and we - you know, we can't  use industrial language and things like that.</p><p>WESTIN: And, also can't hide behind anonymity. I mean, if we say something  we can be sued for it because people know we said it.  When you have a  Facebook and you -</p><p>CRISE: Well, yes. There's one sort of historical (inaudible) of commercial  medial doing fake news and that's the - in the U.S. in the 1930s, the War  of the Worlds where Orson Wells did a radio broadcast of the HG Wells book.  Basically they got shut down, the broadcast, because it was causing - sort  of panic on the streets.  The latter day equivalent in terms of social  media companies and these - you know, the ads or the stories that are  pushed, there's no repercussions as it were.</p><p>WESTIN: Alix, you saw one of the Facebook ads actually supposedly said John  McCain was a founder of ISIS.</p><p>ALIX STEEL, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Oh, my gosh.</p><p>WESTIN: For example. I mean, that's the sort of stuff they were putting up.</p><p>STEEL: Right. So, you think you've got to get something going on with that.</p><p>So, Burns, when you take a look at the tech sector, you have to kind of  start incorporating that into your view of Big Tech, don't you?</p><p>BURNS MCKINNEY, CO-CIO, ALLIANZ GLOBAL INVESTORS: You absolutely have to  consider it. And, in many ways, what's going on with the regulatory  environment for Big Tech is the exact opposite we face for financials right  now. Under the current administration financials really probably face  regulatory tailwinds and likewise deregulation versus on the tech side you  have an administration that came in that was always a little bit  antagonistic toward the tech sector. You saw that late last year.</p><p>I think one of the reasons the tech names have done very well this year has  just simply been playing catch-up from the fact that they lagged late last  year. So, it's something that has to be considered. That said, you know,  from our perspective as value investors, you know, technology - you can't  just lump it altogether. You know, the FANG stocks are some of the ones  that I think really might be those that are most subject to this. They're  also some of the ones that are most over-valued, whereas if you look at the  sector as a whole, you still see really attractive valuations. You see it's  one of the few sectors that trades at a discount to its 25-year average and  really trades about in-line with the S&amp;P, for a place where you have good  dividend growth.</p><p>JONATHAN FERRO, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Yes. Burns, they are also radically  different companies. Amazon for instance, isn't even weighted as a tech  stock on the S&amp;P 500. It's retail.</p><p>And, if you look at the situation with say an Amazon versus a Facebook, the  regulatory hurdles that they could face are going to be radically  different.  Who do you think is in the toughest spot at the moment out of  those two companies?</p><p>MCKINNEY: Yes.  I would say that probably that Amazon is probably a little  bit better positioned to deal with this.</p><p>FERRO: Yes.</p><p>MCKINNEY: I think it's just that they've been a shake (ph) shifter. They  have been able to really transition time after time after time to something  new. And, as a result, they've really demonstrated - the management there  has demonstrated the ability to quickly adapt in today's world, whereas you  know, with Facebook, I think the challenges are probably going to be  ongoing.</p><p>STEEL: Bloomberg's Cameron Crise and Burns McKinney of Allianz Global,  thank you very much.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

The firms formalized their merger last week. \"Veal &amp; Associates is the dean of the intellectual property game,\" Knight said.</p><p> The development illustrates the need among Birmingham's large firms for lawyers specializing in topics needed by the growing technology sector in the city, a sector hungry for advice on protecting new ideas. It also vaults Burr &amp; Forman to 142 attorneys. That puts it second in Birmingham only to Bradley Arant Rose &amp; White with about 165 attorneys.</p><p> The lawyers from Veal &amp; Associates will begin work at Burr &amp; Forman immediately, said Jeff Veal, who made the switch with his three lawyers. Veal said Birmingham's emerging technology sector - made up of biotech, telecommunications, software and Internet ventures - over whelmed his small firm in recent months.</p><p> \"We felt the need to grow and Burr &amp; Forman provided the opportunity,\" he said. Veal's clients include Birmingham's EBSCO, a diversified media and manufacturing company, and Russell Corp., the Alexander City based maker of athletic apparel. Merger, Page 8D 1D</p><p>Veal and his lawyers bring technology expertise in physics and chemical and computer engineering; they will join Burr &amp; Forman's nine intellectual property lawyers and one patent attorney. \"We are building a big tech practice group,\" said Gene Price, a Burr &amp; Forman attorney. \"Service professionals in Birmingham who don't cater to that niche will get left behind.\"</p><p> Law firms throughout the state see the growing need for intellectual property experts, said David V. Lucas, chair-elect of the Alabama State Bar practice section on the topic. \"I would say most firms in Alabama are attempting to build some capability,\" said Lucas, general counsel for Huntsville tech firm Intergraph Corp. \"The work now is in trademarks, copyrights and advice for online ventures and complying with their federal regulations.\"</p><p> Earlier this year, Bradley Arant formed an emerging technology practice group with 24 attorneys. Group leader Jim Rotch said it is already bringing in business. \"We are doing great,\" he said. \"We are just engaging some clients right now, for example.\" He said the group is finding work \"not just from people coming out of their garage\" but also from large corporations spinning off tech subsidiaries.</p><p> The addition of Veal &amp; Associates brings Burr &amp; Forman within shouting distance of Bradley Arant in size. About 14 Birmingham attorneys from other firms have joined Burr &amp; Forman in the past year, said managing partner Knight. \"If size matters - and it doesn't compared to quality - then we have some more big things coming,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BIRMNW-NO_UNIQUE_ID</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BIRMNW2000</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:485Y-P0G0-01M4-51XP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">262334</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"526\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Birmingham News (Alabama)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2000 The Birmingham News, All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"05\" year=\"2000\"><dateText>May 7, 2000 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>BRADLEY ARANT BOULT CUMMINGS LLP\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>\u00a0BURR &amp;

The social network priced its shares at $38, but at the end of the first day of trading (that opened with a technical glitch) they had risen by just 23 cents, before falling well below the offer price in subsequent days, in contrast to other big tech IPOs (see Google). Adding to the disappointment, regulators began inquiries into whether favoured investors were alerted to Facebook's weakening financial projections and dumped stock when buying was opened to the public. Still, Facebook's stockmarket debut valued it at $104 billion. <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>Facebook's boss, celebrated by marrying his college sweetheart.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After months of speculation <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Yahoo!</emphasis> announced plans to divest its 40% stake in <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alibaba</emphasis>, a giant Chinese e-commerce firm. The pair will separate on amicable terms. Yahoo! is selling half of its stake now and will dispose of the rest later, with some of that to be sold when and if Alibaba floats on a stockmarket. </p><p>?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hewlett-Packard</emphasis> slashed another 27,000 jobs, or 8% of its global workforce, in line with its restructuring plan. Mike Lynch, who founded Autonomy, a British software firm bought by HP for $10.3 billion last year, is to step down from his job as head of information management. HP has found it hard lately to persuade markets that it has a strategy for responding to the challenge to its business from smartphones and tablets.</p><p>The IMF's annual review of the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">British economy</emphasis> found it to be underperforming relative to earlier expectations. The fund recommended more quantitative easing by the Bank of England and said growth-boosting measures, such as spending on infrastructure, could help, but only if they were fiscally neutral. </p><p>The<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Bank of England </emphasis>bowed to pressure to launch independent reviews of its own performance during the crisis. The reviews will look at the central bank's emergency-lending operations in 2008-09, its inflation-forecasting record and the system for providing money to banks. But its critics want the reviews to go further and examine its pre-crisis attention to financial stability. </p><p>?</p><p>Despite recent measures by the Reserve Bank of India to support the currency, the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Indian rupee </emphasis>continued to fall. It is the worst-performing currency among Asia's emerging markets so far this year.</p><p>?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JPMorgan Chase</emphasis> suspended its much-trumpeted share buy-back programme in light of its unexpected loss of at least $2 billion in trading on credit derivatives. Since revealing the loss its share price has taken a dive, wiping $30 billion from its stockmarket value. The bank was given the go-ahead for its buy-back plan after passing the Federal Reserve's latest \"stress test\" in March. </p><p>?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Barclays</emphasis> decided to sell the 19.6% stake in <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BlackRock</emphasis> that it had obtained as part of its deal selling Barclays Global Investors to the asset-management company in 2009. The proceeds from the sale could help the bank in meeting new rules on bigger capital buffers. </p><p>?</p><p>The trial of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rajat Gupta</emphasis> on insider-trading charges got under way in New York. Among other things Mr Gupta is accused of passing sensitive information about Goldman Sachs when he was a director of the bank to Raj Rajaratnam, a former hedge-fund boss who was convicted of insider trading last year. Mr Gupta denies the charges.</p><p>?</p><p>PTT, a state-backed energy firm in Thailand, tendered a surprise last-minute bid of $1.9 billion for Cove Energy, trumping an offer from Shell. Cove holds an 8.5% stake in a huge <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">natural-gas</emphasis> field in Mozambican waters. PTT's bid is the biggest ever by a Thai firm for a foreign one, and underscores the rush for oil-and-gas assets off the east African coast.</p><p>Dalian Wanda, a Chinese property group, agreed to buy AMC Entertainment, a ubiquitous American<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">cinema</emphasis> chain.

It could even become self-sufficient in energy by 2035, as oil and gas output soars because of the boom in fracking shale. The IEA reckons that the world's energy map \"is being redrawn by the resurgence of oil and gas production in the United States\". </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">? This article contains a table.

The agreement will need to be approved by a federal court.</p><p>The European Commission decided to suspend for a year the start of a controversial scheme to charge airlines for <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">carbon emitted from flights</emphasis> to and from Europe. The policy has done something the UN can only dream of: it has united America, Russia, China, India and a host of other countries in opposition to it. The commission is suspending the charge in order to encourage talks on setting up a global system to regulate aviation emissions that will begin soon at the UN International Civil Aviation Organisation. </p><p>?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SAS</emphasis>, an airline that is half- owned by the Swedish, Norwegian and Danish governments, urged its employees to accept a package of redundancies, wage cuts and reduced pensions, or else it would be the \"final call\" for the company, which was founded in 1946. As with other flag carriers, SAS has had a bumpy ride competing with nimbler low-cost airlines, such as Norwegian Air Shuttle, which in January placed the largest ever order for new jets in Europe. </p><p>?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lufthansa</emphasis>, Germany's biggest airline, reached a deal on pay and conditions with flight attendants, ending a dispute that disrupted its global services during the summer. </p><p>?</p><p>Apple and HTC, which is based in Taiwan and one of the world's biggest makers of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">smartphones</emphasis>, resolved all their outstanding legal issues over patents by entering into a ten-year licensing arrangement. It is the first patent dispute Apple has settled with a handset-maker that uses the Android operating system (HTC also sells devices that run on Microsoft's software). </p><p>?</p><p>?</p><p>?</p><p>?</p><p>?</p><p>?</p><p>?</p><p>?</p><p>?</p><p>?</p><p>?</p><p>?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apple's</emphasis> share price continued its rapid descent from its mid-September peak of $702. Since then it has fallen by 23%, in part because of production and quality problems in Chinese factories that have beset the new iPhone 5. Around $150 billion has been wiped off Apple's market capitalisation.  </p><p>Steven Sinofsky, who headed <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Microsoft's Windows</emphasis> division, abruptly left the company. No reason was given for his departure, leading to speculation that it was somehow related to the release of Windows 8, the latest version of the firm's operating system which has garnered mixed reviews. Mr Sinofsky is the second high-profile executive to leave a big tech company in as many weeks, following Apple's defenestration of Scott Forstall. </p><p>?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Vodafone</emphasis> booked another big write-down on its business in southern Europe, this time writing off \u00a35.9 billion ($9.4 billion) at its Spanish and Italian divisions. The world's second-biggest mobile-phone operator, which is based in Britain, has now written down \u00a324 billion over the past five years, mostly because of poor returns from the euro zone. But its stake in America's Verizon Wireless is paying off; it produced a \u00a32.4 billion cash dividend for Vodafone this week. </p><p>?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jefferies</emphasis>, a global securities firm, relinquished its claim to be America's largest independent bank by agreeing to a takeover by Leucadia, a conglomerate that holds around 30% of the company. Jefferies came through the financial crisis relatively unscathed. However, some investors are concerned about the health of its balance-sheet. </p><p>?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Credit-rating agencies</emphasis> came under more fire, this time in Italy, where prosecutors from the town of Trani asked a judge to order seven employees from Standard &amp; Poor's and Fitch to stand trial for allegedly violating market rules when they announced downgrades on Italian sovereign debt. The two-year investigation was sparked by complaints from consumer groups and involved a police raid on the companies' offices in Milan. The employees haven't been charged. S&amp;P dismissed the allegation as \"baseless\". </p><p>In a week when another editorial scandal at the BBC prompted questions about the British broadcaster's future, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ITV</emphasis>, one of its main commercial rivals, reported strong earnings. ITV was buoyed by a 20% rise in revenue at its film studio, which produces \"Downton Abbey\" and \"Hell's Kitchen\". Its share price skipped to a five-year high. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-S63CO4V</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5728-G4H1-DY2R-21W4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-10-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"768\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

In Loughrea, Co Galway, the privately held <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chanelle Group</emphasis> embarked on yet another expansion phase. Rather than winding down, Chanelle's 71-year-old owner, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Burke </emphasis>announced an EUR 86 million investment plan.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The former vet has built his business to become an international giant in animal and human generics, and he's done it without ever having to move from his homeplace. </p><p>Another Galway business, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Novate</emphasis>, was acquired in a deal that could earn its investors up to $150 million (EUR 131 million). Having taken 12 years to develop a device to stop potentially fatal blood clots entering the lungs of patients after surgery, the company was sold to UK group BTG for $20 million (EUR 17 million). If the therapy that has been approved by US regulators proves a success in sales terms, the former owners are in line for an additional $130 million (EUR 113 million) payout. </p><p>For <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Thero</emphasis>, it was also a bumper year. Having had his battles, the chief executive of Irish drug company <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amarin </emphasis>released positive news on his Vascepa drug which showed that it reduced a variety of heart complications, including chest pain and procedures to clear clogged arteries by 25 per cent. </p><p>Amarin's shares are up more than 260 per cent this year on the back of its successes. </p><h>Fruit of the boom There was no shortage of corporate M&amp;A this year and another winner must be drawn from that subset of dealmakers. Total Produce chairman Carl McCann is one, after the company he founded acquired an initial 45 per cent stake in Dole, one of the largest producers of fruit and vegetables in the world. </h><p>In a move which McCann believes was the \"single most positive step in our company's history\", Total Produce handed over $300 million (EUR 262 million) for the stake which significantly increases its presence in North America.</p><p>A series of acquisitions throughout 2017 in addition to the Dole purchase has pushed Total Produce on to offer substantial rewards for its shareholders. In August it said profit rose 19.4 per cent in the first half of this year.</p><h>Glanbia's Talbot feasts on success Total Produce wasn't the only busy buyer in the food space: Kilkenny-based Glanbia moved to increase its exposure to lifestyle consumers this year with the purchase of diet brand SlimFast. The $350 million (EUR 305 million) deal also included nutritional supplement brands Healthy Delights and Nu-Therapy. </h><p>It was a good year for chief executive <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Siobh\u00e1n Talbot</emphasis> as well. In May, Talbot was named <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Irish Times </emphasis>Business Person of the Year for her efforts in overseeing a deal to spin off Glanbia's Irish dairy and agribusiness operation into a joint venture. </p><p>Now, Glanbia plans to boost revenues by over a third to EUR 5 billion by 2022 as it grows into new markets and bolsters existing ones. In July, the company reinforced its position as Europe's leading mozzarella cheese manufacturer with plans to open a new EUR 130 million production plant in Co Laois. </p><h>'Two boggers from Cork' Moving away from food and into the technology sector, the two businessmen behind Teamwork.com</h><p>, who refer to themselves as \"two boggers from Cork\", firmly deserve their place in the winners list. In October, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Peter Coppinger </emphasis>and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dan Mackey </emphasis>scooped the prestigious EY Entrepreneur of the Year overall award, having impressed judges for their ingenuity and innovation. </p><p>Teamwork.com, a software-as-a-service company which creates business management applications, counts many of the world's most influential companies among its clients including Disney, Netflix, Forbes, Paypal and Spotify. Founded in 2007, it remains a privately owned company that has never received any outside funding and both its founders maintain ambitious growth plans. </p><p>\"We ultimately want to be a billion dollar company and, for us to achieve that, we need people. And winning an award like this help put us on the map,\" Coppinger said when they picked up the EY gong. </p><h>Hunt gets ahead of the pack On to banking and while relatively little is known about Colin Hunt's year as a whole, he certainly had a positive December. So positive, in fact, that he makes our winners list. </h><p>The veteran finance executive took one of the most coveted banking jobs in the State this month when he was appointed as <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AIB</emphasis> chief executive. Well, perhaps not coveted but high profile at least. Succeeding Bernard Byrne, who announced in October he was leaving the bank to join stockbroking company Davy, the appointment of Hunt - a former economist at rival Goodbody - is expected to take effect \"early next year\". </p><p>Hunt joined AIB as managing director of wholesale and institutional banking, having been poached from Australian banking group Macquarie in 2016. His latest appointment comes at a time when Irish banks are seeking a change in government rules to allow the return of bonus plans. Hunt will receive a salary of EUR 500,000 plus a pension at the bank which last year returned to stock markets. </p><h>Packing a punch for independence Elsewhere, the influential Smurfit family of paper and packaging fame can count their blessings this Christmas, having avoided a takeover of the company that bears their name earlier in the year. </h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Smurfit Kappa</emphasis>, led by chief executive <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tony Smurfit</emphasis>, fought off an unwanted EUR 9 billion takeover approach from US rival International Paper. Smurfit and his board remained resolute in their assertion that the offer fundamentally undervalued the group, despite pressure from a select group of shareholders to consider the deal. </p><p>Then, in early July, the company closed its EUR 460 million takeover of Dutch company Reparency, illustrating its determination to among the leaders in Europe's packaging industry. </p><p>While the Smurfits have a relatively small shareholding in the company, Tony is the third generation of his family to take the helm of the group having been appointed in 2015. </p><p>But it wasn't all good. Smurfit Kappa's shares have since fallen to a 24-month low. And, in the summer, the company's Venezuelan operations were seized by the Caracas government amid complaints about prices the company was charging for its products in a move that led to Smurfit ultimately writing down EUR 60 million of its net assets. </p><h>Sky's the limit for media giant And finally, international media mergers continued apace this year led by the high-profile battle for Sky. Ultimately, Comcast won out with its \u00a330.6 billion (EUR 33.8 billion) bid for Sky, trumping 21st Century Fox and Walt Disney. Valuing the business at almost \u00a34 billion (EUR 4.4 billion) more than the Disney-Fox bid, Comcast's offer brought an end to Rupert Murdoch's long association with the business he founded in 1989. </h><p>For now, this most certainly appears to be a win. Time will tell if Comcast can make hay with its Sky ownership. </p><h>Christmas behind bars</h><p> And so to the losers. Annual readers of this piece will be familiar with a number of the names that make this list but there is no shortage of new entrants. </p><p>One recurring name, however, is the former Anglo Irish Bank chief executive <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Drumm</emphasis>. While the last few years have hardly been auspicious for Drumm, 2018 is almost certainly his annus horribilis. </p><p>Few will forget Drumm's dramatic fall from grace which culminated in June, with a six-year jail sentence over his failures when he led the collapsed Anglo. Drumm was ultimately found guilty of conspiracy to defraud and false accounting relating to EUR 7.2 billion in deposits placed in Anglo's accounts by Irish Life and Permanent. </p><p>Having been found \"not remotely credible\" two years earlier in a US court, Drumm will be spending this Christmas in the slammer. And while he may never return to our winners and losers list again, he will eventually return to normality, likely serve just over 3\u00bd years before being due for release.</p><h>Arresting </h><h>times Executives encountering legal troubles was something of a trend this year. Well, perhaps not a trend but it happened more often than one should reasonably expect. </h><p>As 2018 moved to its close, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Carlos Ghosn</emphasis>, Japan's most celebrated foreign executive was arrested, and ultimately charged with under-reporting his income by millions of dollars. </p><p>Widely credited with pulling Nissan out of the fire, Ghosn also served as the chief executive of Renault and the chairman of Mitsubishi at the time of his arrest. </p><p>Irish businessman <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Peter Conlon</emphasis> was released just before Christmas, having spent the previous 12 months in detention in Switzerland. Conlon received a three-year sentence in November, two of which were suspended, after pleading guilty to using almost EUR 4 million that was intended for charities to fund his technology company, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ammado</emphasis>. Now that he has been released, Conlon will be in a position to make himself available for a February hearing in Dublin connected to the liquidation of a company with links to his Swiss operation. </p><h>Power outage </h><h>for Elon Across the pond, Elon Musk was unceremoniously dethroned as Tesla chairman (although he remains chief executive) after misleading investors with tweets in August that said he was considering taking Tesla private at $420 (EUR 366) a share and had secured funding. </h><p>Musk, who has certainly had a tough year otherwise with outbursts at journalists on a conference call and on an episode of a popular US podcast in which he smoked marijuana, also agreed to pay $20 million (EUR 17 million) to financial regulators. </p><h>Very unsocial media giants Back in the Republic, tech behemoths Google and Facebook, once the darlings of our economy, came in for criticism in 2018. </h><p>In November, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Google </emphasis>staff in Dublin joined thousands of colleagues across the world in staging a workplace walkout in protest at the company's lenient treatment of executives accused of sexual misconduct. The Walkout for Real Change protest came a week after it emerged that Google gave a $90 million (EUR 79 million) severance package to Andy Rubin, the creator of the Android mobile phone software, but concealed details of a sexual misconduct allegation that triggered his departure.</p><p>The technology giant was also fined a record EUR 4.3 billion in the summer for the abuse of a dominant market position by its Android mobile phone operating systems. This followed a 2017 fine of EUR 2.4 billion for Google's abuse of its market position in favouring shopping services in internet searches. </p><p>And then there's <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook</emphasis>, which makes Google's misdemeanours appear like mere slap-on-the-wrist offences. </p><p>Trust in the social media company was shot after a catalogue of scandals, including a data breach involving British political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, which saw Facebook at the centre of a dispute over alleged harvesting and use of personal data. </p><p>Those allegations swiftly led to concerns that the data could have been used to try to influence the outcome of the 2016 US presidential election and the Brexit vote. </p><p>In July, Facebook was also exposed for flouting its standards of content moderation. A Channel 4 investigation revealed a series of failures to remove content flagged as inappropriate. The work is outsourced to Dublin-based company CPL Resources, which has worked with Facebook since 2010. </p><p>Last month it faced further negative commentary when it hired a lobbying company that pushed negative stories about its critics, including the billionaire philanthropist George Soros. And, in the week before Christmas, the social media group was again in the dock following disclosures that, since 2010, it had given more than 150 \"partners\" - mostly tech businesses like Netflix, Microsoft's Bing and Spotify, but also online retailers, entertainment sites, automakers and media organisations - more intrusive access to users' personal data than it had disclosed, effectively exempting them from its usual privacy rules.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg and their team will undoubtedly welcome the end of 2018 and with another US presidential election on the horizon, will be hoping to avoid recent mistakes. </p><h>Apple loss is </h><h>Athenry's pain  Apple has not been a loser this year, or at least not so that it makes our list, but it deserves special mention because of what happened in Athenry. </h><p>The Galway town very much lost out when Apple decided to pull an EUR 850 million investment in a data centre there. The locals were in favour for the most part. A handful of naysayers, however, drove Apple out like Saint Patrick did the snakes. </p><p>Perhaps, in years to come, the naysayers will be celebrated. But for now, there's a bitterness lingering around the fields of Athenry. </p><h>Retail gloom costs designer Orla Kiely One Irish entrepreneur whose stock went out of fashion this year was designer  Orla Kiely. Along with her husband, Dermott Rowan, Kiely led the brand that had her name over the door until its untimely collapse on the high street this year. With debts exceeding \u00a37.25 million (EUR 8 million), the fashion brand's retail empire abruptly announced its closure as of September 17th. </h><p>Kiely's business, which first came to prominence for her colourful prints on handbags that were later applied to everything from biscuit tins to ceramics, faced \"various challenges\", which led to its untimely closure. </p><p>While the closure of Kiely's business sent shocks across the retail world, it wasn't an isolated incident in a year in which the high street - more so in the UK than here - was battered. For <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">House of Fraser</emphasis>, it was a case of hopping out of the frying pan to go into the fire after the beleaguered chain was acquired by Sports Direct owner <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mike Ashley</emphasis>, the billionaire owner of Newcastle Football Club, in a deal worth \u00a390 million (EUR 100 million). </p><p>When it filed for administration, House of Fraser had debts close to \u00a31 billion (EUR 1.1 billion) and creditors of the company's Dundrum store were owed about EUR 2.8 million (EUR 3.1 million). </p><p>Elsewhere,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Debenhams</emphasis>, in which Ashley has a 28 per cent stake, had yet another torrid year resulting in the announcement that it is to close 50 of its underperforming stores, putting about 4,000 jobs at risk. A series of write-downs in the business led to a record full-year loss of nearly \u00a3500 million (EUR 553 million) at the struggling retailer. </p><p>And hopes that at least the lost high street sales were being hoovered up by online retailers were dashed this month when <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Asos</emphasis> published a miserable trading statement warning that sales in the \"very material month\" of November had been \"significantly behind expectations\". The update, which triggered a 40 per cent plummet in its share price and some unpleasant drops for other retail stocks, was notable because it comes at a time when the retail business is undergoing a structural shift in favour of pure-play ecommerce operations just like Asos.</p><h>Collapse and collateral damage While retail bricks-and-mortar may not be in vogue, Ireland is again witnessing a construction boom. But that doesn't mean there weren't casualties. The collapse of British construction giant Carillion left over 30,000 small companies owed money. On these shores, Sammon Contracting subsequently went into liquidation with the loss of 200 jobs. Sammon found itself in difficulty in January after the suspension of a public-partnership school building project, to which it had been appointed as a sub-contractor by Carillion. </h><p>Speaking of public projects, the ungainly fiasco involving the national broadband plan claimed a casualty this year in the form of Independent TD <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Denis Naughten</emphasis>. Formerly the minister for communications, climate action and environment, Naughten was forced to resign after it emerged he held a series of private meetings with David McCourt, the lead investor in the last remaining consortium bidding for the rollout of rural broadband. </p><h>Passengers left high and dry In the transport sector, Irish Ferries owner Irish Continental Group (ICG) was dogged by delays, first in delivery of a new ship, the WB Yeats and then to repair issues with an existing one that led to cancelled sailed and disgruntled customers. </h><p>Discommoded passengers were also an issue for <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ryanair</emphasis> as it tried to get to grips with a new industrial relations model that involved recognising trade unions. As the year closes, the airline is still battling pressure to pay compensation over disruption to passengers. </p><p>A stock market flotation would generally be cause for cheer rather than mention in this section, but the long-planned flotation of plastics group <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">IPL Plastics</emphasis>, formerly One51, has not delivered as investors would have hoped, with the company's market cap falling by about a third since its IPO last summer in Toronto.</p><h>Not-so-fabulous baker boys But the standout corporate loser of 2018 must be Aryzta. No, the Swiss-Irish baking group didn't collapse; no, there weren't any executive scandals; it just had an unremitting bad year. Having issued yet another profit warning in May, Aryzta ultimately returned to markets to raise EUR 790 million in a contentious rights issue that was narrowly approved as it looks to effect a major restructuring and reduce its debt. </h><p>And even in that, it managed to alienate a group of its original IAWS shareholders, who found themselves effectively disenfranchised and with just a tiny fraction of their original investment. Aryzta's presence on the losers list is unlikely to be the biggest headache for its executive team this Christmas but they'll most certainly be hoping that their strategy starts to pay off in 2019. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.3742594</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V2J-G2C1-JC8Y-8144-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3003\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 28, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC000A014</classCode><className>TOTAL PRODUCE PLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009RXD</classCode><className>EMERGENT BIOSOLUTIONS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>NAICS111339 OTHER NONCITRUS FRUIT FARMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS325412 PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATION MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>TOT (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>EBS (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DO1N</classCode><className>NARCOTICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DM6D</classCode><className>OPIOID CRISIS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00090NT</classCode><className>ECONOMIC CONDITIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00096UW</classCode><className>HOMEOWNERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001949</classCode><className>LAND USE &amp;

The project could launch as soon as March, one of them said.</p><p>Goldman, which declined to comment, has been transforming itself from a trading and investment banking powerhouse into a broader financial services group that more closely resembles rivals JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Citigroup Inc. David Solomon, Goldman's chief executive, told shareholders last week that the bank would boost returns by generating revenue from new sources such as consumer banking and wealth management.</p><p>For Amazon, a Goldman deal would be in line with CEO Jeff Bezos' push to turn the company into an infrastructure provider that profits from a growing chunk of online trade by charging for a host of commercial services offered to other companies.</p><p>John Cronin, an analyst at brokerage Goodbody's, said banking partnerships could enable Amazon to \"significantly extend\" its small- and medium-size business lending platform \"without any associated credit risk of regulatory obligations.\"</p><p>Amazon declined to comment on the Goldman talks but said lending was one of the services provided to \"our selling partners, mostly small- and medium-sized businesses, who account for more than half of everything sold in Amazon's stores.\"</p><p>Amazon has already expanded beyond its origins as an online bookseller by building businesses that sell cloud computing space and use of warehouse facilities to a variety of companies.</p><p>It had outstanding small-business loans of more than $863 million on its own balance sheet at the end of 2019. For the last eight years it has lent to small businesses that sell on its site, using the data it holds on their cash positions to offer quick-decision loans in a handful of countries.</p><p>Last year Goldman struck a credit card partnership with Apple Inc., which featured the bank's branding on the physical card and in some marketing and gave Goldman a direct channel to Apple's more than 100 million U.S. iPhone users.</p><p>Executives at Goldman, which lacks the physical branch network that most banks use to attract small- and medium-size business customers, have described the Apple Card as the \"most successful credit card launch ever.\"</p><p>Card lending is known to account for a significant portion of the $7 billion of consumer loans and card balances the bank had at the end of last year.</p><p>Goldman's new consumer ventures accounted for less than 3% of revenue last year, while the cards and consumer loan balances at the end of 2019 were less than 1% of its $993 billion in total assets.</p><p>--</p><p>Copyright The Financial Times Ltd. 2020.

It is time for the rest of the world, including my home country, to follow your lead,\" Cook said.</p><p>\"We at Apple are in full support of a comprehensive federal privacy law in the United States,\" he said, to applause from hundreds of privacy officials from more than 70 countries.</p><p>In the U.S., California is moving to put in regulations similar to the EU's strict rules by 2020 and other states are mulling over more aggressive laws. That's rattled the big tech companies, which are pushing for a federal law that would treat them more leniently.</p><p>Cook warned that technology's promise to drive breakthroughs that benefit humanity is at risk of being overshadowed by the harm it can cause by deepening divisions and spreading false information.</p><p>He said the trade in personal information \"has exploded into a data industrial complex.\"</p><p>\"Our own information, from the everyday to the deeply personal, is being weaponized against us with military efficiency,\" he said. Scraps of personal data are collected for digital profiles that let businesses know users better than they know themselves and allow companies to offer users \"increasingly extreme content\" that hardens their convictions, Cook said.</p><p>\"This is surveillance. And these stockpiles of personal data serve only to enrich only the companies that collect them,\" he said. \"This should make us very uncomfortable. It should unsettle us.\"</p><p>Cook's appearance was one up on his tech rivals and showed off his company's credentials in data privacy, which has become a weak point for both Facebook and Google.</p><p>\"With the spotlight shining as directly as it is, Apple [has] the opportunity to show that they are the leading player and they are taking up the mantle,\" said Ben Robson, a lawyer at Oury Clark specializing in data privacy. Cook's appearance \"is going to have good currency\" with officials, he added.</p><p>The speech comes a week after the iPhone maker unveiled expanded privacy protection measures for people in the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand, including allowing them to download all personal data held by Apple. European users already had access to this feature after GDPR took effect in May.

Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), chairwoman of the Consumer Protection and Commerce Subcommittee, told reporters after the hearing that language similar to Section 230 has no place in a trade agreement.</p><p>\"It is a uniquely American law, and we're in the midst of a discussion about it, and this is a gift to Big Tech to insert it into trade agreements,\" Schakowsky said.</p><p>The debate comes as world leaders look to increase the companies' responsibility for problematic content such as terrorist propaganda. If countries that don't have similar liability exemptions adopt them through trade agreements, then tech companies would have more protection from lawsuits over content.</p><p>Democrats and the White House are moving closer to a deal on the revised NAFTA, called the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement, or USMCA. The two sides are working to improve enforcement of the treaty but haven't resolved other concerns. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), who decides whether to bring the pact to the floor for a vote, has said Democrats want to be on a \"path to yes\" on USMCA.</p><p>The panel had invited U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to testify, but he declined to appear, which Pallone had previously called \"extremely disappointing.\"</p><p>Pallone and Rep. Greg Walden of Oregon, the top Republican on the committee, had sent a letter to Lighthizer in August asking him not to include provisions similar to Section 230 in future trade agreements. Walden said he was frustrated with the lack of response from President Trump's administration and Lighthizer.</p><p>\"I thought the letter to the ambassador was going to send the right message,\" Walden said at the hearing, adding that the committee doesn't want to \"blow up\" the trade deal. \"But we're getting blown off on this, and I'm tired of it.\"</p><p>A message was left with the U.S. trade representative seeking a response to lawmaker complaints about including language similar to Section 230 in the trade agreements and Lighthizer declining to appear before the committee or consult the panel.</p><p>The hearing comes amid growing skepticism among lawmakers about whether social media companies should keep the legal protection as a part of U.S. law as they struggle to stem drug and gun sales and offensive content on their platforms.</p><p>Tech companies value the measure because it saves them from having to review users' posts before they're published online and then shields them from lawsuits if that content turns out to be problematic, which critics say allows the companies to avoid taking responsibility for dangerous and illegal content.</p><p>Yet the companies emphasized that the law also can protect their moves to remove violent content and misinformation, which they say is needed to police their online spaces.</p><p>Katherine Oyama, Google's global head of intellectual property policy, and Reddit Chief Executive Steve Huffman said that any significant changes to their liability protection would hurt their ability to curb harmful content on the internet and hamper the growth of new companies.</p><p>Oyama said the legal measure helped digital platforms turn the internet into an open and thriving marketplace that benefits users and businesses. If the immunity were eliminated, companies would face an onslaught of lawsuits, she said.</p><p>Tech industry advocates also say that amending the legal liability shield would impose onerous burdens on smaller companies while protecting the bigger tech companies from more market competition.</p><p>Lawmakers at Wednesday's hearing showed an increasing willingness to modify the legal liability shield but stopped short of calling for its repeal. At one point during the hearing, Schakowsky asked her colleagues to raise their hands if they wanted to eliminate Section 230. No member did.</p><p>Rep. Bill Johnson (R-Ohio) urged tech companies to do a better job moderating their platforms if they don't want onerous regulations.</p><p>\"I would suggest to the entire industry of the internet, social media platforms, you better get serious about this self-regulating,\" Johnson said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: HOUSE Energy and Commerce Committee head Frank Pallone Jr. opposes the legal liability shield.

The agency's orders take aim not at big deals, but those that were too small to be reported to regulators but may have targeted nascent competitors.</p><p>The study, which is focused on \"research and policy,\" can lead to enforcement action, including unwinding transactions the FTC finds were problematic, Simons told reporters Tuesday.</p><p>The orders also require companies to provide information and documents on their corporate acquisition strategies, voting and board appointment agreements, pacts to hire key personnel from other companies, and post-employment covenants not to compete.</p><p>The FTC is also seeking details about post-acquisition product development and pricing, including whether and how acquired assets were integrated and how acquired data has been treated.</p><p>Some of the tech companies' shares traded lower after the news.</p><p>The agency is studying past tech deals as it conducts an antitrust investigation of Facebook. The inquiry is among several that target large technology companies. The Justice Department is investigating Facebook as well as Google, while state attorneys general are also looking into both companies.</p><p>The inclusion of Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, in the inquiry may be met with dismay at the company, which lost an antitrust battle with U.S. regulators two decades ago but has mostly avoided the same level of criticism and scrutiny as the other tech giants in recent years.</p><p>Here's a look at past small acquisitions by the five tech companies:</p><p>Google</p><p>The new investigation could look at dozens of small acquisitions made by Google in the last 10 years. The company often does \"acqui-hires,\" buyouts with the purpose of bringing on engineers who may not even have a viable business yet. Some of these deals aren't publicly announced.</p><p>From about 2010 to 2014 Google made many acquisitions in the advertising technology space as it sought to build up its business in that industry. Some were relatively large, such as the $250-million buyout of Wildfire Interactive, but most were small and passed beneath the radar of regulators.</p><p>A Google representative had no immediate comment.</p><p>--</p><p>Apple</p><p>Apple has purchased hundreds of companies since 2010, but most of them have been small deals focusing on technologies to enable specific new device features.</p><p>For instance, as the company built up its revamped Maps app, it bought lesser-known companies such as Embark, Locationary, BroadMap, Indoor.io, MapSense and HopStop.com. To develop its latest machine learning and voice control software, it acquired start-ups such as Cue, VocalIQ, Turi, Lattice Data, TupleJump and Perceptio.</p><p>Apple didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Facebook</p><p>Although many of Facebook's most high-profile deals are well known -- Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus -- the social networking giant has acquired dozens of smaller start-ups over the years in various industries. The purchases of Instagram and WhatsApp were approved by the FTC.</p><p>In some cases, these acquisitions were meant to help Facebook compete directly with rival social networks and consumer apps. It bought Onavo, a service for tracking a person's mobile activity, in 2013, and used the data for years to keep tabs on competing products and identify new entrants.</p><p>After Snapchat popularized augmented-reality face filters, Facebook purchased its own face-filter app, MSQRD, to build the technology into the cameras on Facebook and Instagram.</p><p>In other cases, Facebook simply bought companies for their engineering and product talent.</p><p>Facebook didn't respond to requests seeking comment.</p><p>Amazon</p><p>Amazon's small acquisitions in recent years include companies working on internet-connected smart home, networking devices and cloud-computing applications that were folded into the Amazon Web Services division.</p><p>Among them are a members-only retail site called BuyVIP, cloud computing start-up E8 Storage and Eero Inc., a Wi-Fi system maker.</p><p>The company's biggest acquisition, Whole Foods in 2017 for $13.6 billion, received regulatory approval.</p><p>Amazon declined to comment on the FTC's orders Tuesday.</p><p>--</p><p>Microsoft</p><p>Although big deals such as LinkedIn and GitHub get the most attention, the vast majority of Microsoft's acquisitions are smaller ones meant to gain promising technology or employees.</p><p>The company made at least nine such purchases in 2019, including Mover, which makes it easier to move cloud files to Microsoft's 365 services from rivals, and data security firm BlueTalon. In 2018, Microsoft acquired Bonsai to combine it with research efforts around machine automation and PlayFab, which allows Microsoft to help video game companies run their games in Microsoft's cloud.</p><p>The software maker didn't return calls seeking comment.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: THE FTC wants transaction records from Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook dating from 2010.

The success is raising questions about the company's strategy and sprawling influence over the technology industry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the last year and a half, four of CapitalG's 36 portfolio companies have gone public, including Lyft Inc. and Crowdstrike Holdings Inc.Airbnb Inc. plans to do the same. Four others have been acquired. One of them, cloud analytics provider Looker, was bought by Google itself for $2.6 billion. At the end of June, Alphabet's stakes in privately held companies were worth almost $11 billion, with unrealized gains of almost $3 billion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The company's private investing arms have done more deals in the last two years than any other corporate venture investor, according to industry tracker CB Insights. Last year, CapitalG made a record nine \"unicorn\" investments in companies worth more than $1 billion. In second place? GV, Alphabet's venture capital unit, which bought stakes in three unicorns among its industry-leading 70-plus deals.</p><p>Google struggles to make big acquisitions in its main areas of business, partly because of concern over antitrust regulation. Its last huge deal was Motorola almost a decade ago. If the company can't buy promising tech firms outright, the next best thing is investing in them. This helps Google keep tabs on the latest innovations bubbling up in Silicon Valley, and means Alphabet shareholders benefit if the creations turn out to be hits.</p><p>Still, there's so much scrutiny of large technology companies that even this strategy sows suspicion in Silicon Valley and could come under the regulatory microscope.</p><p>\"Deal flow gives you a lot of insight into what other people are doing in the market,\" said Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute, which studies and recommends competition policies. \"It's just one more tool that they have to exert power.\"</p><p>Google's clout was so much of a concern for one financial technology company that it ended up rejecting money from an Alphabet investment arm, according to Pascal Bouvier, managing partner of MiddleGame Ventures.</p><p>\"If Google decides to get into that line, all of a sudden you may have a formidable competitor,\" Bouvier said. He worked at another venture capital firm when the deal was spurned and declined to name the fintech firm involved.</p><p>These are questions that CapitalG executives have gotten before. They say they're not a tool of Alphabet to corner digital markets and insist their mission is the same as traditional private tech investors: generate a return on investments.</p><p>David Lawee, the 53-year-old start-up veteran who heads CapitalG, recalled a dinner in 2017 with a group of entrepreneurs and Google co-founder Larry Page, at which someone asked what CapitalG's purpose was.</p><p>Page turned to Lawee, who responded: \"Make money.\"</p><p>\"That's it!\" Page said.</p><p>Dealing with a company the size of Alphabet, though, it's hard to ignore potential conflicts. Lawee is on the board of Lyft. GV bought a large stake in rival Uber Technologies Inc. And Waymo, Alphabet's self-driving technology unit, could compete with both one day.</p><p>To avoid the appearance of conflicts, Lawee said CapitalG is careful about where it invests while maintaining strict firewalls to protect trade secrets and intellectual property.</p><p>\"There's a few areas we've decided not to be as forward-leaning -- self-driving cars as an example,\" he said during an interview at CapitalG's eighth-floor offices with postcard views of the San Francisco Bay. \"We're not sharing any data back with Google. But we don't want anyone to have that perception.\"</p><p>CapitalG is independent from Google, added Laela Sturdy, a veteran Google worker who along with former TPG Capital executive Gene Frantz make up the trio of partners running the unit. It is also run separately from GV, which invests in early-stage start-ups and shares the same building. \"We operate like any other investment fund,\" Sturdy, 41, said.</p><p>Still, scrutiny is intensifying. Some powerful people in Washington think Google is too big, and to them, nothing the company does is outside the realm of potential anti-competitive behavior.</p><p>Last month, Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), who is leading an antitrust investigation of Google and other big tech companies, asked about Alphabet's venture capital fund.</p><p>\"Unlike many other corporate venture funds, our funds are not designed to create a pipeline for future strategic acquisitions,\" Kent Walker, Google's chief legal officer said in a written response. \"These funds run independently of Google, and there are strict boundaries between the funds and Google to prevent confidential information about any of the funds' portfolio companies from being shared with Google or any other Alphabet entities.\"</p><p>Lawee's position on Lyft's board is one place where lawmakers might cry foul, said Michael Kades, director for markets and competition at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a progressive think tank. A board seat could make it look like Google has influence on Lyft's business, even if CapitalG is officially independent from Google, Kades said.</p><p>CapitalG executives disclose few financial details. Unlike other private equity or venture firms, they have only one partner -- parent Alphabet -- and don't need to raise outside money or return cash to investors on a deadline. They typically invest in only half a dozen start-ups a year, among more than 5,000 on their radar.</p><p>Lawee's pitch, when he started CapitalG as Google Capital in 2013 with the blessing of Page and a top Google lawyer, David Drummond, was to help younger companies grow by matching them with Google experts in areas such as artificial intelligence, marketing and human resources. Lawee knew the value of that expertise, having spent five years overseeing more than 100 acquisitions for Google, including DoubleClick and AdMob.</p><p>CapitalG has delivered on that access, according to officers at several portfolio companies.</p><p>\"They've connected us with probably dozens of people,\" said Luis von Ahn, CEO and co-founder of language-learning app Duolingo. At one point, his start-up wanted to start creating its own instructional videos, Von Ahn said. \"Within two days, we were talking to the head of original content on YouTube.\" (In 2009, Google acquired Recaptcha, another company he co-founded.)</p><p>Daniel Dines, CEO of automation technology start-up UiPath, said he didn't need CapitalG's money when the firm approached him. But the chance to work with GoogleAI experts piqued his interest. In a presentation at a borrowed office in Manhattan, CapitalG's Sturdy clinched the deal. \"I got the sense her allegiance is with UiPath and not with Google,\" Dines said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: AT THE END of June, Alphabet's stakes in privately held companies were worth almost $11 billion.

Since 2014, she has slapped Google with multibillion-dollar antitrust penalties, ordered Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. to pay back taxes, and fined Facebook Inc. over its WhatsApp acquisition -- flagship enforcement cases that have struck fear into U.S. tech companies while drawing attention in Washington.</p><p>Now, in her final year in office, the 50-year-old Danish politician is laying the groundwork for a new phase of regulation beyond the end of her term in October.</p><p>She's planning a report meant to guide EU competition policies in the digital era. Feedback from companies, business groups and experts shows that many see the need for more regulation, and when it's published in March, the report by three expert advisors will reflect the need for new or tougher rules, she said in a recent interview.</p><p>\"The most important thing is that the majority of input is pro-enforcement,\" Vestager said during one of her frequent visits to Copenhagen from her Brussels base. The digital technology industry can no longer be allowed to shape itself, she added: \"We are way beyond that.\"</p><p>It's unclear yet what shape the new enforcement will take, but it may not bode well for the big U.S. technology companies that have landed in Vestager's crosshairs.</p><p>Vestager has cultivated a down-to-earth image -- she likes to knit elephants during meetings -- that belies her formidable powers of enforcement.</p><p>She opened three antitrust cases against Google, including one that resulted in a record $5-billion fine for forcing cellphone makers to use the internet giant's software on Android phones. A separate $2.8-billion penalty was punishment for manipulating shopping search results. Before her term ends, she aims to wrap up an investigation of whether Google blocked rivals from its Adsense ad service.</p><p>Vestager ordered Apple to pay as much as $15 billion in back taxes to Ireland. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook called it \"total political crap,\" and President Trump referred to her as the \"tax lady\" who \"really hates the U.S.\"</p><p>The EU competition commissioner, with a staff of 900 people, is unusually powerful in the Brussels bureaucracy because it can enforce bloc-wide rules, giving it the power to take on countries and companies. Other departments typically share regulatory duties with national governments. Vestager's job includes approving or rejecting mergers and investigating cartels and antitrust behavior. She also makes sure EU states don't give tax breaks to individual companies that are not available to other corporations -- legitimate business strategy in the United States but illegal in Europe.</p><p>A lot of attention is now falling on data, the commodity that drives the digital economy.</p><p>Information collected by web browsers, apps, smartphones and other devices can be enormously valuable to companies because it can provide insight about, for example, an individual's buying habits and movements. Data can power artificial intelligence or be used to show targeted ads. Vestager is concerned that a small group of companies could corner the market and abuse their power.</p><p>She started confronting the problem with an informal investigation launched last year into whether online shopping giant Amazon was using data to gain an edge on third-party merchants, which are both its customers and its rivals. She hopes to decide within six months whether to open a formal investigation.</p><p>Many people still aren't sure how to take control of their personal information. European privacy rules introduced last year were a start, obliging companies to be more transparent about what they do with people's data. But consumers are often still overwhelmed by detailed consent forms for third-party tracking on each new site they visit or the fine print of an app's service terms.</p><p>Vestager, a member of a small left-wing political party who believes in free markets, said the private sector can play a role in finding solutions.</p><p>\"I think you need products that will help you exercise your rights. Independent digital assistants that will make sure that your privacy settings are maintained no matter where you go. That kind of stuff,\" she said.</p><p>Vestager, whose party was founded by her great-grandfather, was Denmark's deputy prime minister and economy minister before taking up her post in Brussels in late 2014.</p><p>Although Vestager's term runs out in October, she's hoping for a second stint, an unlikely prospect because her party is out of power in Denmark.</p><p>\"Sometimes things are unlikely but not impossible,\" Vestager said. \"I'm in the middle of something, and we're not done yet.\"</p><p>Vestager brushes off criticism that she's stifling innovation by targeting U.S. companies to help prop up European firms. She has also taken on Starbucks and McDonald's, and this month she opened an investigation into Nike's tax arrangements. But other targets have included Italian automaker Fiat and Russian gas giant Gazprom.</p><p>\"When you look at our cases, you'd see that what they have in common is not nationality. It's the fact that they're multinationals,\" she said.</p><p>Her aim, she says, is to keep competition fair.</p><p>\"That was the idea before the world became digital,\" Vestager said. \"And it becomes an even more important idea when the world becomes digital because things are so fast moving.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: MARGRETHE VESTAGER, whose term as competition commissioner ends this year, hopes for another stint.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) pledged Friday to take aim at Amazon, Facebook and Google if she is elected president in 2020, breaking apart each of the big tech companies and introducing sweeping new regulation of Silicon Valley.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The proposal marks the most ambitious and aggressive effort targeting the tech industry offered by any Democratic contender for the White House, and it could put pressure on other presidential aspirants to offer similar plans for more aggressive tech oversight.</p><p>\"To restore the balance of power in our democracy, to promote competition, and to ensure that the next generation of technology innovation is as vibrant as the last, it's time to break up our biggest tech companies,\" Warren said.</p><p>Warren's proposal has two key elements. First, the lawmaker said her administration would appoint \"regulators committed to reversing illegal and anti-competitive tech mergers,\" including Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods, Facebook's tie-up with WhatsApp and Instagram, and Google's ownership of Waze, Nest and DoubleClick.</p><p>Second, Warren said she would push legislation that would label key services -- such as Amazon's marketplace for goods and Google search -- as \"platform utilities,\" which would have to be spun off from those tech giants' other businesses.</p><p>Her plan primarily targets companies with annual revenue over $90 million, and it would embolden federal and state regulators to issue steep fines and other penalties for practices that harm competition or consumers. Even Web users could sue Amazon, Facebook and Google if the companies violated Warren's proposed federal rules.</p><p>Warren's blueprint -- detailed in a Medium post -- was unveiled as she prepared to speak to supporters in New York's Long Island City neighborhood, where Amazon initially sought to construct one of two new headquarters. The company ultimately withdrew from the city amid staunch local opposition and fierce criticism from national figures such as Warren, who felt Amazon had received \"taxpayer bribes\" from New York.</p><p>\"We must ensure that today's tech giants do not crowd out potential competitors, smother the next generation of great tech companies, and wield so much power that they can undermine our democracy,\" Warren said in the Medium post.</p><p>Amazon, Facebook and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>For now, Warren's plan illustrates the tech industry's political fall from grace, as policymakers around the world begin to confront the ills posed by Silicon Valley -- from the job losses threatened by the rise of automation to the fast spread of falsehoods online. Privacy scandals, fears of election interference and rapid consolidation have soured even the industry's historically close ties with Democrats in Washington in recent years.</p><p>Previously, Democratic presidential candidates jockeyed to be seen as digitally savvy in the hopes of courting young voters and raising critical cash from tech moguls' deep pockets. Then-candidate Barack Obama even appeared at Google headquarters during the early days of his 2008 campaign.</p><p>More than a decade later, though, the party's most prominent national figures have become some of Silicon Valley's fiercest critics, responding to mounting concerns about the effects of major internet platforms on the economy and even democracy itself.</p><p>Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), another 2020 presidential hopeful, broadly has decried the \"major monopoly problem\" in the United States -- particularly with big tech. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), meanwhile, has tangled with Amazon over its business practices, particularly its treatment of workers. While neither they nor any other presidential contenders have issued a plan as aggressive as Warren's, tech experts in Washington said the party in general had set its sights on reining in the tech industry.</p><p>\"I don't believe this will be an out-of-the-mainstream proposal in 2020,\" said Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank where representatives from Apple, Microsoft, Google and other tech companies sit on the board of directors.</p><p>Calling Warren's proposal \"appalling,\" he said of the tech industry's ties to Democrats: \"Not only is the honeymoon over, but they're in divorce court.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: SEN.

In order of their release dare, here are 20 books we feel are worthy of slowing down for in the month of November, beginning with one we missed from late last month.  Work is Love Made Visible: A Collection of Essays About the Power of Finding Your Purpose From the World's Greatest Thought Leaders[1] byFrances Hesselbein, Marshall Goldsmith, and Sarah McArthur, Wiley Channel happiness and find your purpose with stories from the world's leading minds. </p><p>Work is Love Made Visible[2] offers the insights of some of the world's greatest thought leaders as they tackle one of life's most difficult treasure hunts: finding purpose. The word 'purpose' is big. Very big. And heavy. It carries the weight of a lifetime of work and struggle; the weight of legacy, and the mass of days spent not doing something else. It's something we all grapple with at some point\u2014some of us find our purpose, others spend a lifetime searching. A lucky few grow to realize they've been working their purpose all along. Most of us aren't quite that lucky; often, fulfilling your purpose requires some kind of change\u2014career, lifestyle, habits, family\u2014and what then? Are we selfish for the upheaval, or are we fulfilling destiny? Once we know our purpose, how do we pursue it? This book asked those very questions of people who have followed their purpose and succeeded on a global scale. Their undistilled answers are here, lending you the wisdom of their experiences, their examples, inspiration, and motivations as they: Tackle the universal struggle with individual purpose and meaning Illustrate how personal thought patterns contribute to real-world action Move challenges into the opportunities of their lives Reveal how they arrived at their life's purpose, and what they sacrificed to get there We all want a meaningful life. We want to work together for a brighter future, we want to celebrate our differences and commit to good. We want to inspire others, nurture their talents, and help them grow. We want to look back one day on a life well-lived, and leave something behind that matters to the world.Work is Love Made Visible[3]shows you how some of us have succeeded, and offers you insight and guidance so that you can do the same. Shaping the Future of the Fourth Industrial Revolution: A Guide to Building a Better World[4] byKlaus Schwab, with Nicholas Davis, Currency World Economic Forum Founder and Executive Chairman Klaus Schwab offers a practical companion and field guide to his previous book, The Fourth Industrial Revolution[5]. Today, technology is changing everything\u2014how we relate to one another, the way we work, how our economies and goverments function, and even what it means to be human. One need not look hard to see how the incredible advances in artificial intelligence, cryptocurrencies, biotechnologies, and the internet of things are transforming society in unprecedented ways. But the Fourth Industrial Revolution is just beginning, says Schwab. And at a time of such tremendous uncertainty and such rapid change, he argues it's our actions as individuals and leaders that will determine the trajectory our future will take. We all have a responsibility\u2014as citizens, businesses, and institutions\u2014to work with the current of progress, not against it, to build a future that is ethical, inclusive, sustainable, and prosperous. Drawing on contributions from 200 top experts in fields ranging from machine learning to geoengineering to nanotechnology, to data ethics, Schwab equips readers with the practical tools to leverage the technologies of the future to leave the world better, safer, and more resilient than we found it.

After all, how many companies can get their customers to tattoo their logo on their arms? After having worked with more than one thousand companies worldwide, Schmidt is ready to share the secrets that spurred Harley-Davidson's remarkable turnaround. An avid motorcycle enthusiast, Schmidt harnessed his passion for riding to create his famed Noise Cubed Trilogy\u2014the three questions he asks every one of his clients. They assess a company's positioning, competitiveness, and reputation, and are the key ingredients for any successful corporation: What do the customers your business served yesterday say about your business when they're talking about you to prospective customers? What do you want them to say? What are you doing to get them to say it? InMake Some Noise[7], Schmidt shares his full-throttle approach for businesses and individuals alike. Anyone looking to become more competitive and grow customer loyalty can learn from the case studies and experiences he shares. From a nondescript heavy construction company, to the most high-end 'luxury' gas station in America, to Apple, and to his own personal landscaper, Schmidt illustrates how the answers to his trio of questions will yield a course of action to stand out in today's marketplace. Eat Their Lunch: Winning Customers Away from Your Competition[8] byAnthony Iannarino, Portfolio The first ever playbook for B2B salespeople on how to win clients and customers who are already being serviced by your competition, from the author of The Only Sales Guide You'll Ever Need[9] and The Lost Art of Closing[10]. Like it or not, sales is often a zero-sum game: Your win is someone else's loss. Most salespeople work in mature, overcrowded industries, your offerings perceived (often unfairly) as commodities. Growth requires taking market share from your competitors, while they try to do the same to you. How else can you grow 12 percent a year in an industry that's only growing by 3 percent? It's not easy for any salesperson to execute a competitive displacement\u2014or, in other words, 'eat their lunch.' You might think this requires a bloodthirsty 'whatever it takes' attitude, but that's the opposite of what works. If you act like a Mafia don, you only make yourself difficult to trust and impossible to see as a long-term partner. Instead, this book shows you how to find and maintain a long-term competitive advantage by taking steps like: ranking prospective new clients not by their size or convenience to you, but by who stands to gain the most from your solution. understanding the different priorities for everyone in your prospect's organization, from the CEO to the accountants, and addressing their various concerns. developing a systematic contact plan for all those different stakeholders so you can win over the right people at the organization in the optimal sequence. Your competitors may be tough, but with the strategies you'll discover in this book, you'll soon be eating their lunch. Leading Transformation: How to Take Charge of Your Company's Future[11] byNathan Furr, Kyle Nel, and Thomas Zoega Ramsoy, Harvard Business Review Press New Tools to Overcome the Human Barriers to Change. Leaders know that their job is to transform their organizations to keep pace with technology and an ever-changing business environment. They also know that they are bound to fail in doing so. But this discouraging prospect is not because they won't be able to solve a technological or strategic problem. Leaders will fail because of intractable human responses associated with change\u2014responses such as fear, ingrained habits, politics, incrementalism, and lack of imagination. These stumbling blocks always arise when we humans are faced with change, but what if we had a way to transcend them? This book reveals a radical new method for doing just that. Written by the executive who designed and implemented it, the neuroscientist who helped make it work, and the academic who explains why it works and how to do it,Leading Transformation[12]introduces an innovative yet proven process for creating breakthrough change. Divided into three steps\u2014envisioning the possible, breaking down resistance, and prototyping the future\u2014this process uses cutting-edge tools such as science fiction, cartoons, rap music, artifact trails, and neuroprototypes to overcome people's inability to imagine or react to what doesn't yet exist, override powerful habits and routines that prevent them from changing, and create compelling narratives about the organization's future and how to get there. Showing how these tools have been used successfully by companies such as Lowe's, Walmart, Pepsi, IKEA, Google, Microsoft, and others, the process revealed in this book gives leaders the means to transcend the human barriers that block change and lead their organizations confidently into the future. Automating Humanity[13] byJoe Toscano, powerHouse Books A shocking and eye-opening new manifesto from international award-winning designer Joe Toscano that unravels and lays bare the power agendas of the world's greatest tech titans in plain language, and delivers a fair warning to policymakers, civilians, and industry professionals alike: we need a strategy for the future, and we need it now. Automating Humanity[14] is an insider's perspective on everything Big Tech doesn't want the public to know\u2014or think about\u2014from the addictions installed on a global scale to the profits being driven by fake news and disinformation, to the way they're manipulating the world for profit and using our data to train systems that will automate jobs at an explosive, unprecedented scale. Toscano provides a critique of modern regulation, including parts of the new European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) suggesting how we can create proactive, adaptable regulation that satisfies both the needs of consumer safety and commercial success in the international economy. The content touches on everything from technology, economics, and public policy to psychology, history, and ethics, and is written in a way that is accessible to everyone from the average reader to the technical expert. Oil, Power, and War: A Dark History[15] byMatthieu Auzanneau, Chelsea Green Publishing A critical \"People's History,\" looking at the way oil interests have commandeered politics and economies, changed cultures, disrupted power balances across the globe, and spawned wars. Auzanneau upends commonly held assumptions about key political and financial events of the past 150 years, and he sheds light on what our oil-constrained and eventually post-oil future might look like. Oil, Power, and War[16] follows the oil industry from its heyday when the first oil wells were drilled to the quest for new sources as old ones dried up. It traces the rise of the Seven Sisters and other oil cartels and exposes oil's key role in the crises that have shaped our times: two world wars, the Cold War, the Great Depression, Bretton Woods, the 2008 financial crash, oil shocks, wars in the Middle East, the race for Africa's oil riches, and more. And it defines the oil-born trends shaping our current moment, such as the jockeying for access to Russia's vast oil resources, the search for extreme substitutes for declining conventional oil, the rise of terrorism, and the changing nature of economic growth. We meet a long line of characters from John D. Rockefeller to Dick Cheney and Rex Tillerson, and hear lesser-known stories like how New York City taxes were once funneled directly to banks run by oil barons. We see how oil and power, once they became inextricably linked, drove actions of major figures like Churchill, Roosevelt, Stalin, Hitler, Kissinger, and the Bushes. We also learn the fascinating backstory sparked by lesser-known but key personalities such as Calouste Gulbenkian, Abdullah al-Tariki, and Marion King Hubbert, the once-silenced oil industry expert who warned his colleagues that oil production was facing its peak. Oil, Power, and War[17] is a story of the dreams and hubris that spawned an era of economic chaos, climate change, war, and terrorism\u2014as well as an eloquent framing from which to consider our options as our primary source of power, in many ways irreplacable, grows ever more constrained. Kickback: Exposing the Global Corporate Bribery Network[18] byDavid Montero, Viking An investigation into corporate bribery around the world and how it undermines democracy and the free market system. The World Bank estimates that rich multinational corporations pay hundreds of billions of dollars in bribes every year to officials overseas. The perpetrators are not a handful of rogue companies, but many members of the Fortune 500. Kickback is a sweeping, global investigation into corporate bribery around the world and how these back-door financial transactions undermine democracy and the free market system by lining the pockets of some of the world's worst dictators and criminals. Ultimately this system affects billions of people by creating conditions that lead to poverty, violence, environmental disaster, and political instability in countries like Nigeria, Bahrain, Costa Rica, and Iraq. Kickback[19] examines the origins of corporate bribery during the reign of the British East India Company, the methods by which it is carried out today, and its effects at both the individual and the national level throughout the globe. From the murder of a young activist in Bangladesh, to a Texas billionaire's dealings with Sadaam Hussein, to pharmaceutical firms' payoffs to gain market share in China, to corporations who outsource bribery to 'superagents' in the criminal underworld, to how the entrenched culture of bribery helped destroy the Greek economy. Montero also examines the countermeasures that have been introduced to combat these practices, from the Justice Department's efforts to halt them to identifying and restituting its victims. Given the new era of profound uncertainty we are entering\u2014as allegations mount that President Donald Trump and his associates are possibly tainted by bribery themselves, as the strength of the European Union founders and the power of China rises, as the global economy continues on a path of perilous flux\u2014the stakes for eradicating corporate bribery have never been higher. American Overdose: The Opioid Tragedy in Three Acts[20] byChris McGreal, PublicAffairs A comprehensive portrait of a uniquely American epidemic\u2014devastating in its findings and damning in its conclusions. The opioid epidemic has been described as \"one of the greatest mistakes of modern medicine.\" But calling it a mistake is a generous rewriting of the history of greed, corruption, and indifference that pushed the US into consuming more than 80 percent of the world's opioid painkillers. Journeying through lives and communities wrecked by the epidemic, Chris McGreal reveals not only how Big Pharma hooked Americans on powerfully addictive drugs, but the corrupting of medicine and public institutions that let the opioid makers get away with it. The starting point for McGreal's deeply reported investigation is the miners promised that opioid painkillers would restore their wrecked bodies, but who became targets of \"drug dealers in white coats.\" A few heroic physicians warned of impending disaster. ButAmerican Overdose[21]exposes the powerful forces they were up against, including the pharmaceutical industry's coopting of the Food and Drug Administration and Congress in the drive to push painkillers\u2014resulting in the resurgence of heroin cartels in the American heartland. McGreal tells the story, in terms both broad and intimate, of people hit by a catastrophe they never saw coming. Years in the making, its ruinous consequences will stretch years into the future. Back to Human: How Great Leaders Create Connection in the Age of Isolation[22] by Dan Schawbel, Da Capo Lifelong Books Back to Human[23] explains how a more socially connected workforce creates greater fulfillment, productivity, and engagement while preventing burnout and turnover. New York Times bestselling author Dan Schawbel guides the next generation of leaders to create a workplace where teammates feel genuinely connected, engaged, and empowered to grow strong interpersonal skills rather than relying on technology. Based on Schawbel's exclusive research studies\u2014featuring the perspectives of over 2,000 managers and employees across different age groups and from the US, UK, China, India, Brazil, and other countries\u2014Back to Human[24] reveals why electronic and virtual communication, though vital and useful, actually contributes to a stronger sense of isolation at work than ever before. The corporate cultures we are experiencing right now need to change, and Schawbel offers a new leadership model featuring The Work-Life Balance Myth (we should consider work-life integration instead, which creates more synergies between all areas of your life and puts you in control of how you allocate your time), Shared Learning (how sharing knowledge allows you to stay relevant despite industry disruptions), and more. The book includes: Interviews with 100 leaders from notable companies including Facebook, Honeywell, HBO, Starbucks, General Mills, GE, Nike, American Express, Four Seasons, Walmart, TIME, LinkedIn, and The U.S. Air Force. A self-assessment called \"The Work Connectivity Index\" that measures the strength of team relationships. Exercises, examples, and activities that readers can work on individually, or as a team, which will help them improve their leadership skills. Tips and strategies on how to increase personal productivity, be more collaborative, and become more fulfilled at work. Dark Commerce: How a New Illicit Economy Is Threatening Our Future [25]byLouise I. Shelley, Princeton University Press A comprehensive look at the world of illicit trade. Though mankind has traded tangible goods for millennia, recent technology has changed the fundamentals of trade, in both legitimate and illegal economies. In the past three decades, the most advanced forms of illicit trade have broken with all historical precedents and, asDark Commerce[26]shows, now operate as if on steroids, tied to computers and social media. In this new world of illicit commerce, which benefits states and diverse participants, trade is impersonal and anonymized, and vast profits are made in short periods with limited accountability to sellers, intermediaries, and purchasers. Louise Shelley examines how new technology, communications, and globalization fuel the exponential growth of dangerous forms of illegal trade\u2014the markets for narcotics and child pornography online, the escalation of sex trafficking through web advertisements, and the sale of endangered species for which revenues total in the hundreds of millions of dollars. The illicit economy exacerbates many of the world's destabilizing phenomena: the perpetuation of conflicts, the proliferation of arms and weapons of mass destruction, and environmental degradation and extinction. Shelley explores illicit trade in tangible goods\u2014drugs, human beings, arms, wildlife and timber, fish, antiquities, and ubiquitous counterfeits\u2014and contrasts this with the damaging trade in cyberspace, where intangible commodities cost consumers and organizations billions as they lose identities, bank accounts, access to computer data, and intellectual property. Demonstrating that illicit trade is a business the global community cannot afford to ignore and must work together to address,Dark Commerce[27]considers diverse ways of responding to this increasing challenge. Just Giving: Why Philanthropy Is Failing Democracy and How It Can Do Better[28] byRob Reich, Princeton University Press The troubling ethics and politics of philanthropy. Is philanthropy, by its very nature, a threat to today's democracy? Though we may laud wealthy individuals who give away their money for society's benefit,Just Giving[29]shows how such generosity not only isn't the unassailable good we think it to be but might also undermine democratic values and set back aspirations of justice. Big philanthropy is often an exercise of power, the conversion of private assets into public influence. And it is a form of power that is largely unaccountable, often perpetual, and lavishly tax-advantaged. The affluent\u2014and their foundations\u2014reap vast benefits even as they influence policy without accountability. And small philanthropy, or ordinary charitable giving, can be problematic as well. Charity, it turns out, does surprisingly little to provide for those in need and sometimes worsens inequality. These outcomes are shaped by the policies that define and structure philanthropy. When, how much, and to whom people give is influenced by laws governing everything from the creation of foundations and nonprofits to generous tax exemptions for donations of money and property. Rob Reich asks: What attitude and what policies should democracies have concerning individuals who give money away for public purposes? Philanthropy currently fails democracy in many ways, but Reich argues that it can be redeemed. Differentiating between individual philanthropy and private foundations, the aims of mass giving should be the decentralization of power in the production of public goods, such as the arts, education, and science. For foundations, the goal should be what Reich terms 'discovery,' or long-time-horizon innovations that enhance democratic experimentalism. Philanthropy, when properly structured, can play a crucial role in supporting a strong liberal democracy. Just Giving[30] investigates the ethical and political dimensions of philanthropy and considers how giving might better support democratic values and promote justice.

This Is Marketing[32] shows you how to do work you're proud of, whether you're a tech startup founder, a small business owner, or an executive at a large corporation. Great marketers don't use consumers to solve their company's problem; they use marketing to solve other people's problems.

This book shows you the way. The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age[33] byTim Wu, Columbia Global Reports From the man who coined the term \"net neutrality\" and who has made significant contributions to our understanding of antitrust policy and wireless communications, comes a call for tighter antitrust enforcement and an end to corporate bigness. We live in an age of extreme corporate concentration, in which global industries are controlled by just a few giant firms\u2014big banks, big pharma, and big tech, just to name a few. But concern over what Louis Brandeis called the \"curse of bigness\" can no longer remain the province of specialist lawyers and economists, for it has spilled over into policy and politics, even threatening democracy itself. History suggests that tolerance of inequality and failing to control excessive corporate power may prompt the rise of populism, nationalism, extremist politicians, and fascist regimes. In short, as Wu warns, we are in grave danger of repeating the signature errors of the twentieth century. InThe Curse of Bigness[34], Columbia professor Tim Wu tells of how figures like Brandeis and Theodore Roosevelt first confronted the democratic threats posed by the great trusts of the Gilded Age\u2014lessons of the Progressive Era that were forgotten in the last 40 years. He calls for recovering the lost tenets of the trustbusting age as part of a broader revival of American progressive ideas as we confront the fallout of persistent and extreme economic inequality. Questions Are the Answer: A Breakthrough Approach to Your Most Vexing Problems at Work and in Life[35] byHal Gregersen, HarperBusiness What if you could unlock a better answer to your most vexing problem\u2014in your workplace, community, or home life\u2014just by changing the question? Talk to creative problem-solvers and they will often tell you, the key to their success is asking a different question. Take Debbie Sterling, the social entrepreneur who created GoldieBlox. The idea came when a friend complained about too few women in engineering and Sterling wondered aloud: 'why are all the great building toys made for boys?' Or consider Nobel laureate Richard Thaler, who asked: 'would it change economic theory if we stopped pretending people were rational?' Or listen to technologist Elon Musk, who routinely challenges assumptions with questions like: 'What are people accepting as an industry standard when there's room for significant improvement?' Great questions like these have a catalytic quality\u2014that is, they dissolve barriers to creative thinking and channel the pursuit of solutions into new, accelerated pathways. Often, the moment they are voiced, they have the paradoxical effect of being utterly surprising yet instantly obvious. For innovation and leadership guru Hal Gregersen, the power of questions has always been clear\u2014but it took some years for the follow-on question to hit him: If so much depends on fresh questions, shouldn't we know more about how to arrive at them? That sent him on a research quest ultimately including over two hundred interviews with creative thinkers.Questions Are the Answer[36]delivers the insights Gregersen gained about the conditions that give rise to catalytic questions\u2014and breakthrough insights\u2014and how anyone can create them. Money and Government: The Past and Future of Economics[37] byRobert Skidelsky, Yale University Press A critical examination of economics' past and future, and how it needs to change, by one of the most eminent political economists of our time. The dominant view in economics is that money and government should play only minor roles in economic life. Economic outcomes, it is claimed, are best left to the \"invisible hand\" of the market. Yet these claims remain staunchly unsettled. The view taken in this important new book is that the omnipresence of uncertainty makes money and government essential features of any market economy. Since Adam Smith, classical economics has espoused non-intervention in markets. The Great Depression brought Keynesian economics to the fore; but stagflation in the 1970s brought a return to small-state orthodoxy. The 2008 global financial crash should have brought a reevaluation of that stance; instead the response has been punishing austerity and anemic recovery. This book aims to reintroduce Keynes's central insights to a new generation of economists, and embolden them to return money and government to the starring roles in the economic drama that they deserve.  Chief Joy Officer: How Great Leaders Elevate Human Energy and Eliminate Fear[38] byRichard Sheridan, Portfolio The founder of Menlo Innovations and author of the business culture cult classic Joy, Inc.[39] offers an inspirational guide to leaders seeking joy in the challenge of leading others. Rich Sheridan'sJoy, Inc.[40] told the story of how his tiny software company in Ann Arbor, Michigan achieved success and renown by embracing offbeat culture and human-centered values. InChief Joy Officer[41], he turns his attention from culture to leadership, and draws on his experience running Menlo and consulting elsewhere to offer a wise, provocative guide on how anyone can build leadership capacity for joy within their own organization. Chief Joy Officer[42] offers sage, hard-won advice to any manager or leader who yearns to make more of an impact on the lives of others, including: Self-understanding is the cornerstone for every virtue of leadership: authenticity, trust, humility, and optimism. Good leaders make more leaders: Learn to judge your performance not on whether people are doing what they're told, but whether they're developing independent leadership capacity. Influencing up is just as important is influencing down: how to encourage different thinking in those above you in your organizations. Filled with colorful anecdotes from Sheridan's personal journey and wisdom from many leadership mentors,Chief Joy Officer[43]offers an approachable, down-to-earth philosophy and practice that will help even the most disillusioned of middle managers bring a renewed sense of purpose to their work building others. Convinced!: How to Prove Your Competence ...n People Over[44] byJack Nasher, Berrett-Koehler Competence does not speak for itself! You can't simply display it; you have to draw people's attention to it. World-renowned negotiation and deception detection expert, business professor, and mentalist Jack Nasher offers effective, proven techniques to convince others that we are talented, trustworthy, and yes, even brilliant. Nasher offers the example of Joshua Bell, possibly the world's most famous violinist. In January 2007, at rush hour, he stepped into a Washington, DC, subway station, dressed like any street busker, and began to play a $4,000,000 Stradivarius. It was part of an experiment staged by a journalist of the Washington Post, who expected Bell's skill alone to attract an immense, awed crowd. But Bell was generally ignored, and when he stopped, nobody applauded. He made $34.17. The good news is that you don't have to accept obscurity: you can positively affect others' perception of your talent. Whether you're looking for work, giving an important presentation, seeking clients or customers for your business, or vying for a promotion, Nasher explains how to use techniques such as expectation management, verbal and nonverbal communication, the Halo Effect, competence framing, and the power of nonconformity to gain control of how others perceive you. Competence is the most highly valued professional trait. But it's not enough to be competent, you have to convey your competence. With Nasher's help you can showcase your expertise, receive the recognition you deserve, and achieve lasting success. Taking the Work Out of Networking: An Introvert's Guide to Making Connections That Count[45] byKaren Wickre, Touchstone The former Google executive, editorial director of Twitter and self-described introvert offers networking advice for anyone who has ever cancelled a coffee date due to social anxiety\u2014about how to nurture a vibrant circle of reliable contacts without leaving your comfort zone. Networking has garnered a reputation as a sort of necessary evil in the modern business world. Some do relish the opportunity to boldly work the room, introduce themselves to strangers, and find common career ground\u2014but for many others, the experience is often awkward, or even terrifying. The common networking advice for introverts are variations on the theme of overcoming or 'fixing' their quiet tendencies. But Karen Wickre is a self-described introvert who has worked in Silicon Valley for 30 years. She shows you how to embrace your true nature to create sustainable connections that can be called upon for you to get\u2014and give\u2014career assistance, advice, introductions, and lasting connections. Karen's 'embrace your quiet side' approach is for anyone who finds themselves shying away from traditional networking activities, or for those who would rather be curled up with a good book on a Friday night than out at a party. For example, if you're anxious about that big professional mixer full of people you don't know, she advises you to consider skipping it (many of these are not productive), and instead set up an intimate, one-on-one coffee date. She shows how to truly make the most out of social media to sustain what she calls 'the loose touch habit' to build your own brain trust to last a lifetime. With compelling arguments and creative strategies, this new way to network is perfect not only for introverts, but for anyone who wants for a less conventional approach to get ahead in today's job market. The Fearless Organization: Creating Psychological Safety in the Workplace for Learning, Innovation, and Growth[46] byAmy C. Edmondson, Wiley Conquer the most essential adaptation to the knowledge economy. With so much riding on innovation, creativity, and spark, it is essential to attract and retain quality talent\u2014but what good does this talent do if no one is able to speak their mind? The traditional culture of 'fitting in' and 'going along' spells doom in the knowledge economy. Success requires a continuous influx of new ideas, new challenges, and critical thought, and the interpersonal climate must not suppress, silence, ridicule or intimidate. Not every idea is good, and yes there are stupid questions, yes dissent can slow things down, but talking through these things is an essential part of the creative process. People must be allowed to voice half-finished thoughts, ask questions from left field, and brainstorm out loud. It creates a culture in which a minor flub or momentary lapse is no big deal, and where actual mistakes are owned and corrected, and where the next left-field idea could be the next big thing. This book explores this culture of psychological safety, and provides a blueprint for bringing it to life. The road is sometimes bumpy, but succinct and informative scenario-based explanations provide a clear path forward to constant learning and healthy innovation. Explore the link between psychological safety and high performance. Create a culture where it's 'safe' to express ideas, ask questions, and admit mistakes. Nurture the level of engagement and candor required in today's knowledge economy. Follow a step-by-step framework for establishing psychological safety in your team or organization. Shed the 'yes-men' approach and step into real performance. Fertilize creativity, clarify goals, achieve accountability, redefine leadership, and much more. The Fearless Organization[47] helps you bring about this most critical transformation.

to face up to the US Senate as their more concerns over the role of social media in the spreading political propaganda during elections first Apple now Amazon the online retail giant becomes the world's second Campany to be worth a trillion dollars and launches a new Hindi language service for India and on financial markets concerns about contagion and the vulnerability of emerging market currencies the South African rand and Indonesia is really clear among the latest victims in the US mid-term elections are less than two months away and the government there is keen to know just what the big tech companies are doing to ensure their platforms won't be manipulated by foreign governments or others says senior executives from Twitter and Facebook will answer questions from the Senate intelligence committee today Facebook's chief operating officer that is Cheryl I sound Also the social media giant already disabled almost 1.3 billion fake accounts that is a staggering sum and the firm has doubled the number of people it does it has working to combat mince information on its site Meanwhile Twitter's CEO <person><nameText>Jack Dorsey </nameText></person>is likely to address concerns over censorship he says that Twitter does not use political ideology to make decisions in terms of how content is ranked on its social media platform what about the other big name though in all of this Google the committee also invited Google to take part but instead of sending along <person><nameText>Larry page </nameText></person>firms decided to supply a written testimony to the hearing this is expected to be the most anticipated hearing on technology since April that was when Facebook's chief executive <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>testified before two congressional committees here he is arguing that social media firms need to take more responsibility for what happens on their sites but it's clear now that we didn't do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm as well and that goes for fake news for foreign interference in elections and hate speech as well as developers and data privacy we didn't take a broad enough view of our responsibility and that was a big mistake and it was my mistake I am sorry I started Facebook I run at I am responsible for what happened here we've got James as skin with this director of marketing firm social circle nice to see you tune was so that's kind of what what it will be like later isn't it like Cheryl Sandberg <person><nameText>Jack Dorsey </nameText></person>and others having to answer quite difficult questions mid-term elections as we mentioned not far off it'll give us your thoughts on the day ahead so and there's a real 9 an hour here whereby no longer believes big tech these social media platforms are brushing these things are Is an admission that things have got to change that started about two years ago when as you pointed out a number of fake accounts are being culled on their new tolls and new people have been brought to the table to ensure this this doesn't happen again the reason why it happened in the first place I think is one of regulation because it's almost impossible to regulate the space is impossible for a number of reasons one these social torrents of that the giants will go across so many different borders and they also go across so many different platforms so was good for Instagram which is owned by Facebook might be good for Twitter so it's really really tough to get the right level of regulation works across territory and that works across different platforms are they fighting a losing battle left for because of course we know we've said that Facebook is the said they really need door taking down 1.3 billion take account I asked an enormous number that is how on earth deal police this and therefore do we have to accept the fact but there is manipulation it cannot be stopped I think if you look at the different social media platforms as that platforms then I think there has to be an element of responsibility in the user and that's why there's a sense of responsibility across every single person in the chain this responsibility for the user there's responsibility for the platforms there's responsibility for the brands and advertisers are working on the platform as well and then Yes it does there's an element of self policing we sort of hearing from both sides social circle we have the people that are creating a contoured to go on the platforms and we hear about the brands wanting to promote their own content and there's a fair amount of ignorance of the details of the rules in that regulation and as far as</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

investors as Facebook sure rugs of for owing pressures from regulators with all users and more revenues than ever first the end of the line in the sand workers around the world race themselves the news of thousands of job cuts but where will be axed all and for financial markets to new record highs on wall Street with the SNP and Nasdaq feel biotech shares that a record loss for Boeing abstract the Dow lower Asian shares a little more Porsches with escalating trade tensions between South Korea and Japan Let's dig deep into his Facebook numbers it may be facing growing pressure from regulators over the way it runs its business but that doesn't seem to be putting of users or advertisers at the moment the world's biggest social network got aid be like from investors late Wednesday after a strong set of results with shares jumping in after-hours trade Let's talk you through the numbers Facebook made revenues of just under 16.9 billion $ in the 3 months to the end of June 400 million $ more than expected as you can see that's a jump of 28% on this time last year the number of people using its services including Instagram WhatsApp and Messenger at least once a month hit a new record high of 2.4 one billion again an 8% climb on the year before so those numbers come despite the storm of controversy around the company on Wednesday the federal trade Commission confirmed Facebook has accepted a wreck 5 billion $ fine for privacy violations involving data collection firm Cambridge Analytica Facebook's also confirmed its among the online digital platforms now under antitrust investigation by the us Department of justice into whether they stifle competition and harm to consumers and is faced widespread concern over its plans to launch its own crypto-currency Libre finance ministers from the G7 group of world's top economies have warned of serious risks to the stability of the global financial system I think the takeaway from this is despite a terrible year Facebook was facing scandals over privacy there are questions about anti-trust investigations it has faced scrutiny over its plans to launch a digital currency and yet if you look at its results the message is clear consumers are leaving Facebook where he's not leaving Instagram and advertisers also sticking by the company that is Michelle Fleury with her first thoughts on the numbers from Facebook have got Fergus Hay with the chief executive of the advertising agency earlier gas Delaney good morning to you been looking at the numbers as well what are your thoughts well as amazing as media businesses still performing really really well I mean the growth is strong and that's great for shareholders the register the regulation impact was fairly minimal Unfortunately these big tech companies can brush of these big fines relatively easily the interesting point is as a media business relies on consumption usage of the platform if the regulator becomes a boa constrictor like and and enable consumers to make much more active decisions on their privacy settings then you can see a change in usage on the platform and possibly a drop in the value of the media said this is was interesting about the future for Facebook isn't it because as you say it is seeing growth if the numbers are going up and up record level Levels et cetera but looking forward if anti-trust regulators really clamp down on Facebook and other and other rivals as well and if they can't get lever of the ground because regulators government central banks don't want that to happen what will they do how they navigate all well we have said for a while but Facebook have really made a leap frog innovation and really has been incremental optimisation of the media platform leave is their big players a radical transformation from them from gun for the immediate vertical to creating an ecosystem around consumers with the payment platform the centre of the there's loads of regulation the headwind in the locality for the regulator has been strong really is a huge deal for Facebook the question we've got is the Facebook talk about how important it is for them I'm not sure the moment I see what the

A big like from investors - as Facebook shrugs off growing pressure from regulators with more users and more revenues than ever. Plus - the end of the line. </p><p>Nissan workers around the world brace for news of thousands of job cuts. But where will the axe fall? And on the markets. New record highs on Wall Street for the S&amp;P and Nasdaq - fuelled by tech shares but a record loss for Boeing helps drag the Dow lower. Asian shares a little more cautious with escalating trade tensions between South Korea and Japan. We start with Facebook - it may be facing growing pressure from regulators over the way it runs its business but that doesn't seem to be putting off users or advertisers. The world's biggest social network got a big like from investors on Wednesday after a strong set of results with shares jumping in after-hours trade. Let's show you the details. Facebook made revenues of just under $16.9 billion in the three months to June - $400 million more than expected. That's up 28% on this time last year. The number of people using its services - including Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger - at least once a month - hit a new record of 2.41 billion people - up 8 per cent on this time last year. Those numbers come despite the storm of controversy around the company. On Wedesday The Federal Trade Commission confirmed that Facebook has accepted a record $5 billion fine for privacy violations involving the data collection firm Cambridge Analytica. Facebook has also confirmed it's among the online digital platforms now under antitrust investigation by the US Department of Justice - into whether they've stifled competition and harmed consumers. And its faced widespread concern over its plans to launch its own cryptocurrency - Libra. Finance ministers from the G7 group of the world's top economies have warned of \"serious risks\" to the stability of the global financial system. The take from this is that despite a terrible year, Facebook was facing over privacy, there were questions about anti-trust investigations. It's faced scrutiny over its plans to launch a digital currency yet if you look at its results, the message is clear, consumers are leaving Facebook or at least they are not leaving Instagram. Advertisers are also sticking by the company. Fergus Hay is CEO of advertising agency Leagas Delaney - he joins me now. You've been looking at their numbers as well. What are your thoughts? It's amazing as a media business it's performing really well. The growth is strong and it's great for shareholders. The regulation impact is fairly minimal. These big tech companies can brush off these fines relatively easily but the interesting point is as a media business, it relies on the consumption. If the regulator becomes boa constrictor like, then you can see a change in usage on the platform and possibly a drop in the value of the media. What is interesting about the future of mates book, as you say, seeing growth, the numbers are going up and up, new levels but looking forward, if anti-trust regulators really clamp down on it and other rivals, and if they can't get Libra off the ground because regulators, governments, central banks don't want that to happen, what will they do? How will they navigate? We set for a while that Facebook have not made a leapfrog and it's been incremental optimisation of the platform. Libra is big, radical transformation being a media vertical to creating an ecosystem around consumers with a payment plan form at the centre. There is a load of regulation in the headwind and locality from regulators has been strong but it's a huge deal from Facebook. Facebook talk about how important it is for them but I'm not sure at the moment I see what the problem is for consumers. There are many thin texts out there which provide frictionless payment platform so I'm not sure what the problem Facebook is. Fin techs.

Amazon's sales jump as it invests heavily in one-day delivery but the spending spree ways on profits plus flagging rate cuts the ECB European central bank's signals stimulus is on the way as trade wars and Brexit weigh on the economy and on the markets US stocks falling back from their record highs amid a torrent of corporate earnings is probably be anywhere putting a very mixed bag some weak forecast companies raises concerns for investors Asia shares have been following them Hello we start with Amazon because the online retail giant has revealed another set of mind boggling sales figures the boss Jeff Bezos says efforts to make one-day delivery the norm for Prime customers paying half with accelerating sales growth and shares have fallen though investors were a little bit disappointed with how little profit Amazon is making all of that business and shame some of the details because Amazon made revenues of something like 63.4 billion $ in just 3 months to the end of June that was as you can see up about 20% on the same period last year but only around only around 2.6 billion of that was profit less than investors were hoping for and is forecasting the profit could be lower in the current quarter as well Amazon has been spending heavily something like 800 million $ in the past 3 months alone to try to offer one-day delivery on many more products other boss Jeff Bezos says it is now available on 10 million items that is boosting sales but Amazon is facing growing pressure over its sheer size and power A is facing antitrust investigations in the United States along with other tech giants earlier this month the European Commission also began an investigation into whether Amazon is abusing its role as a marketplace provider from new York his Michelle Fleury Amazon's wave of record profits as crested the company's second quarter profit rose more than 3 and a half percent from a year ago but it fell short of wall Street expectations worse still the e-commerce giant warned not to expect much improvement in the next quarter as it ramps up spending investors had become used to Amazon the record-breaking money making machine its total profit of 28 team of 10 billion $ for the first time in the company's history this was fuelled partly by the success of its cloud computing business but Amazon web services says its cloud operations are no posted its slowest growth rate in more than 5 years raising questions about the continued dominance of the field as if that weren't enough the online retailer shipping costs jumped by more than a third in part because Amazon invested 800 million $ to make one day free shipping the standard for Prime members instead of two days the online retailer's share price was quickly punished falling on news of its results Michelle Fleury with me Cyrus now while who is the head of the Matic research at GlobalData thanks very much for coming here and says Kessler then now we understand that millions more one-day packages went out this quarter than the last customers appear to be responding to this one-day delivery idea that do you think that Amazon's fulfilment centres can keep pace with all this because productivity appears little of think Amazon's always been a leader in e-commerce market that's why it's been so successful drones in the next day delivery we've got regulatory issues this we don't know which countries will allow drones the first but certainly the UK is one of the markets the markets that the strike And drones regulation but certainly I expect also Amazon's warehouses have some of the most advanced robots in the same way that a card a British company does so I think Amazon is improving in all aspects of delivery and also moving into new markets like healthcare luxury goods such now Google and AmazonGoogle should take the parent company alphabet and they both reported the same time they're both facing their own set of specific challenges that and both reporting accelerating growth do you think anti trust probes will play a big role in their future I do the biggest issue for regulation right now courses data privacy and and Facebook just got hit with a 5 billion $ fine just just a few

President Trump meets business leaders on the second day of his state visit to the UK down alone can solve Apple scrapped its iTunes music service after 18 years And the fear factor remains on financial markets flat performance in Asia but the big losers with the so called ban Fang Stocks the big tech companies they lost quite a bit of ground wall Street we will explain so after all the pomp and ceremony of yesterday's Donald Trump gets down to business on day two of his state visit to the UK in a few hours time the literacy some business leaders here in the UK with talks on a possible post Brexit trade deal very much on the agenda the total trade between the US and UK was worth more than 262 billion $ in 2018 making the United Kingdom and America's 5th biggest export market for goods the top US exports to the UK last year were aircraft precious metals and machinery agriculture made up only a tiny proportion of exports to the UK with a value of just two billion $ Washington wants to boost that figure after Brexit saying EU regulations unfairly band things like chlorinated chicken and hormone treated beef but even more contentious is the question of the NHS the UK's National health service the US ambassador to Britain has said the entire economy would be included in transatlantic negotiations which could mean that American firms could bid for NHS contracts I'm joined by David Collins Professor of international economic law at London University good morning David I think from the pre interview the us President there's all to play for but it does depend on the UK's Ship the EU in the future you will of course that's how it works the UK care to sign a free trade agreement with anybody if it stays inside the customs union if it stays inside the single market it will be very difficult for the UK to sign free trade agreements that includes services so he's absolutely right so we have to wait to see what happens with Brexit before the US can proceed with with comprehensive negotiations on these issues and if I quote President Trump now this is what he put out on Twitter before he left the US's saying a big trade deal is possible once the UK gets rid of the shackles by that he means a clean break with the EU Yes well it a clean break absolutely but it doesn't mean that the UK can also have a conventional free trade agreement with Europe that's the beauty of free trade agreements you can have with multiple partners so but he is alluding to being out of the customs union and the single market and hopefully it looks like a free trade agreement with the US is it is gonna happen in terms of the business leaders who are there who are there today is this quite a feud is the likes of Jes Staley chief executive of Barclays bank got Emma Walmsley the CEO of GlaxoSmithKline got defence companies others there is probably being a strategically Hickson from the point of view of the UK trade deal with us as soon as possible will be very important when it would be axed it would be a win for both countries and I think those individuals are there to reflect the interests of those industries are obviously the US is a massive services market and this is the axis of the UK companies want and Conversely as you indicated earlier the US is seeking access to the British agricultural market that seems to be the central trade after taking place when it comes to issues like chlorinated chicken and other types of agricultural products which are currently not able to come into the UK and EU regulations there's many in the unit for example agricultural body So health and safety would argue actually this regulation protect us we want the is I'm not sure about that the the chlorinated chicken the is not unsafe GI Yes it is it's a this is an aspect of the EU's protectionism it is often has to do with that treatment of animals I am my approach to this is its spectre of consumer choice who do not buy the product if you do why did I would I would hate to think that would be a stumbling block for free trade with those types of issues but I can see that they are contentious I think the important issue is to educate society be transparent what the risk actually are here said animal welfare issue is the main issue when it comes to that</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Hello. later, the likes of <person><nameText>Sheryl Sandberg, </nameText></person>Jack Dorsey and others having to answer quite difficult questions on the mid-term elections not far off at all, give us your thoughts on the day ahead. There's a real moment were no longer these big tech and social media platforms are brushing these things off. There's an admission these things have to change and that started about two years ago when, as you said, a number of fake accounts were cold and there were new tools and people brought to the table to ensure this doesn't happen again. The reason it happened in the first place I think is one of regulation, because it's almost impossible to regulate this space for a number of reasons. Social drives are just that, Giants. Though go across so many different borders and they also go across and so many different platforms -- social Giants are just that, Giants. It is tough to get the right level of regulation that works across territory and the different platforms. Are they fighting a losing battle? We have said that Facebook has said they have removed or taken down something like 1.3 billion fake accounts, that's an enormous number. Like you say, how do you police this and therefore, do we have to accept the fact there's manipulation and it can't be stopped? I think if you look at the different social media platforms as bad, platforms, then I think there has began element of responsibility in the user and that's where there's a sense of responsibility with every person along the chain -- as that. There's a responsibility for the user, the platforms and the brands and advertisers working on the platform as well. Yes, there's an element of self policing. We hear it from both sides. We have the people creating the content to go on the platforms, and we hear about the brands wanting to promote their own</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-1ec26ed4638f451ebf280ba6f420363e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T67-YJ91-JBH6-C1D1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"763\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 TVEyes, Inc.

Rory Cellan Jones explained recently An absolute storm in certain corners of the Internet, it is seen by 70 tech leaders including the creator of the world wide web, saying this could be end of the Internet as we know it but it seems to have made little political splash. Articles 13 and 11 which put much more duty on websites to police copyright. Article 13 says they've got to check all the time that they are not letting their users upload copyright material. You'd think that was simple enough. This will not affect the likes of Facebook and Google because they have got the power to do this, they got the resources to do this.

The question is, how do you police something like this when videos for text or images are being uploaded to Web -- websites like YouTube at such a rapid rate? There are billions of music videos watched every year in the UK get it generates hardly any income to the people who created those songs so it's only about 3% of the recorded music industry's income comes from those videos.

People sharing and re- sharing video with something with a bit of music. But in turn leads to the music artist gaining popularity, publicity, and that leads to more revenue. We are all in favour of users being able to share music videos. All you want is the services negotiate a fair deal.

bird sings with a look at that the results coming from Twitter today was a bumper day for technology NHS and a long drawn out and bitter takeover battle in the pharmaceuticals industry could be nearing its conclusion will be live in Singapore for all the latest we've got all those stories coming up here on your business briefing including helpfully look at financial markets had to say it will be headed lower today following their lead from wall Street so it's a big day for tech earnings will hear from Facebook and eBay but first to reveal their numbers will be Twitter the big question is can he do it again investors are hoping he can keep itself in the black demand Stock has been on the app's since February that's when Twitter announced its first ever quarterly profit in his 12 year history and despite being a favourite medium for the likes of President Trump celebrities and politicians and the media of course Twitter has been struggling to gain users investors will be closely watching to see if his numbers of users which currently stands at around 330 million is going to go up getting more people on Twitter will be a huge challenge for its boss <person><nameText>Jack Dorsey </nameText></person>who's had to cut back on spending on research and development and marketing in an effort to break even we've got Mike Weston with this morning managing director of Jellicoe a Danish marketing automation company nice to see you again my first of all what to expect Twitter to say in terms of money it is making and using his why we're looking for two things really took to his story has shifted over the last few months to one way they talk about growth of overall numbers to really focusing on making value from that users that they've got says all about how the Daily user numbers gone up that publishing actual number but they published the growth in that that's been growing for 5 quarters we're looking to see that growing again as will show some consistency that should be therefore backed by rising advertising revenue which will feed into question about profitability and that's really where they are trying to focus attention said reducing investors and and those who look at companies like Twitter have got more comfortable with the fact then that Twitter will not grew to a degree in terms of users like Facebook and other organisations there was a huge explosion when it first came on the scene massive excitement but then everybody sort of felt very lacklustre about Twitter because it became clear that there was a small group of people love it but it wasn't getting beyond that Yeah nearly 330 million small group compared to Facebook Yes but it's a viable audience so the real question is The 330 million people get to actually been really investing and spending their time day-to-day on the platform and been a worry a year ago that was declining the last 5 quarters That's grown in can make it 6 quarters this time around it the as as a business starts to look attractive and maybe a tractor was an acquisition of so today we need to hear more about how they will make more money on advertising revenues are talking about have used their video more effectively that kind of thing has been quite a few changes we can say more on Twitter in 140 characters but in terms of the issue of data and that's a big black cloud hanging over all these companies we don't know much in terms of what Twitter is doing about that obviously it's got this European regulation kicking next Monday has to comply with that Yes they do and as do all of that the big tech giants there they're all looking back question Twitter I think because they hold less personal data on us than either Google or Facebook for example it will feel that they can probably say under the horizon a little bit for the time being I don't know how much they'll say about it I think they're trying keep their powder dry until such time as is as everybody else's shenanigans get exposed and just very briefly what the Trump effect been if anything well it's interesting it's made traditional news sources and and trusted news sources more valuable I think Twitter place quite a good wrong on that in a way that changes to Facebook's algorithm of have removed from that said that might be part of the key to help Twitter really really engages with the audience OK Thank you very much indeed Michael coming in so we will of course tell you what Twitter has to say when it releases its latest earnings and of course Facebook and eBay as well to keep it with us here throughout today now 5th time lucky Japanese drugs giant actor Qaida has upped its bid Shire</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

EU decides on a huge legal shake-up that according to some could mean the end of the internet as we know it's plus global growth under threat the head of the WTO weren't warned of the economic damage of ballooning trade war and on financial markets Asia got off to a cautious start today as investors remain nervous ahead of tomorrow's deadline US tariffs on Chinese import say let's begin in Strasbourg where the European parliament will vote later on a huge shake-up of copyright law it sparked a major row between publishing music and film industries on the one side and tech giants on the other web pioneer Sir <person><nameText>Tim Berners Lee </nameText></person>is among those warning it could even mean the end of the internet as we know it so what's it all about well it's called the European copyright directive article 13 would require all digital platforms to stop users upload copyrighted material whether that be a text music or video or or pay to license the material that this would mean sites like YouTubeFacebookTumblr could be they are sharing revenues with publishers YouTube already does this to an extent and being liable if their users infringe copyright the plan has been welcomed by the music film and TV industry is highly controversial as our technology correspondent Rory Kevin Jones explained recently on our business live programme thing as absolute stormer Arkinson cause the internet about this is seen by a 70 tech leaders including created the world wide web <person><nameText>Tim Berners Lee </nameText></person>signed a letter saying this could be The internet as we know it it seems to make little political splash what we've got is to measures article 13 article 11 which put much more duty on websites to police copy article 13 in particular says they've got a check all the time they're not letting users upload copyright material well you think that was simple enough but what it did this will not affect the likes of Facebook and Google because they have got the power to do this they got the resources to do this the theories from has objected to this this will put huge pressure on tiny websites face big fines if their users put a bit of video updates term that belongs to somebody else that is Rory Kevin Jones our technology correspondent Geoff Taylor is with us today he's chief executive of the British photographic industry that's the music business trade body in the UK as well as the Brit awards welcome to the briefing said give us your take on this move in in Europe I assume you feel this is necessary necessary and overdue for many years we've been having these outdated regulations that was set in the late 90s 90s to govern the internet what that has meant there has been a lack of clarity in the legal framework which is really undermine the ability of creators to get paid for the work they create when it's used by big tech platforms the question though is how do you possibly police something like this when videos or texts all all images being uploaded to websites like YouTube and others as such a rapid rate short this is a vast problem there are billions of music video for example watched every year in the UK yet generate hardly any income the talk for the people who created their songs as only about 3% of recorded music industry's income comes from the billions of music videos watch every year in fact that's less than half makes vinyl records it really is a problem that requires equalisation was does it clarifies the law to make it clear that if you are if you're running a service that Music video other creative content the need X to negotiate a licence isn't there are other ways though now is just how the industry is changing in the sense that people sharing me sharing a video or something with a bit of music can't actually that does then in turn leads to the music artist gaining popularity publicity and that in turn led to lead to more revenues to anyway we're all in favour of users being able to share music the areas on platforms that a licence so all we want is the services negotiate a fair deal just like Spotify and Apple music and other music services they have their licences they negotiate arm's length we think all services should have to comply with the same regime create a level playing field that return money back we can invest in the next generation of this we want to be able to sign the next storms in the next few up but you could understand the likes of apart Sir Paul McCartney who's obviously very clearly backing this move he's got the resources to pursue those who are perhaps not</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

These state officials are looking at Google's search engine and its digital advertising and whether it has stifled competition by favouring its own sites. And this is not the only investigation to hit big tech. Last week, another coalition of state officials announced an anti-trust look into Facebook. </p><p>They will probe whether social media, search, and e-commerce companies have become too big, and the Federal Trade Commission continues to examine Facebook. These investigations may take a year or even longer, and at the end of all of that, the landscape of big tech may not end up looking any different. Even with anti-trust enforcement, even with investigations, we still may have a few dominant firms. And that will leave policymakers with another question. That is, do you regulate more in this space? Do you come up with neutral stray digital market that actually expand opportunities for competition? I believe that is probably where we're headed. This all comes as consumers have confidence in tech companies. They have been unable to safeguard people's information and they have been caught up in efforts by foreign powers to influence elections. So now, it is up to big tech to prove lawmakers wrong. Samira Hussain, BBC News, Washington. We have been asking you today if you can live without Google. Do you think that Alphabet, the parent company, should have its wings clipped. We will discuss some of your comments a little later, as well. Later today Jack Ma, who is one of the best-known and richest businessmen in China, is stepping down from his post as the executive chairman of Alibaba. The announcement last year took many by surprise. Let's go to our Asia Business Hub, where Rico Hizon is following the story. So Jack Ma stepping down. What is he going to do? At 55 years old he is retiring from Alibaba. Well, he wants to get into education, Sally. And basically he is following through on his own advice which he shared two young leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos last year. He said when you are in your mid- 50s or 60s, you should enjoy spending time with your grandchildren. And that is what he plans to do. But retirement aside, Sally, you probably know him as one of China's richest men, with a net worth of over $38 billion. He was born into a poor family and started his career as an English teacher, and he was even rejected for 30 different jobs, including one at KFC. He founded Alibaba, which is now worth $460 billion, in his apartment two decades ago. Well, he bought his first computer at the age of 43 and was surprised when no Chinese beers turned up in his search for beer, and the rest is history. From being a traditional e-commerce company 20 years ago, it is now a conglomerate that has businesses from logistics to food delivery and cloud computing. Sally. Quite a story, thank you very much. Good to see you. Now let's brief you on some other business stories: Nissan's chief executive, Hiroto Saikawa, has said he will step down next week. Mr Saikawa has been criticised for being overpaid as part of a bonus scheme, although he denies any wrongdoing. The latest announcement followed a meeting of the carmaker's board. Rating agency Moody has downgraded Ford's senior unsecured debt rating, putting the car company in junk territory. It also warned further downgrades could follow. Ford's shares fell 3.7% in after-hours trading. British Airways pilots are striking for a second day in an ongoing dispute over pay and conditions. Tens of thousands of passengers have been told not to go to airports, with the airline cancelling some 1,700 flights due to the disruption. Later, Apple will be holding its yearly launch event. We are expecting details on the next iPhone, and possibly some other product upgrades. But the talking point for Apple is more political in nature, with the looming threat of trade tariffs threatening to have a big effect on America's richest company. Our North America technology reporter Dave Lee will of course be there. Here is what he is looking out for. Apple is a company that craves control, which is why the next</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-aace1dbc76b649dd859c0453a2c997ca</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X15-5M01-DY08-30J6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"737\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

The first is, I think is unlikely the US is lucky to break these companies up because Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, they provide the next generation of technology that is going to use the economy versus China. You mention the finder Facebook, but that is a drop in the ocean compared to what Amazon could be facing. </p><p>With this your opinion trust probe that's going on the moment. Judicially big tech companies like Amazon, they have been fined billions of dollars and they have just shrugged it off. The ship rescues rising because they have 70 markets in which they are dominant. But the issue of regulation today is really, it's not controlled by specific market, but it's control of data. Amazon, Facebook, Google, all these companies control our data, your data and my data. In theory, that belongs to us but these companies use it as belongs to them. If regulators really attack the data model, then this companies could be in trouble. As we have seen, they can shrug off $5 billion fines. But what the shrug of more? Thank you so much for coming in, I noticed earlier. Can. The European Central Bank has hinted it could cut interest rates to tackle a slowdown in the eurozone economy. It says a weak manufacturing sector and uncertainty about Brexit and trade are threatening to derail growth. It's the latest central bank to signal an easing of monetary policy - with the US Federal Reserve expected to cut rates next week - as Jonathan Josephs explains. The global economy is slowing and the Eurozone is no exception. Trade tensions, such as the US- China trade war, one of the major reasons why. The European Central Bank, which sets interest rates for the 19 countries that use the euro, is increasingly worried. It's president Mario Draghi has said that things were getting worse and worse. The prolonged presence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors, the rising threat of protectionism, and vulnerabilities in emerging markets, is dampening economic sentiment, notably in the manufacturing sector. Interest rates have been kept on hold for now. They have been near zero for years anyway. But Mr Draghi made clear hints that was something that could change in September, when the next policy meeting happens and another chance to stimulate the eurozone resigning economy. The other option would be quantitative easing the so-called printing of money. Nearly $3 billion has been pumped in like this since 2015, when the programme first began. Germany's factories are another major worry. Industrial production there has been the slipping. Factories that make cars and other sorts of machinery are worried about Brexit and the ongoing uncertainty there - as is the rest of the eurozone, it should be pointed out - but also there are concerns about US tariffs on cars from the European Union. Something we still do not know whether or not it is going to happen. Now these trade tensions have also caught the attention of the International Monetary Fund. Earlier this week it cut its global forecast for growth. And another body that we'll be looking at them very closely is the US Central Bank, which meets next week to discuss interest rates and could well cut them for the first time in a decade. Let's go to Asia now - and Japanese tech firm Softbank has unveiled a huge new investment fund - which plans to raise more than $100 billion of capital for new cutting edge technologies. Sharanjit Leyl has been looking at this for us. This is the second fund of this nature, who else is going to back it and what about you? That is right, I should say it's a whopping 108 early in dollar fund to be precise, which they are contributing 38 billion two, they're expecting the rest to come from companies like Apple, Microsoft, the sovereign wealth fund of Kazakhstan, would you believe, amongst others. It is a second fund, it is aimed at investing in tech companies and artificial intelligence. In the first fund you recall had a lot of middle eastern oil money, specifically Saudi investment, that is just right there try to move away from that after a backlash following the murder of the journalist which was linked to the kingdom. Softbank launched its first fund in May 2012, an attempt by early and a founder to try and transform the group from a telecom centred conglomerate into a global investment powerhouse. There are essentially the largest private full of money ever raised and a lot of that money was channelled into next-generation firms like Buber, China's version of it - metabolic. -- Uber.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-77eccdb38f674bc49f147c6514e0e462</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WNB-H271-JBH6-C3NR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"787\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

Animal welfare is the main issue about that, as you said, it's not unsafe at all. Give in, very interesting. And as we mentioned earlier, we are going to be across this old today, day two on that state visit -- across this all day. </p><p>But now let's look at South Korea's economy. South Korea's economy shrank more than initially estimated in the first three months of the year. It'll put pressure on the central bank to cut interest rates. Let's go to our Asia Business Hub where Rico Hizon is following the story. Sally! Nice to see you! Tell us about South Korea. Ways the economy shrinking at the moment? With this construction, the country is now one of the worst performing economies in Asia -- contraction. It was dragged down by slowing global demand for electronics. The GDP of Asia's fourth largest economy decreased by 0.4%, compared to the previous period which was the largest drop since 2008. Sally, the bank of South Korea revealed a 3.3% fall in manufacturing due to lower production of electronics was a key reason for this contraction. Also hit by slowing global demand for semiconductors and uncertainty sparked by this protracted US-China trade war. So we've been speaking about this slowdown and surely there will be pressure on the central bank to ease monetary policy sooner rather than later. Nice to see you, Rico. Now let's brief you on some other business stories: Facebook investors will only be allowed to vote on Mark Zuckerberg's salary every three years. It's the result of a shareholder vote last week. The Facebook boss and some fellow executives hold a special class of shares which carry 10 times the voting power of standard shares. Some standard shareholders had wanted Mr Zuckerberg's salary reviewed annually. Uncertainty over Brexit saw new foreign direct investment projects in the UK fall 13% last year. A study by professional services firm EY says that despite the dip, the UK remained the top investment destination in Europe last year, although France and Germany have narrowed the gap. It's the end of an era for Apple. It's scrapping its iTunes music download service after 18 years. The firm also revealed a number of new privacy measures at its annual developer conference in San Jose. Dave Lee has more. It's been almost 20 years since Steve jobs introduced iTunes into the world. And the world of entertainment has changed a lot in them. So as many Apple fans have been predicting for some time, iTunes is going to be phased out and replaced with three separate ups. Once for music, one for pod casts and one for Apple balls DV subscription services that is going to come later this year -- podcast and their subscriptions service. They are creating a unique e-mail address for every up you sign up with, so if there is a data breach down the line, that's not going to affect you as much and the data isn't going to be useful for advertisers either. For the first time in six years, Apple announced a new desktop PC, it's going to cost $5,999 to start, which means it is being aimed squarely at the creative industries, a group of people who feel they have been slightly neglected by Apple in recent years. Dave Lee, BBC News, in San Jose. Let's stay with the big tech giants, including Apple. The share price of the so called FAANG companies have slumped in the US. So that's FacebookAmazon, Apple, Netflix and Google's parent company, Alphabet. They saw $137 billion wiped off their stock market value. Here's Michelle Fleury in New York to explain why. What sparked the sell-off was the prospect of greater regulatory scrutiny. US anti-trust forces have apparently carved up jurisdiction for possible investigations into Google, Facebook, and was on and Apple. The wall street journal reported on Friday that the US Justice Department is preparing an anti- trust investigation into Google's business practices. The Washington post claim that the Federal Trade Commission is looking into potential anti-trust violations of Amazon. Bloomberg says the FTC might open a anti-trust probe into Facebook. It's not uncommon for the agencies to negotiate over who gets to that which companies and markets. It is to avoid duplication and stepping on each others' toes. It's also worth noting that the last big anti-trust suit in the United States</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-28eb9054fdd7458d8cdf338d196a605b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W88-1J41-DY08-30GG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"750\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.
