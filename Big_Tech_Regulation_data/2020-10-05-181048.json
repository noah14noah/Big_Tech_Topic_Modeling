We have accumulated IP and built verticals in seven different industries: financial services, communications, utilities, hospitals, retail, health and construction. For each of these verticals we have global business groups focused on product strategy, engineering, M&amp;A, sales, implementation and customer service. We have 22,000 people working worldwide across these verticals, and financial services is the largest, with more than 9,000 employees.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">GF:</emphasis> How is the finance sector in taking up new technology?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Singh:</emphasis> Financial services were early adopters. They were first to truly use computing to enhance business. They invested aggressively and built their own proprietary systems before many of the transformative technologies like AI, Big Data, IoT and social media that are mainstream now even existed. Now, precisely because financial-services were early adopters, they have legacy systems that are devoid of these technologies.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">GF:</emphasis> How do you solve the problem of being an early adopter?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Singh:</emphasis> To catch up and be able to evolve at a fast clip, systems need to have an architecture that can change very quickly, that's modular. Our digital and data architectures are constructed this way. They can be absorbed in a progressive fashion into the financial institution's business technology framework. We also make these components available through well-defined APIs, allowing the more progressive banks to operate in an ecosystem with fintechs and Big Tech. There's an emerging ecosystem of financial service providers, and open banking for retail and corporate is an important aspect that banks need to think about.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">GF:</emphasis> What are some of the drivers shaping technology adoption?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Singh:</emphasis> We see people get caught up by 'buzz' around certain technologies, or sometimes fear of missing out (FOMO), which can lead to fragmented technology adoption. We find that thoughtful evaluation is better for innovation. Banks also have to increasingly comply with more regulations. Regulations evolve and change, and as businesses address each regulation they end up with silos of data. Managing this data with a well-defined information architecture helps not only with compliance, but also provides opportunities to monetize the data in areas such as relationship pricing and personalized product offers.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">GF:</emphasis> How are user expectations about technology changing?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Singh:</emphasis> The word \"digital\" has passed its prime as a differentiator. Being digital is expected, a given. We conducted a survey with 5,700 respondents in 13 markets, and 81% of their business interactions were already digital. Every company now has a digital interface, and customer satisfaction with digital at the basic level is very high.</p><p>However, once you get past the simpler transactions, such as depositing checks, to more complex transactions-loans or mortgages-satisfaction with digital plummets, with 30% of our survey respondents looking at alternatives. Simpler transactions are being addressed by digital experiences, while more complex processes are still being handled in the traditional way.</p><p>Banking used to have a strong human element. In corporate banking, where banks serve large corporations, technology is not pervasive across all the functions; there is still a lot of human interaction. However, when you step down to lower market tiers, B2B and B2C are very similar. This is where the banks need to drive digital transformation, reduce friction and deliver a better customer experience. The digital experience needs to be more than skin deep.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, no caption</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GFMAG-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GFMAG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V98-J4B1-JC8V-41Y4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">297150</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"625\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Global Finance Media, Inc.

I like and agree with a lot of what he says, but I also think that the recent crisis, and the shock of what it says about the powers of the State, might - I hope - jolt people into realising that we libertarians, banging on about autonomy, property rights and so on, aren't as irrelevant as is fashionable to claim. The Big State/Small State difference still counts for a lot. </p><p>This argument should be made. Free societies, as we can point out, are often better at stepping up to change and emergencies than states often are. Not everyone worships at the altar of socialised medicine. And boy, have we learned the value of free press and scrutiny, if only by seeing what happens in China, when those things don't exist. Consider, even Formula 1 motor racing[2], that symbol of toxic masculine love of going very fast in noisy cars, is using its technical skills to meet the pandemic challenge. Libertarians should point out how entrepreneurial gusto, not the clunky hand of Whitehall, is what needs to be celebrated. And we certainly need to challenge the narrative of how marvellous China has been in locking things down. Turns out that it has been a shitshow.[3] Dr Davies has given a list of trends and forces he thinks will accelerate and turn as a result, and some of his predictions make me alarmed, others less so. Here are some of my own predictions. Dear readers: do add your own. Here goes: A big push to divert supply chains from China; more diversification around this. Maybe some pullback from just-in-time inventory but I don't expect a total shift - the losses in efficiency and living standards are too big. Less business travel and some tourism via air; more requirements that passengers carry medical data with them. Airport security to increasingly entail 'medical security' and there will be demands that airports are more hygienic with cleaner air systems. Continued 're-shoring' of some manufacturing. It is happening already because making stuff locally is getting easier with modern tech.  There will be pressure to monetise the enormous amounts of public debt. We could have a Japan-style stagnation lasting for two decades. Not sure if we get hyperinflation. Expect more commentary about gold, the need for hard money, etc.  Far more telecommuting and remote working. Some central business districts will have to adjust; some skyscrapers will struggle to fill up. Suburbs and cars are back:[4] who wants to live in a cramped city and rely on unhealthy, crammed public transport if you can live in a nice house, work from home and have a garden? The anti-car lobby has lost - people are glad they have cars. Issue: will the planning system free up to allow lots more homes with gardens etc to be built? I hope so. The 'woke' agenda is losing a lot of steam. It was happening already. Even remote learning will dent traditional educational attendance and power structures. That is a good thing.  The European Union and other transnational organisations, including the World Health Organisation, have been useless, and it turns out in the WHO's case, all too cozy to China over Taiwan.[5]Some red tape will be rolled back; if people are going to have to put up with more nannying and state control in some areas they will want liberalisation elsewhere. Look at how some regulations have been canned to deal with the crisis. That could become permanent.  The actions of UK and other police in this pandemic have caused very bad publicity for the cops. It was bad already. It is getting worse. Scientists who claim to have all the answers and claim the science is 'settled' will encounter even more resistance. In a funny way this virus is bad news for the dark Greens. Extinction Rebellion's vision of life has been rammed down people's throats these past few weeks.  Attacks on Big Tech and demands for anti-trust will wane. The internet has had a good crisis. It kept us going. The value of people with vocational skills, earned without vast sums of student debt, will appreciate; the education 'bubble' of arts grads with high debt/lower salary will burst. This will also hurt the 'woke' culture and the nonsense of what's been happening on our campuses. Identity politics is not going away without a fight, however. Classical liberals/libertarians haven't really woken up fully to how much the victories of the 80s, 90s and even some of the Noughties have been compromised, sometimes by sheer complacency. We need to wake up, to do more of the intellectual heavy lifting. I hope the present situation galvanises more thought, activism and writing.  Celebrity culture looks to be on the back foot. It may return, but the Hollyweird culture is in really serious trouble. Crappy remakes of films, Weinstein, etc, etc.  People might actually be healthier: all that focusing on taking a daily walk, eating at home, thinking about 'underlying health conditions', might have a positive effect. It is a wake-up call.  Mainstream religions might get a revival. I wonder how many atheists have, sort of, prayed recently.  Public sports events, though, will attract sell-out crowds. Imagine if you are a rugby, cricket or football fan and denied the ability to see your teams and in the case of Liverpool, for example, robbed of the ability to be the unchallenged winner of its season.

BERNSTEIN &amp; CO., LLC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Great. We'll get started here. First, I'm delighted to welcome for the first time Ted Pick from Morgan Stanley to the SEC Conference.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For those who don't know Ted, Ted runs the institutional business at Morgan Stanley. Prior to that, he was [in] sales and trading, where he took the equities business to the #1 on The Street by market share. He also performed quite a remarkable turnaround in the Fixed Income business, driving growth in that business while sort of cutting cost and capital.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What Ted will first do is give a brief presentation, sort of, about 10 minutes-ish, and then we'll set down for Q&amp;A. So Ted?</p><p>TED PICK, HEAD OF TRADING &amp; INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESSES, MORGAN STANLEY: Thanks, Christian. Good afternoon. Thanks for inviting Morgan Stanley to this conference.</p><p>We have 7 slides today covering 3 topics. Our approach to managing the Institutional Securities group, the performance of the group over the last 5 years, and our growth opportunities.</p><p>The first slide is called: Managing to the Bigger Box. You may recall that in 2010, we coined the 9 boxes approach for managing the growth plan for the equities business. Here, we will now adapt that construct for the Institutional Securities business as a whole.</p><p>Three major businesses: investment banking, equity sales and trading, and fixed income sales and trading across the 3 geographies. It's a straightforward regional and product matrix, where each partner on the management team is accountable for their box, but also jointly tasked with growing the larger box. In practice, the approach succeeds with the management team that has trust, partnership and cohesion built over time, where the average length of Morgan Stanley service for our ISG operating committees averages 20 years. In proper execution, this bigger box facilitates a seamless offering of our tool kit to clients: advice, capital, liquidity, access and risk management solutions. The management accountability model is dependent on a culture of disciplined risk and resource management and a perpetual reinvestment into our leading technology platform. This is the approach we used to success in building our leading equities business, to reshape and grow our Fixed Income business, and to expand our market share in our investment banking business.</p><p>The next slide is a snapshot of our equities division, the first box. Over the last decade, we've built this business to become the industry leader for the last 5 years running. As you can see, $9 billion in revenue last year and 20% to 21% share for the last 3 years against a roughly flattish industry wallet. Financing revenue has contributed meaningfully to our overall growth, a relatively more stable revenue stream, but as you can see from the bottom left, now accounts for half the total.</p><p>Our steadfast focus on clients, whether they be established asset managers or new entrants across the 3 major product boxes: cash, prime brokerage and derivatives, in each of the 3 major regions has enabled us to identify and capture opportunity sets. The emergence of quantitative and passive investment strategies are 2 examples where we've been able to capture outside share.</p><p>We also build businesses which span multiple boxes. Once folks knew how to operate in their box, we wanted them to bleed into other boxes. Examples include futures and clearing. A decade ago, we were an also-ran in that product. Now we're top 2. We're focused on building our resourcing for our International Wealth Management business in Asia, and we have momentum in our fund services business. This is the administration for alternative asset managers, where we are now an industry leader.</p><p>In equities, we apply continued rigor on headcount and resources to ensure we retain an attractive return profile. Importantly, continued investment in Morgan Stanley Electronic Trading, what you may know as MSET, that platform is critical, as technology has transformed the Equity business, borne out of for agency cash business and now leveraged across all of our equities businesses.</p><p>And now on to the slide for the fixed income division, where we applied similar principles to address what we saw as the secular challenge of a declining wallet. You will recall that in late 2015, we took steps to restructure that business, withdrawing financial resourcing and headcount. Having then completed that task, we felt that the talent pool, with some additional client coverage and risk management best practices learned from the equities experience would create an integrated sales and trading offering. Importantly, we did not break down the separate cultural identities of the equities and fixed income divisions. Rather we cross-pollinated where it made sense to offer clients a harmonized markets offering.</p><p>By way of example, we have offered clients an expanded slate of properly risk-managed financing products, again to give the business a more annuitized feel. And similarly, we have also extended our MSET technology, leveraging the brand and industrial scaling capabilities across sales and trading as a diverse -- a fixed income product set that electronifies or equitizes.</p><p>As you can see here, $5 billion of revenue over the last several years against a shrinking wallet means that our share has gone up from 6% meaningfully to 9%.</p><p>And in the third business, the investment banking division, a business you know well, here, we've maintained a consistent approach. For strategic mandates, the dialogue demands value add to the C-suite and Boards, providing the highest-quality advice and service. The advisory and underwriting businesses are traditional Morgan Stanley strengths which are dependent on our continuing to develop selectively bolt-on talent to optimize client footprint and opportunity. We have maintained sound franchise and underwriting standards through the cycle. And the results are consistently top 1 to 3 in the advisory and equity underwriting products in each region, with improving share in both products while maintaining our wallet in debt underwriting.</p><p>That's history in each of the 9 boxes. And now, this slide is entitled Institutional Securities Going Forward, speaking to the potential for growth in our existing businesses.</p><p>In equities, we will continue to pursue our strategy of what I call offensive defense. That is to say building on leading share, mining risk and return in our leading prime brokerage and cash businesses while continuing to invest across our derivatives businesses. Again, opportunities that run across the boxes will get prioritized. In fixed income, our forward approach is defensive offense, where we are focused on maintaining our credible trading footprint while selectively investing in our financing businesses.</p><p>While we are mindful of the diversity and complexity of the fixed-income product set, our investment into the lead steer client set has begun to result, as you saw, in meaningful share gains. And in banking, we believe we can continue to monetize the Morgan Stanley franchise: our intellectual capital, with share gains achieved by very selectively adding boots to the ground, that is capacity; and product skills, that is capability, where the opportunities arise.</p><p>From the bottom are highlighted 2 difference makers for the success of the bigger box that I described: our integrated investment bank, one of the firm's global presence; the second is ISG's capacity to help deliver one firm to our clients.</p><p>Across the range of Institutional Securities businesses, to the client set, our global presence is mission-critical and provides us with revenue, diversity and optionality. The U.S. economy and markets have been and will continue to be substantial drivers of ISG's results. Europe, the U.K. and the Continent both, notwithstanding Brexit trauma, will, of course, continue to be important. But here, we highlight growth in Asia as it becomes increasingly relevant to global strategic activity client flows and, in turn, to Morgan Stanley's success.</p><p>The inclusion of China in the MSCI marks an inflection point, making China investing scalable for global investors. We've been focused on leading with content, product and corporate access. Consequently, we are ensuring that we have the people, products and infrastructure in place.</p><p>For example, in research, we have lead the way in A-share and Greater China coverage footprint, covering nearly 600 companies, representing 60% of advertised daily volume and over 75% of the MSCI market cap in Greater China. That is China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. We are top 1, 2 in trading Hong Kong Connect, which facilitates north- and south-bound market connectivity. We're deploying more resources to our International Wealth Management business.</p><p>Investing in growing wealth in Asia represents a significant opportunity in its own right, of course, given the demographic. But the synergy between high-end wealth and ISG is very large and very real. Bank the entrepreneur and bank the company creates a virtuous cycle.</p><p>As you're hearing, research, trading and wealth management are critical in the going public lifecycle. As you can see from the middle IPO volume graph, the acceleration of capital formation in Asia is at hand, and we're well positioned with the #1 position in underwriting Asia-based global IPOs for each of the last 3 years, and now, into 2019.</p><p>As we think about the Mainland, we continue to invest time and efforts on our onshore securities joint venture with our partners MS Huaxin Securities as we expect direct access to China will be increasingly important alongside continuing access through Hong Kong.</p><p>Japan, too, is a key underpinning of Morgan Stanley's global story. Our unique partnership with our 24% shareholder MUFG makes us a leading player in the market, as you can see by our joint venture's top rankings. We've worked together on over 600 transactions, and we build on that through the cycle.</p><p>And finally, the Venn diagram, delivering one firm to our clients. This last slide places ISG in the one firm, firm ecosystem. That is Institutional Securities, wealth management and Investment management.</p><p>The differentiated value proposition is as follows: that of a comprehensive distribution platform for clients, spanning institutional to retail, which enhances the service offering. There are various ways in which our major businesses complement each other, sourcing ideas, capital, lending opportunities and further client penetration. While we have made real progress, we still have significant opportunity to leverage our global franchise and will continue to be an area of critical focus.</p><p>To conclude, I would leave you with the following. Institutional Securities has achieved success simply by executing for clients, exercising risk and resource discipline, and continuing to invest in technology and talent. The team across the integrated investment bank, which has accomplished this, is an experienced and proven team and a collegial one. We actually get along across the investment bank, which plays to our bigger 9 box. We see further potential for growth servicing clients in our existing businesses by continuing to execute.</p><p>And with that, I will now take questions, which hopefully will not stump me from Christian.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>CHINEDU BOLU: Great. Thank you very much, Ted. Before we dig into Morgan Stanley and the topics you brought up, just step back and macro backdrop. Lots of noise, conflicting signals, when it's U.S.-China, folks worried about the late cycle risks. From your seat, how do you see the macro backdrop?</p><p>TED PICK: Well, global GDP growth peaked in the first half of last year, probably in the first quarter. U.S., a little later than that, thanks to the effect of the tax package, but that kind of worked its way through the system. And while confidence was good, it wasn't clear that we were going to grow much beyond that. Nonetheless, the Fed was continuing along. They were hiking. There was continued (inaudible) in the fall. And then the Fed went one too many. They -- the market didn't like that, and we had that very rough fourth quarter. But the Fed, having looked at the data, then pivoted.</p><p>And so as difficult as the fourth quarter was, the reality is that the beginning of the new year actually started pretty well. There was a strong recovery bias. It happened so quickly that consumer and corporate confidence actually held in pretty good. And so, while growth is slow -- if you think about the U.S. growth for the first half, it's coming in around trend line at 2%. Lower in the second quarter, given the ins and outs of a higher first quarter, probably somewhere around 0.5%. But nonetheless, for the first half, about 2%. And as I said, confidence has held up pretty good.</p><p>But then there's this U.S.-China discussion. And that has increasingly created a risk. S&amp;P trades up 10% on the year, but highly defensively. As you know, financials and cyclicals are for sale. Bond markets inverted. So there's a balancing act now, where on the one hand, we are later in the cycle and growth has slowed, but in fairness, growth had not slow to the point that it was below trend line. But now, we have this potential prolonged situation between the 2 which, if it goes on for the balance of the year, will have an effect on corporate confidence, will draw more volatility into the markets, and we'll have clients sitting on their hands. On the other hand, we can muddle through this. It actually could be a reasonably good second half.</p><p>CHINEDU BOLU: I guess in a world where there are offsetting items like that, the one hand trend line growth, as you said, but on the other hand, the bond markets could just send in a different signal, how do you manage the business? Are you more cautious? Are you more opportunistic?</p><p>TED PICK: Yes. The answer is both, both. We have a strategy in place. Here are the strategies. In fact, there are clients who will look to have us intermediate risk or to act on a catalyst strategy at moments of dislocation, so we're there for the clients. That's a given. And we've been through these periods before.</p><p>On the other hand, when you do think about the fact that we are getting later, you have to be thinking about how you're looking at risk. So when the markets get more volatile, the risk itself reprices. So on the one hand, the growth strategy's in place for each of the 3 businesses, these bigger 9 boxes, but we, too, are focused on expense management. We have a firm efficiency ratio out at 73%, and we're very focused on maintaining that, particularly, if this is prolonged in the second half.</p><p>CHINEDU BOLU: Let's just get the current operating environment question out of the way. So as you put all that together, how does that impact the business from activity level so far this quarter?</p><p>TED PICK: It's mixed. Again, it's mixed. Some product categories are slower. Cash equity volumes are slower. The equity underwriting business is slower. M&amp;A announcements are slower. On the other hand, until very recently, corporate credit, volumes are actually up. Prime Brokerage balances, which bottomed out in the fourth quarter, have been accelerating during the course of the year. So it really is a mixed bag.</p><p>And I'd say, in some respects, we're up against very tough same stores because now, having seen that growth peaked now last year, it's not surprising that we were performing at peak's end. But I'd say, this year, given that the confidence is still there, if the China situation does not worsen, perhaps this will look more like 2017 than 2018, which was actually a pretty good year. But we have to see how the next couple of months play out.</p><p>CHINEDU BOLU: Okay. Maybe with a longer-term lens, so if I think post-crisis, you saw a nice spike up in Institutional revenues. Broadly speaking, over time, they've been flat. At least for the industry, even though Morgan Stanley has taken market share. As you look forward, say, over the next 5 to 10 years, how do you think of the growth profile of Institutional business, both at Morgan Stanley and the broader industry?</p><p>TED PICK: Yes, it's an important question, Christian, because as we know for many years, the securities business was viewed as reasonably correlated to GDP growth. Then we went through these 2 secular themes of automation and regulation coming out of the crisis. And that clearly took some of the wallet out of the business altogether. We saw that in fixed income. We anticipated that, but it had had a drag on the industry as a whole. But we believe that both regulation and automation, while they will continue to be very much in place, they're much better understood.</p><p>And so the way I think about it for us is, in 2014, we had $16.5 billion of revenue against $153 billion of total revenue available to the 9 global competitors. And then last year, we had $20 billion of revenue against $145 billion. So that means, all things being equal, our revenue share went from 11% to 14%. That's a pretty good story. And we actually think there's more share to consolidate as we continue to judiciously grow across these boxes.</p><p>But more importantly, and I think critical to your question, I'd like to think that now we will begin the process of being the investment banking securities pool as a whole, begin to resume this correlation to GDP growth. So if you have a view that U.S.-led global economy is going to grow, I'd like to think we would grow in line with that or potentially even greater than that.</p><p>CHINEDU BOLU: How do you think of the end markets? So I think about your core business and the institutional asset manager base that feeds a lot of your sales and trading business, any challenges they're having, how does that impact your view on the growth prospects of that -- of your business?</p><p>TED PICK: They are struggling with, in fact, some of the same issues that the securities business struggles with, namely automation and regulation, and how to generate profitability and to work on optimizing their income statements. So in a sense, that has come back to us to try to divine ways for them to more efficiently deliver product, to reduce friction costs. And the key to that, of course, has been to have this electronic plan that can help deliver a product efficiently to help them risk-manage. But to replace some of that margin hit, really, there are only 2 ways to go: one is to do more volume, which we have; or second to try to offer other products, which is part of the reason I highlighted some of the ancillary businesses that have become quite large inside of equities, inside of fixed income, financing businesses. What we call mandate businesses like listed and futures and clearing, the fund administration business.</p><p>The other thing I would add, though, is we thought it was important to get in the C-suite. If you are talking to the asset managers, as you would any other corporate client, and having a discussion about what they're going to do given that they are going through really extraordinary, strategic change, particularly on the back of facing similar challenges to the ones that we went through, it's the beginning of a good conversation. Do you -- if you're a long manager, do look at long/short? Do you think about developing a quantitative offering? Do you think about trying to get at the A-share market? And once in there with the asset manager at the C-suite level, the word works its way through the system that the firm is acting as a trusted adviser. And that enables us then to get some of these other products in-house as well.</p><p>CHINEDU BOLU: Okay. So when we put it all together and you kind of think about what specifically would be the biggest opportunities for Morgan Stanley over the next kind of 5 years, whether it's region or product, kind of how would you maybe stack rank that?</p><p>TED PICK: Well, the U.S. will lead the way. It's -- again, it's very hard not to be thinking a lot about Asia. I'm not the bear on Europe that some folks are. Both the continent and the U.K. will find its way as economic powerhouses. We're up and running in Frankfurt. We have a big presence in Paris and in Dublin across the securities business, banking and sales and trading. But it's hard not to be allocating increasing amounts of human intellectual capital and then financial resourcing into Asia.</p><p>The internationalization of the Chinese capital markets is an extraordinary thing to witness. We pursue the privatizations of the SOEs about 20 years ago, then we went through the going public phase of Alibaba and Tencent and Meituan. And now, we are at the next stage, where these companies are effectively having cubs and grand cubs that are not only in the regular way technology business to service the Chinese consumer business, but they are global behemoths in health care, in financials, in logistics. So the internationalization of the Chinese capital markets, with the imprimatur of this MSCI [weighting], is something that we are extremely excited about and we will be giving a lot of attention to. That is sort of the regional forced order.</p><p>Again, U.S., first and foremost, increasing Asia, and as a global player, we're not going to relent in Europe.</p><p>And then in the functional categories, I like elements of all 3. The reality is that the M&amp;A franchise and our underwriting capabilities are superb, but there's more share. We can go after that. If we, now and then, want to bolt-on a banker who can get us C-suite access, we'll do that. But the culture in the investment business banking at the firm is very strong.</p><p>If you think about the equities business, the challenge there is to make sure that we are growing revenue, but not diluting returns. If we have competitors that are looking to push us on risk or on margin, we have to hold fast. How do you do that? You need to make sure that you're offering some of these other products I described.</p><p>And then the Fixed Income business, what's much important is that we have this ballast of stable revenue. So increasingly, we're thinking about the financing stream. We have a world-class securitized products group, so lending with -- secured lending with high underwriting standards. And what's important, too, then is to use the MSET technology to sort of help us progress as leaders across these markets.</p><p>CHINEDU BOLU: Since you brought up technology, let's pivot to technology. I think Morgan Stanley has been at the forefront, especially post-crisis, of innovation -- or that's Project Velocity, MSET, et cetera. When you look -- going forward, when you think about what you invested in today from a technology standpoint, which technologies do you think will have the biggest payoff over the next 5 years?</p><p>TED PICK: It's an interesting question. We -- as you say, we have history here in the equities business going back to decimalization and then Reg NMS. And I think you referenced Project Velocity. So this was a mission-critical assignment that we undertook around 2010 after I'd been managing the equities business for about a year. We got together with our MSET team and the business leaders and we decided to effectively double down on the cash agency business. And now, we trade 13% of U.S. advertised daily volume. On busy days, about 1 billion shares a day. That has been, in some respects, a category killer. The key, though, has been to take that MSET technology and the brand and to effectively germinate it across the equities business and then, over time, to think about how we can put that to use in the Fixed Income business.</p><p>And so I made reference to this notion of equitizing the Fixed Income business. And I guess the way I would think about it is a barbell. On the one end of the barbell, you are effectively running a robust, resilient kit which prosecutes large volumes and offers you access and liquidity across every connector. And then at the other of the barbell, you have a human capital that leads in offering content and solutions. That barbell, I think, is the vision that will begin to take hold inside of the Fixed Income business as we move the brand, migrating it from what was originally a cash agency business across the equity underlier and then into fixed income.</p><p>CHINEDU BOLU: To use your phrase, equitization of FIC, we're seeing a trend of folks like yourself that run the equities business running FIC, but it just seems like that business has had a harder time equitizing.</p><p>TED PICK: Right.</p><p>CHINEDU BOLU: Kind of when you think about some of the structural barriers, like kind of what are they? And what actually changes like the pace of equitization in that business?</p><p>TED PICK: The business has been resistant to electronification. It's true, as you know -- as you well know. We have to consider how varied and complex the fixed income product set is. You're talking about credit, interest rates, foreign exchange, commodities all under 1 umbrella called fixed income.</p><p>When I came from my underwriting days to the equities business, I thought \"Wow, that is complicated, complex stuff.\" And then I got introduction of fixed income, and it's seminar-level complexity. Large notionals, convexity, and we know this. And so what happened is that the rate of adoption has not been linear, and it has not been the same for each of the product set. And some of that's been driven by client behavior, where they want to play where they don't. It's also driven by the reality that some of the products are traded on a principal versus agency basis. The spot FX, as we all know, is now traded completely automated.</p><p>It's actually the case that 70% of our tickets across fixed income -- not apples-to-apples, but if you just sort of counted every ticket in the fixed-income division as one, 70% of them are executed electronically. But it's only about 1/3 of the volume.</p><p>If you think about our cash agency equities business, that number is well over 90%, so there's a heck of a way to go. Now if you took a slice of that, think of investment-grade corporate credit, there, I believe, 34% of the CUSIPs trade less than $1 million a year.</p><p>So the task of trying to amalgamate and effectively warehouse and classify all of those CUSIPs requires a lot of technology, a big lift. But it's happening, and it's happening at an accelerating clip. We have world-class effort there. We have a world-class effort in annuities. Same type of dynamic. And the equitization of this product set is not an if; it's a when. And it's happening now.</p><p>So the key is, again, to think about the barbell. You will have, over time, say 5 years, you will have, on the end, much of the product set having been equitized. And then at the other end, some of the businesses not meant to be equitized. It is traded over-the-counter. It is highly complex, bespoke over-the-counter, not just in the fact that it's not exchange-driven but it is very much C-suite driven, high sophistication and risk management requirements. And that solution's mentality will sit at the other end of the barbell.</p><p>But the rate of equitization for the preponderance of the fixed-income product set, I think, that's a big story that is now kicking in. And for us, the key is that we have this MSET brand. The clients are ready to move. We're moving with them. We have these world-class technology efforts in and around the boxes in fixed-income. And now, we're leveraging that across the markets businesses.</p><p>We have front-to-back projects, for example, in structured notes, a laborious process where you look to try to create scale, where each ticket takes a long time to process, where there isn't trade through processing. Or in the loan settlement business, which was a process that would take a month. Now I can see a day when that will take a matter of days. We have these front-to-back projects that are run jointly by our technology business and the business unit leaders as one team.</p><p>Now what's important in all of this, of course is, you imagine these kits that allow you to prosecute a lot of volume across many different underliers, you need humans, whether they be [strats], risk managers, business folks to be properly calibrating the risk, make sure on an ongoing basis they're measuring resiliency and making sure that we're executing in a flawless way.</p><p>CHINEDU BOLU: Perfect. Let me switch over to the investment bank, the IBD division, which you've just taken over. Obviously, you've had a successful strategy in equities and in the Fixed Income business. What's your vision for the investment bank over the next 5 years?</p><p>TED PICK: The 2 thoughts I have there are: one, it's a world-class business. It's a gem. So part of my job is not do anything to make it any less a gem. And if there are folks that we might bolt-on, perhaps there is a bit of capacity or there are product areas where we can expand the effort, so capability, we might add.</p><p>The beauty of the 9 box is the beauty of having our leading investment bankers working so well with our folks who run the markets business, which those of you that know the investment banking industry, that in itself is something very positive. You can then imagine that the investment banker can have effectively a two-pronged dialogue. For the control catalyst situation, they're in the boardroom, they're in the C-suite. But there are a panoply of products that need to be sold through the CFO or the Treasurer, risk management, hedging product, and there, we want to be aggressive, bringing our markets people together with our bankers through our world-class underwriting business, our Global Capital Markets Group.</p><p>CHINEDU BOLU: You mentioned the investment banking business is already on a very high level. From a manager perspective, do you have a different mentality in terms of how you think about running the business that's already doing well as opposed to the other 2 you took over where you effectively did a turnaround?</p><p>TED PICK: They were running -- the other businesses were running reasonably well, truly. Once we got going after the crisis, the team inside of equities, they did a world-class job focusing on the client. They just focused on the client, the firm, gave us some balance sheet to work with to rebuild the prime brokerage. We already had the history and cash that I described, and then we really went after trying to not be an also-ran in the derivatives business. A huge team that put that together, I think, the average tenure on our equity operating committee is 23 years. I was an active observer, but they did that.</p><p>The fixed-income turnaround, there, I might argue the team actually did an even more extraordinary job because, there we're not a natural. We're not a natural top 3 players commercial bank. And so the question became an existential one. And for us, we made the decision that we would have a credible business. We have a leadership team that is not only dedicated to managing the business prudently, but so, too, as we did in equities, very much focused on client behavior. And this equitization effect is not just how we behave and it's not just a technology phenomenon. It's, notwithstanding some of the agency-versus-principal differences, the fixed income client set, very much focused on some of the same qualities of content and service that the equities client set is. And the management team and then the core of the Fixed Income business, very much focused on that.</p><p>So for a period of time, as you know, while we kept the identity -- I mentioned in the presentation, we did not seek to try to convert the identity of one or the other business. What we sought to do was try to cross-pollinate risk management and some of the leadership techniques where we could actually bring them together in front of the client. And that has been reasonably successful. We think there's more to do.</p><p>And then, this type of 9 box mentality now will extend to the investment bankers, who view the folks in the markets businesses as partners. That in this environment, we can continue to take share, but hopefully, too, we're going to get, for the first time in more than a decade, a chance to actually watch the pie increase. That there might be macro opportunities, there might be incremental hedging opportunities. And that is exciting for the business as a whole.</p><p>CHINEDU BOLU: Regulation method, so what are we, 18 months post-implementation? If you look at the impact across your business, research, et cetera, kind of how has it affected your business, lesson learned, et cetera?</p><p>TED PICK: As it pertains to MiFID, I guess that focuses mainly on what you're speaking to which is the separation, the bifurcation of the advisory product, research from BestX. It began, as we know, as a European phenomenon, some debate about whether for operational reasons some of the lead steer institutional client base would go global. Some of them have. I believe, others might well follow. Others, though, won't.</p><p>The implication is that there has been a combination of a withdrawal of some of the research capability in the system as a whole, and then a diminution in the pure advisory product paid out to The Street for providing research. We can all pull up a model. So a lot of what made research worth having 10 years ago is obsolete. Everyone has a model.</p><p>So then the question is, do you have a research proposition that's differentiated? And I guess the way I would think about it is, if you thought about your eyeballs on Bloomberg or on the tube, maybe you've seen our name more than you might have 3 years ago, and the answer to that is yes. We actually are steadfast in the delivery of the product. A little bit of countertrend, folks looking at, \"Well, what would be the implications to cash margins with the advisory removal?\" Our view was, not just for Institutional Securities business, but also for the Wealth Management business, having relevant research makes a difference. Having world-class economists, having strategists, but that, that research couldn't any longer be just a regurgitation of an earnings report, but would have to actually be provocative stuff, forward-thinking about the auto industry, for example, across geographies.</p><p>So again, having people work together across research disciplines and then putting out blue papers that the clients grew AI and bots. We can see if they're reading it or not. In fact, they are reading it. They like it. And then that becomes the venue for discussions about whether they want to do other types of business for us. So we have been steadfast here, and we will continue to be.</p><p>The question will be whether some of the boutiques who may not have the wherewithal for the other capabilities, whether they will continue to have a role and whether midsized players that have equities businesses that're not PVT positive, whether they will stick with it. I mean there is a possibility that if there is an enough of a diminution of high-quality alpha-generative, or the conduit to alpha-generative sell-side research, that actually we could emerge a winner, helps us to consolidate other revenues as appropriate.</p><p>CHINEDU BOLU: Okay. Maybe just last one on the equities business. We have taken share, you are the leader. But every other bank out there or a lot of banks out there trying to take share. How are you able to sort of defend that share over time?</p><p>TED PICK: High levels of paranoia led by me, by now, I've bequeathed that mindset to the 3 who are running the business better than I did.</p><p>Paranoia. When you're 5 years #1 and there are 1 or 2 competitors we can think of, they're coming after you. How are they coming after you? Well, maybe they're coming after you on price. Maybe they're coming after you on reduced margin, i.e., looser risk requirements for the client base. That's not a game we're going to play. We are going to offer the product at returns on capital that are attractive to the business and to the shareholder. And that balancing act then necessitates that, not only do we continue to offer research, content, advice, but the entire product set. So when there are periods when people are interested in China, when there are periods where the market is defensive and they're looking for hedging techniques, we need to have outside share.</p><p>The pressure is on, but the team is used to this and has lavishly focused on where they need to perform in the 9 boxes. And again, as much as it's important to lead in that segment, and it is important to have 20 share, what is more important in terms of overall PVT generation is whether the wallet can resume its correlation to GDP.</p><p>I'd add, too, that as we have seen over the years in the fixed-income products set, the barriers to entry to run a large equities business are quite high, and they're growing given the headwinds of automation and regulation. And so there is the possibility that 3 to 5 years out, there will be a smaller set of large equities providers who will be able to increase share through the cycle.</p><p>CHINEDU BOLU: Perfect. As you think about PVT optimization and even ROE optimization, the business as a whole, ISG, do think there's still room for incremental expense or capital efficiencies in the broad ISG business?</p><p>TED PICK: I think we're in a pretty good place in terms of capital efficiency as you think about where we are on the efficiency frontier. As you know there are various toggles, but we've been on this for a number of years. So I'd say that on capital, whether it's measured by Basel or balance sheet, we feel pretty good about where we are in terms of optimization. In fact, the RWA numbers have gone down over the last several years while our revenues have gone up. So there's a pretty good capital story there.</p><p>Expenses, though, you need to stay on it. There's this duality. We want invest through the cycle, but we want to be mindful of the 73% number. And that means that you have to be careful about where you are in fact investing in the client set versus generating inefficiency. Technology spend can be split into run-the-bank process, where we need to make sure we have credible and resilient operations, especially as we get larger and some of these products, especially as the fixed income product set begins to equitize. But then we need to also spend money on changing the bank, which means we need to be thinking about forward technologies. That is something that we spend a considerable a lot of time on.</p><p>CHINEDU BOLU: Okay. Maybe one last one here. Talent. It's a people business. And as you think sort of about the competition for talent today and the role that big tech is playing, how is Morgan Stanley staying competitive in terms of your ability to attract the brightest, young talent?</p><p>TED PICK: Well, the war for talent is never ending, as it should be. And it is the case that some folks will migrate to technology companies, but we, too, will hire from technology companies, whether they be programmers or folks who can help transform our business. So it's not a material [specter] to departure. There are some. But we saw this phenomenon overheat a little bit in the late '90s, and as we know then, things normalized. But these are great companies, of course. Many of them are our clients, so it stands to reason that they will be interesting competitors.</p><p>What's more interesting, though, still, is where you have alternative asset managers or real money asset managers who have embedded technology, private equity firms. And that is of interest to folks who may be looking to do something different than working at a big investment bank.</p><p>And there's good news for us. We had 50,000 applications for our 550 summer intern lots that are starting now. I can tell you with high levels of certainty that I don't think I could have gotten a job against these applicants. I'm sure you could have, but I couldn't have. And it's extraordinary.</p><p>And we survey well internally, and we survey well externally. Glassdoor has us as a top 5 employer, all good stuff. But the key is to -- if we're talking about juniors, is to keep these kids longer. And they are extraordinarily well informed. So they want to come in, but then, do they want to do something next and when? And so how do we think about that? And we're pivoting on offense. The way we're think about that is show them the firm, give them mobility experience, put them in some of the different circles of the Venn diagram, allow them to see what a trading desk looks like, have then work in research, have them work in securitized products, have them work in the M&amp;A department, and do that early.</p><p>And then of course, it's critical to have a class and a group of people who are diverse that reflects society at large, and it's increasingly important for us to be focused on making sure of that -- a place where people feel included and a sense of belonging.</p><p>And so of that against a culture of excellence, where we think about doing the right thing. I'm bullish on our ability not only to attract the very best of these kids, but over time to nurture their careers and then to have folks that spend their whole careers at the firm, like I did .</p><p>CHINEDU BOLU: Fantastic.

On Wednesday, Wall Street analysts issued their price targets for Moderna. With the exception of JPMorgan and Barclays, all were above Moderna's $23 IPO price. Watch Moderna[2] trade in real time. </p><p>The buzzy biotech Moderna broke records with its initial public offering last month, but its track record since has fallen short. Moderna, which is developing messenger RNA-based therapies for cancer, infectious diseases and more, went public at $23 a share in early December. The stock fell in its trading debut[3], and has keep on tumbling since. It now trades for about $15 a share. Wall Street analysts began putting out research reports on the biotech on Wednesday. The reports provide an overview of Moderna's business prospects, and offer an estimate of what the stock is worth. Much of Wall Street has high hopes for the stock, including big-name firms Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley had the highest price target among analyst notes reviewed by Business Insider, at $29. \"For us, we continue to view the strength of the platform as a major competitive advantage and see data as the clear way to address the bear case,\" Morgan Stanley wrote. JPMorgan, which helped lead the IPO, was a notable exception. JPMorgan issued a price target of $22 on Wednesday, below Moderna's IPO price tag, though still above where it's trading now.Moderna's valuation is a `sticking point' for JPMorgan\"The company's unprecedented valuation has been a sticking point,\" JPMorgan analyst Cory Kasimov noted, given a crucial risk: that its mRNA medicines may not work. \"While we acknowledge this is a long-term story, we believe weakness post-IPO presents a more enticing opportunity.\" Key Moderna price targets include: Morgan Stanley: $29 Oppenheimer: $27 Goldman Sachs: $25 JPMorgan: $22 Barclays: $20 Read more: Moderna tumbled in its Wall Street debut after the biggest IPO in biotech history[4]Turning the body into a drug factoryA key component of the excitement surrounding Moderna is its technology: messenger RNA, which has long been seen as having enormous potential to treat disease. The idea is that by putting messenger RNA into the body, it can turn the body into a drug factory, pumping out the proteins needed to fight a particular disease like a virus or cancer. Yet turning that potential from theory to practice has been the challenge. Moderna's approach centers around modifying a component of RNA called uridine, so that internal bodily mechanisms won't get in the way of its drugs. Other companies are also working in this area, but Moderna has wowed many on Wall Street with how much it has accomplished in a relatively short amount of time.Moderna doesn't have any drugs on the marketFounded in 2010, the biotech had just one employee when CEO Stphane Bancel joined the following year. Now, though, it has brought 21 drug development programs along, 13 of which are a focus, and has ushered an impressive number of them into clinical trials, according to Oppenheimer analyst Leah Rush Cann. \"Moderna has advanced ten compounds into the clinic during this time, an unprecedented number during this time frame for any biotech company previously,\" Rush Cann said. J.P. Morgan's Kasimov also praised Moderna's 'disruptive platform with a formidable pipeline to match.' Notably, though, Moderna's medicines have not yet been reviewed or approved by US regulators, and aren't expected to be for the next several years. Oppenheimer's Rush Cann, for example, projects that Moderna could bring in its first product revenue in 2024, and estimates that revenue could balloon to $28 billion in 2030.Barclays has the lowest price target for ModernaBarclays analyst Geoff Meacham set a price target at $20 on Wednesday. His thinking: It gives investors a chance to get in now before more data from clinical trials read out. Moderna declined to comment on the price targets. Other investors have been more skeptical of Moderna's success. When sharing her 2019 predictions, Venrock partner Cami Samuels[5] said she's expecting Moderna to exit at a $3 billion valuation. That's less than half of its valuation at the IPO, and even further below where Moderna was trading on Wednesday, when it had around a $5 billion valuation. \"It's hard for me, looking at their pipeline, to figure out why they're valued five times, six times [as much as] other companies with the same pipeline,\" said Samuels, whose firm makes investments in technology and healthcare companies.

He is competing against strong candidates. And even if he wins, the international talks are stalled, each side digging in its heels.</p><p>It's becoming clearer and clearer, most recently in Australia, that the real decisions need to be made at the national level - and will require some chutzpa.</p><p>There's no doubt that reining in the reach and the wealth of Big Tech is a global affair. But waiting for global action is just taking too long.</p><p>\"Dealing with social media regulation is a global problem,\" says Fenwick McKelvey of Concordia University in Montreal. \"There needs to be a way forward; but there's no clear way forward.\"</p><p>The pandemic economy has amplified the power of the digital behemoths, and the dynamics between so-called FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) and consumers, the media and the advertisers who rely on digital distribution have become more intense as our nondigital world has shut down.</p><p>Domestic media and domestic businesses are paying the price, and the price is rising.</p><p>In Canada, concern about the influence of FAANG has mounted steadily. Content providers - Canadian media, entertainment, cultural industries - have struggled and sometimes buckled under even as the platforms that carry their work flourish and expand their influence.</p><p>The hope was that countries around the world could come together and decide what to do collectively, to avoid the threat of retaliation from the United States (where the companies are based) or from the companies themselves, now that they're as powerful as some countries.</p><p>With strong support from leaders at the G20 and the G7, the OECD is hosting talks on digital taxation. And on the fake-news, hate-speech issues raised by unedited content on social media platforms, Canada was co-operating with the likes of New Zealand and other countries to crack down on terrorist discourse, violence and hatred on the web.</p><p>But the digital taxation talks have blown past their deadlines, and the proliferation of fake news and hatred on the web continues. Canadian authorities have made it clear that they're discussing domestic moves, and in the last election, there was a political consensus that Big Tech should pay corporate tax. But so far, they've limited their action to narrow competition concerns and privacy concerns taken up through the courts.</p><p>It's no secret why.</p><p>It's a love-hate relationship on many levels, and every move to regulate or tax their reach has many ripple effects. Canadian media and creative industries don't usually get paid for the use of their content on social media platforms, but they need the platforms to distribute their content. Canadian politicians don't like the misinformation or bias spread by social media, but they rely on social media to spread their own messages.</p><p>Canadian consumers may lament the disappearance of local products, but they love the convenience of online shopping.</p><p>Corporate self-interest blurs and conflates with the public interest in so many of these discussions that it's difficult to separate them out.</p><p>Several European countries have taken matters into their own hands, but it's Australia's example that is an informative but cautionary tale for Canada.</p><p>Similar in size and power to Canada, Australia turned to its competition authority to order Facebook and Google to negotiate a deal with some Australian media to pay for content. Facebook has balked and said it just won't carry Australian news if forced to pay.</p><p>But rather than run scared, Canadian decision-makers could look to Australia for a real-time read on how far Facebook and Google can be pushed before they pull away and refuse to do business, McKelvey says.

In France, the finance minister, Michel Sapin, told French radio on Monday that  France could support debt relief for Greece should the Greek prime minister, <person><nameText>Alexis Tsipras, </nameText></person>put forth a proposal containing \"serious\" terms for a new bailout package. And in Brussels, the European Commission's vice president for euro affairs, Valdis Dombrovskis, said, \"If all sides are working seriously,  it's possible to find a solution, even in this very complicated situation.\" </p><p>After President <person><nameText>Fran\u00e7ois Hollande </nameText></person>of France and <person><nameText>Angela Merkel, </nameText></person>Germany's chancellor, met in Paris on Monday, each leader said Europe was open to negotiations with Greece, but Ms. Merkel  struck a tougher tone, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/07/world/europe/angela-merkel-faces-monumental-test-of-leadership-after-greek-vote.html\">Alison Smale and Andrew Higgins write in The New York Times</url>. \"She said that just as Greek voters had a right to make their voices heard, the views of other democracies in the European Union  also have to be respected,\" they write. Europe had offered Greece a  \"generous\" bailout deal, she said, and now it was up to Mr. Tsipras to present \"very specific proposals.\" (The New York Times has       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/07/01/business/international/what-key-players-are-saying-about-greek-crisis.html\">compiled a chart</url> listing the key players' stances on the Greek debt crisis.) </p><p>The European Central Bank also added more pressure on Greece on Monday as it  toughened the collateral terms for Greek banks that seek to tap into an emergency credit line, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/fastft/355591/ecb-adjusts-haircuts-on-greek-bank-collateral\">The Financial Times reports</url>. The E.C.B. kept the credit line limit at (EURO)89 billion, or $98 billion, but that would not necessarily be enough to keep money flowing to depositors, Ms. Alderman and Mr. Ewing write. The Greek government  extended a weeklong bank holiday through Wednesday and said that a withdrawal cap of (EURO)60, or $67, per day from A.T.M.s  could be tightened. </p><p>With Euclid Tsakalotos, an Oxford-educated economist, replacing Yanis Varoufakis as Greece's finance minister, Mr. Tsipras is preparing to present new debt proposals on Tuesday, when eurozone leaders are to meet in Brussels at 6 p.m. (noon E.D.T.). The eurozone finance ministers will meet earlier in the day at 1 p.m. (7 a.m. E.D.T.).<br/></p><p> CHINESE MARKET ROUT HITS ORDINARY INVESTORS  |  Chinese stocks resumed their decline on Tuesday, despite the Chinese government's effort to prop up the country's stock markets over the weekend, and ordinary investors are bracing for a wild ride, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/07/business/dealbook/chinese-mom-and-pop-investors-who-borrowed-are-hit-hard.html\">David Barboza writes in DealBook</url>. \"What happened in China over the last year looks like another episode of the  madness of crowds, when many investors seem to lose their senses,\" he writes. \"They started to borrow money on margin to buy shares they couldn't afford. They bet everything on the belief that this was a new era,  gleefully believing stocks moved in only one direction.\" This sort of blind optimism is not unique to Chinese investors, but Mr. Barboza notes a  key difference between markets in China and those in big economies like the United States: \"In China,  mom-and-pop investors, rather than big institutions, make up the bulk of stock purchases.\" And the ordinary investor doesn't have the same resources as the big institutions to ride out the volatility of the markets, he writes. </p><p>What makes matters worse is that the market drop comes at a time when the  Chinese economy has weakened considerably and many local governments are deep into debt. The government is now worried about the  social and political repercussions of a sustained fall in the markets. And yet, some investors, like Chen Minliang of Shanghai, are still undeterred. \"Honestly, my confidence in regulators and the market is diminishing,\" the publishing house editor told Mr. Barboza. \"But I still think the market itself has some rules and  will likely rebound after reaching the floor.\" (For other views on the Chinese markets, see <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/07/upshot/how-to-make-sense-of-chinas-plummeting-stock-market.html\">Neil Irwin's take in The Upshot</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/07/business/dealbook/chinese-stocks-still-look-overvalued.html\">Peter Thal Larsen's post for Breakingviews</url>.)<br/></p><p> EX-GOLDMAN PROGRAMMER'S 2ND CONVICTION OVERTURNED  |  On Monday, Sergey Aleynikov, a former Goldman Sachs programmer, won a dismissal of his conviction on a charge that he stole confidential computer code for Goldman Sachs's high-speed trading business, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/07/business/dealbook/conviction-of-former-goldman-programmer-is-overturned.html\">Matthew Goldstein writes in DealBook</url>. This was the  second time Mr. Aleynikov prevailed in court. After Mr. Aleynikov was found guilty of stealing proprietary code in December 2010, a federal appellate court in 2012  overturned the conviction under a federal corporate espionage law, ruling that federal prosecutors in Manhattan had misapplied the law. </p><p>Then state prosecutors in Manhattan charged him with  violating state computer-theft-related laws, and Mr. Aleynikov was found guilty on one count. On Monday, Justice Daniel P. Conviser of the State Supreme Court in Manhattan on Monday  overturned that conviction, ruling that the decades-old state law that Mr. Aleynikov was found guilty of violating  did not apply to the accusations against him. State prosecutors in Manhattan have already indicated  they may appeal the decision.<br/></p><p> ON THE AGENDA  |  The Department of Commerce will release the latest data on the  trade balance in May at 8:30 a.m.  John Legere, T-Mobile's chief executive, is scheduled to appear on CNBC at 5 p.m. </p><p> TOO MANY ANGELS?  |  As wealthy individuals clamor to be a part of the hot start-ups before they get big, tech entrepreneurs are finding that there can be downsides to having too many angel investors, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/07/technology/for-start-ups-how-many-angels-is-too-many.html\">Mike Isaac writes in The New York Times</url>. \"When many angels are involved, for example,  no one investor may feel compelled to help the company if it runs into trouble,\" he writes. \"Yet at the same time, having a dozen or more on-the-ground investors can also mean  a dozen or more opinions about company strategy.\" </p><p>Too many angels can also be taken as an indication that a company is  not strong enough to attract a lead investor, said Nancy Hua of Apptimize. And Mr. Isaac notes that many angel investors who haven't done their due diligence  may not know the exact health of their start-up when asked by others, which can give the perception that the company is not doing well. \"That communication overhead isn't something I'd realized would happen beforehand,\" Ms. Hua said.<br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/category/mergers-acquisitions/\">Mergers &amp; Acquisitions \u00bb</url></p><p> Teva Said to Prepare Higher Bid for Mylan  |  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries is preparing to raise its bid for Mylan by as much as $2 billion, to $43 billion, as soon as this week, Bloomberg News reports, citing people with knowledge of the matter.<br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-06/teva-said-planning-to-raise-mylan-bid-to-86-88-share-this-week\">BLOOMBERG NEWS</url></p><p> German Media Giants Said to Be in Deal Talks  |  The German broadcaster ProSiebenSat.1 and the German publishing company Axel Springer are in talks to combine their businesses, whose combined market capitalization is roughly (EURO)14.4 billion, or $16 billion, The Wall Street Journal reports, citing people familiar with the matter.<br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/germanys-prosiebensat-1-axel-springer-in-talks-to-merge-1436209816\">THE WALL STREET JOURNAL</url></p><p> Music Publishing Deal Driven by Shift From Sales to Streaming  |  Sesac, a boutique music rights group, is purchasing the Harry Fox Agency, a move that will allow it to collect fees both when songs are played and when they are sold.<br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/07/business/media/music-publishing-deal-driven-by-shift-from-sales-to-streaming.html\">NYT \u00bb</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/b/banks_and_banking/index.html\">INVESTMENT BANKING \u00bb</url></p><p> Banks File Updated 'Living Wills'   |  Under refiled \"living wills\" posted on the websites of the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley would cease to exist after a bankruptcy, The Wall Street Journal reports. <br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/big-u-s-banks-refile-living-wills-after-regulatory-rebuke-1436212747\">THE WALL STREET JOURNAL</url></p><p> Goldman Restructures Its Activism Defense Team  |  The move, days after the banker who led the group left the firm, comes as Wall Street focuses on helping companies respond to dissident investors.<br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/07/business/dealbook/goldman-restructures-its-activism-defense-team.html\">NYT \u00bb</url></p><p> Stephen Cutler, JPMorgan's General Counsel, to Become Vice Chairman  |  Mr. Cutler will be succeeded as general counsel by Stacey Friedman next year.<br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/07/business/dealbook/stephen-cutler-jpmorgans-general-counsel-to-become-vice-chairman.html\">NYT \u00bb</url></p><p> John Weinberg, Scion of Goldman, Is Retiring  |  Mr. Weinberg, whose father and grandfather led Goldman Sachs for decades, had his own 32-year career at the firm.<br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/07/business/dealbook/john-weinberg-scion-of-goldman-is-retiring.html\">NYT \u00bb</url></p><p> HSBC Fires 6 Employees Over Mock Execution Video  |  HSBC has fired six members of its British staff after they posted a video featuring an Islamic State-style mock execution, CNBC reports.<br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/102813621\">CNBC</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/p/private_equity/index.html\">PRIVATE EQUITY \u00bb</url></p><p> Italian Fashion Draws Private Equity Firms  |  Recent successes in the Italian fashion sector -

The fee was written into the merger agreement to reassure Baker Hughes that Halliburton expected the deal to be completed. </p><p>Since the merger was announced in November 2014, commodity prices have plummeted and sent many energy companies into a tailspin. Merging these two oil services companies may have helped with some of the effects of deteriorating commodity prices, but the Justice Department last month sued to block the deal.

Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla </nameText></person>of Puerto Rico said Sunday that he had ordered a debt moratorium, blocking a $422 million payment due on Monday,<br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/02/business/puerto-rico-to-miss-largest-payment-to-date.html\">Mary Williams Walsh reports in The New York Times.</url></p><p>This would be the biggest payment that Puerto Rico had missed and  indicates that it is also likely to default on even larger and more consequential payments due on July 1, unless Congress enacts rescue legislation in time. </p><p>\"This was a painful decision,\"  the governor said in a speech on Sunday, in which he struck a nationalistic tone and said he had to invoke his emergency powers under Puerto Rican law because help from Washington was not coming. \"We would have preferred to have had a legal framework to restructure our debts in an orderly manner.\"</p><p>Nearly $2 billion is due at the beginning of July and about $800 million of it consists of general obligation bonds that carry an explicit guarantee by the Puerto Rican Constitution. Missing that payment would set off a wave of creditor lawsuits and cast a shadow over America's $3.7 trillion municipal bond market, which has been an essential source of financing for public works. </p><p>In his speech, the governor  said  that rescue legislation was too slow and blamed unnamed \"opponents of the people of Puerto Rico,\" saying that they \"unleashed a brutal campaign of racial discrimination and lies against us\" and convincing some members of Congress that Puerto Rico needed austerity rather than debt relief. </p><p>\"Puerto Rico needs Speaker Paul Ryan to exercise his leadership and honor his word,\" he added. \"We can't wait any longer. We need this restructuring mechanism now.\"</p><p> ON THE AGENDA   |  The Manufacturing ISM Report on Business will be published at 10 a.m. Warren Buffett, Charles Munger and Bill Gates will appear on Fox Business Network at 3 p.m.  </p><p> CHINA LENDING SENDS EGG FUTURES SOARING  |  China has poured hundreds of billions of dollars into its economy in a bid to support growth and a lending deluge has sent money into some unexpected places,<br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/02/business/dealbook/china-lending-inflates-real-estate-stocks-even-egg-futures.html?ref=international\">Neil Gough reports in DealBook.</url></p><p>At a financial market in Dalian, where investors can place bets on the future productivity of the country's hens, egg futures have surged by as much as one-third since March. This might be justified if investors were expecting an end to China's chicken flocks, but the market's usual participants say the chickens are fine. Indeed, the actual price of eggs in the country's markets has fallen from a year ago, according to government statistics. </p><p>China is the world's biggest producer of eggs, but it is not clear whether the investment surge in eggs will have an impact on real-world prices, as futures prices can take months to trickle down to the real world. If it subsides, the price of eggs in local markets may not move. </p><p>Eggs are not the only commodity out of kilter - domestic prices and trading volumes for steel, garlic, cotton, iron ore and other items have  soared despite demand being dampened by China's economic slowdown. </p><p>Economists blame Beijing's efforts to shore up the economy. China has a tendency to experience investment bubbles when the government steps up spending and lending - previous efforts to bolster growth have created unexplained rises and striking drops in the real estate and stock market. </p><p>Government officials increased lending by state-controlled banks and offered other support measures in the first few months of the year as economic growth slowed and  longtime drivers like manufacturing and exports showed continued weakness.</p><p>In the short term, the lending may be good for global growth, but China risks adding to its already fast-growing pile of debt, which is nearly 300 percent of gross domestic product by some estimates.</p><p>It seems that policy makers have set aside their concerns about the debt burden for now, but by delaying a move to wean itself off cheap credit, China may be setting itself up for even more problems.</p><p>  |  Contact <url normalizedValue=\"mailto:amie.tsang@nytimes.com\">amie.tsang@nytimes.com</url></p><p>DEAL NOTES</p><p> Australian Entrepreneur Says He Created Bitcoin  |  Craig Steven Wright provided digital evidence linking himself with Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonym previously tied to the currency's creator, the BBC said.<br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/03/business/dealbook/bitcoin-craig-wright-satoshi-nakamoto.html\">NYT \u00bb</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/category/mergers-acquisitions/\">Mergers &amp; Acquisitions \u00bb</url></p><p> I.C.E.

Fink, </nameText></person>co-founder and chief executive of BlackRock, sent a letter to 500 chief executives on Monday urging them to stop providing quarterly earnings estimates,<br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/02/business/dealbook/some-heresy-on-wall-street-look-past-the-quarter.html?ref=business\">Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in the DealBook column.</url> The proposal, an effort to curb companies' short-term focus, goes against the grain of most money managers, who clamor for companies to provide detailed guidance on the next quarter, down to the last penny. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"To be clear, we do believe companies should still report quarterly results - long-termism should not be a substitute for transparency,\" he said. \"But C.E.O.s should be more focused in these reports on demonstrating progress against their strategic plans than a one-penny deviation from their E.P.S. targets or analyst consensus estimates.\" </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The letter goes further than the proposals Mr. Fink had already made to encourage longer-term thinking over the last few years. Mr. Fink is asking chief executives and boards to provide detailed long-term plans for their shareholders too. </p><p>Short-term investors were able to offer more compelling strategies than the companies themselves when management did not map out their plans for the next few years, he argued. </p><p>The call from Mr. Fink comes as activist investors are increasingly pressuring companies to return money to shareholders or buy back shares, but big investors and business leaders are also trying to encourage less focus on short-term efforts to life earnings. </p><p>The world's largest asset managers have held secret meetings to discuss proposals to encourage longer-term investment, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/3e6a1b90-c8fb-11e5-be0b-b7ece4e953a0.html?ftcamp=published_links%2Frss%2Fcompanies%2Ffeed%2F%2Fproduct#axzz3ysmruDCj\">The Financial Times reports.</url> The meetings were said to have been convened by Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan's chief executive, and Warren Buffett, to work on a statement of best practice. </p><p>In an interview, Mr. Fink said he wrote the letter to get ahead of proxy season, when many companies hold their annual meetings and vote on shareholder resolutions. He is hoping to influence how chief executives discuss their companies' performance and goals in their annual letters to shareholders. </p><p> ALPHABET CLOSES IN ON APPLE  |  Wall Street got its first glimpse of the financial details of Alphabet, Google's parent company, and investors liked what they saw enough that it is poised to become the world's most valuable company, </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/02/technology/alphabet-earnings-google.html?ref=business\">Conor Dougherty reports in The New York Times.</url></p><p>Alphabet's advertising business helped the company outpace expectations with its earnings in the last three months of 2015. This is in spite of spending $3.6 billion a year on projects like self-driving cars that do not make much money. </p><p>The earnings bolstered Alphabet's share price, and when Wall Street opens for business on Tuesday, Alphabet will most likely be worth more than Apple. It seems that investors will allow big tech companies to spend on side projects as long as the core business is not showing signs of weakness. </p><p>Alphabet's total revenue, barring currency fluctuations, rose 24 percent to $21.3 billion, compared with the last three months of 2014. </p><p>The increase was attributed to growth in mobile search and YouTube - giving investors a sign that the business was making a smooth transition from desktop computers to mobile phones. </p><p>Google was notorious for its indifference to Wall Street, but Alphabet has reined in expenses, repurchased stock and given investors more insight into how Google's core business is performing. Many Alphabet investors are hoping that the disclosure of new information will give the stock price an extra lift, as it did with Amazon.</p><p> HOW FREE ELECTRICITY HELPED DIG $9 BILLION HOLE IN PUERTO RICO  |  Puerto Rico's power authority, also known as Prepa, has been giving free power to all 78 of Puerto Rico's municipalities, to many of its government-owned enterprises and even some for-profit business, but not to its citizens,<br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/02/business/dealbook/puerto-rico-power-authoritys-debt-is-rooted-in-free-electricity.html?ref=dealbook\">Mary Williams Walsh writes in DealBook.</url><br/>It has done this for decades, even as it has sunk deeper into debt and borrowed billions just to stay afloat. </p><p>Now, the island's government is running out of cash and a movement is underway to limit the free electricity, which is estimated to cost Prepa hundreds of millions of dollars. </p><p>But the free power is so tightly woven into the fabric of society that unwinding it could worsen the plight of the people who live in Puerto Rico.</p><p>\"If the towns don't get free energy, they're going to have to pay for it by increasing their property taxes or something, so the people will end up paying,\" said Eduardo Bhatia, the president of the Puerto Rico Senate. Residents are already upset about a recent sales tax hike. </p><p>Mr. Bhatia will begin hearings on Tuesday to determine who and what are to blame for the authority's larger problems, especially its inefficient power plants. </p><p>Meanwhile the power provider continues to demonstrate how complex solutions to the debt problems are likely to be. </p><p>In Aguadilla, a town on Puerto Rico's northwest coast, Prepa managed to power a development spree, populating the town with restaurants, a hotel, a water park, a baseball stadium and a waterfront studded with dancing fountains. </p><p>Carlos M\u00e9ndez Mart\u00ednez, the mayor of the town, has kept his 17-year-old promise not to raise taxes, but even he is anticipating limits on his free power now that the authority is struggling for solvency and recently put a solar power system on the roof of the town's ice skating rink that he hopes will eventually get it off the grid.</p><p> ON THE AGENDA  |  Monday's newsletter included an incorrect time for Yahoo's conference call on its fourth-quarter and full-year results. It starts today at 5 p.m. Pfizer will hold a conference call on its latest quarterly results at 10 a.m. ExxonMobil's call on its fourth-quarter and full-year earnings starts at 10:30 a.m. The Securities and Exchange Commission's   Equity Market Structure Advisory Committee will meet at 9:30 a.m. </p><p> TED CRUZ WINS REPUBLICAN CAUCUSES IN IOWA  |  Senator Ted Cruz of Texas dealt a humbling loss to Donald J. Trump in the Iowa caucuses,<br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/02/us/ted-cruz-wins-republican-caucus.html\">Jonathan Martin reports in The New York Times.</url> With 98 percent of precincts reporting, Mr. Cruz had nearly 28 percent of the vote, while Mr. Trump had 24. Mr. Cruz's victory throws into question the depth of support for Mr. Trump's unconventional candidacy. Marco Rubio finished a strong third with 23 percent, bolstering his case to consolidate the support of Republicans uneasy about the two top finishers. </p><p>Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders remained locked in a tight race, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/02/us/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-democratic-iowa-caucus.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=a-lede-package-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news\">Patrick Healy reports in The New York Times.</url></p><p>The close results were unnerving Mrs. Clinton and her team, who had expressed confidence that they had recaptured political momentum in recent days. They are likely to split Iowa's share of delegates to the Democratic convention, and Mr. Sanders will be able to argue that the result was a virtual tie. </p><p>The Iowa Democratic Party declared early Tuesday morning that Mrs. Clinton had won, but The Associated Press had not called the race yet.</p><p>European stocks following a slide in Asia early on Tuesday, as the slump in oil continued.

He added that he did not want anyone \u201cto use our tools to undermine democracy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what we stand for,\u201d he said.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104052907253171\">In a Facebook post</url>, Mr. Zuckerberg also outlined the company\u2019s newest initiatives:</p><p> The service will now show which Facebook page paid for the ad, and the advertiser\u2019s page will show all the ads the entity is running. (Still, that doesn\u2019t necessarily identify who is running the page.)</p><p> \u201cWe will strengthen our ad review process for political ads,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg promised.</p><p> Facebook will hire 250 more employees for its security team.</p><p> The company will expand coordination with global election commissions.</p><p> It also promised to work closely with other technology companies to share threat information.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg also said Facebook was monitoring activity related to the German elections on Sunday:</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re also examining the activity of accounts we\u2019ve removed and have not yet found a similar type of effort in Germany. This is incredibly important and we have been focused on this for a while.\u201d</p><p>The Response</p><p>Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, to The Times:</p><p>\u201cThis is a good first step,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed it\u2019s taken 10 months of raising this issue before they\u2019ve become much more transparent.\u201d He said he believed there were additional \u201ctroll farms\u201d in both Russia and Eastern Europe, \u201cand it\u2019s really important that Facebook work with us to investigate other sources of advertising and fake accounts.\u201d</p><p>Representative Adam Schiff of California, the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-21/facebook-says-it-will-release-russian-election-ads-to-congress\">Bloomberg\u2019s Sarah Frier</url>:</p><p>\u201cIt will be necessary to hear directly from Facebook, Google and Twitter, as well as others in the tech sector, including in open hearings that will inform the American public,\u201d Schiff said in a statement. \u201cMoving forward, the committee\u2019s investigation will require greater and ongoing cooperation by Facebook and other social media companies on this and other issues.\u201d</p><p>The Context</p><p>Facebook is trying to stave off stricter government regulation. Tech executives have been worried that new rules could lay huge burdens on the world\u2019s biggest advertising business.</p><p>Facebook says it is not legally allowed to share everything it knows about advertisers, but some in the industry worry that could change. The Times\u2019s media columnist, Jim Rutenberg, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.recode.net/2017/9/21/16341822/jim-rutenberg-new-york-times-facebook-russia-political-ads-news-media\">discussed this on a Recode podcast</url>:</p><p>\u201cTelevision stations have to keep records that literally anyone in the public can see, in windows close to elections, who bought ads,\u201d Mr. Rutenberg said. \u201cMaybe who bought it is \u2018Citizens for Blue Skies,\u2019 and you have to figure out who they are, but there\u2019s a record of this. And there\u2019s talk now about making social media properly accountable for this kind of advertising.\u201d</p><p>At the same time, Facebook and Alphabet are finding themselves under pressure from older tech companies and other sometime allies.</p><p>From <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theinformation.com/facebook-alphabet-find-few-friends-in-washington\">The Information\u2019s Cory Weinberg</url>:</p><p>In the debate-du-jour in the U.S. Senate, Oracle, Disney, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and 21st Century Fox recently voiced support for an anti-sex trafficking bill that would change the bedrock internet platform law, the Communications Decency Act\u2019s Section 230, to put more legal liability on web companies like Facebook and Alphabet. Co-sponsored by Republican senator Rob Portman of Ohio, it is aimed mainly at Backpage.com, a classifieds site that ran ads connected with sex trafficking.

McFadden in The Times</url>:</p><p>L\u2019Affaire Bettencourt had captivated France since 2007, when a daughter\u2019s lawsuit charged that Mrs. Bettencourt, ranked as the richest woman in the world, had been bamboozled by a society photographer 25 years her junior for cash, annuities, fine art and, it seemed, an island in the Seychelles.</p><p>This became a government scandal, too, when a former family accountant suggested that Mrs. Bettencourt had made contributions to Nicolas Sarkozy shortly before his election as president of France.</p><p>Taking Aim at Harvard Favoritism</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2017/09/19/how-harvard-helps-its-richest-and-most-arrogant-students-get-ahead/?dlbk\">This op-ed in The Washington Post</url> by Sarah Ruden, a doctoral graduate from Harvard, has had the business world talking.</p><p>Ms. Ruden recounts how a student in a Latin class she had taught was outraged at having received an A-minus.</p><p>From her piece:</p><p>This professor didn\u2019t ask to see any evidence.

This ban would show the world that, far from being open, London is closed to innovative companies who bring choice to consumers.''</p><p>  Joe Murphy, the political editor of London's Evening Standard newspaper, had this to say on Twitter:</p><p>  Related Reading</p><p>  The Wall Street Journal's Greg Bensinger says that Benchmark, one of Uber's earliest backers, won't participate in a plan to let SoftBank buy out existing investors.</p><p>Facebook Bows to Pressure From Washington</p><p>  Lawmakers had complained that Facebook had turned over evidence of Russian-linked political advertisements to special counsel Robert S. Mueller, but not to Congress.</p><p>  The technology giant is now bowing to the pressure, agreeing to turn over more than 3,000 of those ads to congressional investigators.</p><p>  The New York Times's Scott Shane and Mike Isaac reported on Facebook's reasoning:</p><p>  ''I care deeply about the democratic process and protecting its integrity,'' Facebook's chief executive, <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>said during an appearance on Facebook Live, the company's video service. He added that he did not want anyone ''to use our tools to undermine democracy.''</p><p>  ''That's not what we stand for,'' he said.</p><p>  In a Facebook post, Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>also outlined the company's newest initiatives:</p><p>   The service will now show which Facebook page paid for the ad, and the advertiser's page will show all the ads the entity is running. (Still, that doesn't necessarily identify who is running the page.)</p><p>   ''We will strengthen our ad review process for political ads,'' Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>promised.</p><p>Facebook will hire 250 more employees for its security team.</p><p>   The company will expand coordination with global election commissions.</p><p>   It also promised to work closely with other technology companies to share threat information.</p><p>  Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>also said Facebook was monitoring activity related to the German elections on Sunday:</p><p>  ''We're also examining the activity of accounts we've removed and have not yet found a similar type of effort in Germany. This is incredibly important and we have been focused on this for a while.''</p><p>  The Response</p><p>  Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, to The Times:</p><p>  ''This is a good first step,'' he said. ''I'm disappointed it's taken 10 months of raising this issue before they've become much more transparent.'' He said he believed there were additional ''troll farms'' in both Russia and Eastern Europe, ''and it's really important that Facebook work with us to investigate other sources of advertising and fake accounts.''</p><p>  Representative Adam Schiff of California, the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, to Bloomberg's Sarah Frier:</p><p>  ''It will be necessary to hear directly from Facebook, Google and Twitter, as well as others in the tech sector, including in open hearings that will inform the American public,'' Schiff said in a statement. ''Moving forward, the committee's investigation will require greater and ongoing cooperation by Facebook and other social media companies on this and other issues.''</p><p>  The Context</p><p>Facebook is trying to stave off stricter government regulation. Tech executives have been worried that new rules could lay huge burdens on the world's biggest advertising business.</p><p>Facebook says it is not legally allowed to share everything it knows about advertisers, but some in the industry worry that could change. The Times's media columnist, Jim Rutenberg, discussed this on a Recode podcast:</p><p>  ''Television stations have to keep records that literally anyone in the public can see, in windows close to elections, who bought ads,'' Mr. Rutenberg said. ''Maybe who bought it is 'Citizens for Blue Skies,' and you have to figure out who they are, but there's a record of this. And there's talk now about making social media properly accountable for this kind of advertising.''</p><p>  At the same time, Facebook and Alphabet are finding themselves under pressure from older tech companies and other sometime allies.</p><p>  From The Information's Cory Weinberg:</p><p>  In the debate-du-jour in the U.S. Senate, Oracle, Disney, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and 21st Century Fox recently voiced support for an anti-sex trafficking bill that would change the bedrock internet platform law, the Communications Decency Act's Section 230, to put more legal liability on web companies like Facebook and Alphabet. Co-sponsored by Republican senator Rob Portman of Ohio, it is aimed mainly at Backpage.com, a classifieds site that ran ads connected with sex trafficking. But it is written broadly enough that most big consumer internet companies have voiced concerns. </p><p>  Related Reading</p><p>   Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>denied to Bloomberg Businessweek that his well-document tour around the United States was political:</p><p>  ''Wouldn't it be better,'' he asks with a sly smile, ''if it was actually an accepted thing for people to want to go understand how other people were living?''</p><p>  He also complained about perceptions among the media that he is being inauthentic:</p><p>  As he says this, his publicist stands up and indicates the interview is over, but <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>isn't quite done. He smiles and then says, ''I need to give you a hard time.'' He proceeds to complain about a Bloomberg Businessweek story in January that noted he employs a team of about a dozen content moderators -- as well as communications managers, professional photographers, video producers, Morgan Freeman -- who are all responsible for maintaining his personal Facebook page. ''You're taking away from all the time that I spent on this,'' he says.</p><p>   The Times's Kevin Roose suggests that Facebook should learn from Wall Street and create a risk department.</p><p>   From The Financial Times's lunch with Margarethe Vestager, Europe's antitrust commissioner:</p><p>   ''To some degree some of these companies are very old-school advertising companies in a completely new dress. Some of the things that they do, they are amazing. These are innovations that have changed our societies. But that doesn't change the fact that they still have a responsibility. If you're a dominant company, you have a special responsibility.''</p><p>   Yoshua Bengio, a professor at the University of Montreal and a pioneer in artificial intelligence, wants more government regulation of the big tech companies, according to Axios's Steve LeVine:</p><p>  I asked Bengio if the companies should be broken up. He harrumphed and responded that antitrust laws should be enforced. ''Governments have become so meek in front of companies,'' he said.</p><p>   Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>may deny that he's running for political office. But The Washington Post's Aaron Blake thinks that another corporate mogul is itching to run for something:</p><p>  Schultz spoke with The Washington Post at a job fair for young people on Wednesday, and while he insisted he wasn't talking politics, it wasn't difficult imagine him delivering the same words in a stump speech in Des Moines.</p><p>  Brexit Is Poised to Take Shape</p><p>  On the Political Front</p><p>  After months of very public infighting among her cabinet members, Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain appears ready to commit to a negotiating strategy for her country's exit from the European Union.</p><p>  At a speech in Florence today, Ms. May is expected to announce plans for a two-year transition period after leaving the political bloc.</p><p>  From Bloomberg's Tim Ross, Ian Wishart and Simon Kennedy:</p><p>  The goal is to maintain trade ties to the U.K.'s biggest market and give businesses time to adjust to the new regime. A holdover period would protect companies from being hit with unwieldy tariffs and regulations overnight, if no long-term trade deal has been struck by Brexit day in March 2019.</p><p>  The Guardian's Jon Henley adds that Ms. May will concede that Britain will pay some kind of divorce bill to the European Union:</p><p>  It is thought May will offer to pay enough into the EU to ensure no member state need make extra contributions during the current budget round, which ends in 2020 -- a year after the UK leaves. This would amount to about ?20bn (\u00a318bn), although she may not mention a figure.</p><p>  The assessment of The Financial Times's Sebastian Payne: The new approach ''marks the end of 'no deal is better than a bad deal.'''</p><p>  On the Business Front</p><p>  Britain is hoping to keep the financial services sector from fleeing to continental Europe with a more industry-friendly approach to regulation.</p><p>  From The Financial Times's Sarah Gordon, Laura Noonan, Patrick Jenkins and George Parker:</p><p>  [David Davis, Britain's lead Brexit negotiator] believes that if Britain maintained the same regulatory framework for financial services as the EU in the long term -- without having any influence over its composition -- this would erode any competitive advantage the UK-based industry would gain from being outside the bloc.</p><p>  After Bettencourt, L'Or\u00e9al May Be in Play</p><p>  For years, L'Or\u00e9al's independence was all but guaranteed by the 33-percent stake held by the family of Liliane Bettencourt, the daughter of the founder of the cosmetics giant.</p><p>  Her death on Wednesday, at age 94, has raised questions about how much longer that independence will endure.</p><p>  The most obvious suitor: Nestl\u00e9, which owns a 23-percent stake.</p><p>  The Swiss conglomerate has long said that it views the holding as long-term and strategic. (Third Point's Daniel S. Loeb, who is urging changes at Nestl\u00e9, disagrees: He wants the company to sell those shares.)</p><p>Nestl\u00e9's website says that the company will not make any moves on L'Or\u00e9al for at least six months, as dictated by an agreement with her family. That restriction will end in March.</p><p>  A spokeswoman for Nestl\u00e9 told DealBook that the company declined to comment beyond this statement:</p><p>  ''It is with great sadness that we received the news of the passing away of Mrs. Liliane Bettencourt. We express our most sincere condolences and deepest sympathy to Mrs. Bettencourt's family and to all at L'Or\u00e9al at this difficult moment.''</p><p>  What Investors Think</p><p>  Shares of L'Or\u00e9al were up 3.5 percent this morning on the Euronext Paris stock exchange, at 182.80 euros, or nearly $218, their highest level since July.</p><p>  Related Reading</p><p>  Mrs. Bettencourt was long regarded as the richest woman in the world. (Bloomberg estimates her net worth at $42.5 billion.)</p><p>  But her later years were marked by controversy. From the obituary by Robert D. McFadden in The Times:</p><p>  L'Affaire Bettencourt had captivated France since 2007, when a daughter's lawsuit charged that Mrs. Bettencourt, ranked as the richest woman in the world, had been bamboozled by a society photographer 25 years her junior for cash, annuities, fine art and, it seemed, an island in the Seychelles.</p><p>  This became a government scandal, too, when a former family accountant suggested that Mrs. Bettencourt had made contributions to Nicolas Sarkozy shortly before his election as president of France.</p><p>  Taking Aim at Harvard Favoritism</p><p>  This op-ed in The Washington Post by Sarah Ruden, a doctoral graduate from Harvard, has had the business world talking.</p><p>  Ms. Ruden recounts how a student in a Latin class she had taught was outraged at having received an A-minus.</p><p>  From her piece:</p><p>  This professor didn't ask to see any evidence. He accepted the student's plea that he had ''worked really hard.'' Then, in front of the student, he pressed me to explain the reason for my poor teaching, apparently the only thing that could reveal why the student wasn't satisfied with his grade.</p><p>  Ms. Ruden adds:</p><p>  Many of the better-off young people at Harvard appeared to require intense favoritism to reassure them, perhaps because of the less-moneyed achievement and potential that loomed all around. Though some of the anointed developed their capabilities to the full, the institutional imperative to establish a hierarchy between them and us took precedence.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-519375170923</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PJ8-CY51-JBG3-63G8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2128\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The New York Times Company</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times</publicationName><edition>The New York Times on the Web</edition><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/22/business/dealbook/london-uber-ban.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/22/business/dealbook/london-uber-ban.html</url><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 23, 2017 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>CC0009DNU</classCode><className>GEOPHARMA INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"68\"><className>NAICS325412 PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATION MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><className>SIC2834 PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

On Wednesday, Monsanto told investors that it was  abandoning \"large-scale\" mergers as a strategy. \"A board that's considering a transaction has to reassess what are the  outer limits of what the government is prepared to do,\" said Richard Brand, a mergers and acquisitions partner at Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp; Taft. \"If it's a politically unpopular transaction and the government has the tools to block it,  they might block it just because they can.\" </p><p> Obama administration officials  deny that there has been any change in their views of mergers. In a conference call about the lawsuit against Halliburton and Baker Hughes, the head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, William Baer, said companies had been striking more deals and betting that they will not have to make large changes for regulatory approval. \"There are some deals that are  so antitrust-risky that they never ought to make it out of the executive suite or the corporate boardroom,\" he said. </p><p> Given the current climate, Pfizer's options appear to be limited, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/07/business/dealbook/pfizer-allergan-merger.html\">Katie Thomas and Chad Bray write in DealBook</url>. It has  two choices: grow bigger or split up. Some analysts have been pushing for a breakup of the company because they believe that two smaller and more focused companies would be worth more than one bigger entity. Pfizer's chief executive, <person><nameText>Ian C.

If these newcomers succeed,  \"Wall Street as we know it may become an outpost of Palo Alto,\" Mr. Sorkin writes.</p><p> Of course, there are the skeptics, like the banking investor J. Christopher Flowers, who have  dismissed the fintech frenzy as mere hype that defies common sense and will leave a trail of failed companies in its wake. But Mr. Sorkin writes that a  third view may have the highest likelihood of coming true: \"The big banks, so powerful and yet so anxious about the possibility of being disrupted by the upstarts, will  gobble them all up in a spate of mergers and acquisitions that puts the disrupters squarely inside the institutions they were supposed to overtake.\" </p><p> The banking industry needs to realize that change is coming whether it likes it or not, contends Steve Case, a founder of AOL and an entrepreneur with investments in several fintech businesses, who just wrote a book about the future, \"The Third Wave.\" \"Some banks will be smart and figure out how to partner with some of these entrepreneurs or acquire some of these companies or do joint ventures, but  if they just think it's going to stay the way it is, they will be surprised,\" Mr. Case said.</p><p> ON THE AGENDA  |   Janet L.

Yahoo is projecting  revenue of $4.4 billion this year, down from $5 billion last year, according to two people close to the bidding who have seen the confidential data the company has shared with potential bidders. That figure is on the  low end of the revenue estimate the company shared publicly with investors in February. Also, Yahoo is expecting to pay other sites about $1 billion this year for sending traffic to its advertising services. </p><p> \"Perhaps more important to potential bidders is that Yahoo executives, including the chief, Marissa Mayer, are offering  little detail about the costs and realistic growth prospects of various parts of its business,\" Mr. Goel writes. Initial bids are due at the end of next week, but that deadline might be pushed back.

The numbers were down when compared to July, which the index attributes due to seasonal changes. IT workers continue to be in high demand, according to Morgan McKinley, particularly in the areas of infrastructure and support, as well as mobile development and user experience design. The role of big tech multinationals in Ireland's economy also kept demand for multilingual workers strong - with German, Dutch, French and Nordic languages amongst the most sought-after. Meanwhile, regulatory changes have pushed up demand for workers in risk and compliance fields, while rising mergers and acquisitions activity also saw a rise in the need for corporate finance professionals.</p><p>Karen O'Flaherty, chief operations officer at Morgan McKinley, says a number of companies and organisations are looking to tap into the current talent within Ireland of which - especially within such areas as the IT sector - there is a skills shortage and a high demand for women in the industry. A number of employers are looking to attract people, particulary female workers, who may have been out of the workforce for some years and who need to be reintegrated into the workplace. A number of these professionals have transferable skills, but they will still require some reskilling and a number of organisations - from a training and development and mentoring point of view - are trying to make sure people's skills meet the workplace demands, Ms O'Flaherty explains.</p><p>Due to the strong export sector and the high level of demand for multilingual skills, Ms O'Flaherty says there are definite skilsl shortages evident in the multinational sector. She says that the country has to be more open about how we attract workers here to fill those shortages. <br/><br/> ***<br/> MORNING BRIEFS - Irish mobile firm Zamano has reported a more-than 19% increase in its revenue for the first half of the year. The company, which once made a significant amount of its money from ringtones, has in recent years transitioned into a mobile-focused marketing and payments service. It includes Vodafone, Three and Permanent TSB amongst its clients. In the first half of the year Zamano had revenues of \u20ac10.4m, with its pre-tax profit rising by more than 17% to \u20ac1.16m. </p><p>*** Hewlett-Packard is to cut another 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its enterprise business due to falling demand for products. The latest wave of cuts come on top of the 55,000 layoffs previously announced by the company's CEO Meg Whitman. HP has around 4,000 employees in Ireland working in manufacturing, research and development, customer software support, marketing, and sales and services. The majority are based in Leixlip, Co Kildare with other operations in Galway and Dublin's Swords. The company indicated the cuts announced today will be global, but provided no specifics.</p><p>*** </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RTENEW-728186</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RTENEW2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5GXX-X7V1-JDRT-23JR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">352662</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-09-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"514\"/><timeReceived>11:28 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 RTE Commercial Enterprises Ltd / Radio Telef\u00eds \u00c9ireann All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>RTE News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"62422\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"09\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>September 16, 2015 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002KLJ</classCode><className>HEWLETT-PACKARD CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS334118 COMPUTER TERMINAL &amp;

So it was primary day in Florida. And in the race for governor, President Trump's favored candidate cruised to a win in the Republican primary. But it was really the Democratic primary that surprised a lot of people. Andrew Gillum was the favorite of left-wing progressives in the state, but he never led in a single poll and then ended up winning last night over former Congresswoman Gwen Graham. Here's Gillum in his victory speech last night.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ANDREW GILLUM:                 Right here in the state of Florida tonight, we have shown the rest of the country that we can be the David in the situation where there's a Goliath.             </p><p>DAVID GREENE:                 OK. Well, that says it. NPR's lead political editor Domenico Montanaro is here. Domenico, good morning.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Good morning, David.             </p><p>DAVID GREENE:                 So was this a David-and-Goliath situation? And how shocking is this victory by Andrew Gillum?             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 I mean, it's pretty shocking. It was a big surprise. Certainly, Gillum had the support of Bernie Sanders and a lot of progressive energy on his side and a lot of late momentum. He was not expected to win. That - the favorite was Gwen Graham, who's the daughter of the former senator and governor Bob Graham. But you know, Gillum really showed - as you could hear in that clip, his kind of aspirational, working-class, hopeful message really won the day.             </p><p>                And you know, he's currently the mayor of Tallahassee, the state's capital. And he's dynamic and young - only 39. He'd be the state's first black governor. He campaigned on improving the state's education system, expanding Medicaid, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour and repealing the state's controversial \"stand your ground\" gun law. And you know, he came on late, campaigned across the state. And even though he wasn't very well-known, the energy was certainly with him, and he's certainly getting a lot of attention now.             </p><p>DAVID GREENE:                 All right. So this election year, you have both parties sort of trying to figure out which wing of the party has a better chance of being successful for them. Here you have a candidate, you know, endorsed by Bernie Sanders. What might this tell us about Democrats heading into this fall?             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Well, I mean, on the Republican side, the winner was Ron DeSantis, who basically staked his entire political career on how close he was to President Trump. He won decisively last night. And this really sets up an amazing race because you have a race in Florida that is everything to 2018, everything that 2018 represents. It's going to be the Bernie Sanders versus Trump race that never happened.             </p><p>DAVID GREENE:                 Oh, that's interesting. Well, let's turn to another state, Arizona. There was the race to fill Republican Senator Jeff Flake's seat. He's retiring. How did that play out?             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Well, national Republicans were a little worried going into last night because of some of the back-and-forth that had happened within the primary, moving their preferred candidate Congresswoman Martha McSally a little bit to the right. But she prevailed fairly easily last night. But it was a bruising primary, so much so that Kyrsten Sinema, the Democrat in the race, has taken something of a sizable lead in the average of the polls.             </p><p>                And this is an important place for Democrats to try to be able to have a chance to take back the Senate. They are going to need to win here. But so far, right out of the gate, McSally, a former fighter pilot, came out hotly negative against Sinema, saying that she's impressed she owns a hundred shoes but she's flown over a hundred flights. So get ready for a...             </p><p>DAVID GREENE:                 Wow.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 ...Very nasty fall.             </p><p>DAVID GREENE:                 That sets it up. How many primary days are left? Are we getting - we're getting close to them being over. Right?             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 This was the last kind of big, major primary night. There's still one more left.             </p><p>DAVID GREENE:                 OK. NPR's Domenico Montanaro.             </p><p>                Domenico, thanks a lot.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 You're welcome.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF PARAMORE SONG, \"AIN'T IT FUN\")                </p><p>DAVID GREENE:                 I think you could say trade negotiations can feel a little bit like a poker game at times.             </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN:                 Yeah. NAFTA negotiations are underway in Washington, and they seem to have their share of bluffing, folding and compromising - all this among countries that are supposed to be friends - right? - the U.S., Mexico, Canada.             </p><p>DAVID GREENE:                 Yeah.             </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN:                 As Canada's foreign minister rushed to Washington, D.C., for talks, Canada's prime minister, Justin Trudeau, seemed to strike an optimistic note.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>JUSTIN TRUDEAU:                 We will engage in a positive and constructive way, as we always have been, and look forward to ultimately signing a deal as long as it is good for Canada and good for middle-class Canadians.             </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN:                 The Trump administration says - hey, we've already got a deal with Mexico. Canada, you better hurry up and get on board.             </p><p>DAVID GREENE:                 All right. So who has the leverage here? Who's bluffing in this really important poker game? Shawn Donnan is a senior reporter covering global trade for Bloomberg News, and he joins us in the studio.             </p><p>                Hey there, Shawn.             </p><p>SHAWN DONNAN:                 Hey.             </p><p>DAVID GREENE:                 Does this feel like a poker game? Is that what we're seeing play out in Washington right now?             </p><p>SHAWN DONNAN:                 Well, it doesn't just feel like a poker game. This feels like it's 5 a.m. in the morning. We've been up all night playing poker. Everyone's feeling tired. The coffee is brewing, and we're getting ready for that kind of last standoff.             </p><p>DAVID GREENE:                 It is a last standoff because there's a deadline here - right? - I mean, to come up with some sort of deal. Remind us what the window is.             </p><p>SHAWN DONNAN:                 So it's kind of a fake deadline. Basically, the Trump administration's been negotiating with the outgoing administration of Enrique Pena Nieto in Mexico. He leaves office December 1. And that means - and the Trump administration and both Enrique Pena Nieto and his successor, Manuel Lopez Obrador - I hope I got that right...             </p><p>DAVID GREENE:                 Yeah.             </p><p>SHAWN DONNAN:                 ...Is - want Pena Nieto to sign the deal. And to do that, you have to notify Congress. You have to give 90 days' notice to Congress of the signing ceremony. And basically, that 90-days deadline is Friday.             </p><p>DAVID GREENE:                 OK. So it's getting this done before the leadership in Mexico changes. Well, let's talk about candidates. So you had President Trump saying that there was sort of a loose understanding with just Mexico. Canada comes to Washington, joins the talks. Is Canada really on the spot because you listen to, like, everyone in the United States - Republicans, Democrats, labor leaders, business leaders - they all seem to be saying, give Canada what they want, and get them in here.             </p><p>SHAWN DONNAN:                 Well, that's absolutely right. So the Trump administration has a kind of gambit here. And that is that they can force the Canadians to give in on big issues, like giving the U.S. greater access to the dairy market in Canada. The problem is that the Canadians actually don't have their own political deadlines. While President Trump has the midterm elections in mind, while the Mexicans have the change of administrations in mind, Canada doesn't face elections until well into 2019. So it's a real question of - who's got the leverage here?             </p><p>DAVID GREENE:                 Whatever happens, if there is a new agreement, is this going to look all that different from NAFTA? Or are all the sides going to just come up with something and then present it to their people as something that may be new, may be not new but it's beneficial to them?             </p><p>SHAWN DONNAN:                 So I mean, that's the big story if you step back from this. President Trump came in promising a revolution in trade. He was going to have jobs flooding back into America. He was going to rip up existing trade agreements, things like NAFTA, that he said were terrible. Actually, what we're ending up with is something that looks like a kind of - a real NAFTA 2.0. President Trump has said he wants to rename it. He doesn't like the name NAFTA. It's got bad connotations. But you look at the details or at least the contours of the deal that they've revealed this week, and it looks a lot like NAFTA with some tweaks.             </p><p>DAVID GREENE:                 You probably won't be hearing President Trump call it NAFTA 2.0 on the campaign trail this fall. But interesting to hear about. Shawn Donnan covers trade for Bloomberg News and joined us this morning.             </p><p>                Thanks so much, Shawn. We really appreciate it.             </p><p>SHAWN DONNAN:                 Thanks for having me.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                </p><p>DAVID GREENE:                 I don't think I have to tell anyone the role that Google plays in many of our lives. If there's a question we want to answer if we're talking with family or friends and we can't think of what the name of that movie was - whatever it is, we just Google it.             </p><p>RACHEL MARTIN:                 Right. So President Trump is upset about what those searches are turning up. In statements throughout the day yesterday, the president complained about the kinds of results that pop up when someone puts the words Trump news into the Google search engine. The president claims, without evidence, that Google has it all rigged, showing only the reporting of, quote, \"fake news media.\" The president went on to accuse Google of suppressing conservative voices. His administration says it's now going to explore ways to regulate Google. Here's Trump in the Oval Office yesterday.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>DONALD TRUMP:                 I think that Google and Twitter and Facebook - they're really treading on very, very troubled territory. And they have to be careful. It's not fair to large portions of the population.             </p><p>DAVID GREENE:                 All right, Hadas Gold covers the media for CNN, and she joins us.             </p><p>                Good morning.             </p><p>HADAS GOLD:                 Good morning.             </p><p>DAVID GREENE:                 So not any evidence that the president presented, this narrative about conservatives being treated unfairly by social media - is there anything new that the president has discovered? Or is he just making this accusation?             </p><p>HADAS GOLD:                 So we did a little bit of reverse engineering and found that this tweet likely stemmed from an unscientific study done by a conservative site called PJ Media that was then later picked up by Fox Business, which we know the president enjoys watching Fox hosts. And that study - again, completely unscientific - what they did is they just sort of Googled certain phrases, like Trump. And then what they found was that they declared that all of the results tended to come - or most of the results tended to come from what a lot of people call mainstream media but what they deemed liberal media, or left-wing media. And that ranges everything from CNN to Reuters to Associated Press. And they put certain sites like InfoWars, which is known to spread conspiracy theories, more into the center-right.             </p><p>                So it's all about definitions here. If you believe that Reuters and The Associated Press are left-wing media, then, yes, a lot of the Google News results are going to be from those types of sites. But there's no specific evidence that Google is trying to clamp down on conservative views. But the Google algorithm is this sort of black box. They don't really open it up. We don't really know exactly how it all works. Google claims that this is not what they do. In a statement yesterday, they said that search is not used to set a political agenda and that they don't bias their results toward any political ideology. But as we've seen, tech and social media have become a big target for the president and for his supporters.             </p><p>DAVID GREENE:                 Yeah. This came up when big tech was testifying before Congress - at least the idea of whether they could be regulated, whether there's interest in regulating these kinds of platforms, as the president brought up yesterday. Where does that stand, and what might the implications of that be?             </p><p>HADAS GOLD:                 So it's really interesting because they're getting this pressure from both the right and the left. On the left, there's complaints that these platforms give free rein for conspiracy theories and hate speech, and they need to do more to clamp down on that. Also, there's the whole issue of Russian interference, foreign interference in elections. All these tech platforms are going to be facing even more questions on September 5. Facebook, Twitter and Google have all been invited to testify at the Senate Intelligence Committee, where I'm sure we are going to hear pressure from both conservative and more liberal senators on exactly these types of issues.             </p><p>DAVID GREENE:                 OK. Hadas Gold is a reporter with CNN. She covers the media. We always appreciate you having on. Thanks a lot.             </p><p>HADAS GOLD:                 Great to be here. Thanks.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ERIC LAU'S \"STAR TREKKING\")            </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NPRMED-201808291018</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NPRMED2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T4V-YB71-JBJH-3493-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429280</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2453\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 National Public Radio (R) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NPR Morning Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 29, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Primaries</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Governors</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>International Trade &amp;

The new justice was speaking publicly for the first time since the bruising nomination process ended. Kavanaugh said he would not allow what took place to influence his decisions on the bench.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BRETT KAVANAUGH:                 The Senate confirmation process was contentious and emotional. That process is over. My focus now is to be the best justice I can be. I take this office with gratitude and no bitterness.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 President Trump, on the other hand, took a somewhat different tone. He slammed Democrats for trying to destroy his nominee. NPR's White House correspondent Tamara Keith is with us now.             </p><p>                Good morning, Tam.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Good morning.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 So what is Trump telling Republican voters?             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 He is telling them that Democrats are the enemy. And that - you know, he is really playing up - rather than celebrating the victory with the Kavanaugh nomination, he's playing up the fight and trying to continue to stoke the anger that rose up as a result of how that process went.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 Well, we are one month out from the midterms. And elections, as you well know, are all about enthusiasm. So what is the outlook for each party in the midterms now that the Kavanaugh fight is over?             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 This is just a moment in time. And there are still those weeks left. And we don't know how this is going to evolve over those weeks. But what we know is that during the fight over the Kavanaugh nomination, Republican enthusiasm spiked. We had an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll that showed that just over a short week-long period, Republicans got much more enthusiastic about the midterms than they had been. Democrats, on the other hand, are fired up. They were fired up. They continue to be fired up. And many Democrats have a lot of frustration over Kavanaugh being confirmed even after those allegations of sexual assault against him.             </p><p>                President Trump, as I said, has really very quickly turned this to be about Democrats being, as he calls them, quote, \"an angry mob.\" Here's what he said yesterday at an International Association of Police Chiefs (ph) meeting.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>DONALD TRUMP:                 False charges, false accusations, horrible statements that were totally untrue that he knew nothing about - frankly, terms that he probably never heard in his life. He was this. He was that. He never even heard of these terms. It was a disgraceful situation brought about by people that are evil.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 So people that are evil...             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 Yeah.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 ...That's pretty strong language. And we can expect to hear more of that type of language in the weeks ahead. One interesting thing - there are four campaign rallies this week that President Trump is holding. And they are going to areas that were once thought to be areas where he might not go, including some suburbs.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 Well, is that risky - because the president is not particularly popular in the suburbs - right? What is he thinking?             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 That's right. And - but there is clearly a decision that's been made here to go to areas that are seen as toss-ups in these congressional races. And it's all about the base, as they say. He's going to rile up the base.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 All about the base. NPR's White House correspondent Tamara Keith, she also hosts the NPR Politics podcast.             </p><p>                Thanks, Tam.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 You're welcome.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                </p><p>NOEL KING:                 All right. We're moving on now to a serious data breach at Google. It happened earlier this year, but Google decided not to tell hundreds of thousands of users that their personal information may have been compromised.             </p><p>DAVID GREENE:                 Yeah. According to a Wall Street Journal report, there was this software glitch in Google Plus. That was Google's unsuccessful answer to Facebook. So this glitch enabled outside developers to collect a user's profile data and also the private data of a user's friends.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 And Google executives decided, for some reason, not to make this problem public. Doug MacMillan is with me in studio. He's one of the reporters who broke this story.             </p><p>                Doug, thanks for coming in.             </p><p>DOUG MACMILLAN:                 Hi. Good morning.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 So how long were users exposed for? And what information might these outside developers have been able to collect on them?             </p><p>DOUG MACMILLAN:                 Yes. So the software bug existed unfixed for more than two years. It began in 2015 and was eventually fixed in March of this year. We believe that it affected personal data that people entered in their Google Plus profile. So that included their name, occupation, things like relationship status, birthdate, gender - straightforward profile information. All of that could have been potentially collected by outside developers.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 But outside developers would not have been able to read my Gmail, for instance.             </p><p>DOUG MACMILLAN:                 Right. It's just this profile information.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 All right. So if this was discovered last spring, the big question is, why did Google executives just go public now? Why didn't they say something about it then?             </p><p>DOUG MACMILLAN:                 That is the big question. And our reporting gets into this. This is a relatively small number of users. They're saying that they think maybe half a million users are affected. The real concern is why they didn't disclose this. They knew, potentially, these users were affected. And they did some digging. They looked into whether or not, you know, developers had misused this data. They found, ultimately, no evidence. So they decided that was a reason not to tell anybody. We don't know if any data was misused, so we have no obligation to tell people.             </p><p>                The real reason that we think, you know, swayed their decision was because they were afraid of how this would look. They were afraid of the PR consequences and potential regulatory scrutiny of what was going on with Facebook in the news and the Cambridge Analytica breach - that basically they would be dragged into that same story if they came out with this.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 So we sort of have to - if you're one of those users whose information was compromised, you sort of have to trust Google when they say, yeah, nothing bad was done with it. There is no law that says, if there's a breach, the company's got to tell consumers?             </p><p>DOUG MACMILLAN:                 There's a patchwork of laws. They're a patchwork of state laws, and there's a new European law that addresses this. The problem is, these laws hinge on whether or not the company knew that data was improperly accessed. In this case, Google is pleading ignorance. They're saying, we don't know. We have no evidence the data was accessed. So we, therefore, have no obligation.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 Google's chief privacy officer, Keith Enright, testified before a Senate panel two weeks ago, and he talked about consumer trust. Let's hear what he had to say.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>KEITH ENRIGHT:                 We acknowledge that we have made mistakes in the past from which we've learned and improved our privacy program. We understand that the foundation of our business is trust.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 Based on your reporting, is that believable?             </p><p>DOUG MACMILLAN:                 I think that they're going to have a lot of work to do to regain user trust. There's a lot of people questioning how Google handled this incident. And I think there are a lot of people generally look at these big tech companies right now who have vast influence over a lot of data in our digital lives. And I think there's a big question about user trust. The law is one thing, but our relationship with these companies and our trust with them is probably a bigger responsibility. In the end, you're going to have to start see them grapple with these issues on a day-to-day basis.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 And we should note that Google has said it is finally disabling Google Plus altogether. Doug MacMillan covers Google for The Wall Street Journal, and he reported this story with fellow Journal reporter Robert McMillan.             </p><p>                Thanks, Doug.             </p><p>DOUG MACMILLAN:                 Thanks.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                </p><p>NOEL KING:                 All right. Until yesterday, the head of Interpol, the international police organization based in France, was a man named Meng Hongwei. He's from China.             </p><p>DAVID GREENE:                 Right. But a few days ago in France, Meng's wife reported that he had gone missing while he was on a visit to his native China. And then yesterday, Meng resurfaced and announced that he was resigning from Interpol, this after apparently being detained by Chinese authorities on charges of corruption.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 NPR's Shanghai correspondent Rob Schmitz has been following this story. He's with us now.             </p><p>                Hi, Rob.             </p><p>ROB SCHMITZ:                 Good morning.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 All right. So what do we know about Meng?             </p><p>ROB SCHMITZ:                 Well, Meng Hongwei is 64 years old. He served as the vice minister of the public security bureau, which is China's national police. In 2016, he became the first Chinese head of Interpol. And his election was a big victory for China's government, which under leader Xi Jinping was eager to use Interpol to locate and extradite Chinese officials that it deemed corrupt, who had escaped China. But as it turns out, Meng himself is now under investigation by Chinese authorities for corruption.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 What exactly are they investigating him for?             </p><p>ROB SCHMITZ:                 Well, China's government hasn't released any details besides that he's under investigation for bribery and other unspecified crimes. And the little we know about how his detention unfolded has come from his wife, Grace Meng. On September 25, the day her husband arrived to China for a visit, she allegedly received a text from him that said, wait for my call, which was followed by an emoji of a knife, suggesting that he was in danger. A week later, she reported him missing to French police. On Sunday, she spoke to reporters in Lyon, France, where Interpol is headquartered. And here's what she said.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>GRACE MENG:                 (Through interpreter) I'm speaking on behalf of my husband, my children, all the people of my motherland - for all the wives' and children's husbands and fathers so that they may no longer disappear.             </p><p>ROB SCHMITZ:                 And as you can hear in that tape, Noel, she's crying during this part of the video, with her back turned to the camera because she's received threats and is under protection by French police.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 Well, when she talks there about the husbands and fathers who've disappeared in China, what does she mean?             </p><p>ROB SCHMITZ:                 Well, she's talking about the government's anti-corruption campaign. It was launched by Xi Jinping immediately after he took office in 2013. And it snared hundreds of thousands of officials, both on the local level as well as among the highest echelons of the party. In fact, the man who appointed Meng Hongwei to vice minister of public security was Zhou Yongkang, the highest-ranking Chinese official who was brought down by this campaign. Zhou was a former member of the Politburo Standing Committee, the group of seven men who ruled China. He was China's security czar before he was sent to prison for life in 2015.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 So by removing Meng from the presidency of Interpol, China is going to lose a lot of sway inside of this organization. That much is clear. What does this mean for Interpol and its relationship with China?             </p><p>ROB SCHMITZ:                 Well, Interpol has announced his resignation and appointed an acting president. But even before this happened, China's use of Interpol under his presidency was starting to raise a lot of red flags. They were using his position to target people that China wanted in jail but that didn't have any evidence of any wrongdoing on their case, and they were vetoed by other members of Interpol. And this case with Meng is a good example of how China's own messy politics is sort of spilling over into international organizations.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 Really interesting. NPR's Rob Schmitz from Shanghai.             </p><p>                Thanks so much, Rob.             </p><p>ROB SCHMITZ:                 Thanks.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF SLUSHII'S \"SAPIENT DREAM\")            </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NPRMED-201810091019</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NPRMED2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TG7-NFW1-DY1J-T04P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429280</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2334\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 National Public Radio (R) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NPR Morning Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 9, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>People's Republic Of China</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Supreme Court</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Elections</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Social Media</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Cyberattacks And Hacking</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Arrests, Arraignments, Detainments &amp;

And elections, as you well know, are all about enthusiasm. So what is the outlook for each party in the midterms now that the Kavanaugh fight is over? </p><p>TAMARA KEITH: This is just a moment in time. And there are still those weeks left. And we don't know how this is going to evolve over those weeks. But what we know is that during the fight over the Kavanaugh nomination, Republican enthusiasm spiked. We had an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll that showed that just over a short week-long period, Republicans got much more enthusiastic about the midterms than they had been. Democrats, on the other hand, are fired up. They were fired up. They continue to be fired up. And many Democrats have a lot of frustration over Kavanaugh being confirmed even after those allegations of sexual assault against him. </p><p>President Trump, as I said, has really very quickly turned this to be about Democrats being, as he calls them, quote, \"an angry mob.\" Here's what he said yesterday at an International Association of Police Chiefs (ph) meeting. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)        </p><p>DONALD TRUMP: False charges, false accusations, horrible statements that were totally untrue that he knew nothing about - frankly, terms that he probably never heard in his life. He was this. He was that. He never even heard of these terms. It was a disgraceful situation brought about by people that are evil. </p><p>TAMARA KEITH: So people that are evil... </p><p>NOEL KING: Yeah. </p><p>TAMARA KEITH: ...That's pretty strong language. And we can expect to hear more of that type of language in the weeks ahead. One interesting thing - there are four campaign rallies this week that President Trump is holding. And they are going to areas that were once thought to be areas where he might not go, including some suburbs. </p><p>NOEL KING: Well, is that risky - because the president is not particularly popular in the suburbs - right? What is he thinking? </p><p>TAMARA KEITH: That's right. And - but there is clearly a decision that's been made here to go to areas that are seen as toss-ups in these congressional races. And it's all about the base, as they say. He's going to rile up the base. </p><p>NOEL KING: All about the base. NPR's White House correspondent Tamara Keith, she also hosts the NPR Politics podcast. </p><p>Thanks, Tam. </p><p>TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)        </p><p>NOEL KING: All right. We're moving on now to a serious data breach at Google. It happened earlier this year, but Google decided not to tell hundreds of thousands of users that their personal information may have been compromised. </p><p>DAVID GREENE: Yeah. According to a Wall Street Journal report, there was this software glitch in Google Plus. That was Google's unsuccessful answer to Facebook. So this glitch enabled outside developers to collect a user's profile data and also the private data of a user's friends. </p><p>NOEL KING: And Google executives decided, for some reason, not to make this problem public. Doug MacMillan is with me in studio. He's one of the reporters who broke this story. </p><p>Doug, thanks for coming in. </p><p>DOUG MACMILLAN: Hi. Good morning. </p><p>NOEL KING: So how long were users exposed for? And what information might these outside developers have been able to collect on them? </p><p>DOUG MACMILLAN: Yes. So the software bug existed unfixed for more than two years. It began in 2015 and was eventually fixed in March of this year. We believe that it affected personal data that people entered in their Google Plus profile. So that included their name, occupation, things like relationship status, birthdate, gender - straightforward profile information. All of that could have been potentially collected by outside developers. </p><p>NOEL KING: But outside developers would not have been able to read my Gmail, for instance. </p><p>DOUG MACMILLAN: Right. It's just this profile information. </p><p>NOEL KING: All right. So if this was discovered last spring, the big question is, why did Google executives just go public now? Why didn't they say something about it then? </p><p>DOUG MACMILLAN: That is the big question. And our reporting gets into this. This is a relatively small number of users. They're saying that they think maybe half a million users are affected. The real concern is why they didn't disclose this. They knew, potentially, these users were affected. And they did some digging. They looked into whether or not, you know, developers had misused this data. They found, ultimately, no evidence. So they decided that was a reason not to tell anybody. We don't know if any data was misused, so we have no obligation to tell people. </p><p>The real reason that we think, you know, swayed their decision was because they were afraid of how this would look. They were afraid of the PR consequences and potential regulatory scrutiny of what was going on with Facebook in the news and the Cambridge Analytica breach - that basically they would be dragged into that same story if they came out with this. </p><p>NOEL KING: So we sort of have to - if you're one of those users whose information was compromised, you sort of have to trust Google when they say, yeah, nothing bad was done with it. There is no law that says, if there's a breach, the company's got to tell consumers? </p><p>DOUG MACMILLAN: There's a patchwork of laws. They're a patchwork of state laws, and there's a new European law that addresses this. The problem is, these laws hinge on whether or not the company knew that data was improperly accessed. In this case, Google is pleading ignorance. They're saying, we don't know. We have no evidence the data was accessed. So we, therefore, have no obligation. </p><p>NOEL KING: Google's chief privacy officer, Keith Enright, testified before a Senate panel two weeks ago, and he talked about consumer trust. Let's hear what he had to say. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)        </p><p>KEITH ENRIGHT: We acknowledge that we have made mistakes in the past from which we've learned and improved our privacy program. We understand that the foundation of our business is trust. </p><p>NOEL KING: Based on your reporting, is that believable? </p><p>DOUG MACMILLAN: I think that they're going to have a lot of work to do to regain user trust. There's a lot of people questioning how Google handled this incident. And I think there are a lot of people generally look at these big tech companies right now who have vast influence over a lot of data in our digital lives. And I think there's a big question about user trust. The law is one thing, but our relationship with these companies and our trust with them is probably a bigger responsibility. In the end, you're going to have to start see them grapple with these issues on a day-to-day basis. </p><p>NOEL KING: And we should note that Google has said it is finally disabling Google Plus altogether. Doug MacMillan covers Google for The Wall Street Journal, and he reported this story with fellow Journal reporter Robert McMillan. </p><p>Thanks, Doug. </p><p>DOUG MACMILLAN: Thanks. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)        </p><p>NOEL KING: All right. Until yesterday, the head of Interpol, the international police organization based in France, was a man named Meng Hongwei. He's from China. </p><p>DAVID GREENE: Right. But a few days ago in France, Meng's wife reported that he had gone missing while he was on a visit to his native China. And then yesterday, Meng resurfaced and announced that he was resigning from Interpol, this after apparently being detained by Chinese authorities on charges of corruption. </p><p>NOEL KING: NPR's Shanghai correspondent Rob Schmitz has been following this story. He's with us now. </p><p>Hi, Rob. </p><p>ROB SCHMITZ: Good morning. </p><p>NOEL KING: All right. So what do we know about Meng? </p><p>ROB SCHMITZ: Well, Meng Hongwei is 64 years old. He served as the vice minister of the public security bureau, which is China's national police. In 2016, he became the first Chinese head of Interpol. And his election was a big victory for China's government, which under leader Xi Jinping was eager to use Interpol to locate and extradite Chinese officials that it deemed corrupt, who had escaped China. But as it turns out, Meng himself is now under investigation by Chinese authorities for corruption. </p><p>NOEL KING: What exactly are they investigating him for? </p><p>ROB SCHMITZ: Well, China's government hasn't released any details besides that he's under investigation for bribery and other unspecified crimes. And the little we know about how his detention unfolded has come from his wife, Grace Meng. On September 25, the day her husband arrived to China for a visit, she allegedly received a text from him that said, wait for my call, which was followed by an emoji of a knife, suggesting that he was in danger. A week later, she reported him missing to French police. On Sunday, she spoke to reporters in Lyon, France, where Interpol is headquartered. And here's what she said. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)        </p><p>GRACE MENG: (Through interpreter) I'm speaking on behalf of my husband, my children, all the people of my motherland - for all the wives' and children's husbands and fathers so that they may no longer disappear. </p><p>ROB SCHMITZ: And as you can hear in that tape, Noel, she's crying during this part of the video, with her back turned to the camera because she's received threats and is under protection by French police. </p><p>NOEL KING: Well, when she talks there about the husbands and fathers who've disappeared in China, what does she mean? </p><p>ROB SCHMITZ: Well, she's talking about the government's anti-corruption campaign. It was launched by Xi Jinping immediately after he took office in 2013. And it snared hundreds of thousands of officials, both on the local level as well as among the highest echelons of the party. In fact, the man who appointed Meng Hongwei to vice minister of public security was Zhou Yongkang, the highest-ranking Chinese official who was brought down by this campaign. Zhou was a former member of the Politburo Standing Committee, the group of seven men who ruled China. He was China's security czar before he was sent to prison for life in 2015. </p><p>NOEL KING: So by removing Meng from the presidency of Interpol, China is going to lose a lot of sway inside of this organization. That much is clear. What does this mean for Interpol and its relationship with China? </p><p>ROB SCHMITZ: Well, Interpol has announced his resignation and appointed an acting president. But even before this happened, China's use of Interpol under his presidency was starting to raise a lot of red flags. They were using his position to target people that China wanted in jail but that didn't have any evidence of any wrongdoing on their case, and they were vetoed by other members of Interpol. And this case with Meng is a good example of how China's own messy politics is sort of spilling over into international organizations. </p><p>NOEL KING: Really interesting. NPR's Rob Schmitz from Shanghai. </p><p>Thanks so much, Rob. </p><p>ROB SCHMITZ: Thanks. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF SLUSHII'S \"SAPIENT DREAM\")          </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NPRMED-201810091018</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NPRMED2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TFK-RV61-DY1J-T1TF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429280</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2036\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 National Public Radio (R) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NPR Morning Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 9, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009TCX</classCode><className>US DEMOCRATIC PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009TD5</classCode><className>US REPUBLICAN PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DNV7</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DF5U</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001932</classCode><className>CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp;

RBS earned \u00c2\u00a31.19 billion (roughly $2 billion), compared with earnings of \u00c2\u00a3393 during the same period a year ago. However, \"RBS warned that costs would likely rise considerably when the bank launches a major restructuring plan in the second half of the year,\" the Wall Street Journal reports. The Financial Times puts a similar spin on RBS's first quarter, pointing out that RBS ran into another hurdle last week when the agency that manages the British government's stake in the bank opposed its proposal to hike bonus caps to 200% of salary. This refusal put a wrinkle in RBS's attempts to reinvent itself as a \"smaller, simpler and smarter bank,\" according to the New York Times, and will hurt recruitment and retention since RBS's competitors can offer employees more attractive bonuses.</p><p>Banks and credit card companies worried about Silicon Valley's attempts to edge onto their turf can cling to a nugget of hope offered by venture capitalist Dave McClure at a Milken Institute conference. It's true that consumers already hooked on Google, Apple and Amazon might be willing to ditch banks for the tech giants' payment services, McClure says, but the regulatory costs associated with the payment industry may yet keep big tech at bay.</p><p>People are more willing to put their retirement savings into stocks than they have been since the financial crisis decimated many Americans' nest eggs. \"Stocks accounted for 67% of employees' new contributions into retirement portfolios in March,\" the paper reports. That is the highest percentage for stock investment since March 2008. Fading memories of the market downturn is one factor behind savers' renewed faith, the paper suggests.</p><p>MasterCard's brisk business may stumble because of sanctions against Russia. The company's profits climbed to $870 million in the first quarter, a 14% increase from the same period a year ago. But the Journal coverage foregrounds MasterCard's Russian headache. The country is likely to \"change its domestic-payments market structure\" in response to Western sanctions. MasterCard CEO Ajay Banga told analysts, \"What we have in place today does not, I believe, meet all of the new Russian requirements.\" MasterCard says the changes will have a small effect on its 2014 earnings; the long-term impact is difficult to predict.</p><p>Bank of America takes another knock for the accounting error that caused it to misreport its capital levels during a recent stress test, this one courtesy of the FT's Tracy Alloway. Alloway points out that high-frequency trading firm Virtu Finanical and specialty finance company Springleaf Financial also recently discovered inaccuracies in their financial statements. The problem lies in part with the absurd complexity of some financial products, she says. \"If the institutions which create these products cannot correctly assess their value, then what hope is there for the rest of us? The risks to the banks of inaccurate accountancy treatment may be measured in varying levels of institutional embarrassment - the risks to investors carry a much more tangible cost.\"</p><p>As a matter of fact, BofA's top shareholders are pretty put out by this latest fiasco, the paper reports. Shareholders at Citi, which flunked its stress test, are displeased too. A top 10 BofA shareholder, who sought anonymity, told the paper, \"Shareholders and investors can only take so much of these repeated headlines - of this sort or legal and regulatory colour - that's why the frustration level is increasing. There are other stocks that have exposure to the US recovery, with more transparency and less trouble.\"</p><p>Financial Times editor Lionel Barber suggests that bankers take a hard look in the mirror and clean up their act. Bankers \"must reconnect to the community,\" he said in a speech at the University of Cambridge. \"The alternative may not be a living hell, but it will be a prolonged spell in purgatory.\"</p><p>The U.S. bank loan market is getting stopped up because issued loans are taking too long to settle. \"The settlement backlog has built up as investors have poured money into the loans market in expectation of rising interest rates. They have now begun pulling money out, and concerns are growing that any rise in loan fund redemptions could make it harder for investment managers to return cash to investors.\"</p><p>Lloyd Blankfein takes pride in being one of the last CEOs left standing from the financial crisis, according to a report in Dealbook. The Goldman Sachs head recalled a dinner with fellow survivors JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and Standard Chartered head Peter Sands at a recent charity event; a group of eavesdropping reporters were standing nearby. \"If you look in the books - if you go check,\" Blankfein said, \"who are still in their C.E.O. jobs from before the crisis?\" Wonder how Blankfein would fare on Survivor.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNKR-0001067262</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMBNKR2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5C41-CD31-F06X-W49X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"835\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

MANSUETO, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, MORNINGSTAR, INC.: Hey, why don't we go ahead and get started? Good morning, everyone. It's great to see everybody. I'm Joe Mansueto, Chairman of the Board of Morningstar. That's me. And it's my pleasure to call the meeting to order.</p><p>It's great to see everybody here. We especially are thankful of you who allocate so much time to the meeting. I know many of you've traveled across the country to be with us. And we really always enjoy seeing you in person, our shareholders, analysts, getting your feedback, taking your questions and giving you an update on our business.</p><p>Like the last few years, we're also streaming this meeting live. So if you're tuning in over the live stream, welcome to you as well.</p><p>So our meeting today has 3 parts. 4, if we include the break. First is the business of the annual meeting, which will not take very long. Secondly, we've got 4 management presentations, which I think you'll really enjoy and find very informative. And I'll tell you more about those in a moment. Then we'll take a short break and come back for the Q&amp;A session. And this is really an important part of the meeting.</p><p>As you know, this is the one opportunity you have to ask us questions live, the management team, about what's going on at the business. Beyond that, we say, if you have a question, please put it in writing and we take all of those questions, we answer them every month, post the answers on our website, file an 8-K. And we view you as our partners. And so we really want to make sure that we answer your questions and keep you informed about our business.</p><p>So if you have questions, I would really encourage you to take advantage of one of those 2 avenues: either come to the meeting, ask questions or send in a question, and we will get that answered.</p><p>So let's get started. You should have received a copy of the agenda and rules of procedure. If you did not receive copies, please raise your hand and we'll bring copies to you. There are 2 items of business on our agenda today. It's pretty straightforward. We need to elect our directors and ratify the appointment of KPMG as our independent auditors for this year.</p><p>Before we get started though, I'd like to introduce our directors, all of whom are in attendance. As I call your name, if you could stand and face the audience. Robin Diamonte, Cheryl Francis, Steve Kaplan, Kunal Kapoor, Gail Landis, Bill Lyons, Jack Noonan, Caroline Tsay and Hugh Zentmyer.</p><p>We have a very strong and independent board, and I want to thank each of you for all of your valuable counsel and guidance to Morningstar throughout the year.</p><p>Next, I'd like introduce our executive officers: Kunal Kapoor, our Chief Executive Officer; Bevin Desmond, our Head of Talent and Culture; Jason Dubinsky, our Chief Financial Officer; Danny Dunn, our Chief Revenue Officer; Haywood Kelly, Head of Research; Pat Maloney, our General Counsel; Daniel Needham, Head of Investment Management; and Tricia Rothschild, our Chief Product Officer. Thank you, all. You're a great team, and thanks for all your hard work during the year.</p><p>Now I'd like to take this opportunity to introduce Kurt Gabouer with KPMG, our auditors for 2018. Kurt, would you or any of your colleagues like to make a comment at this time?</p><p>KURT GABOUER: Joe, no prepared remarks, but we'd be happy to answer any questions that you may have.</p><p>JOSEPH D. MANSUETO: Any questions for Kurt? Thanks, Kurt. We've been public 13 years, no one has asked -- ever asked a question of our auditors. Maybe one day, Kurt, we'll get a question for you.</p><p>Okay. Now I'd like to get started with the official business of the meeting. Greg Malatia, a representative of Broadridge Financial Services, is here as the Inspector of Elections. Heidi Miller, our Corporate Secretary will now report on the voting of the mailing of the notice of the meeting and the number of shares represented at today's meeting.</p><p>HEIDI T. MILLER, ASSOCIATE GENERAL COUNSEL AND CORPORATE SECRETARY, MORNINGSTAR, INC.: We are holding this meeting pursuant to a notice mailed on April 6 to each shareholder of record on March 19. A certified copy of the list of shareholders of record has been available at our office for the last 10 days. I'd like to report that we've established a quorum for the conduct of business at the meeting.</p><p>JOSEPH D. MANSUETO: Thanks, Heidi. Okay. As I mentioned, the first item of business today is the election of our directors. We'll elect 10 directors at today's meeting. The directors elected today will hold office until the 2019 Annual Shareholder Meeting or until their successors, if any, are elected or appointed.</p><p>The nominees for director are: Robin Diamonte; Cheryl Francis; Steve Kaplan; Kunal Kapoor; Gail Landis; Bill Lyons; Jack Noonan; Caroline Tsay; Hugh Zentmyer; and myself, Joe Mansueto.</p><p>The second item of business is the ratification of the appointment of KPMG as our independent auditors for 2018. The board recommends a vote for each of these proposals. I now declare that the polls are open. If you would like a ballot, please raise your hand and one will be brought to you. Anyone need a ballot? Please remember that if you've already sent in your proxy or voted by Internet or telephone, your shares have been voted accordingly. You did not need to vote today unless you are voting for the first time or you wish to change your vote.</p><p>(Voting)</p><p>JOSEPH D. MANSUETO: If anyone has a question related to any of the proposals, please raise your hand and we'd be happy to address that. There is also a Q&amp;A session later in the meeting for other questions. But if there's any questions related to these 2 proposals, we're happy to take those at this time.</p><p>I don't see any hands. So I now declare that the polls are closed. Heidi, do you want to report on the voting results?</p><p>HEIDI T. MILLER: Sure. More than a majority of the shares represented in person or by proxy and entitled to vote at this meeting has been voted for each of the director nominees listed in the proxy statement and to ratify the appointment of KPMG. We will file an 8-K with more detailed voting results within the next 4 days.</p><p>JOSEPH D. MANSUETO: Thank you, Heidi. So that concludes the official business of the meeting. See, I told you it wouldn't take long. And now we're going to move on to the management presentations.</p><p>As I mentioned, we have 4 management presentations. I think you'll enjoy these. First, Kunal Kapoor, our CEO, will start by talking about recent company highlights, mission strategy and our 5 key investment areas. And then Jason Dubinsky, our Chief Financial Officer, will talk about our financial results. And then one of the things we try and do at this meeting is rotate through different parts of our business, expose you to different members of our senior leadership team. You may remember -- if you were here last year, you may remember Tricia Rothschild, our Chief Product Officer, presented.</p><p>This year, we have 2 of our senior leaders presenting. Daniel Needham. Daniel is Head of our Investment Management business, and he'll be talking about his business. Daniel is a terrific investor. He comes from Sydney. You'll notice it that he is Australian by his accent. Terrific guy. I think you'll enjoy getting to know Daniel, learning about managed portfolios and the strategy for our Investment Management business.</p><p>Next, we have John Gabbert. John is the Founder and Leader of PitchBook. This is a company we purchased about 1.5 years ago and has been doing fabulously. John is one of the most outstanding entrepreneurs I've ever met. He's taken PitchBook from an idea in his head to an organization today that employs over 500 people based in Seattle and has certainly created the premier private company database. I think you'll enjoy listening to John and learning more about PitchBook, which has been a key driver of our results.</p><p>I mentioned, afterwards we're going to take a short break. We'll come back for the Q&amp;A session. By the way, if you do have a question and you're watching via the live stream, you can send in a question to this address, morningstar.socialqa.com.</p><p>I suppose if you're in the audience and you don't want to raise your hand. You could also send in a question that way. And so again, we encourage and really welcome your questions. So please take advantage of that.</p><p>And so now I'd like to introduce Kunal Kapoor, the first of the management presentations. Kunal, as you may know, has been CEO a relatively short time, about 1.5 years, but he is doing a terrific job. You can see by our results. Organic growth rates have ticked up. Profitability is up. We're making great progress on our key initiatives, and he is off to a flying start. But you know, even though he is relatively new to the CEO role, he is a Morningstar veteran. He's worked here 21 years. He started in '97. He's worked in most parts of our organization at one time or another, excelled in all of those roles. And therefore, he's got a very in-depth and comprehensive knowledge at Morningstar. He is an avid investor himself. He is highly engaged and just a terrific leader for the company.</p><p>So I'm going to call him up and I'm going to play a short video as he comes up that I think you'll enjoy.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>JOSEPH D. MANSUETO: Kunal Kapoor.</p><p>KUNAL KAPOOR, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, MORNINGSTAR, INC.: I feel such a pride whenever I see that video. It's such a nice video. Welcome everybody. I want to join Joe in welcoming you to our annual meeting. It's great to have you here, and I want to thank many of you who make the trip out to Chicago. I know many of you have been doing it year-in and year-out, and we really do love having you here.</p><p>I also just want to start by also joining Joe and just acknowledging the great work done by our leadership team. We have a fantastic culture here at Morningstar, but it starts with all the folks who are largely scattered up here. And all the good results that you've been experiencing over the past year are in large part due to their efforts, so thank you all for all of that. And again, welcome.</p><p>Before I kick off my presentation, I want to take a second here just to put up our safe harbor statement. So if you don't mind taking a moment to read it, we will then kick off the presentation.</p><p>No presentation at Morningstar begins without our mission statement. We are at our core a very mission-driven company. And I hope this morning, if you had a chance to stop by the kiosks, you noticed that right at the center, we had our talent and culture kiosk. We really are focused here on doing the right thing for investors.</p><p>I can remember in my 20 years plus at Morningstar that there have been many times when people have questioned whether you can build a successful business while continuing to do things by putting the investor first. I think we live in a time today globally pretty much in all the markets that we operate in, where there is no doubt as to what the answer to that question is. The answer simply is, you can't build a business anymore if you don't put the investor first. And so we're so glad that we've always done this. It's at the core of what we do, and it continues to be the true north that we at Morningstar have ourselves and one that we share with many of the clients that we serve.</p><p>And as I said, it's led to spectacular growth over time. We're mission-driven company, but we're also entrepreneurial. We believe in financial success. And so we think that while the chapters that we've written for Morningstar thus far, actually, Morningstar turned 34 this week, have been quite wonderful, that the path ahead is also going to be quite dynamic and exciting.</p><p>And in fact, if I look back on the last year here at Morningstar, we've had a really busy year with a lot of wonderful achievements during the year. And we'll be spending some time today talking about a lot of those achievements. But if I had to call out a few things that I think are of particular interest to us and I think would be of interest to you as well, we've been expanding our efforts in ESG. You've been hearing a lot about that from us, and we really see this as a big opportunity.</p><p>PitchBook launched a new platform midway through the year. And the interesting thing about that, that I'd like to point out is we got very few client complaints, which is a great thing and it just shows how wonderfully the platform was transferred over. When you make such big switches, they're not easy, and if anything, the NPS scores have gone up even further. We're starting to explore, taking our retirement business and bringing it closer to the financial adviser who we serve so successfully as financial advisers get more and more involved in the retirement business. And I invite you, if you haven't already, to take a look at Morningstar Plan Advantage, which we are showcasing out here and which will be available for you to view during the break as well.</p><p>So lots of good and exciting things going on at Morningstar. I fear whenever I do one of these slides that I'm going to get an e-mail afterwards saying, hey, you didn't highlight what I was working on. So apologies to my colleagues if I have skipped something. But hopefully, I just want to give you a flavor of all the good things that we have going on here.</p><p>It begins, of course, with research, technology and design. In the past couple of years, the word FinTech has particularly started to catch on. You can't go anywhere these days without hearing the word FinTech. And often, FinTechs are talking about technology and design and in some instances, research being core to what they want to do or what they are. And I like to point out that if that's the case, then Morningstar is the original FinTech. And the way we've built our moat is very much around these capabilities.</p><p>So if you think about just the research side of the house and what we're doing, every year, we try to give you a flavor of how we're investing in this part of our business. And hopefully, you notice that every year, we keep adding more and more to what we're doing here.</p><p>Just to give you a quick sense of things, we're really beginning to invest, for example, in Collective Investment Trust and Separate Account databases. And you might wonder why you're doing that. Well, increasingly in the investment world, we see a future where investors and asset managers are vehicle agnostic. They want to take a strategy and deliver it through multiple channels. Morningstar is going to be in a position to allow an investor to do that type of analysis both within our software and our data because we're building out capabilities like that.</p><p>You're going to hear from John Gabbert later on about what we're doing within PitchBook, where not only are we building out our private equity database, you can see we've got more than 900,000 private equities, but we are taking our public equities data, which has been an underutilized asset at Morningstar up to this point and putting it into PitchBook.</p><p>So lots of exciting things going on. Maybe on the previous slide, you recall HSAs there. Morningstar is starting to work on the HSA front, too, as more and more Americans begin to use the HSA as a savings vehicle. So we're starting to think about how do we help investors with that part of their financial life as well.</p><p>So there is a lot of opportunities. We remain focused on the key segments that we want to serve, and we're excited about what our research does to widen our moat every year.</p><p>Our technology coverage is also pretty vast. Sometimes, I bristle a little bit when folks think about Morningstar purely from the lens of being a mutual fund data and ratings firm. It's super important to us. We're really good at doing that, and we plan to continue to be really good at doing that. But we're increasingly doing things at a really big scale in many, many other parts of our business. And our technology organization is a fantastic reflection of the scale that we're increasingly starting to see. And this is a theme that you're going to keep hearing through the presentations today. How do we scale Morningstar to being a business that's larger than $1 billion and beyond in the years ahead? And our technology infrastructure and the things we're doing on that front are a big part of our future.</p><p>And there's design. Even the wonderful auditorium you're sitting in, it's a part of our DNA. And we take design very, very seriously at Morningstar because part of what we want to do is bring complex concepts to life in a way that investors can understand the concepts that we're trying to get across to them and in a way that makes them uniquely Morningstar. So whether it's something that you're familiar with like the Style Box or some of the things that we're working on, say, with our risk model, you'll see that there is a unique design element. And David Williams and his team continue to do fantastic job for us.</p><p>One of the things that I want to highlight here with the video I'm going to show you here in 2 seconds is really that we're trying to take different artifacts from our design engine and slowly build different components so that regardless of where you live in a Morningstar product or solution, the look and feel of it continues to be very, very familiar.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>KUNAL KAPOOR: There it is indeed. It's such an important part of what we do, and it's something that we at Morningstar really believe is the core of the value that we offer to investors.</p><p>So of course, we have our core strength and we operate in an industry that's forever changing. I imagine some of these themes around the industry landscape look very, very familiar to you. Across-the-board, we see declining fees, we see the rise of the best interest advice and we see digitization sweeping the financial services industry. All of these are opportunities and challenges for Morningstar and just about any organization today.</p><p>Our goal, as you listen to the presentations today, is to leave you with a strong sense of how we're approaching all 3. For instance, while it's true that declining fees do hurt many of our asset management clients, it's also the case that many of them are looking to consolidate the partners they work with or they're looking to do new things on the indexing front, or perhaps if you're a financial adviser looking to lower your costs, maybe you're starting to outsource portfolios or maybe you're starting to look at the private markets. So we're finding that even in a declining fee environment, there is lots of things that people are coming to Morningstar for and we continue to work at that.</p><p>In terms of best interest advice, one of the reasons Morningstar did as well as it did last year is because around the world, there was a big movement to ensure that financial advisers act in the best interest of their clients. And regardless of whether regulation goes one way or the other, it's been our belief that the market is going to move in that direction. And so many of the tools that we're building these days are essentially there to help financial advisers ensure that they can document and provide best interest advice regardless of what the headline regulations may be. That's how they're going to win.</p><p>And then there is digitization. There is more sophistication in the way advisers, for instance, and their clients want to interact with each other. There is more sophistication in the way asset managers want to use our information, and we're responding most recently with the launch of Morningstar Office, which is our high-end offering for financial advisers, which has basically got all our advice capabilities, including aggregation, which we purchased via our ByAllAccounts acquisition a few years ago.</p><p>So lots of good things going on, on this front, but I think for us it means that there are more and more opportunities that we have a chance to take advantage of.</p><p>We like to put this information up every year as well just to give you a sense of the 2 areas that we're focusing our business on and how they're growing. I also just like to remind everybody that regardless of the growth in both decision support and outsourced investment management, we remain today a fairly small piece of the pie.</p><p>So as you think about how we're thinking about our future and the markets that we address, one of the reasons we're optimistic is because the end markets that we address are so much larger than what Morningstar is today. And many of the competitors that we increasingly find ourselves taking share from are also larger. And so this is an exciting development for us, and I think it portends very well for our future.</p><p>It's also the outgrowth and the base through which we've developed our strategy. This, as well, should look very familiar to you. And perhaps the only difference in the last 3, 4 years in the way we've presented this to you is that with the acquisition of PitchBook, we now think of PitchBook as well as one of our key platforms for that institutional investor, and we're certainly seeing terrific growth on that side of the house.</p><p>These are our key investment areas. I think many of you who've been Morningstar shareholders for many years have come to know them well. We've added PitchBook as a stand-alone investment area because it's certainly a larger and growing part of our business, and we want to draw attention to it, so you can better understand what it is we hope to achieve with PitchBook.</p><p>I'm going to go through these each relatively quickly, and then I'm happy to answer more questions in the Q&amp;A. But both Daniel and John will spend some time, as Joe said, particularly on managed portfolios and PitchBook.</p><p>Our largest business at Morningstar is Morningstar Data. I showed you the earlier slide around our research capabilities. In many ways, that is what underpins the power of our data. I've often heard folks say that data can be a commodity. And my response is that, you only believe that if you don't actually understand data.</p><p>Data is about quality. It's about timeliness. It's about depth. It's about breadth and facets like that. And we think we do it as well as anybody. And the amount we invest in data year-in and year-out is a key part of how we think about growing our business.</p><p>Most recently, we're particularly excited about the fact that we think our indexes business is beginning to reach a certain scale where it can really start to continue to grow in a meaningful way.</p><p>Last year, we talked to you about our open indexes initiative, where we basically are making our indexes, our beta indexes, available at no cost for benchmarking purposes for asset managers. And we're making these indexes also available at a minimal cost for the purposes of product creation.</p><p>Most recently, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Company announced that they're going to be using our indexes for the launch of some new ETFs.</p><p>On the innovation side, that's really where we see the larger financial opportunity, and that's where we marry together our index creation capability with our research capability to come up with unique strategic data indexes that we then think we can monetize through products.</p><p>I think many of you are most familiar with our moat series of indexes. There is a domestic moat and an international moat, both continue to do well. And we have made that available in more markets globally that we operate in over the past couple of years with our partner, VanEck. So I think the indexes business is one you will continue to hear a lot about. And Sanjay Arya and his team do a really nice job with this business.</p><p>ESG is the other piece on the data side that I would like to highlight today. I think there is a lot of debate often in the press around whether ESG is real or not. And our belief is that it's real, that it's different from socially responsible investing. But we also believe that it's going to take a little while before the financial opportunity plays out.</p><p>What we do know for certain though is that there is a massive wealth transfer taking place in most developed economies around the globe. And as that wealth transfer is taking place, the data shows that the folks inheriting the wealth are far more likely to care about ESG than the people that they have inherited that wealth from.</p><p>You're also seeing a massive shift in institutions, particularly in the U.S., beginning to adopt ESG at a much faster pace than what used to be the case. ESG was a European phenomenon for the most part. No longer is that case. And so with our partner, Sustainanalytics, which Morningstar owns 40% of, we have continued to push on, on this front, and we're seeing really big adoption. And what we are particularly focused on is educating advisers on how to help their clients understand this and how to talk to clients about this. We see that as the biggest gating factor today is that most advisers, while well intentioned, still don't know how to talk about ESG with their clients.</p><p>Then comes Morningstar Direct, which is run by Dermot O'Mahony and his team. And Direct is one of our favorites. Year-in and year-out, a good performer for Morningstar, and we love it because we take everything we have and we put it in one platform and we make it available globally. So whether you're sitting in Hong Kong or Mumbai or Dubai or Milan, Toronto or Chicago, you're looking at the same platform and you're able to get all of what we built into it. And it's continued to grow very nicely for us. We like to talk about the fact that this is a market that will continue to expand, and we see many, many opportunities. And most recently, we've been focused on trying to take advantage of situations where some of our clients have wanted to consolidate the partners that they work with. As well, we are trying to increasingly concentrate on the wealth management space, most recently highlighted by the fact that we've launched Direct for wealth management which, quite simply, you can think of as a platform for higher-end financial advisers, who continue to want to do a lot of the research themselves, quite different from the business that Daniel oversees and is going to talk about.</p><p>We've also got PitchBook now in the Morningstar family. And in case, you haven't noticed, it's been growing quite nicely, doing really, really well. Obviously, many of you had questions last year at this meeting about our plans for PitchBook. And so we've put John on the hot seat this year, and he'll talk you through what's driving that growth. But it's an exciting story, and we see the runway for PitchBook to be very, very significant.</p><p>I think back to the time when John and I were meeting once, and it was a board meeting at PitchBook back when it was still private. And I remember looking at the audiences we were trying to serve at that time and we didn't even think that corporate clients were going to be a big part at that time. It was sort of there on the sheet, but not an area of focus.</p><p>Today, if you think about most -- even corporate clients, almost every company is thinking about the venture capital space and at least keeping an eye on all the firms that might be competing with them. And so that in and of itself has opened up an entirely new group of users that we could be serving. And so I think the opportunity for PitchBook is only just beginning to emerge. John will get into this in a little bit more detail, but we are starting to take our fundamental equity data capability and feed it into PitchBook with the intent that over time, PitchBook becomes a platform for the buy side where both private and public equities live side-by-side.</p><p>And many of you attending here are already in the portfolios you oversee beginning to mix in some private equity to the extent that it's allowed. We think that that's going to continue. We're hearing from more and more high-end advisers that they're starting to dabble in private equity and want it included in portfolios. And the reality is many, many companies that once would have come public at the size they are, think Uber, think Lyft, are now choosing to stay private a lot longer. And so having the premier database on the private side, I believe, puts Morningstar in a very, very strong position to be able to tell that story through the PitchBook platform.</p><p>And then there's Morningstar Managed Portfolios. We refocus this part of our business, our investment management business, on financial advisers, and the results are really starting to pay off. This is a secular growth story. It's a terrific opportunity for Morningstar. And we find that in most markets globally where there is an independent financial adviser network, we have a terrific opportunity to bring Morningstar Managed Portfolios to them.</p><p>So while this remains a business that's largely U.S.-focused, today you'll see that much of the growth is also starting to come now from outside the U.S. And Daniel and his team have built an investment management capability that is global in nature, so as the opportunities emerge, we're ready to serve that opportunity and take advantage of it.</p><p>Just a quick slide highlighting that mix I was talking about, where the business still largely remains U.S.-focused, but you can see that the growth is beginning to accelerate elsewhere as well.</p><p>Our Workplace Solutions business is one that's, I think, near and dear to many at Morningstar because we feel like from a mission perspective, it's exactly where we want to be. We have a real retirement crisis in the U.S., and we feel like we have a fantastic solution to offer investors. And while the term robo-advice has become quite chic these days, I'd like to point out that our robo-adviser is actually quite large relative to many of the robo-advisers that get a lot of the press. And we're very proud of the research backing and the fundamental research that drive our retirement offering here.</p><p>If you notice in our results, too, we have 2 other pieces that are part of our retirement -- 2 other significant pieces today that are part of our retirement offering, custom models and fiduciary services. Those continue to grow as well. And I would just add that we have a CIT that is coming up on a 3-year record in June that we're very excited about. It's incredibly important. Many of you know to have a 3-year track record when you have a CIT to kind of get past the consultant gatekeepers. And so we're hoping that the 3-year record will allow us to do that.</p><p>And finally, I referenced Morningstar Plan Advantage, which is an offering that we're rolling out for advisers who want to participate in the retirement space. I think you'll be hearing a lot more about that from us in the years to come as we try to build that capability out.</p><p>I think one of the underappreciated assets of our retirement business is the pipes and plumbing that this business has and the connections it has to many of the record keepers and the value that, that brings us in that retirement ecosystem.</p><p>Finally, Morningstar Credit Ratings. This is a business run by Brian Grow, who reports into Haywood. Brian just took over this business earlier this year. He is doing a terrific job. I think the part I want to leave you with here most importantly is that when I stood up here last year and talked to you about this, we talked a lot about the importance of continuing to diversify this business, and we have continued to do that. And you'll see from the statistics that over time, the shift is starting to take place where this business is not necessarily dependent to the degree it used to be on just one asset class. And in the past year, in particular, we've had a lot of success in the asset-backed security space, having some really good market share and providing some really good research there. It's really been a sign of the type of thing that we can do as we continue to grow in this business.</p><p>The final note I want to end on is that at the end of the day, Morningstar is a special place that it is because of the talent and the culture that Bevin and her team ensure persists at Morningstar. Joe built a very special place. And one of the key things that I focus on is to make sure it stays that way.</p><p>I spent a lot of time thinking about it. I can tell you, our senior leaders spent a lot of time thinking about it. And I'm often asked the question, what is the one thing that keeps you up at night? And my answer invariably is that it's about talent and ensuring that the next person who comes into Morningstar -- we have almost 5,000 people now -- that the next person who comes into Morningstar understands what it takes to make us special and the importance of acting in that ethical investor-first way that we hold in such high esteem. And so all of us in the senior team are really committed to this, and you'll be surprised at the amount of time that we all take to participate in interviews, including for those who are coming out of college, our Morningstar development program, our all the senior team participates in those interviews. Joe used to do it, too, when he was running the company. And we're just trying to make sure that we're all involved to make sure that culture stays and persists in the way that we so desire, so we can continue to do as well as we have because we certainly are in an environment where people can pick where they want to go to work and having a great workplace is an important way that you can get people to come and work here.</p><p>Whenever I talk about slides like this, I'm reminded of a quote of Warren Buffett's that I very much appreciate, which is that, Warren says that he likes to invest in easy-to-understand businesses with growth -- with good growth prospects that are run by ethical competent people. And in many ways, that maybe an oversimplification, but I think that's something that we really try to aspire to with the things that we try to do at Morningstar.</p><p>So I'm going to now pass it over to my partner, Jason Dubinsky, our new CFO. This is Jason's first visit to our Annual Shareholder Meeting. And Jason and I actually met for the first time last year prior to our Annual Shareholder Meeting. And we actually just met here on the eighth floor and it was the process we were going through to select our CFO. And I very quickly knew that Jason had all the skills that we were looking for and subsequent interviews with other senior members of our team confirmed that as well. But then we spent 3, 4 months from the time when we first started talking to each other to when Jason joined Morningstar just getting to know each other and figuring out how we would work with each other, what our philosophy was. And we spent that much time on it because when we add senior folks, whether it's Jason or Danny, a big part of it is about ensuring that we have the trust to work well together and we're all on the same page in terms of how we're going to drive this business forward. So I'm really thrilled that Jason has come onboard, and he is exactly doing that, exceeding our expectations in many ways. And I hope, too, that it's a sign to you that as we add talented folks to our team from the outside like Jason or Danny or John Gabbert joining management team, it's a sign to you that we are really thinking about how Morningstar can thrive even as a larger business.</p><p>So we have a lot of good people here at Morningstar who, like me, have built their careers here, but we want to be thoughtful of making sure that we complement that with the right skill sets of folks who can bring additional perspective as long as they're comfortable in thriving in our culture, and Jason has done just that.</p><p>So please join me in welcoming to his first shareholder meeting, Jason Dubinsky.</p><p>JASON M. DUBINSKY, CFO, MORNINGSTAR, INC.: Thank you. Well, good morning, everyone. This is my first shareholder meeting, and it's great to be here in front of all of you. It was actually great to meet many of you for the first time outside before the meeting, and I look forward to maintaining and sustaining long relationships with our shareholders and most of you here.</p><p>Kunal, thank you for the kind opening remarks. And I could say that Kunal and his vision and his leadership were a big reason why I joined the company and spending time with him ahead of joining here was important for me in establishing an important decision that I was going to make in my career, and I'm proud to be part of Morningstar and part of an incredible leadership team here.</p><p>And I'm relatively new here, both by leadership team and by Morningstar standards, but I thought I'd share some of the reasons why I joined Morningstar aside from my remarks about Kunal and his strong leadership. We have an incredible brand here and purpose-driven mission that resonated with me and continues to resonate and is powerful in the marketplace for our clients and customers and investors.</p><p>Kunal mentioned talent and culture, which is really important and differentiating here and, I think, very much is a competitive advantage for us vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis our competition in the marketplace and other -- others in the market when we're searching and trying to retain talent.</p><p>And then finally, I strongly believe we have a great strategy and a wealth of opportunities ahead of us to continue to drive the business forward, grow and create sustainable shareholder value, which I'll talk about in some of my presentation.</p><p>So I'll cover a few things today. I'll go through a bit of our financial results, talk about capital allocation and close with some final thoughts on value creation.</p><p>So many of you who are long-time shareholders at Morningstar hopefully are familiar with our core values. But for me as CFO, it's fantastic that we've got financial success rooted in our core values here at Morningstar and something that I'm very focused on.</p><p>And here's how we can -- -- we define it, and you can read this, but I'll offer a kind of a little bit different perspective on it. And I view financial success for us as very much a win-win. Meaning, if we can stay true to our mission and purpose, continue to innovate and deliver great products to investors in the marketplace in a responsible way, we have the opportunity to grow in a sustainable way and create shareholder value.</p><p>And for any company, it's critical to make sure you've got a strong foundation of financial success to set yourself up for future growth and profitability. And we've got tremendous pillars here and a very strong foundation to continue to grow from.</p><p>I mentioned the first 3 as the reason why I joined Morningstar and our strategy and competitive position and the economic moat that we've created. Our unique culture and talent that's differentiating, and our brand and mission. But focusing a bit more on the bottom row, we've got incredible products and intellectual property here. It's the core data, research, technology, design that Kunal was mentioning. It's the pipeline that we've got and the innovations that we continue to bring to market to serve diverse constituents across the globe.</p><p>We've got a diverse business across products and geography that's scalable, that provides inherent operating leverage in our ability to grow the business and generate profit.</p><p>And finally, we have an incredibly strong balance sheet and create sustainable cash flow generation, which provides us with significant financial flexibility to continue to make the right capital allocations decisions for the future.</p><p>So I thought we'd focus a bit on historical operating performance. And this chart shows the difference between our revenue growth on a reported basis over the past 5 years as well as our operating income growth. And by any measures, looking at this chart, you can see that we've had some mixed performance over the past few years. And there are stories to each year, including some of the investments that we've made in the business that were strategic to drive growth, and you can see where we ended up in 2017. But I would tell you that me and Kunal and our leadership team is very focused on getting back to a pattern of a more sustainable growth over the long term in both revenue and operating income.</p><p>And we do get a lot of questions on our operating margin and these are the results on the chart that you saw before. And I tell you that I think our operating margin generally has been in a relatively tight band over the past 5 years. 2014 was impacted by a litigation settlement. So if we adjust for that, we're close to about 22% operating margin. And then last year, if we strip out the impact of an impairment charge we took in the fourth quarter as well as the impact of PitchBook in its first year, our margins were closer to 21%. So I do believe that over time, we do have opportunity to continue to increase our margin in a responsible way. But I would say that we are going to continue to make the right trade-offs in the short term and the long term to invest in the business to drive long-term growth and return.</p><p>So I joined at the end of last year. And by many measures, 2017 was a very successful year, getting the business back on solid footing and creating strong momentum across products and geography. So we topped over $900 million revenue. We grew the business at over 14%. And then on the cash flow side, we are up close to 22%, close to a record year in the free cash flow, showing that growth in excess of revenue as our performance improved and our cash flow generation and conversion improved as well.</p><p>I'll get into operating margin -- operating income in a bit because there's a bit of a story there. But overall, very strong performance in 2007 -- 2017.</p><p>So we look at the business in a little bit of a different way, too, to unpack some of that performance, in organic revenue and adjusted operating income. So organic revenue strips out the impact of currency as well as M&amp;A. And adjusted operating income last year stripped out the impact of PitchBook.</p><p>So organic revenue last year was about 7.6%, and we saw a good growth across product lines and revenue categories. And our adjusted operating income was down 1.1%. If you adjust for that impairment charge, as I mentioned before, it was up closer to 1.2% versus the negative 1.1%.</p><p>But I think for me, the important takeaway from last year, we have to look at it on an annual basis, but you saw the momentum that was building in the business as we progress throughout the year, especially in the back half of the year where our strong sales performance in the first half translated into strong performance in our license business, and we saw positive performance in our transactional revenues as well to help generate growth and provide good momentum heading into this year, which is exactly what we've seen.</p><p>So for those of you that looked at our first quarter, we had very strong performance across-the-board. It was a very positive quarter, broad-based growth across products, across geography. 16% revenue growth, closer to 14% on an organic basis. We grew operating margins almost 600 basis points, and you see 67% operating income growth and our free cash flow momentum continued. And while it's only one quarter, we're very pleased with the performance and actually shows the potential of the business when things are all moving in the right direction and the inherent operating leverage that we can create when we can drive revenue significantly in excess of our expenses.</p><p>So we did mention in our earnings release that there were some factors in the fourth -- in the first quarter, which will impact the shape of the year, namely, the timing of advertising and marketing expenses, how we've been capitalizing software and what we were lapping from last year, as well as certain items in salary and compensation expense. We're very pleased with the start of the year, but we're also focused on delivering a strong year in 2018.</p><p>So Kunal mentioned our key investment areas at start, where we've been heavily focused over the last 3 years in repositioning our capital allocation in these areas. I thought I'd unpack that a little bit for you and get a sense of how have these areas performed in relation to the rest of Morningstar.</p><p>So if you look over the past few years, our key investment areas have outperformed the rest of Morningstar and you can see the basis points spread both with and without PitchBook. If you look across these 3-year periods, our Direct business is growing in double digits; Data, high single digits; Investment Management, high single digits and the same for our Workplace business. Our Credit Ratings area has been relatively flat over the last few years, but we've worked very hard, as Kunal said, to reposition that area, focus more on diversification and you've seen that come through in the numbers last year, and we're pleased with the building of that foundation and set up our -- setting up our Credit Rating business for future growth and opportunity.</p><p>And a very similar position in 2018 with that spread in our key investment areas versus the rest of Morningstar. So today, roughly 60% of our revenue is generated from these key investment areas. And I think you'll see that our focus is paying off, and we hope to continue to drive outsized returns in these areas going forward.</p><p>The other way we look at the business is the diversification that we have across product and geography. So our product area is divided between license revenue, asset-based revenue, as well as transactional revenue. And you can see the pie, today -- about 3/4 of the business today is license-based. So that's the core data, software offerings that we offer to provide significant leverage to the business and are scalable and ultimately, present a great opportunity that you see for recurring revenue in our license-based products. That was up 15.6% last year, in the 7% to 8% range excluding PitchBook.</p><p>Our asset-based areas were up 10%, given the strong net flows in both Investment Management and Workplace that Kunal showed earlier, and we're pleased with the growth momentum in both those areas. And then our transactional revenue, so for those who follow us, that represents our advertising sales on Morningstar.com as well as our Credit Ratings area. And we do see fluctuation from quarter-to-quarter, so it's ultimately important to look at this on an annual basis and you see double-digit growth here. But -- and especially, when these are moving in the right direction, as you saw in the first quarter of this year, that revenue tends to drop directly to the bottom line and profit. And we're pleased with our performance in our transactional businesses in the first quarter.</p><p>Turning to geography, about 80% of our revenue today is in the Americas, which is primarily the U.S. I mean, very strong growth in the U.S. last year. And then we had single-digit growth in both Asia Pacific and EMEA regions last year, high to mid-single-digit growth in both of those regions. There will continue to be a core focus on Morningstar in these areas, in the markets that we serve. We continue to believe we have considerable opportunity to grow outside the U.S. in areas where we can scale and generate outsized profit margin and return. And a lot of the results in EMEA and, especially, APAC last year were self-inflicted, and we got out of things that were very customized, especially in our Investment Management business to these regions, focusing on more scalable, profitable solutions.</p><p>So I'll turn to capital allocation. We're fortunate to be in a business that generates a significant amount of cash flow that tends to be very stable and secure. So if you look at over the last 5 years, you can see that pattern. 2014, again, was impacted by that litigation settlement. But 2017 was close to a record year in free cash flow. It was a record year in operating cash flow. We generated $250 million and, again, that provides us with significant flexibility for capital allocation.</p><p>The one thing that I would note that we mentioned in our fourth quarter earnings release is the impact of tax reform. So on an ongoing basis, given the rate change in the U.S. being lower, we do think over time, we're going to have about a $10 million to $15 million positive benefit in cash flow, all things being equal, in business mix as a result of tax reform. We should start to see some of that as we progress through this year.</p><p>So what have we been doing with our cash? And if I look at our performance over the past 5 years and, hopefully, you see this in the chart, I think we've got a pretty balanced approach to capital allocation. And our first priority is going to continue to be to invest in the business, organic opportunities that we have. And you can see the level of CapEx over the past 3 years has been relatively consistent and this is the core development activity that we have bringing -- in our core products and bringing innovation to market.</p><p>But second, we will continue to look at M&amp;A and we view that as very complementary to organic growth profile and PitchBook is a great example to that -- of that and John will talk soon. We're very pleased with the performance so far of the PitchBook acquisition, which is exceeding our expectations. But we're going to do transactions at the right price, at the right value, when they're complementary to the business and where we can extract a return, and we'll continue to focus there. But I think what you've also seen this year is we've divested a -- out of a couple areas, in HelloWallet late in last year and our 15(c) board reporting business at the beginning of this year, and we'll continue to look at that where we think things become noncore, where we think we can extract value.</p><p>And then, finally, on returning cash to shareholders. Last year, we returned about $80 million in both dividends and share repurchase. And we're pleased at the end of last year to be able to announce an 8.7% increase to the dividend and a new $500 million share repurchase program. Returning cash to shareholders will still be an important part of our toolkit and we remain focused on that.</p><p>And then the other thing in 2017, as you can see the purple bar up here is we did focus some of our cash flow generation to delevering the balance sheet. So when we acquired PitchBook, we took on about $250 million of debt and it was always intent to delever over time, and we put free cash flow towards that repayment last year and the beginning of this year. And we're about $100 million below the peak debt level that we had at the PitchBook acquisition. And we're pleased with that as it continues to strengthen the balance sheet and provide flexibility for future opportunity.</p><p>So turning to value creation. Like you, we're all investors here at Morningstar and return driven and return focused. And we measure ROIC and we ask that you hold us accountable to that as well. So over the past 5 years, we've been able to return -- earn a return in excess of our cost of capital across different periods of the business growth -- across some different periods of the business growth and investment. And you see all the peak in '15 and '16. And I think, especially in 2017, in the first year of PitchBook when we incurred more debt, we were still able to earn a return in excess of our cost of capital. We'll continue to focus on this and measure this for you over time.</p><p>But ultimately, how is that translating into returns to shareholders in terms of share price, dividends? And here's a map of our performance against the Morningstar U.S. Total Market Return Index since the IPO. And you could see on the book ends, there's positive things to report here that since the IPO, and I know many of you here are long time shareholders of Morningstar, we've outperformed our own index significantly. And then, obviously, in recent periods, 1-year, 3-year as well and the recent stock price performance has certainly helped that, but not as well in 5- and 10-year periods.</p><p>And I'll tell you that we're focused there, but want to also focus on things that we can control, and I will come back to where I started in talking about financial success, because I do believe that we have significant opportunity to continue to grow the business and create value if we stay true to our brand, if we stay true to our mission and, ultimately, the end investor that Kunal talked about. We do that in a responsible way to continue to drive innovation and bring products to market and that in turn should provide us with opportunities to grow the business, to create cash flow, to invest back in the business to drive long-term shareholder value. And I can assure you that is what myself and the entire leadership team remain focused on.</p><p>So I thank you for your time and look forward to questions that you have after the presentation.</p><p>So it's my pleasure to introduce Daniel Needham to the stage. Daniel is an incredible partner to me. He's been with Morningstar since 2009, as Joe mentioned. But he has been leading our Investment Management business since 2015 and a lot of the growth and success that you've seen over the last few years can be directly attributable to Daniel and his leadership.</p><p>So I'd like to welcome Daniel. You'll also notice that he has a much cooler accent than I do.</p><p>So with that, look forward to Daniel and your remarks. Thanks, Dan.</p><p>DANIEL E. NEEDHAM, GLOBAL CIO, MORNINGSTAR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT EUROPE LTD.: Thanks, Jason. So you can tell from my accent that it's South Side, Chicago. It's a local accent. So look, just happy to be here and excited to talk about the business. So I lead the Investment Management group. And firstly, I wanted to cover the assets under management for the business, how to think about the business, talk a bit about the strategy, specifically Managed Portfolios, how we're executing our investment approach and then also some of our new offerings that we're bringing to market.</p><p>So firstly, the assets under advisement/management are around $200 billion and this is split into 2 main businesses. So we have Workplace and Investment Management. And Brock Johnson leads Workplace, but the Investment Management team that I look after provides the investment services and research to those offerings. But I'm going to talk more about the Investment Management business, which is around $70 billion of assets under management.</p><p>So it's really broken into 3 main offerings: Institutional Asset Management, Asset Allocation Services and Managed Portfolios. And so Kunal talked about the shift we've been making within the group.</p><p>Institutional Asset Management and Asset Allocation Services, historically, have been more customized or bespoke where a lot of the work we did was specific to the institution that we worked with, whereas Managed Portfolios has been much more built around our core investment strategies that are standardized, scalable and really reflect our best thinking.</p><p>And so when I took the group over in early 2015, I worked with Joe and the leadership team to really focus the business towards Managed Portfolio, so shifting the business towards Managed Portfolios and really away from the Customized Advisory business. Customized Advisory really was lower margin. It had higher client turnover. It was also facing some headwinds, especially in the variable annuity space and with the rising pressure on costs and the shift to passive, that part of the market was under pressure. But more importantly, it didn't really represent our offerings. We couldn't control the investment outcome or the investor outcome. Whereas Managed Portfolios was higher margin, had better growth potential, there was less client retention risk, and more importantly, it reflected our best thinking where we could really influence the investor outcome.</p><p>So since 2015, we've seen good growth within the Managed Portfolios business, which Kunal covered. It's been growth in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. And so since early 2015, we've had over 20% growth in assets in constant currency terms.</p><p>So I'll spend a little bit of time on what Managed Portfolios are. So they're effectively managed solutions that we provide, primarily to fee-based advisers that are seeking to outsource the investment management of their business. We offer these in core markets, so in the U.S., which is our largest market as well as Australia, the U.K. and South Africa. And so these are areas where we see a lot of opportunity, as Kunal mentioned, for more independent financial advisers. And the offering is sold through 2 main channels: direct to adviser with our sales team and then direct to institution via our portfolio specialists.</p><p>Direct to adviser is primarily through banks, RIAs and broker dealers. And direct to institution is to broker dealers, wirehouses and discount brokers. But all roads lead to investors through advisers for the Managed Portfolios business.</p><p>Now as Kunal mentioned, there are some really powerful trends that are influencing the asset management adviser space, so we have declining fees. We have the best interest standard and we also have digitization. And so these are really driving a couple of forces in the adviser space that supports Managed Portfolios. So we're seeing a shift from brokerage to fee-based, we're seeing outsourcing by advisers, we're also seeing the use of package products as opposed to individual securities and a shift from investment advice to financial planning. So from CFA to CFP and these really support the Managed Portfolios business.</p><p>At the same time, it's a business that has good organic growth opportunities. And so I wanted to just outline how we think about organic growth drivers in the business. So we think there is really 3 key drivers: investor outcomes, market positioning and sales effectiveness. So it's an asset-based business. So growth comes from increasing assets under management, which are driven by investment returns as well as gross inflows and redemption. So we want positive net inflows. That's the real organic driver.</p><p>And we think investor outcomes are, by far, the most important element. So if you're an asset management business, you need to deliver investment results, you need to have trust and you need to have value for money service that includes an ease of use and quality of service. This is by far the most important for us. But we also need to make sure that we've got the offerings in the right markets, serving the right segments, really helping advisers and investors. So we want to make sure we're focusing on positioning. At the same time, asset management businesses really have to be careful that the product side doesn't dominate the outcome side. And I think at Morningstar, there's a very low risk of that happening because we care so much about the investor outcomes.</p><p>And finally, sales effectiveness. We want to make sure we've got efficient and effective deployment of our sales resources. So these are things like having high-quality sales team, incentives as well as sensible territory structure. We're also investing in data, so more data-driven sales techniques as well as digital lead generation.</p><p>So, overall, I think we're well positioned. Again, it really comes down to having the right investment proposition. So when I took the group over in 2015, one of the first things we did was put in place a vision that clearly stated that we're here to deliver good investment results, we want to be global and we also want to be aligned to our mission.</p><p>And any Investment Management business needs to have a clear investment philosophy, set of guiding principles.</p><p>Alexander Hamilton said those who stand for nothing fall for anything. I would say, it goes doubly well in Investment Management. And so we put together 7 guiding principles, which reflect the heritage of Morningstar as well as successful principles that have been applied by investors for many decades. So these 7 principles, which I won't go through, which I'm sure people will be happy about, are applied across our group around the world. And whether you're managing a portfolio in Australia or the U.S. or in London, you're going to be applying these investment principles. So we're primarily a multi-asset investment shop. We combine asset allocation, investment selection and portfolio construction, leveraging Morningstar's proprietary data and research and packaging it up and delivering it to advisers.</p><p>One of the most important capabilities that we have is asset allocation. With the trends that I talked about, asset allocation is going to become an even more important part of what advisers need to support their clients. So we have a long history of asset allocation at Morningstar, including the acquisition of Ibbotson Associates in 2006, and we have a large investment team. So we have 50-plus asset-class team members around the world sitting in Chicago, London and Sydney, primarily, and we're organized into 12 asset-class teams across equity and fixed income. So this team covers 200 equity markets, 150 fixed income markets and 30 currency markets. And we're able to produce valuation implied returns or 10-year forecasts, contrarian indicators and any risks that allow us to develop convictions across all of these asset classes. That then powers our asset allocation offerings whether it's in the U.S., whether it's in Australia, whether it's in U.K. or South Africa.</p><p>Now asset allocation is going to be one of the more important solutions that investors are going to need help with. So goals-based investing is a very popular term. I'm sure everybody has heard a lot about. The good news is that it's not new. It's actually popular, but not new. I always find when I read Ben Graham's writings that actually he was ahead of time by many decades. But this is what he wrote in his last edition of The Intelligent Investor in the '70s. The best way to measure your investing success is not by whether you're beating the market, but by whether you have put in place a financial plan and a behavioral discipline that are likely to get you where you want to go. That's a great definition of goals-based investing. It really resonates with us not just because we're value investors, but also because it's more than just investment. It combines the financial plan as well as the behavioral discipline, and these are 2 areas we're investing in at Morningstar, both financial planning and behavioral science.</p><p>Now I think it's important to maybe provide a taxonomy of multi-asset because it can get a little confusing goals-based, outcome-based, objectives-based. And so, as always, we like to set the standard on defining things. So benchmark-based in a multi-asset setting is the one that people are most familiar with. It's -- the idea is you want to outperform a benchmark in a risk-adjusted way, relative to a market cap benchmark, normally determined by risk tolerance questionnaire or a target-date glide path. And it's a benchmark that's made up of strategic asset allocation.</p><p>Risk is actually underperforming. Then we have outcome-based, which is a newer strategy, which is more about delivering an investment outcome such as outperforming inflation, delivering a certain income yield or delivering a certain retirement drawdown. This is a newer area. The key difference between benchmark-based and outcome-based is that outcome-based will move the asset allocation around and success is not delivering an outcome as opposed to underperforming a benchmark.</p><p>And then finally, goals-based, which is again what I referred to previously. It's more of a financial planning-based strategy. It includes more than just the asset allocation. It includes savings, spending, life expectancy, social security, pensions, outside assets and it's geared towards goals, such as saving for college, retirement or maybe taking a holiday.</p><p>So success here is failing to achieve the goals of the plan. Now you can build a goals-based strategy using benchmark-based or outcome-based, but the important thing is somebody has to be thinking about the full picture and that it's more than just the investment strategy. And so we see this as a big opportunity for our business. And so we've been investing in outcome-based and we're also building out a lot of R&amp;D around goals-based.</p><p>So this is our outcome-based offering, which really sits across the different outcomes that we think are important for advisers to help investors and also to populate a goals-based plan. Firstly, real return. That's really beating inflation by a certain amount. We think that's going to be important for advisers.</p><p>Income, whether it's a retirement income, so drawing down a certain amount over a certain time period or multi-asset income where you want to deliver certain income yield so the capital maintains purchasing power over time.</p><p>And then, finally, absolute return is where investors want low market directionality, but a return that's better than cash. So we think about that as absolute return. So we've been building out these strategies and we think they're going to help advisers as they tackle goals-based solutions.</p><p>They're implemented using direct securities, ETFs and mutual funds. And as Kunal pointed out, declining fees or costs is a real driver in the industry and so we've been working on that as well. As I'm sure everybody here is aware, we've filed to register for mutual funds with the SEC. We are currently in the quiet period so there's not a lot we can say about it, but I can refer to things that are in the filing. And so these are effectively mutual funds that are going to be replacing third-party mutual funds that we currently use within our Managed Portfolio as our multi-asset solutions. We're going to be using subadvisers instead of third-party managers to implement. Really, the key driver of this is to bring costs down for investors to simplify the structure for ourselves and advisers as well as to gain flexibility to manage the underlying exposures in the portfolio whether it's shifting subadvisers or asset allocation. So these are going to be really important for us as we build our asset allocation offerings in the future. But to wrap up, I just wanted to say that I think we're well positioned to take advantage of a lot of the powerful trends in the adviser space, both to grow our business, to help advisers and to deliver good investor outcomes.</p><p>And with that, I'm going to thank you for your time. And I'm going to introduce John Gabbert, who is our West Coast executive, which I think he says is Silicon Forest, not Silicon Valley. So thank you.</p><p>JOHN GABBERT, CEO OF PITCHBOOK DATA INC, MORNINGSTAR, INC.: Well, Daniel, thank you very much for that. And Kunal, thank you very much for inviting me to the hot seat. So I really, really appreciate that. So my name is John Gabbert. I'm the Founder and CEO of PitchBook, and it really is great to be here with all of you. And maybe just to kick it off and to follow up on Kunal's comments about culture and becoming part of the Morningstar family, that was really probably the most important thing to me is finding a home for PitchBook that fits well. And I think our cultures have blended together incredibly nicely. So thank you very much for the opportunity.</p><p>My objective really today is to provide a little bit more of an overview on what it is that we do at PitchBook. Brett Kaluza who leads our customer success team always jokes and says, \"What is it that you say you do here?\" So I plan to get into that a little bit more on what it is we do.</p><p>A little bit about our story. I founded PitchBook in March of 2007 after doing research on the venture capital industry for 9 years, down in the real Silicon Valley, I guess. But -- and really the primary need that we were looking to address was providing a better private equity deal database. My previous company focused on venture capital and people kept asking, \"Hey, what about private equity?\" So I'm passionate about building data products, and I really enjoy the private capital markets and building these types of teams.</p><p>So founded PitchBook in 2007 to meet that need. It took us until Q1 of 2009 to build the back-end tools, to get the data, to build the front-end of the product so that we can secure our first customer, which was Grant Thornton in Q1 of 2009. Through that time period, we raised a little bit over $4 million. And Morningstar was the last investor in that Series A financing in September of 2009. So we've been working with Morningstar since then. And really, I think that led a lot to -- up to the acquisition, it's just frankly building trust and relationships over time.</p><p>So one thing that I also want to highlight on this journey is that every year, we're really looking to leverage our technical data gathering and go-to-market capabilities to expand our markets. So while we first started as a private equity deal database-focused company, we then added limited partners that became a fund-raising tool. We added fund performance data, and became a benchmarking tool, public company data, then we added venture capital data, European data, M&amp;A data, et cetera. So we're always looking to expand our market and leverage these core capabilities. And as we first started tracking M&amp;A -- launched this M&amp;A transaction database in 2016, dovetailed in nicely with the acquisition of PitchBook by Morningstar, so we're tracking our own transactions there. And I like to think we got all the details just right. And we continue to invest in the business. I'll get into a little bit more on our products, but we look to get deeper into our customers' workflow. And data business, obviously, a very large business for Morningstar. And last year, we really enhanced our capabilities to deliver data feeds as well as APIs, again getting data into our customers' workflow. And this year, a big push on integrating the next generation of equity fundamental data that Morningstar is gathering into PitchBook as well as Morningstar research. So it's been a fun journey, and really look forward to what's ahead.</p><p>So the core of what we track. This slide kind of walks through the life cycle of private capital markets. So top left, first, the limited partners. These are the endowments, foundations, insurance companies, pension plans family offices that are making commitments to private capital funds. So we track those commitments to the funds. We also track again that fund performance. We have -- with the company providing the largest database on private capital fund performance, so cash flows on a quarterly basis, et cetera. Then all of the investors from angels to corporates. And then where we really focus is on the companies and transactions. And I think this is the sweet spot that our clients value the most and having details on valuations, cap tables, terms and conditions on transactions, multiples, et cetera. This is really our sweet spot as a company. And then all of the service providers and professionals involved investment banks, lawyers, lenders, accountants, consultants, that's the ecosystem that we're really focused on tracking.</p><p>So how is it that we get this? First and foremost, we do leverage a lot of technology. I think we ran nearly 600,000, 700,000 web bots and crawlers every single day, bringing in an incredible amount of information into our system then use data science, natural language processing, machine learning to pick up the most valuable data points, but this is a market where every transaction is a little bit different. So we spent over 3 million man hours going through this data, curating data, cleaning it, normalizing it in order to provide a valuable product to our customers. So we have specialized data teams that are going through every single transaction, every single profile. So we put a lot of -- we kind of marry the technology side with manpower, lots of quality assurance. And then we also get on the phone and we follow up. So it's cross-validating the information usually reaching out to the CEO, the CFO of the company that received the investment or the investors or the advisers involved. So it's really this cycle that we're continually running to make sure that we have the best possible data. Then that data flows into our products. Our primary product is the PitchBook Desktop Platform. All of the data, analytical tools are very customizable. This is really the core product that our customers are using to meet their needs, discovery, benchmarking, et cetera, which I'll get into a little bit more. And again, we work to get into customer workflow. So we have a great mobile application that we've won awards for. So you can take the PitchBook with you wherever you go. It's a great reference tool. We then have an Excel plug-in, so a lot of analysts, associates at investments banks, private equity firms, venture firms, corporate development groups running valuation model. So with click of the mouse, you can update these models. And one differentiator in our plug-in as well as it not only has the public company data, which many competitors have, but it has the private company data as well. So again that's the key theme here is putting private company data alongside public company equity data as well.</p><p>CRM integration, so in Salesforce, if you're a business development professional or anyone using Salesforce as a workflow tool, you can have mini profiles from PitchBook on any of the entities we track right there. And then Chrome extension, so as you're browsing the web, reading an article, you can click a button in our plug-in and highlights companies that we track and then again pull a little mini-PitchBook profile for that entity.</p><p>So we serve a very diverse customer base. And nearly 3,000 firms, which I'll get into that in a moment as well. But again very diverse customer base. Certainly venture firms, private equity, investment banks, but a lot of corporate development groups, as Kunal mentioned. The market for corporates is quite large for us. And that's just whether they're trying to understand what's going on within the market, emerging technologies, identifying acquisition targets or investment targets, benchmarking competition, et cetera. So we serve, again, those investor types, investment banks, limited partners, so a very diverse customer base.</p><p>As far as user growth. Yes, we're a business very focused on maximizing our potential and serving absolutely as many people as possible. So we certainly show up every single day to drive growth. It's almost 3,000 firms that we're serving today and over 15,000 individual users. You can see the growth rate over the past year or so. And again, something that we're very focused on as the business is driving growth.</p><p>From our customers, our first core value is customers are King. I think that fits very nicely with Morningstar's mission of serving investors. And I believe that we service the heck out of our customers. Our NPS is currently 58. So this is a simple question to users, which is how likely are you to recommend PitchBook to or refer PitchBook to a friend or colleague. And not to get into exactly how the tally is done, but you have to get a 9 or 10 in order to get a positive 1 in this. So a 58 score truly is fantastic, something we're very proud of. We also -- some other surveys and questions that we asked to our customers is about their return on investment in a PitchBook subscription. And 91% of our clients say that they get a positive return within the first year of their investment. 71% of customer say that we have significantly better private company data. 74 say significantly better private company data in comparison to one of our larger competitors and 58% that -- say that we have significantly better fund performance and management data relative to others as well. So very proud of that.</p><p>A little bit more qualitatively from some of our customers. Again, this is why we show up every single day to serve them. So we're proud of these phenomenal information service, outstanding application, awesome platform, customer service, super responsive, exactly what I'm looking for, et cetera. So again, very proud of this and why we show up.</p><p>As far as key initiatives that we're working on. Again, this is really the theme of focusing on our core, having the best private capital data possible and marrying that with public data sets. So again, in our expanded relationship with Morningstar integrating that next generation of equity fundamental data as well as the research, when it comes to the private side, one key thing and actually I was having a conversation earlier this morning about this, how we're looking to better compete, especially on this first box on top is search and discovery is how do we enable our customers to more easily surface emerging trends. If you're trying to understand what's going on with blockchain, who are all the companies, who were the investors, who's involved, how much capital have they raised, what specifically are they doing. We're really looking to service -- surface those types of emerging trends for our customers. Again deeper into the workflow whether that would be Excel plug-in, APIs data feeds, Salesforce and then speed and scale. As we have over 15,000 users, we want to make sure that we're scaled, so that we can support many, many times that.</p><p>On the public data side, again the valuation modeling. This is something that there is always a challenge in changing user behavior and something like these Excel models are very sticky for analysts and associates already have them built. So we're offering services to recreate those models for them. And then again building out the library of available models that are already prebuilt. As Kunal mentioned for the buy side, integrating Morningstar equity research and analyst notes into the PitchBook platform has been one of the biggest requests that we've had over the past couple of years. And then again, real-time and scale, making sure that we can accommodate real-time publishing of new reports or real-time data.</p><p>And with that, I'd like to share a little video related to this public and private intersection.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>JOHN GABBERT: So with that, thank you very much for having me here today, and I'd like to welcome Kunal back to the stage -- back to the hot seat. Thanks. I appreciate it.</p><p>KUNAL KAPOOR: All right. Hopefully, you enjoyed the presentations. I think we all knew PitchBook had arrived when we've had a moment on the HBO show Silicon Valley. What was that 18 months ago or so, John?</p><p>JOHN GABBERT: Yes.</p><p>KUNAL KAPOOR: Right after the acquisition. So had its moment in zeitgeist, but again, we're going to take a short break now. It is about 10:25. So we'll take a 15-minute break. Come back in here at 10:40. If you're watching the stream, please feel free to send in a question on the platform, otherwise, we'll set up here in the room for the Q&amp;A. And we'll also be joined by Tricia Rothschild, our Chief Product Officer, on the stage. So look forward to answering your questions here in 10, 15 minutes.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>KUNAL KAPOOR: All right. Thank you, and welcome back, everybody. We're going to kick off the Q&amp;A portion of the meeting. We've actually already got a number of questions that are coming in over the web, but we're going to start in the room itself. And so I think there's a mic in the back. And if you just want to raise your hand, we'll send the mic over to you. Just please identify yourself, the firm you're with and then feel free to ask any question of any of us in the stage. And other members of the management team and board will jump in as appropriate, if needed. Let's see. Right there. Yes, sir.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SHAREHOLDER: Yes. I'll open this one up. I'm Terry Brady. I'm a shareholder from Yorkville. First time I've been here, a new investor in the company. Somewhat impressed so far. I notice this company is one of the ones that's separated the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer. But you threw in something kind of muddied the water there, Executive Chairman. Just what does that mean? I don't recognize that title at all? And how does that relate to the CEO? I mean, have you really separated them or have you just sort of did it with -- in name only? Or what's the relationship with the Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer?</p><p>KUNAL KAPOOR: Yes. Yes. So the question is what's the relationship between Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the working relationship. The way I think about it is that Joe and I have a very close relationship and partnership in running the business. And so I think it's fair to say that Joe is probably more involved in working with us on strategy, capital allocation and things like that than probably you would have in another situation. So we do operate pretty separately on a day-to-day basis, I would say. On a day-to-day basis, I'm running the business for sure, but in terms of all long-term decisions, Joe plays a key role. And I think that's how I think about the Executive Chairman role being different from a more passive Chairman of the Board. Fair enough?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED SHAREHOLDER: Fair enough.</p><p>KUNAL KAPOOR: Okay. Question right in the middle here.</p><p>SCOTT THEODORE BRAYMAN, MANAGING PARTNER, CIO OF SMALL &amp; MID CAP STRATEGIES AND PORTFOLIO MANAGER, CHAMPLAIN INVESTMENT PARTNERS, LLC: Scott Brayman, Champlain Investment partners. Can one of you describe any tools or benchmarking practices that you use to measure the productivity of your software design and production teams? And also maybe talk about how that productivity has been trending?</p><p>KUNAL KAPOOR: Absolutely. So I think this is a good question for both Tricia and John to answer since they oversee the 2 software platforms.</p><p>TRICIA ROTHSCHILD, CHIEF PRODUCT OFFICER, MORNINGSTAR, INC.: Sure. It's a great question and something that we spend a lot of time making sure we are measuring -- the question is, how we measure the productivity of our software development teams. So we deploy an agile software development process, which enables us to look at the output of all of the squads. We have a process known as an Agile Health Check, where we look at the commitments that those squads have made, the velocity of their throughput and then the outcomes that they deliver. And in terms of the trend, actually, we've been evolving toward the agile development process from a more traditional waterfall process over the past 3 years, and we have been spinning up these squads and have seen improvements in the output which, ultimately, the real test of that is in the investor experience, our Net Promoter Scores, our financial results and the retention rates. So I do feel like you can see the trends in the improvements in terms of the throughput from the data, which is really kind of where everything starts here at Morningstar on the software side into the product development process running through this agile process in the squads and then delivering it out through the market and our marketing and sales teams.</p><p>JOHN GABBERT: Yes. I think many similar ways that we do it at PitchBook. Certainly, we look to make sure that our spending on R&amp;D is in line with overall budgets and financial plans. And as Daniel went through on the investment side as far as how to measure success, I also think we measure it on a goals basis. Are we providing our customers with what they need and measuring it through active users. And once we release certain piece of functionality, is it being adopted. So I think certainly, on the front end, managing resources and also measuring success of that once it rolls out.</p><p>BRAD MOLDIN: I'm Brad Moldin from Fidelity Investments. You guys have done a lot of acquisitions since becoming a public company. Could you just spend a few minutes on the vetting process for looking at deals, how you are sourcing them and what the hurdle rates for the deals and like, what the time horizon is to achieve those hurdle rates?</p><p>KUNAL KAPOOR: Yes. So Brad's question is just in our acquisition strategy and how we think about that. And I think you're referencing that we've done a number of deals since we came public. Brad, one thing I'd sort of point to is you can probably segment the acquisition strategy a little bit. We probably did a far greater number of deals in the first few years after coming public than we have of late. But I think one thing we said consistently and that we believe in is that we think that the organic opportunities at Morningstar are far superior to many of the acquisition opportunities that come our way. So when we think about investing in the business, organic opportunities are generally the top of the list. And I will say that over time as we've made acquisitions, I think, we've learned from them. If you were to ask me, among our acquisitions, which ones do you think have been the most successful, I would actually point to some of our larger acquisitions as actually having been the most successful. More recently, PitchBook, obviously, is one we're talking about. But I think about the acquisition of the S&amp;P Fund Data business, which really gave us a footprint outside the United States or I think about the acquisition of Ibbotson, which really, I think, gave us scale on the Investment Management side. And so I think those have been very, very successful on a number of measures. I think the smaller ones sometimes are harder to do because they do tend to kind of be hard to focus on, and they do tend to get a little bit lost. And so I think overall, when we think of acquisitions now, we really viewed from the capability of what are we missing that we can't build ourselves or that we have an issue in terms of how long it might take for us to get to market. And the reality is that acquisitions never come at you necessarily on the life cycle that you want them to, they kind of show up sometimes at random times. But we tend to be prepared. Mike Holt, who runs our strategy team, has a list of companies that we keep tabs on, that we're interested in. And again, we are price-sensitive, obviously, and we do not want to pay something that we don't think we're going to be able to earn a good return on. And I will say that in the current environment, in particular, when we see the valuations that a lot of companies are going at and their product and revenue, it's not nearly as exciting to us as doing things such as buying back our own stock. So I'd say that we are generally skeptical of acquisitions and it's a very high bar for making them.</p><p>ARTHUR BAPTIST: Arthur Baptist with Goldengate Capital. I just had a couple. My first is just one the -- when you look across the software portfolio, if you could maybe talk about -- I know you had some recent announcements about new products, introducing them in the cloud. I'm just curious kind of long term what's the strategy of moving your portfolio into the cloud, where are you today in terms of how many products do you have that are ready to go? And is there an appetite with your customers to move in that direction?</p><p>TRICIA ROTHSCHILD: Sure. Happy to take that. So really, our story here is about portfolio simplification and ensuring that our products are relevant for the use cases that we see from our core customer bases, which as you know are primarily asset managers and wealth management firms and independent advisers for that part of the business, and then the private equity and venture capital asset or the user group from John's part of the business. In terms of our movement to the cloud, we have -- there's a technology strategy as well as a client-facing strategy. So we are migrating off of our on-prem servers into Amazon Web Services. That's going very well and we can talk in more detail about that if you'd like. In terms of the client-facing product experience, which I think is more of the core of your question, we have our independent adviser platform now fully in the cloud. So that is same brand, Morningstar Office, and we have probably about 1/4 to 1/3 of our advisers accessing the cloud. We still are running the other product so our strategy here is to entice them to move as opposed to force them to migrate. And we have seen and we're investing in terms of our research and data capabilities in the cloud version so that there's an incentive. We have seen really great response because the connectivity of the data and research in the cloud version is -- performs far better for the advisers, and it allows them to get their jobs done more efficiently and take broader advantage of the types of investments that Morningstar has made over the years, including our ByAllAccounts data aggregation, all in one product. As far as the other user types that we serve, we have Direct for wealth management, which we just released. We have an investor pulse predictive tool so that asset managers can understand asset flows better. That will be released in the cloud exclusively. And we are moving toward other cloud-based transitions for the asset manager users of Morningstar Direct. So we maintain, as I said, the desktop version but entice the folks to move over to the cloud with the investments that we're putting there and the upgrades that we're putting into the cloud versions.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: That's great. And then maybe just, I guess, for Kunal and Jason. Just when you look at the organic growth and 2017 was a meaningful improvement in the organic growth rate, and then even Q1 this year has been another step-up into kind of this double-digit level. What were kind of the big 1 or 2 reasons why organic growth kind of inflected positively to this level? And then as we look out 2, 3, 4 years, kind of -- is there rate we should expect kind of target? How are you setting investments? I guess, what kind of organic growth are you driving the business towards?</p><p>JASON M. DUBINSKY: Yes. So the question was if you looked at last year and the momentum in organic growth, what were some of the drivers of that, and then if we look out into the future, are there expectations of what levels that should be? So maybe I'll start with the last and then go back to the first. And we don't give any formal guidance but I'll come back to kind of the remarks that I made in my prepared remarks in the presentation. We're very focused on getting call back to more sustainable levers of long-term growth and making sure that revenue is growing at a healthy pace, and we are able to manage the right spread, bringing revenue and expense growth, you had to generate strong performance in operating income and margin. I'd focus on that and that's the focus and intent. We are investing in the business to drive growth, and I think you could see the outsized growth in our key investment areas. So we do believe there's significant opportunity ahead in all of our areas to continue to provide pretty positive growth. But it takes work, creates tension, takes execution. We're focused on doing that but there's not a target rate we can disclose. And I assure you everyone up here is focused on maintaining that momentum into the sustainable future.</p><p>KUNAL KAPOOR: I would just add that if you think back to the shareholder meeting last year, we talked about this topic as well. And the one thing I would say is that last year, we talked a lot about the investments we were making and how we hope that they would pay off and that we intended to drive those types of results. And so in my mind, one of the differences between last year and this year is potentially where we are at a point where we are seeing the investments that we made pay off, whereas last year, we were still sort of at a point where we were making some of those investments, and I think that was part of the difference. So it is true that I think probably relative to other organizations, there's a willingness to, I think, look at long-term growth that is superior even if it's a little lumpier as long as the end outcome is better than just sort of taking the straight line because it's a straight line. I think we want to have more at the end. And that's always our goal and so we invest with that in mind and we will take advantage of things. And in fact, I think one of the things we have tried to do every year is even though we have a budget and we set things, as stuff pops up that we think we want to get after, we will try to do it. And Morningstar Plan Advantage is a perfect example of that. When the fiduciary rules first started to come about or there's discussions around it, we didn't have a product or a budget or anything like that stacked against it. We saw the opportunity and we immediately moved resources to kind of go get after it. And we will do that from time to time because we see the opportunities. We're certainly in the place where I think many of the investments we've made are starting to really pay off and we're starting to, I think, to see the benefits of that.</p><p>JASON M. DUBINSKY: And I'll just close too and I give a lot of credit to Danny, Don and our sales team as well is it's one thing to be able to create and bring great innovations to market; it's another thing to make sure we've got the systematic approach and structure and a global team that's able to go and sell those and deliver those to clients, so. And that renewed focus certainly has helped us in create great momentum in the business and a credit to our global sales team.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: I think there's a question up here. Eugene has got a question.</p><p>EUGENE KRISHNAN: Eugene from Lazard Asset Management. I actually have 2 questions. First question for Daniel. Okay, it's actually 3 questions. Maybe you could talk about the decoupling between AUM growth and revenue growth. And I think you guys partially talked about it in terms of some of the international custom model stuff that was going away. But how long should we see that? And clearly, you've focused the strategy on managed portfolios. Should we basically assume that the rest of the revenue, I don't want to say to be dramatic, it goes away over time but it's just basically going to be in decline or is there some strategy for that part of the business? And I guess the second question would be for Kunal on credit ratings. You showed that great slide in terms of how asset-backed has become a bigger part of the mix, you have more balance there and you guys have clearly made a large investment in that business in terms of growing the headcount over the last few years. Maybe you could talk about what's needed in terms of further investment from here. What are you doing to continue to grow asset-backed and corporate securities part of the business strategy there?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Danny, why don't you -- just repeat the question.</p><p>DANIEL E. NEEDHAM: So the question was related to the transition we'd been making in the investment management business so towards managed portfolios and away from the more customized advisory, how should we think about that transition and asset growth to revenue going forward? And then -- what was the second question, sorry?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Will that revenue go away or...</p><p>DANIEL E. NEEDHAM: How are we going to see the run down, sorry, yes. I was too busy thinking about the answer to the first question. So as I showed, we've been on a transition for the last 3 years away from the customized advisory. I think we've made a lot of that movement now. I think a lot of that is behind us but it's going to continue into the future. Our goal is to have the managed portfolios grow at a much higher rate, so the share will fall as the managed portfolio growth is much higher. And I think the runoff of that business could take some time. And so these are clients of ours, we continue to provide services where we have good relationships. But their businesses are in a different place than when we set the relationship up. And so the way to think about the customized deals is that you start them early, you have, say, a 5-year ramp-up period, and the biggest risk of client losses in that 5- to 10-year period, when the assets are at their largest. And so you're not only competing with other organizations, you're also competing with internal teams, so it becomes a real challenging business. And so once you stop growing that business, it just slowly declines because you've got to continually replenish the larger accounts that you lose. And so it's going to be lumpy but it's going to run down. And within the managed portfolios business, we feel confident that we've got the position, the business position well. And then specifically for the direct-to-adviser part of the business, that's where we're investing a lot and we think that's a really attractive potential growth engine for us in the future.</p><p>KUNAL KAPOOR: Yes. Before I answer the second part of your question, Eugene, I would just add that I think part of the way you can think about this, too, is just wherever we can across our business, we want to try to control our destiny and the outcome that we deliver to the investor. And if you look back on our history, I think we have been most successful both in terms of impacting the investor and impacting the financial outcome when we have that type of impact and control. And so much of the shift in Daniel's business is going to give us that ability, and we like the managed portfolios business for that reason. We're delivering solutions that we have high conviction in, where we can kind of control how they're sold, what the messaging is. One of the things that Daniel and his team are going to work on is really essentially a program for advisers where we certify them in our way of thinking about investing and thinking about how to interact with clients. We really want to have folks who are true long-term partners in that sense, whether they're advisers or investors or what have you, so I would just kind of add that. The second part of your question was really around our credit ratings business and how you think about -- how we think about investing in that business. You're right, we certainly, over the past few years, have made investments to grow the size of the team in the credit rating space. I believe we're now at a place where we are largely essentially reinvesting back into the business as opposed to adding a whole lot of new capital into the business to fund the future growth. So it's not to say that more opportunities will not pop up, but we feel like we've reached a point where we have that ability to do things. One thing we are doing with that business is expanding some of the support operations in Mumbai that underpin that business, so we've been investing somewhat there because it's really proven to be quite successful. And so that's the one part that perhaps we've done some things. And clearly as you pointed out, with ABS, we did as well make some investments just because the demand was so high and the market share that we captured was greater than we thought it would be right out of the gate. So we've made some tactical investments. But otherwise, we're essentially now trying to get into a place where it's self-sustaining. I guess there's a third question.</p><p>EUGENE KRISHNAN: Sorry. I'll just follow on with Daniel. So I guess the third question I was trying to ask is basically, and I may have read this a bit wrong, but in the proxy, it looks like your annual comp was tied specifically to the managed portfolio revenue and EBITDA growth. But if I think about the overall investment management business, there are a couple other components there that you guys have talked to, and those look like they are -- they could be in decline. And I guess I worry that when I look at that overall business that you guys do a great job of showing the key products and how we've got 8% growth, but the reality is the investment management business, with those other pieces in decline, the overall growth is going to be less. So maybe you could talk about how you feel like you're incentivized and what the overall strategy is for the other components to that business.</p><p>DANIEL E. NEEDHAM: Sure. So the question is with the focus on managed portfolios and sort of the incentives of leadership of the investment management group, how we tie it to the aggregate revenue. So firstly, I think that it's important to note that the portion of my compensation that's tied to the financial results of the investment management include both managed portfolios and the nonmanaged portfolios part of the business. So we have aggregate revenue targets for the business, including those as well as operating income targets. So when we're thinking about the business, we're thinking about all of the clients in the business. So that's -- there's an incentive for me to make sure we don't lose those clients and actually they grow. And so that's something we're focused on. And so we spend a lot of time, as we shifted the business in 2015, was for the clients that were, say, more customized was to build a more scalable delivery for those bespoke clients and so we spent a lot of time on that. We're still very focused on supporting those clients so we have sales folks and account management folks who are incentivized to keep those clients. And so you have to use different economic incentives for businesses that have different levels of maturity. And so -- and I think we've reflected that in the KPIs for the teams that look after that. And I think overall, we're focused on the outcomes for all of our clients so it's not just the managed portfolios users, it's also all those clients. But there is -- I think as you deemphasize growth, there is just a natural deceleration in those businesses because you have to constantly replenish the client lineup as organizations move away. But a lot of these organizations that are providing customer services to also take other services from Morningstar. And so it's not as if we're just providing that. So we have a holistic relationship and account managers. So I don't want it to seem that we're just kind of forgetting those. I think it's a good question and we're definitely focused on that, but we're realistic about the future growth.</p><p>KUNAL KAPOOR: It's also just worth pointing out as it pertains to Daniel's incentives, a significant portion of his incentives are also tied to the performance of the portfolios that his team oversees. And so we want to make sure that he's also aligned to a long-term risk-adjusted performance that his team is delivering.</p><p>DANIEL E. NEEDHAM: Yes.</p><p>KUNAL KAPOOR: Barb, do we want to do a few questions that are coming in as well?</p><p>AMY ARNOTT, DIRECTOR OF IR, MORNINGSTAR, INC.: This one is for John and then also the Morningstar executives. Could you discuss how you view the potential total addressable market for PitchBook?</p><p>JOHN GABBERT: Certainly. I mean, I think in general, I believe that we have a lot of runway. We're serving nearly 3,000 firms today but I think there are many tens of thousands of potential firms for us to serve. And then even within firms, certainly, we serve many of the large investment banks as an example, and there's a lot of potential seat growth there as well. So I don't worry about -- I don't worry as much about there being available market as just executing to make sure that we go after it. So I believe there's plenty of market.</p><p>KUNAL KAPOOR: Yes. I mean, among the many things I admire about John is that he's a very focused individual. And we've had many discussions about how we should think about PitchBook from a geographic diversification perspective. And the reality is that today, PitchBook could be in many more markets than it is. And we have purposely chosen not to be there because we think in the core markets that we're executing in today, the opportunity itself remains so big. So for instance, Brad, you had the question about acquisitions or things like that. We get a lot of calls about, \"Why are you guys not in Asia? There's all these databases popping up in Asia.\" We could be there. We could be looking at that but you get the trade-off of that we have this huge opportunity in the U.S. and in the EMEA area, and we want to execute on those first and foremost. So I too am not worried about the size of the opportunity. I think PitchBook could be many multiples larger than what it is today. And it fundamentally comes down to our ability to execute against the opportunity and obviously for the health of the underlying market over the long haul to be sustained as well.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: All right. I think as investors, as we think about the significant market potential and we just talked about with PitchBook, very significant. And we talked about management portfolios for advisers and then also retirement managers within Workplace Solutions. It'd be great if you could start providing addressable market sizes. I know you provide it for the whole thing. But address like your penetration with advisers is here but managed portfolios, this is this tiny sliver or PitchBook could be addressable market or credit ratings could be -- it could really help us start sizing things because I think there's a tremendous opportunity within retirement manager just to take on that management. There's a tremendous opportunity if you look at your installed base of financial advisers to take on managed portfolios. I mean, I think it's the sliver of assets that you've managed and what that could be over time, that could really help us kind of understand not just, is this a 3% grower or an 8% grower, but in 5 years or 10 years, this could be twice the size, right, or 3 times the size. And you did that a few years ago with that $100 million for each one of these targets. But not today but over time, if you can start providing that through 8-Ks and disclosures, I think it'd be a really helpful and powerful way to tell the story.</p><p>KUNAL KAPOOR: It's good feedback. So we certainly have points of view in each of the areas that we operate across products and we'll take that in consideration what information transparency we might be able to provide on a go-forward basis. But thanks for the point.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Pete Walstrom calling in -- well, not calling in, I guess, but from Burnett. So Jason, welcome to the stage.</p><p>JASON M. DUBINSKY: Thank you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: There's a lot of focus on revenue growth, whether organic or via acquisitions and for good reason. Maybe could you take a step back, and as I think about Morningstar, it's a business that has very fixed cost areas that are -- incremental margins are very nice in a lot of different areas. Could you talk about some of the underlying changes that you are implementing in Morningstar's core cost base -- cost structure that maybe are being masked right now as you're seeing a lot of revenue growth and a lot of that incremental margin is dropping to the bottom line, some of the things that you see maybe as an opportunity to trim?</p><p>JASON M. DUBINSKY: Yes. Well, maybe -- it's a good question. The question was around the opportunities with the cost base as revenue growth. I think I will reframe that a little bit, and Kunal might have mentioned it the beginning of his remarks. But to some extent, as we kind of approach $1 billion business and are growing up in many different ways, the important thing that we can do is make sure the business is set up for scale in the future. I talked a little bit about that. I've seen a lot of the focus and the attention across our products and geographies in our core infrastructure is how do we make sure that we're allocating resources in the right way. Just talked about our core IT infrastructure. How do we aggregate that in the right way for the future to set our products up for success, their whole IT infrastructure for success so we can serve to get pipes to our products in an efficient manner? I think about our process and governance around things that we do and decision-making to make sure that we're set up the right decisions to drive returns for long-term success. So I view a lot of what I'm doing and we're doing as a leadership team to kind of evolve process and structure to allow ourselves to scale in the right way, especially given the fact -- then we got various lines of business and products across geography. And I think that is the primary focus. And I think you've seen us do some of that in terms of what Daniel is doing in some of his businesses, exiting certain businesses and prioritization against the opportunities that are really going to drive growth where we can scale is where I'm focused and where the leadership team is focused.</p><p>HEIDI T. MILLER: If you don't mind, I just wanted to add, Pete, an example of where this kind of growth at scale comes to light is we have an initiative that's pretty much company-wide around robotic process automation and how do we deploy more efficient techniques to data collection, data processing, how -- if we're transferring clients from a desktop to a cloud version, we're trying to move objects, are there ways that we could program the bots to do that repeated task as opposed to having an entry-level person doing that systematically and very tedious and not adding as much value. So that type of thinking and all of the leadership team and our managers are expected to think about growth but really from that scale.</p><p>KUNAL KAPOOR: Yes. I was actually just going to talk about RPA, which is a big deal here within Morningstar. Bevin Desmond often pushes me to think about transformation of our business. And every time I come with an idea, Bevin's like, \"Well, let's move it up here,\" and we've been talking about this notion of data automation within Morningstar and how we can be on this path where essentially all the data we're collecting is more or less always automated in the way that we're getting it in. And so you would think naturally that the first step then is if we can do that, then that lowers your cost base. And at some level, yes, it does. But I think the other thing that we think about, Pete, is what can we now start gathering that we were not gathering? And what can we put people on that they could not do before? And so there's both the potential to reduce costs but also to just actually go get more harder-to-find data sets that we were previously maybe not touching.</p><p>I will also just say that when it comes to just thinking about our cost base, we're also always thinking actively around where our people are and whether we have the right amount of scale in the different locations that we need to. In the past year, we have made a concerted effort, for instance, to start scaling our operation in Madrid. And part of what we're trying to do there is pull together more of what happens across Europe in one location. And we're finding that Madrid is not only full of the talent that we need but also from a cost perspective is quite favorable. And so I just kind of want to point out that there's many dimensions to how we think about costs and where our people are is a pretty big and important part of that. And even John in part of the business that he oversees, we're looking at where we have contractors, does that make sense or can he now leverage Morningstar's India footprint to do some of the data gathering that PitchBook has done historically? So these are all things that we're looking at. But I will say our primary goal right now is to automate and do more because there's a lot of things that we want to do. Every org has a huge list, obviously, and we haven't been able to get through our list and I think RPA is one example of something that's going to enable our ability to get further down our list.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Just wanted to go to your license growth outside of John's business but just Direct, Office and Workstation. We track those trends, Office and Workstation have been pretty flat. I think I understand why but not totally sure. Office, does that pick up? And then what's -- I guess, could you just talk about the growth of Direct and Office and why Direct is growing so fast and revenue's even growing faster than your license growth? I assume that's mix and price and other things but those 3 lines would be really helpful.</p><p>KUNAL KAPOOR: Yes, absolutely. Do you want to start?</p><p>HEIDI T. MILLER: Yes. Sure. So the question is related to the growth and perhaps book revenue versus user growth across the 3 primary software platforms in the license business space, which are Direct, Office and Advisor Workstation. So to answer the last part of your question first, Morningstar Direct has a large seat component and so we have over 14,000 users. But there's also revenue that comes from reporting solutions where there, it's really more of an enterprise-wide or a distribution-based piece of the revenues and there's also been some price increase of success that we've seen as we've added more value to the platform. We've been able to hold up really well in terms of the price increases. So it's a combination of unit growth there as well as the other services that are embedded in that. And when we think about then the connection to the other software platforms that you mentioned, as I said a few minutes ago, we're really looking to simplify the product portfolio. So instead of having what we had built originally which made sense at the time, which were really 3 distinct stacks of technology to serve these very 3 distinct use cases, we've re-platformed on a common core framework, which is the core and we call that the direct core. And then we can target the same user groups that we serve through a more efficient delivery mechanism. So you will see Office as an example, some of the core are IE users who want a complete performance reporting portfolio accounting service will use Morningstar Office. If somebody else in their practice wants a harder, kind of harder core, heavier-duty research solution, they would use Morningstar Direct. There's a link between Morningstar Direct and Morningstar Office in terms of how the data can flow so we can serve both use cases within the same wealth management or advisory firm, for example. And then the additional use case there would be the asset manager use case. And Advisor Workstation today is still -- remains as a separate product. Primarily the use case there is proposal generation for an adviser to give to a client, and we are delivering over 165,000 investment proposals per year through that service. So we've seen, especially with the increase in fee-based advice and the need for advisers to be able to look at both the fee-based and commission-based part of their business, that Advisor Workstation has been a really important part of the solution. And that was where a lot of the growth last year came from in terms of the Department of Labor and best interest solutions that we rolled out. And as Kunal said, regardless of what the regulatory regime is, all of these advisers are now being held to a higher standard really by their clients in terms of being able to provide transparency into how they deliver those proposals and what's going into them.</p><p>KUNAL KAPOOR: I think there's a really nice story there if you look at Office and the recent release in terms of how we're slowly kind of moving into the same platform that Direct is on. So we've talked about this decision of trying to get everybody on that same ecosystem. And I would say that under [Dermot's] leadership, we've really made some really good strides recently in executing that vision. So pretty excited about the direction for Office.</p><p>AMY ARNOTT: We'll take another one from the web. This question is directed to John and Daniel and Trisha. Could you talk about the ways in which your businesses are or are not resilient during market and economic downturns?</p><p>KUNAL KAPOOR: I think it's an easy answer for Daniel.</p><p>DANIEL E. NEEDHAM: If the market goes down, our revenue goes down. I think -- but we're long-term investors so there's going to be volatility in the flows and so we invest for the long term and we factor in variability in the sort of headline revenue that's going to come from markets. And so I think there's good returns in the asset management industry and business. And I think that in-built in that is the natural fluctuation in the markets. And so as an investor, we actually like the market volatility so we kind of -- you see the revenue go down but at the same time, you see opportunities open up for our investors. And so as surprising as it might sound, we actually get more excited when markets go down. But -- Trish?</p><p>TRICIA ROTHSCHILD: Sure. I'll just say from the licensed software perspective as an example and morningstar.com would be another place where you might see this, we are really a pretty big provider of trust and transparency, whether we're doing that directly with the investor or whether we're doing it through an intermediary like an adviser and the communication tools that an adviser uses from Morningstar to get the message across to the investor is relevant particularly in down markets or volatile markets. So I think that there is, in terms of like the purpose of our service, it actually holds up pretty well across different market environments.</p><p>JOHN GABBERT: And I think it depends how long, how bad. I think that we have a product that's quite sticky. And it's one thing in our world in private capital asset classes, most fund lives are 10 years and most actually extend out further than that, which, I think, makes them a little bit more resilient to some cycles. So I think that's one. Two is that I think -- I've been doing research private capital market since 1998, certainly some downturns through there. And I think when our customers or potential customers are taking a look at spend on data products, I think for our core markets, if we can ever get kind of that bake-off side-by-side, if they're looking to make an investment in another one versus us because they still need information to make decisions, I think that we usually fare quite well. So in general, yes. I like things when things are normal, hard, good and depends how long, how bad.</p><p>KUNAL KAPOOR: Yes. I think in summary, the way I think about it is if you look at our business today versus 10 years ago, we are probably more sensitive to economic market cycles than we were at that point. But I think if you look at our performance during the last downturn, it should give you a pretty good picture of the stickiness of our business and the resilience of the business. While it was a tough environment, we still stayed relatively profitable. And more importantly, we actually invested pretty heavily in the business during that last downturn. So that when things turned, we were ready to take advantage of it. In fact, Daniel's business, the one he's running today was a small business for us at that time and we stuck with it, poured money into it, kind of re-platformed somewhat and we're re-platforming again. But I think it's a good lesson in terms of how we might think about things. And it's one of the reasons we like to have a strong balance sheet because that's when you see interesting opportunities pop up. And even on the acquisition front, when money is cheap and everyone is out there selling their firm, there's, I think, people who are going to bid what seem like unnatural numbers to us. And certainly in a tougher cycle, there's fewer buyers who have sort of the flexibility and wherewithal that we do to move quickly when someone needs us to.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: This is just a follow-up, Daniel, on your businesses specifically. Is there a way to think about just the kind of underlying secular growth in the asset management business? And maybe as a thought experiment, let's say the market was flat for a number of years, what's kind of the underlying just from penetration and adding new clients that you can grow kind of assets in that business?</p><p>DANIEL E. NEEDHAM: Yes. I mean, I can't get into specifics but I mean, I was pretty flippant with my previous comment. I think in a flat market, we have organic growth because we expect gross inflows less redemptions. And so I think a target redemption rate for an asset management business would be kind of sub-15%. That's a good level for redemption rate. And so -- and then we're always looking to get good output per salesperson on the growth sort of flow side. And so you can kind of -- I mean, we're a multi-asset business, and so therefore, you can look at our assets and roughly work out that it's a 60-40 portfolio and you can kind of work backwards from there what the organic growth rates are.</p><p>KUNAL KAPOOR: I would say that on the managed portfolios business, I think there's also an opportunity to take market share from others that exist today. I think we're building a superior solution and when I look at the size of some other firms that operate in this space, I think that, in and of itself, is a good sign. I mean, SCI is a firm that we compete against and they're many multiples larger than we are today in the space. And I think we have an offering that can compete well against theirs, for instance. So I think in a flat market, that's the other part that we certainly have as we continue to really get advisers excited about what we are building and get them bought into our system. Getting them to think about shifting assets from other providers is a part of the strategy.</p><p>AMY ARNOTT: Here's another one from the web. For everybody up on the stage, what do you think is the biggest misconception about your business?</p><p>KUNAL KAPOOR: I think I tried to touch that. The question is what do we think is the biggest misconception of our business. I think the thing that we are best known for and obviously is the reason why we're all here today is often also something that perhaps limits the way people think about us. And I referenced that in our speech, which is obviously, we have this wonderful asset in the mutual fund realm with our data set, our research and our ratings. And that's an important part of our business. But our business is so much more than just that. And I think part of what we tried to do today is paint that story for you, that there's a lot of other things going on around that core. And we're hoping to continue to build on these things and ensure that, that great core we've built will really lead to good outcomes in investment management, good outcomes for PitchBook, good outcomes for our data business. And I think these are all things that maybe are not as well elevated in the conscience when people think about Morningstar.</p><p>JOHN GABBERT: Could I add something to that? I love to clarify misconceptions. We have an editorial team that has done an amazing job with our newsletters and reports. And we have over 500,000 daily subscribers to our PitchBook newsletters. We have 15,000 subscribers to our data platform. So a big misconception we have is, \"Oh yes, no, that newsletter. I get everything you guys have, your e-mails.\" It's great. It's like, have you ever seen the database? So that is one misconception, that wonderful newsletter, and if you don't get it, please do sign up but we also have this data platform. So thank you very much for the opportunity to share that with you.</p><p>EUGENE KRISHNAN: Just a question on the sort of professionalization of your sales organization. Again, this is something that you guys mentioned in the proxy both with Danny and Kunal, in terms of adding the infrastructure, I think the words were improved cadence and forecasting. So maybe you could give us some examples of what you guys have done. And should the output we think of this being you have better visibility to what your growth can be in your different businesses? Does it extend across the businesses or what's the output of that effort?</p><p>KUNAL KAPOOR: Thanks, Eugene. I told Danny to be prepared to answer a question. So I think your time has come, Danny, to maybe come and share a little bit of the journey that you've been on and some of the things that we're going on. So maybe just grab the mic and pop up here on the stage.</p><p>DANIEL DUNN, CHIEF REVENUE OFFICER, MORNINGSTAR, INC.: Yes, that's great. Thanks for the question and good to join all of you. This isn't my first visit from the crowd but I like the question. I think the way I would answer that is, if you simplify sales, it's really a business process, right? And I would argue it's probably the most critical business process inside of a company. I'm biased. But if we think about it as a business process, the way I looked at Morningstar as I came on board was foundational to running a sales organization and being able to integrate sales with product, marketing and downstream client service is very robust operations. So the way I think about that is -- I've been made fun of my buzzwords like cadence and things like that but essentially, it starts with a single process, single language that we use globally and a methodology globally to orchestrate and run our sales teams, right? And then we do that through a leading tech stack of Salesforce and Tableau. And the idea is essentially to drive insights into the business, into the units, into the products and the performance globally. And then what we like to do is pull that together as a team so that marketing, sales, product all see the same information. When we use the word cadence, what we're talking about is a repeatable way of engaging from field all the way up to leadership. It's consistent. We talked about the current quarter performance. We hold people accountable for their commitments, and we also talk about long-term performance. So we look at what we call the out-quarter performance. How's the pipeline build going across strategic initiatives? And how is it going across our transactional businesses as well? So that all comes together with cadence. Without it, I think you're sort of -- you're flying blind, right? And so as we think about how might we reorganize and optimize sales coverage, as we think about who our highest growth customers that matter the most as we introduce new products, you have to have that grounded in data and rigor. And so that's ultimately what we've done and we've got more work to do but we feel pretty good about the progress we've made.</p><p>KUNAL KAPOOR: John, maybe you want to weigh in here as well. You guys have a really solid process as well that I think is worth highlighting.</p><p>JOHN GABBERT: Yes. I think very similar to Danny's comments and yes, we're trying to create that repeatable process and really that system. And similarly, from our newsletter, generating leads, I think it's a system all the way through demand generation, lead nurturing, conversion to opportunities of sales qualified leads to conversion to customers and then continuing to develop those opportunities within our existing customer base. So I think very similar, we're always looking to create systems that we can scale and then systems that we can constantly tweak and refine, so.</p><p>JASON M. DUBINSKY: And yes, it's great having John's and his team as a part of this too because we've got some heritage Morningstar team members with great perspectives. We have my perspectives from big tech in thinking about scale, and we balance that with John's perspective on startup process and scale. And when that comes together in the room, that's how I think we can really innovate together. So yes, it's been great. We did just that yesterday. I thought it was good.</p><p>KUNAL KAPOOR: Great. Thank you, Danny. And I would just that a key part of our success on the sales side is going to be our ability to scale our marketing engine as well. So Rob Pinkerton and his team are focusing very heavily on that, and we're spending a lot of time and effort just to make sure that the digitization of our marketing efforts as well kind of catch up to where we need them to be and we've made really good progress.</p><p>AMY ARNOTT: It's another question from the web. Jason noted that ROIC is a key focus but only revenue and EBITDA are drivers of management incentive compensation. Why?</p><p>JASON M. DUBINSKY: Yes. So -- the question was that we're focusing on ROIC but that revenue and EBITDA are the only components in management compensation. So revenue and EBITDA are one component of management compensation and that's for our annual bonus. So if you look at our proxy materials, roughly half of management's compensation is tied to revenue performance, the other half to EBITDA performance. And that's managed through annual budget process and the way we set targets. But we do have a long-term compensation program and have -- and market stock units that are based on stock price performance over a longer period of time, so consider that like our long-term incentive plan. And I would say that given our stock price should be relatively correlated to ROIC, I think that there are incentives aligned with making sure that we drive long-term performance the right returns, and we benefit from improvements in our stock price performance as our shareholders do.</p><p>AMY ARNOTT: We have one last question from the web. John, what are some secular trends that can be headwinds for your business over the long term and how can you address them?</p><p>JOHN GABBERT: Yes. I mean, I think we talked about potential downturns again, depends how bad, how long. I think as behaviors change, people's use of data potentially changes. I mean, I currently view all those as opportunities for us. I think private capital markets haven't used data as much as public markets have. And I think that our markets are continuing to get more and more sophisticated regularly. So I think it is just that overall downturn potentially. Again, I think we addressed that a little bit earlier. But I don't know if there's other things in particular, but I don't know.</p><p>KUNAL KAPOOR: I would just say, I mean, certainly because of the growth in interest in that space that you see a lot more competition potentially entering. You're certainly seeing some larger companies try to pay attention to that. You're seeing some startups getting funding in that space, which are covered by PitchBook. And so I think obviously, there's a little bit of that going on. But if you look at where we are today and what PitchBook has built, it is very hard to replicate the data set that's already been built. And I think people underestimate how difficult that is and even some of the startups that have tried to make a run at PitchBook are increasingly sort of cleaving off and doing very different things because they just can't close the gap on the data set without massive amounts of investment. So I would agree with John that I think it's more sort of macro factors that are probably the key risks for PitchBook at this stage more so than anything else.</p><p>No more questions on the web? Any more questions in the room? Anything that we can answer for you before we adjourn the meeting? Okay. Going once? One question. Scott [Raymond], yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: (inaudible)</p><p>KUNAL KAPOOR: Scott's question is when are we going to end of life the desktop software?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: All cloud.</p><p>KUNAL KAPOOR: And be all in the cloud?</p><p>TRICIA ROTHSCHILD: That's a good question. And we are, as I said earlier, at the moment, enticing folks to go there. And we are looking for efficiencies kind of in terms of how we end up getting there. So it's a couple of years, I would say.</p><p>KUNAL KAPOOR: I think we are going to make a pretty concerted effort in the next 12 months to start moving people over as more of that functionality hits the cloud.</p><p>TRICIA ROTHSCHILD: Yes.</p><p>KUNAL KAPOOR: So we feel like we're at a tipping point in terms of where the functionality in the cloud has gotten to a place where it's not only the new stuff but key things that people have used on a desktop version of Direct, for instance. And they've kind of gotten it in there. So that's been one of the biggest challenges as people have not wanted to migrate because they're used to running their processes in the desktop version. And I think as we've closed the gap in that functionality, that's going to be a pretty big leap forward. So I think when we're sitting here next year, you're going to have seen some pretty dramatic progress on that front, Scott. We think about that a lot, actually. It's a good question because it kind of goes to the heart of your earlier question on just efficiencies and the way we think about that as it pertains to the software business.</p><p>Great. Any further questions? Anything that we can answer for you? All right. Well, I want to thank all of you again for making the trip out to Chicago and for being our partners. We very much appreciate your being here, and as always, I look forward to continuing our partnership. Feel free to keep sending in questions that we'll answer every month for you and we look forward to seeing you back here next year as well. So thank you.

The Wall Street firm is expected to name fewer than 100 new partners this fall, one of the smallest classes in recent years, according to people briefed on the matter but not authorized to speak on the record.</p><p>In an effort to reward its top consistent producers, Goldman spends months vetting potential partners every two years. Those selected are typically rewarded lavishly and have an inside track to top jobs at the firm. In 2010, 110 new partners were named.</p><p>But this year Goldman will be more selective. The firm has cut its head count over the last year by more than 8 percent, to 32,400 employees, to cope with reduced revenue amid difficult markets and new regulations.

The Haitian immigrant was en route to Timmins, in northeastern Ontario, hoping to set up a medical practice there, but a restaurant owner in Mattawa convinced him to hang out his shingle there instead. The respected physician, who had tended to the wounded when Dominican troops slaughtered more than 12,000 Haitians in the Parsley Massacre of 1937, was Mattawa's doctor until 1964, when he was elected mayor. He also served as the national director of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, and in John McNeil's photo of Sept. 5, 1967, Monestime is giving a warm welcome to George Hees, who was running for the leadership of the party. The good doctor would remain mayor of his adoptive hometown until his death on Oct. 27, 1977. - Massimo Commanducci</p><p>If you'd like to receive this newsletter by e-mail every weekday morning, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/newsletters/?utm_source=Arcnewsletter&amp;utm_medium=onsite&amp;utm_campaign=fixed_positions&amp;utm_term=signuppage&amp;utm_content=morning_update_promo\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/newsletters/?utm_source=Arcnewsletter&amp;utm_medium=onsite&amp;utm_campaign=fixed_positions&amp;utm_term=signuppage&amp;utm_content=morning_update_promo</url> to sign up.

All of this would require resources to tackle, not less,\" he added.</p><p>Governments across North America have been under pressure to cut funding or reform law enforcement agencies after police officers were charged in the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.</p><p>Provinces scramble to deliver real-time data on school COVID-19 infections</p><p>Quebec has promised to deliver real-time data on COVID-19 cases and outbreaks to help keep parents informed as students head back to school.

But, above all, it should remind us that the courts cannot improve medicare, or remedy the waiting times problem. Only forward-looking public policy can ensure timely and equitable access to care, and that's where we should be focusing our efforts, not on pesky gadflies like Dr. Day.\"</p><p>Robyn Urback: \"We all want to survive this pandemic, surely. But comforting ourselves with low or stagnant death numbers, particularly when we don't know enough about chronic, potentially irreversible complications (and the incidence thereof) from the disease, is to take a myopic view of a pandemic that could plague health care systems in a different way long after the acute crisis is over. Those who fervently oppose continued lockdown measures may call this argument yet another attempt at 'fear-mongering.' But most others, I'd wager, would just call it 'science.' \"</p><p>Preston Lim: \"The most natural way forward would be to drag China before an unbiased and respected international tribunal, such as the International Court of Justice (ICJ) or International Criminal Court (ICC). That would demonstrate that what's happening in Xinjiang isn't just antithetical to Western values, but also represents a violation of international law. Such a ruling might also impose costs and restrictions on third-party countries that have continued to co-operate with China despite its actions.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TODAY'S EDITORIAL CARTOON</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIVING BETTER</emphasis></p><p>Fall film preview: The most exciting movies definitely, probably, maybe coming out this upside-down season</p><p>The fall is typically the most important season for the movie industry as all of the award-worthy films are released.

His time as secretary is widely heralded as bringing stability to the treasury and the country's economy.</p><p>Hamilton wanted the U.S. to move away from an agricultural focus to a market economy with robust international trade and growing industry. He supported strong central government in his quest to establish national wealth and power and maintain political order in the then-young country. He also created a plan for a national bank to assist the country in any financial crisis and helped to establish the U.S. Mint.</p><p>Hamilton served until Jan. 31, 1795, at which point he had grown dissatisfied with what he saw as a lack of a comprehensive plan to fix public debt. Today, the story of Hamilton's life and death as an American founding father is immortalized in Lin-Manuel Miranda's critically acclaimed musical Hamilton. Although Hamilton must have predicted some legacy for himself, it's unlikely he anticipated it would include 46 hip-hop songs.

He wanted Australia to be the world's \"model\" country. \"I want Australia to be in the leadership pack, if not even at the front of that pack, when it comes to our success,\" he told reporters in Melbourne on Thursday.\"I want us to be the model jurisdiction in the world.\" This is an admirable sentiment, the sort of ambition and leadership Australians want from their national leader.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But he was talking about only one particular field - the digital economy. It's a vital field, and a commendable aim. He announced a series of policy steps to tame the Big Tech buccaneers and protect Australia's national interests. Among those interests were the privacy of citizens. And, he said, he was also advancing \"the safety of our children at the same time as realising the benefits to our economy that comes from these digital technologies\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We want our cake and we want to eat it when it comes to digital in Australia,\" said Morrison. \"We want the benefits for the public and our economy.\" Absolutely.</p><p>His government is pioneering in bringing these rampaging multinational corporations into the realm of civilised behaviour. Morrison, with New Zealand's Jacinda Ardern, led the world in demanding that Facebook and other sites prevent the live-streaming of atrocities after the Christchurch terrorist attack.</p><p>And now he's moving to the broader agenda. Big Tech has had 23 years to do exactly what Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg urged in his company's old motto: \"Move fast and break things.\" Because 23 years ago, the US Congress passed a law that actually suspended the normal operation of law so that the tech industry could have unique advantages, section 230 of the US Communications Decency Act. This gave the tech companies a special immunity - they're not responsible for what others put on their platforms.</p><p>That is the root of the problem. No one noticed when they were quirky, fun, garage start-ups. But now that they are among the biggest and most ruthless corporations on the planet, governments everywhere are waking up.</p><p>With the Big Tech firms blithely enabling child abuse, criminal fraud, rampant misinformation and foreign undermining of democratic elections while making vast profits from it all, Morrison stated that \"we are not going to put up with this\".</p><p>So why stop there? On the same day, in the same press conference, he addressed the bushfires, drought and climate change. Why not declare his ambition for Australia to lead the world in firefighting best practice and innovation, drought management and climate change?</p><p>But no. Suddenly the emphasis was on the limitations of Australia's powers, not the breadth of its ambitions. He didn't squarely address the problems but stressed that existing government policy was adequate. \"The Commonwealth, the federal government, is responding to all of the needs that have been presented to us by our state and territory authorities,\" he assured.</p><p>\"We have over 200,000 registered firefighters in this country. That is an enormous, an enormous national resource, which we value greatly. They are supported for their equipment and needs by our state and territory governments. And that is where that support is provided. And they deal with the Commonwealth for broader nationally co-ordinated efforts.\"</p><p>Good to know, Prime Minister, but hardly leadership. Decoded, \"it's someone else's problem, but we help when we're asked\".</p><p>He made the case for Australian activism on the digital economy, but he argued for complacency on the urgent crisis preoccupying his people.</p><p>If anything, he sought to minimise the current demands for help and leadership as being merely youthful hysteria at a bit of smoke haze. \"I'm a Sydneysider and I know how unusual it is to see that haze across my city. And I know how distressing that has been, particularly for young people who wouldn't have seen that before.\"</p><p>Apart from the condescension, there's the implicit assurance that it's all just business as usual. The former NSW commissioner of fire and rescue, Greg Mullins, says repeatedly that climate change has introduced a \"step change\" in the nature of drought and fire in Australia.</p><p>But Morrison knows better, evidently. \"I do remember Sydney being ringed by fire in my lifetime. I remember as a young fellow being down at the beach and seeing smoke all around as I looked back out from the surf across the sand and I've seen it before.\" What would an internationally recognised firefighting expert know?</p><p>With masses of evidence of the physical harm to Australia's people, the mental illnesses building up across a frightened community under stress, the practical problems of firefighter exhaustion, pressures on small business who have freed their employees to battle blazes, and so on, the country is crying out for leadership. Instead it got excuses.</p><p>He didn't urge Australia to be calm about the misconduct of Big Tech, but he urged the country to be calm about the fires and the choking smoke haze that repeatedly descends on some of Australia's main cities.</p><p>Perhaps the saddest of all was hearing the Prime Minister regurgitate the hoary excuse for inaction on climate change - that Australia accounts for only 1.3 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>This is what the former High Court judge and banking royal commissioner Kenneth Hayne has described as \"learned helplessness\" on emissions. You could make the same excuse on regulating the tech titans. Australia this year accounts for 1.1 per cent of global retail e-commerce, according to Statista. Did Morrison cite this in announcing his plan to assert sovereignty over the digital economy? Did he say, \"anything Australia does will not make a difference\"? Of course not.</p><p>If Australia surrendered to this self-declared helplessness, it would never contribute to solving any shared problem. We certainly would not have fought for the defeat of fascism in WWII, for example, or taken part in the Montreal Protocol that successfully saved the earth's ozone layer.</p><p>Morrison sees the whole complex of problems - fire, drought, water shortage and climate - as a political risk for himself and his government. After years of Coalition civil war over climate change, Morrison does not want to upset the delicate ceasefire. And it has worked for him. So far.</p><p>But the balance of risk is changing. The raging fires, the drought, the water shortages, not caused by climate change but intensified by it, are changing attitudes in Australia. Rather than play a grudging catch-up later, Morrison has the opportunity to lead. Not by rushing to take selfies with Greta Thunberg and announcing a target of zero emissions by Monday.</p><p>The big opportunity is to smash the whole paradigm that has held Australia in paralysis for a decade. Renewable energy is a multi-trillion-dollar growth industry. Australia already is participating, but largely in spite of federal government policy, not because of it. With an immobilised federal government sitting in the middle of the landscape, Australia is working around it. Households are installing huge acreage of solar panels, companies are investing tens of billions in new power generating capacity, state governments are setting their own renewable energy targets. Imagine how Australia's economy could be energised, in every sense of the word, by a nationally co-ordinated drive to be the world leader in this enormous growth industry. Australia has the opportunity to be the lowest-cost electricity supplier on the planet. This is exactly the scenario explained in Ross Garnaut's new book Superpower. This would be a competitive advantage for Australian industry and the entire economy.</p><p>Morrison has the opportunity to transform Australia's politics as well as its economy and climate policy. Champion an economic opportunity for Australia to lead in one of the biggest growth sectors of the early 21st century.</p><p>Rather than persisting with the dead-end dichotomy of \"cheap electricity versus climate action\", he can take the lead in enlarging an existing investment boom, creating a strong economy, with the cheapest electricity, and dramatically cutting carbon output as a result. He would be able to pledge \"the safety of our children at the same time as realising the benefits to our economy that comes from these renewable technologies\".</p><p>If he were to move early, he could secure economic and climate advantage for Australia and shut out Labor, depriving it of one of its major campaign strengths. The politics of complacency can succeed against the realities of intensifying fires, drought, water shortages and climate change for a while. But not forever. Fire season began in winter this year. This is not business as usual.</p><p>Peter Hartcher is political editor.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-doc78dttfbtth31ezf7ibku</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XR7-V5D1-F0J6-J3RW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1457\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

Microsofthas pledged it wouldn't use such patents to block competitors. But off-loading the patents to a third party provides an easy way for Micro-soft to avoid the litigation, but still reap the benefits, Googleclaims.</p><p>\"Nokia and Microsoftare colluding to raise the costs of mobile de-vices for consumers, creating patent trolls that sidestep promises both companies have made,\" Mountain View, California-based Googlesaid in an emailed statement.</p><p>These \"patent trolls\" use exclusive rights to a product idea to demand royalties rather than to make products.</p><p>Even though the practice of patent litigation is perfectly legal, the sheer number of patents in the technology industry concerning software and proprietary designs has made an effective legal department the corner-stone of any major digital company.</p><p>Companies have been suing one another over everything from the way users interact with cellular phones through to camera technology and even the wireless technologies that allow most modern devices to work.</p><p>Collecting a trove of patents is seen as the best defence against litigation, as it allows companies to negotiate to share technology and avoid ending up in court.</p><p>According to Google, the deal with Mosaid gives Microsoftand Nokia a share of any proceeds the Canadian company gets from licensing the patents.</p><p>Mosaid hasn't seen Google's com-plaint and so couldn't comment, said Michael Salter, a Mosaid spokesman. The company was taken private in December in a transaction led by Chicago-based Sterling Partners.</p><p>Mosaid's Core Wireless unit, which holds the patents obtained from Microsoftand Nokia, filed a patent suit in February against Apple.</p><p>Mosaid sold five patent families for $11 million in September. Googlewas later identified as the buyer.</p><p>When the deal was announced in September of last year, Mosaid shares rose to their highest level in more than a year.</p><p>That helped to prevent a takeover bid from rival Ottawa patent and licensing firm Wi-LAN Inc., which does similar litigation.</p><p>The complex deal involved a Luxembourg holding company that controlled many of Nokia's patents regarding cellular technology.</p><p>The deal came after the announcement of a major partnership between Microsoftand Nokia to distribute cellphones based on the rebooted Windows Phone operating system. The Nokia Lumia 900, the result of this agreement, went on sale in Canada in April. Google's antitrust complaint is the latest in a long-running patent war between big tech firms. It may prompt an investigation by the same European Union antitrust authority that is probing Google's Motorola Mobility over its use of patents in litigation against Microsoftand Apple Inc.</p><p>Antoine Colombani, a spokesman for the European Commission in Brussels, confirmed that regulators had received the filing and said they would examine it.</p><p>With files from Citizen news services</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CANWNS-142757528</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CANWNS2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:55TM-B1M1-F125-148K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">335915</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-10-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"620\"/><timeReceived>01:02 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 Canwest News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canwest News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"06\" year=\"2012\"><dateText>June 5, 2012 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Microsoft has pledged it wouldn't use such patents to block competitors. But off-loading the patents to a third party provides an easy way for Micro-soft to avoid the litigation, but still reap the benefits, Googleclaims.</p><p>\"Nokia and Microsoft are colluding to raise the costs of mobile de-vices for consumers, creating patent trolls that sidestep promises both companies have made,\" Mountain View, California-based Googlesaid in an emailed statement.</p><p>These \"patent trolls\" use exclusive rights to a product idea to demand royalties rather than to make products.</p><p>Even though the practice of patent litigation is perfectly legal, the sheer number of patents in the technology industry concerning software and proprietary designs has made an effective legal department the corner-stone of any major digital company.</p><p>Companies have been suing one another over everything from the way users interact with cellular phones through to camera technology and even the wireless technologies that allow most modern devices to work.</p><p>Collecting a trove of patents is seen as the best defence against litigation, as it allows companies to negotiate to share technology and avoid ending up in court.</p><p>According to Google, the deal with Mosaid gives Microsoft and Nokia a share of any proceeds the Canadian company gets from licensing the patents.</p><p>Mosaid hasn't seen Google's com-plaint and so couldn't comment, said Michael Salter, a Mosaid spokesman. The company was taken private in December in a transaction led by Chicago-based Sterling Partners.</p><p>Mosaid's Core Wireless unit, which holds the patents obtained from Microsoft and Nokia, filed a patent suit in February against Apple.</p><p>Mosaid sold five patent families for $11 million in September. Googlewas later identified as the buyer.</p><p>When the deal was announced in September of last year, Mosaid shares rose to their highest level in more than a year.</p><p>That helped to prevent a takeover bid from rival Ottawa patent and licensing firm Wi-LAN Inc., which does similar litigation.</p><p>The complex deal involved a Luxembourg holding company that controlled many of Nokia's patents regarding cellular technology.</p><p>The deal came after the announcement of a major partnership between Microsoft and Nokia to distribute cellphones based on the rebooted Windows Phone operating system. The Nokia Lumia 900, the result of this agreement, went on sale in Canada in April. Google's antitrust complaint is the latest in a long-running patent war between big tech firms. It may prompt an investigation by the same European Union antitrust authority that is probing Google's Motorola Mobility over its use of patents in litigation against Microsoft and Apple Inc.</p><p>Antoine Colombani, a spokesman for the European Commission in Brussels, confirmed that regulators had received the filing and said they would examine it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OTTAWA-142722492OTCT</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OTTAWA2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:55TD-VTP1-DY2T-823V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"614\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 Ottawa Citizen, a division of CanWest MediaWorks Publication Inc.

Most Americans apparently just don't know that truth also extends to the tech sector.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Leading non-profit public opinion research organization Pew Research Center released a new report Wednesday measuring the digital literacy of American adults across topics like cybersecurity and the tech industry. Called the Americans and Digital Knowledge report, the results were pretty dismal: a majority of respondents could answer fewer than half of the ten (for the most part very basic) questions correctly.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> One question concerned Facebook's sprawling business interests. Pew asked survey respondents whether they thought that Facebook owns Instagram and WhatsApp (it does). Just 29 percent of people surveyed correctly answered in the affirmative \u2014 meaning that over 70 percent of Americans don't know that Facebook owns Instagram and WhatsApp.</p><p> That's not the most stable foundation of public knowledge for any potential future anti-trust inquiries into Facebook's ownership of Instagram and WhatsApp.</p><p> Rather than being misinformed, however, most Americans are actually under-informed. While 22 percent answered incorrectly, nearly half - 49 percent - responded that they were \"not sure\" whether Facebook owned Instagram and WhatsApp.</p><p>Pew says that this result indicates that people's use of social media is out of joint with their understanding of the companies.</p><p> \"We found that even as a majority of American adults use Facebook, they aren't that knowledgeable about some aspects related to the business side of the company,\" Monica Anderson, Pew's associate director of research, told Mashable. \"Only around 20% correctly identified WhatsApp and Instagram as two companies owned by the company. And around half reported being unsure. So there is relatively low levels of familiarity with the company's assets \u2013 and that is true across demographic groups.\"</p><p> For the survey, in June, Pew asked a nationally representative sample of 4,272 US adults the ten questions. It included questions like knowing the function of a web cookie, identifying an example of two-factor authentication, and whether people could identify Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey in a photo (nope! Only 15 percent of people got that one!).</p><p> Overall, people were mostly just confused about what was going on, with a popular response to many questions being \"not sure.\"</p><p> \"Although the share of Americans who can correctly answer these questions varies from topic to topic, in most cases the share providing an actual incorrect answer is relatively small,\" Anderson said. \"Users are more likely to indicate that they simply are not sure of the correct answer which indicates an unfamiliarity with many of these tech-focused concepts.\"</p><p> The survey also recorded demographics information, like age and education level.</p><p> Younger Americans (18-29 and 30-49) were more knowledgeable about Facebook's business tentacles than older ones (50-64 and 65+). Nearly 40 percent of people in the two younger groups responded affirmatively to Facebook's interest in Instagram and WhatsApp.</p><p> That spread extended to education level, too. Respondents who had graduated college answered correctly 41 percent of the time.</p><p> But even these numbers on the higher end of the spectrum demonstrate a lack of knowledge by people who are likely regular users of the various platforms. Another Pew survey found that 69 percent of Americans use Facebook. Meanwhile, 37 percent use Instagram and 20 percent use WhatsApp. Many of those Instagram users are young people: 75 percent of 18-24 year olds say they use Instagram.</p><p> Why does it matter if people know the extent of Facebook's ownership in the social media and messaging world? People are starting to become wiser to the amount of data Facebook harvests from its users, and its highly personal advertising targeting practices. This has caused backlash against Facebook in the form of declining sentiment and stagnating growth. The situation was helped along by Russian operatives' use of Facebook to manipulate the 2016 election in favor of Donald Trump and inflame political sentiments overall.</p><p> The bigger a data and advertising company is, the harder it is to detangle its tentacles from your life.</p><p> However, all the measures people might take in the wake of these scandals to protect their privacy and decrease their exposure to divisive ads is moot if they're also using Instagram. Facebook gets that information and revenue, too. Incidentally, user numbers show that as people sour on Facebook, the popularity of Instagram continues to explode.</p><p> That's an especially urgent problem considering that just Tuesday, a Bipartisan Senate report detailed how instrumental Instagram is especially in disseminating Russian information campaigns.</p><p> Amid these scandals, there have been calls from political candidates, like Elizabeth Warren, and current government bodies, to investigate big tech companies including Facebook to determine whether they are a monopoly. In addition to concerns about anti-competitive behavior, Facebook's consolidation with Instagram and WhatsApp presents a problem for consumers, too: The bigger a data and advertising company is, the harder it is to detangle its tentacles from your life.</p><p> Even if users aren't wholly aware of Facebook's dominance, that doesn't mean they don't want action. A previous Pew survey found that half of Americans think tech companies should be subject to more regulation.</p><p> Other surveys have noted Americans' less than comprehensive knowledge of Facbook's business practices before. But the Pew survey places it in context: not only do people know about who's running the internet, there's also a dearth of knowledge about how to protect ourselves.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>All of these things are just like the others.

That concern has fuelled in part by some some of the firms' extraordinary efforts to limit their taxation, about the lack of diversity within Silicon Valley, and controversies such as the one last August when Googlefired an engineer who had written and posted a ten-page memo arguing for less concern about gender inequality in the workplace.</p><p>Billionaire investor George </p><p>Soros</p><p> calls more stringent regulations for monopolies like Googleand Facebook</p><p>Last October, in what was perhaps the first effort by Congress to regulate big technology firms, which spend millions of dollars lobbying the government.</p><p>Republican John McCain and two Democratic unveiled a bill that would force Facebook, Googleand others to disclose who is purchasing online political advertising.</p><p>When releasing the first legislative response to revelations that Russians used tech platforms to interfere in the 2016 election, the senators said their bill was intended to defend the bedrock of the US's political system.</p><p>During a news conference, the Democratic co-sponsors of the bill - senators Amy Klobuchar and Mark Warner - said they were angry at how foreign actors had been able to take advantage of loopholes in current laws to threaten the integrity of the US election system.</p><p>\"Our entire democracy was founded on the simple idea that the people in our country should be self-governing,\" Ms Klobuchar said.</p><p>\"Now 240 years later, our democracy is at risk.

In the past, Silicon Valley was going to put a computer on our desks, a phone in our pockets and, eventually, connect us all with fun social networks. The public not only believed these changes were generally good, they also felt they understood them,\" he said.</p><p>He said he believed the level of the backlash was already having an impact. \"You see Facebook's numbers dropping, smartphone sales are leveling off, etc. It's just the beginning, but tech is losing its lustre,\" he added.</p><p>The Axios survey found that while 82 per cent of Americans believed that technology has an overall positive effect on society, 55 per cent thought special media hurt democracy and free speech, more than it helped it.</p><p>Around 80 per cent blamed technology companies for not doing more to safeguard their platforms against election interference.</p><p>Read more</p><p>How tech giants have transformed San Francisco's skyline</p><p>Sequoia Capital invests $50m in Bristol-based AI startup</p><p>The Uber whistleblower that refused to be torn down by Silicon Valley</p><p>Last week, Barack Obama told a conference at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, that firms such as Facebookand Googleneeded to have a conversation about their business models and recognise they were both \"a public good and a commercial enterprise\".</p><p>\"We have to have serious conversation about what are the business models, the algorithms, (and) the mechanics whereby we can create more of a common conversation and that cannot just be a commercially driven conversation,\" he said.</p><p>Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who is investigating alleged Russian interference in the 2016 US election and possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, has indicted 13 Russians and outlined details of the way they sought to use social media to post fake news and divisive opinions during and after the election.</p><p>Charles Cooper, who has been writing about technology and business for three decades, said he believed it may not be wise to attach too much value to a single poll. He said previous news cycles, whether it was the alleged role of computer games in inspiring the Columbine massacre shooters or the controversy over net neutrality, pushed issues over technology to the top of the agenda, only to see them subsequently fade.</p><p>\"We're just a very fickle nation with a very short attention span,\" he said.</p><p>\"Tech issues can get complicated and most people have neither the time nor the inclination to dig very deep, I'm afraid.\"</p><p>Read more</p><p>Bill Gates basically predicted rise of Netflix and Facebookin 1994</p><p>Denise Howell, a writer and intellectual property and technology lawyer based in Newport Beach, California, said firms such as Facebook, Google, and Yahoo had taken some steps to counter public concern, though probably not enough to prevent government regulation.</p><p>\"They have not sufficiently anticipated the scope and potential impact of public awareness and outrage. They could and should have done a better job of managing their platforms and public expectations,\" she said. </p><p>\"Had they done so, the public and its elected representatives might be more inclined to take a hands-off approach, conclude that market forces are sufficient checks on concerning policies and practices, and leave the regulatory landscape alone.\"</p><p>She added: \"It behooves Silicon Valley to get out in front of this policy and public relations battle effectively and immediately. If it does not, lawmakers will inevitably weigh in to address their constituents' concerns. </p><p>\"Lawmakers historically have demonstrated an imperfect understanding of the interplay between the internet and public interest, and may unwittingly pass knee-jerk, apple-polishing measures that fail to foresee their collateral damage.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INPDWB-41823818</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INPDWB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RS1-H2S1-JCJY-G1WF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1181\"/><timeReceived>4:25 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Independent Digital News and Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Independent (United Kingdom)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19720\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"02\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>February 28, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

majority of Australians oppose harvesting of their personal information by apps and websites, with three-quarters reporting they are uncomfortable with the on-sale or government provision of their data to businesses.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Essential poll of 1,075 respondents found that a majority were also uncomfortable with the government providing other agencies with information for national security purposes (58%) or facial recognition to restrict access to content not suitable for children (56%).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The poll found that just 19% of users claim to have fully read and understood the terms and conditions of websites they use and about the same number (18%) say they never read the terms, they just accept them.</p><p>Most users are somewhere in between, reading the terms but not understanding the implications (21%) or reading the terms \"sometimes ... depending on the website\" (38%).</p><p>The majority of respondents were uncomfortable with commercial platforms selling their data (76%) and the government providing their data to businesses (74%).</p><p>About two-thirds of respondents were uncomfortable with the government (66%) or commercial online platforms (65%) \"offering products and services based on [their] personal information and behaviour\".</p><p>The most likely to object use of personal information for national security reasons were Greens voters (65%) or \"other\" voters for minor parties or independents (70%), with facial recognition for age verification also the most unpopular among those groups.</p><p>Across age groups, people aged 18-34 were less likely to report being uncomfortable with all forms of data collection than those aged 35-54 or 55 and above.</p><p>The results, released on Thursday, mark the launch of the Australia Institute's new Centre for Responsible Technology, to be headed by the Essential Media executive director, Peter Lewis.</p><p>Lewis said the results reflect \"increased public distrust at the data models at the very heart of the business strategies of big tech organisations like Facebook and Google\".</p><p>\"They also show a breakdown of trust in the government to collect information in the public interest,\" he said. \"What is most confounding about these results is that the public is uncomfortable with the use of data in the precise ways they routinely consent to it being used.\"</p><p>The centre aims to develop a set of rules and standards to control how organisations handle personal information and to help people make choices about how their information is used.</p><p>In July, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/inquiries-ongoing/digital-platforms-inquiry\">Australian Competition and Consumer

updated</url> to give users greater control over their personal information, the ability to move the data from one company to another, to have the data destroyed and to require greater levels of consent from users before personal information is collected.</p><p>In responding to the report, the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said: \"There is no option other than to put in place the right regulatory and legislative regime to protect the public's privacy.</p><p>\"What this report finds is that so much personal data is being collected without informed consent,\" he said.</p><p>In

A third of Canadians (33 per cent) say the platforms are making society better.</p><p>\"That is just shocking, the amount of negative attitude that Canadians are feeling toward these tech companies,\" Lorne Bozinoff, president of Forum Research, said in an interview. \"Let's face it. The experience with these companies has been horrific from a public and users point of view. And there seems to be no remorse or concern or real corrective action taken by them.\"</p><p>Bozinoff said what's unusual is that voters of all political parties share the negative attitude.</p><p>\"It's the one thing Canadians seem to agree on, no matter the political philosophy,\" he said. \"Attitudes can change pretty quickly. We saw this with climate change, and now we see it with technology, where people seem to be more concerned.\"</p><p>While Forum's own polling shows the environment is top of mind for Canadian voters, the negative attitude toward Big Tech is actually a more unifying issue across all parties, said Bozinoff.</p><p>\"Everyone agrees that the environment is an issue, although Tory voters are less concerned than the other three progressive parties.\"</p><p>\"But in the case of technology, we hardly ever see a poll where everyone across the spectrum agrees.\"</p><p>According to Forum, 83 per cent of Canadians agree that large technology companies have an ethical duty to ensure their products are not causing harm.</p><p>Some 81 per cent say that they should be responsible for ensuring that the information distributed on their sites is accurate and not fake news.</p><p>\"There is real concern out there by Canadians, because the companies don't seem to adhere to the traditional corporate responsibility model that they should be contributing to the good of society,\" said Bozinoff.</p><p>\"The old rule was that if you were good for society, then it would avoid government intervention. But that doesn't seem to be the case.\"</p><p>According to a report released in September by the International News Media Association (INMA), more than 100 inquiries or legal cases against the tech giants are underway.</p><p>It has been a watershed year for antitrust and other investigations by global regulators even as public sentiment has continued to shift.</p><p>In Canada, the relationship with some of the tech platforms has deteriorated markedly. This year the country's privacy czar filed suit against Facebook for allegedly violating laws over user consent and personal information. And Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg defied a subpoena by a parliamentary ethics committee in Ottawa, refusing to testify.</p><p>\"There has been an unprecedented rise in the number of official inquiries into digital platforms' global activities,\" said Robert Whitehead, a former editor of the Sydney Morning Herald and author of the INMA report.</p><p>\"There is also alignment emerging among regulators that the platforms have become too dominant in key areas.\"</p><p>(Torstar president and CEO John Boynton is a board member of the association.)</p><p>The Forum poll shows 61 per cent of Canadians say they would approve of stronger laws for the Big Tech companies operating in Canada. This is in line with a poll released last month by the Ryerson Leadership Lab that showed 60 per cent of Canadians are in favour of more government regulation of social media platforms.</p><p>\"Tech was supposed to be the new frontier. There was an idea with some of the public that this was a place where there wouldn't be censorship or restrictions, but it has now backfired,\" Bozinoff said.</p><p>\"The public is getting tired and don't appreciate the manipulation. The old mainstream media used to take care with fact-checking and accuracy and there seems to be none of that online.\"</p><p>An exclusive survey of the main political parties released this month by the Star shows that all are in agreement that there needs to be more oversight of Big Tech.</p><p>The issue is how to update Canada's antiquated copyright and taxation laws for the digital era.</p><p>\"Technology has been a great enabler for progress, but with everything there's a balance,\" Mary Ng, minister of small business and export promotion, said in a statement to the Star on Friday. \"That's ... why we introduced our country's first ever Digital Charter. The initiative protects Canadians' privacy and personal data, while also enabling them to leverage their innovative talents and strengths to harness the power of the digital economy.\"</p><p>The Liberals have so far been the most aggressive of the parties in tackling the issue, announcing that they would follow the example of the French government by introducing a three per cent tax on large digital companies operating in Canada.</p><p>The Conservatives have said they believe in a \"level playing field,\" and that public policy should \"keep up with a rapidly changing marketplace.\"</p><p>The New Democratic Party said it would ensure web giants \"play by the same rules\" as Canadian companies. The Green party came out strongly in support of the European Union and its leading policies on privacy, copyright and taxation.</p><p>In that sense, the politicians are in line with public sentiment. Canadians also happen to be in substantial agreement that there shouldn't be an uneven playing field between digital platforms and legacy media when it comes to taxation.</p><p>The Forum poll found 79 per cent of Canadians agreed that large technology companies based outside the country should be charged taxes on sales of advertising displayed in Canada. (Because they may not have a substantial physical presence or headquarters in the countries where they operate, many of the big platforms pay little to no tax in the countries where they do business.)</p><p>\"The idea that certain companies aren't taxed because they're not really operating in Canada, or that they're on the internet so they really aren't operating anywhere, doesn't fly with Canadians,\" said Bozinoff.</p><p>\"They are saying these companies are doing millions of dollars' worth of business and commercial activity in our country. And they're not paying their fair share. There is huge agreement. This doesn't sit right with Canadians.\"</p><p>The Forum Poll was conducted Sept. 30 to Oct. 1 in a phone survey of 1,853 randomly selected Canadians. Results are considered accurate plus or minus three percentage points, 19 times out of 20.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2019100655904382</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X6R-KKJ1-DY91-K18R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1106\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 6, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It was conducted in August for the Ryerson Leadership Lab.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"There seems to be support for change in these platforms,\" says Sam Andrey, director of policy and research for the university think tank, which studies leadership and the democratic process. \"Attitudes are definitely shifting. More people than not think there is a role for government.\"</p><p>The poll didn't ask exactly how government should regulate Big Tech, but most respondents supported moves such as requiring platforms to delete illegal content such as hate speech in a timely manner (77 per cent) or posts that intentionally spread misinformation (75 per cent). Respondents also supported requiring platforms to develop third-party fact checking verification of news posts, and increasing digital and media literary education (70 per cent).</p><p>However, only 36 per cent said they were strongly or somewhat supportive of breaking up social media platforms like Facebook, while 45 per cent were neutral on the issue. Nineteen per cent of respondents felt strongly, or somewhat did not support breaking up the platforms.</p><p>Among social media companies, Facebook is the least trusted by Canadians. But social media companies in general rank the lowest in trust overall, below that of oil companies, telecom providers, banks and traditional news media.</p><p>Andrey says there's been a shift in public sentiment in the wake of scandals involving privacy, data dumping, fake news and targeted political advertising that have made Canadians more skeptical of Big Tech.</p><p>\"I think in the wake of issues such as Brexit, the Trump presidency and Cambridge Analytica, you are seeing a general distrust of social media,\" Andrey says.</p><p>The survey revealed that 95 per cent of respondents get their information from Google search compared to 86 per cent from television and 73 per cent from print newspapers.</p><p>Ryerson also asked whether Canadians should go the route of France and impose a three per cent tax on large technology companies. The U.S. has pushed back against the tax, saying it unfairly targets U.S. companies.</p><p>Because big technology companies typically aren't headquartered in the countries they do business in, critics say they pay far less taxes than they should be required to, which has become a bone of contention for lawmakers globally.</p><p>Thirty-eight per cent of Canadians either strongly or somewhat supported a tax, while 30 per cent strongly or somewhat didn't support the tax, showing that opinion is divided.</p><p>\"It did surprise me a bit that opinion would be so split,\" says Andrey. \"Although Canadians do generally have an aversion to paying higher taxes, this isn't about individuals paying the tax. It speaks to the fact there is probably more work to do in this area. Perhaps to unpack for people how valuable these companies are and the impact they are having domestically.\"</p><p>Ryerson's leadership lab has also teamed up with the British firm Who Targets Me to monitor the current federal election, launching Who Targets Me Canada.</p><p>The app lets people see a personalized breakdown of how political parties are targeting them with Facebook ads. Facebook has also put in a library allowing users to see how much political parties spend on ads.</p><p>\"People recognize now that new technology is not an unalloyed good,\" says Sam Jeffers, founder of the non-partisan Who Targets Me. \"We have to ensure that the platforms are not the only people who are enforcing their rules.\"</p><p>Jeffers, a visiting global fellow at the Ryerson Leadership Lab, has implemented his software in the German and U.K. elections.</p><p>\"Some of the players are bypassing traditional media with misinformation and we try to put this stuff in proper context so there is more transparency,\" Jeffers says.</p><p>\"It creates a problem if people lose faith in the democratic process.\"</p><p>The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 1.8 per cent 19 times out of 20.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2019092655778492</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X4K-D4D1-DY91-K1Y5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"701\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 26, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

A third of Canadians (33 per cent) say the platforms are making society better.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"That is just shocking, the amount of negative attitude that Canadians are feeling toward these tech companies,\" Lorne Bozinoff, president of Forum Research, said in an interview. \"Let's face it. The experience with these companies has been horrific from a public and users' point of view. And there seems to be no remorse or concern or real corrective action taken by them.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Bozinoff said what's unusual is that voters of all political parties share the negative attitude.</p><p>\"It's the one thing Canadians seem to agree on, no matter the political philosophy,\" he said. \"Attitudes can change pretty quickly. We saw this with climate change, and now we see it with technology, where people seem to be more concerned.\"</p><p>While Forum's own polling shows that the environment is top of mind for Canadian voters, the negative attitude toward Big Tech is actually a more unifying issue across all parties, said Bozinoff.</p><p>\"Everyone agrees that the environment is an issue, although Tory voters are less concerned than the other three progressive parties. But in the case of technology, we hardly ever see a poll where everyone across the spectrum agrees.\"</p><p>According to Forum, 83 per cent of Canadians agree that large technology companies have an ethical duty to ensure their products are not causing harm.</p><p>Some 81 per cent say that they should be responsible for ensuring that the information distributed on their sites is accurate and not fake news.</p><p>\"There is real concern out there by Canadians, because the companies don't seem to adhere to the traditional corporate responsibility model that they should be contributing to the good of society,\" said Bozinoff.</p><p>\"The old rule was that if you were good for society, then it would avoid government intervention. But that doesn't seem to be the case.\"</p><p>According to a report released in September by the International News Media Association (INMA), more than 100 inquiries or legal cases against the tech giants are underway.</p><p>It has been a watershed year for antitrust and other investigations by global regulators even as public sentiment has continued to shift.</p><p>In Canada, the relationship with some of the tech platforms has deteriorated markedly. This year the country's privacy czar filed suit against Facebook for allegedly violating laws over user consent and personal information. And Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg defied a subpoena by a parliamentary ethics committee in Ottawa, refusing to testify.</p><p>\"There has been an unprecedented rise in the number of official inquiries into digital platforms' global activities,\" said Robert Whitehead, a former editor of the Sydney Morning Herald and author of the INMA report.</p><p>\"There is also alignment emerging among regulators that the platforms have become too dominant in key areas.\"</p><p>(Torstar president and CEO John Boynton is a board member of the association.)</p><p>The Forum poll shows 61 per cent of Canadians say they would approve of stronger laws for the Big Tech companies operating in Canada. This is in line with a poll released last month by the Ryerson Leadership Lab that showed 60 per cent of Canadians are in favour of more government regulation of social media platforms.</p><p>\"Tech was supposed to be the new frontier. There was an idea with some of the public that this was a place where there wouldn't be censorship or restrictions, but it has now backfired,\" Bozinoff said.</p><p>\"The public is getting tired and don't appreciate the manipulation. The old mainstream media used to take care with fact-checking and accuracy and there seems to be none of that online.\"</p><p>An exclusive survey of the main political parties released this month by the Star shows that all are in agreement that there needs to be more oversight of Big Tech.</p><p>The issue is how to update Canada's antiquated copyright and taxation laws for the digital era.</p><p>\"Technology has been a great enabler for progress, but with everything there's a balance,\" Mary Ng, minister of small business and export promotion, said in a statement to the Star on Friday. \"That's ... why we introduced our country's first ever Digital Charter. The initiative protects Canadians' privacy and personal data, while also enabling them to leverage their innovative talents and strengths to harness the power of the digital economy.\"</p><p>The Liberals have so far been the most aggressive of the parties in tackling the issue, announcing that they would follow the example of the French government by introducing a three per cent tax on large digital companies operating in Canada.</p><p>The Conservatives have said they believe in a \"level playing field,\" and that public policy should \"keep up with a rapidly changing marketplace.\"</p><p>The New Democratic Party said it would ensure web giants \"play by the same rules\" as Canadian companies. The Green party came out strongly in support of the European Union and its leading policies on privacy, copyright and taxation.</p><p>In that sense, the politicians are in line with public sentiment.</p><p>Canadians also happen to be in substantial agreement that there shouldn't be an uneven playing field between digital platforms and legacy media when it comes to taxation.</p><p>The Forum poll found 79 per cent of Canadians agreed that large technology companies based outside the country should be charged taxes on sales of advertising displayed in Canada. (Because they may not have a substantial physical presence or headquarters in the countries where they operate, many of the big platforms pay little to no tax in the countries where they do business.)</p><p>\"The idea that certain companies aren't taxed because they're not really operating in Canada, or that they're on the internet so they really aren't operating anywhere, doesn't fly with Canadians,\" said Bozinoff.</p><p>\"They are saying these companies are doing millions of dollars' worth of business and commercial activity in our country. And they're not paying their fair share. There is huge agreement. This doesn't sit right with Canadians.\"</p><p>The Forum Poll was conducted Sept. 30 to Oct. 1 in a phone survey of 1,853 randomly selected Canadians. Results are considered accurate plus or minus three percentage points, 19 times out of 20.</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

And one-fifth of those polled (22 per cent) say they're making it much worse. A third of Canadians (33 per cent) thought they were making society better.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"That is just shocking, the amount of negative attitude that Canadians are feeling toward these tech companies,\" says Lorne Bozinoff, president of Forum Research in an interview. \"Let's face it: the experience with these companies has been horrific from a public and users' point of view. And there seems to be no remorse or concern or real corrective action taken by them.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Bozinoff says what is unusual is that the negative attitude is shared by voters of all political parties.</p><p>\"It's the one thing Canadians seem to agree on, no matter the political philosophy,\" says Bozinoff.</p><p>\"Attitudes can change pretty quickly. We saw this with climate change, and now we see it with technology, where people seem to be more concerned.\"</p><p>While Forum's own polling shows that the envirnoment is top of mind for Canadian voters, negative attitudes toward Big Tech is actually a more unifying issue across all parties, says Bozinoff.</p><p>\"Everyone agrees that the environment is an issue, although Tory voters are less concerned than the other three progressive parties. But in the case of technology, we almost never see a poll where everyone across the spectrum agrees.\"</p><p>According to Forum, 83 per cent of Canadians agree that large technology companies have an ethical duty to ensure that their products are not causing harm.</p><p>Another 81 per cent say that they should be responsible for ensuring that the information distributed on their sites is accurate and not fake news.</p><p>\"There is real concern out there by Canadians, because the companies don't seem to adhere to the traditional corporate responsibility model that they should be contributing to the good of society,\" says Bozinoff.</p><p>\"The old rule was that if you were good for society, then it would avoid government intervention. But they doesn't seem to be the case.\"</p><p>According to a report released in September by the International News Media Association (INMA), there are more than 100 inquiries or legal cases against the tech giants underway.</p><p>It has been a watershed year for antitrust and other investigations by global regulators even as public sentiment has continued to shift.</p><p>In Canada, the relationship has deteriorated markedly with some of the tech platforms. This year the country's privacy czar filed suit against Facebook for allegedly violating laws over user consent and personal information. And Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg defied a subpoena by a parliamentary ethics committee in Ottawa, refusing to testify.</p><p>\"There has been an unprecedented rise in the number of official inquiries into digital platforms' global activities,\" says Robert Whitehead, a former editor of The Sydney Morning Herald and author of the INMA report.</p><p>\"There is also alignment emerging among regulators that the platforms have become too dominant in key areas.\"</p><p>(Torstar President and CEO John Boynton is a board member of the association)</p><p>The Forum poll shows 61 per cent of Canadians say they would approve of stronger laws for the Big Tech companies operating in Canada. This is in line with a poll released last month by The Ryerson Leadership Lab that showed 60 per cent of Canadians are in favour of more government regulation of social media platforms.</p><p>\"Tech was supposed to be the new frontier. There was an idea with some of the public that this was a place where there wouldn't be censorship or restrictions, but it has now backfired,\" says Bozinoff.</p><p>\"The public is getting tired and don't appreciate the manipulation. The old mainstream media used to take care with fact-checking and accuracy and there seems to be none of that online.\"</p><p>An exclusive survey of the main political parties released this week by the Star shows that all are in agreement that there needs to be more oversight of Big Tech.</p><p>The issue is how to update Canada's antiquated copyright and taxation laws for the digital era.</p><p>\"Technology has been a great enabler for progress, but with everything there's a balance,\" Mary Ng, minister of small business and export promotion, said in a statement to the Star Friday. \"That's ... why we introduced our country's first ever Digital Charter. The initiative protects Canadians' privacy and personal data, while also enabling them to leverage their innovative talents and strengths to harness the power of the digital economy.\"</p><p>The Liberals have so far been the most aggressive of the parties in tackling the issue, this week announcing that they would follow the example of the French government by introducing a three-per-cent tax on large digital companies operating in Canada.</p><p>The Conservatives have said they believe in a \"level playing field\" and that public policy should \"keep up with a rapidly changing marketplace.\"</p><p>The New Democratic Party said it would ensure web giants \"play by the same rules\" as Canadian companies. The Green Party came out strongly in support of the European Union and its leading policies on privacy, copyright and taxation.</p><p>In that sense, the politicians are in line with public sentiment.</p><p>Canadians also happen to be in substantial agreement that there shouldn't be an uneven playing field between digital platforms and legacy media when it comes to taxation.</p><p>The Forum poll found 79 per cent of Canadians agreed that large technology companies based outside of the country should be charged taxes on ad sales displayed in Canada. (Because they may not have a substantial physical presence or headquarters in the countries where they operate, many of the big platforms pay little to no taxes in the countries they do business in.)</p><p>\"The idea that certain companies aren't taxed because they're not really operating in Canada, or that they're on the internet, so they really aren't operating anywhere, doesn't fly with Canadians,\" says Bozinoff.</p><p>\"They are saying these companies are doing millions of dollars worth of business and commercial activity in our country.</p><p>\"And they're not paying their fair share.</p><p>\"There is huge agreement.</p><p>\"This doesn't sit right with Canadians.\"</p><p>The Forum Poll was conducted Sept. 30 to Oct. 1 in a phone survey of 1,853 randomly selected Canadians. Results are considered accurate plus or minus three per cent 19 times out of 20.</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

And one-fifth of those polled (22 per cent) say they're making it much worse. A third of Canadians (33 per cent) thought they were making society better.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"That is just shocking, the amount of negative attitude that Canadians are feeling toward these tech companies,\" says Lorne Bozinoff, president of Forum Research in an interview. \"Let's face it: the experience with these companies has been horrific from a public and users' point of view. And there seems to be no remorse or concern or real corrective action taken by them.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Bozinoff says what is unusual is that the negative attitude is shared by voters of all political parties.</p><p>\"It's the one thing Canadians seem to agree on, no matter the political philosophy,\" says Bozinoff.</p><p>\"Attitudes can change pretty quickly. We saw this with climate change, and now we see it with technology, where people seem to be more concerned.\"</p><p>While Forum's own polling shows that the envirnoment is top of mind for Canadian voters, negative attitudes toward Big Tech is actually a more unifying issue across all parties, says Bozinoff.</p><p>\"Everyone agrees that the environment is an issue, although Tory voters are less concerned than the other three progressive parties. But in the case of technology, we almost never see a poll where everyone across the spectrum agrees.\"</p><p>According to Forum, 83 per cent of Canadians agree that large technology companies have an ethical duty to ensure that their products are not causing harm.</p><p>Another 81 per cent say that they should be responsible for ensuring that the information distributed on their sites is accurate and not fake news.</p><p>\"There is real concern out there by Canadians, because the companies don't seem to adhere to the traditional corporate responsibility model that they should be contributing to the good of society,\" says Bozinoff.</p><p>\"The old rule was that if you were good for society, then it would avoid government intervention. But they doesn't seem to be the case.\"</p><p>According to a report released in September by the International News Media Association (INMA), there are more than 100 inquiries or legal cases against the tech giants underway.</p><p>It has been a watershed year for antitrust and other investigations by global regulators even as public sentiment has continued to shift.</p><p>In Canada, the relationship has deteriorated markedly with some of the tech platforms. This year the country's privacy czar filed suit against Facebook for allegedly violating laws over user consent and personal information. And Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg defied a subpoena by a parliamentary ethics committee in Ottawa, refusing to testify.</p><p>\"There has been an unprecedented rise in the number of official inquiries into digital platforms' global activities,\" says Robert Whitehead, a former editor of The Sydney Morning Herald and author of the INMA report.</p><p>\"There is also alignment emerging among regulators that the platforms have become too dominant in key areas.\"</p><p>(Torstar President and CEO John Boynton is a board member of the association)</p><p>The Forum poll shows 61 per cent of Canadians say they would approve of stronger laws for the Big Tech companies operating in Canada. This is in line with a poll released last month by The Ryerson Leadership Lab that showed 60 per cent of Canadians are in favour of more government regulation of social media platforms.</p><p>\"Tech was supposed to be the new frontier. There was an idea with some of the public that this was a place where there wouldn't be censorship or restrictions, but it has now backfired,\" says Bozinoff.</p><p>\"The public is getting tired and don't appreciate the manipulation. The old mainstream media used to take care with fact-checking and accuracy and there seems to be none of that online.\"</p><p>An exclusive survey of the main political parties released this week by the Star shows that all are in agreement that there needs to be more oversight of Big Tech.</p><p>The issue is how to update Canada's antiquated copyright and taxation laws for the digital era.</p><p>\"Technology has been a great enabler for progress, but with everything there's a balance,\" Mary Ng, minister of small business and export promotion, said in a statement to the Star Friday. \"That's ... why we introduced our country's first ever Digital Charter. The initiative protects Canadians' privacy and personal data, while also enabling them to leverage their innovative talents and strengths to harness the power of the digital economy.\"</p><p>The Liberals have so far been the most aggressive of the parties in tackling the issue, this week announcing that they would follow the example of the French government by introducing a three-per-cent tax on large digital companies operating in Canada.</p><p>The Conservatives have said they believe in a \"level playing field\" and that public policy should \"keep up with a rapidly changing marketplace.\"</p><p>The New Democratic Party said it would ensure web giants \"play by the same rules\" as Canadian companies. The Green Party came out strongly in support of the European Union and its leading policies on privacy, copyright and taxation.</p><p>In that sense, the politicians are in line with public sentiment.</p><p>Canadians also happen to be in substantial agreement that there shouldn't be an uneven playing field between digital platforms and legacy media when it comes to taxation.</p><p>The Forum poll found 79 per cent of Canadians agreed that large technology companies based outside of the country should be charged taxes on ad sales displayed in Canada. (Because they may not have a substantial physical presence or headquarters in the countries where they operate, many of the big platforms pay little to no taxes in the countries they do business in.)</p><p>\"The idea that certain companies aren't taxed because they're not really operating in Canada, or that they're on the internet, so they really aren't operating anywhere, doesn't fly with Canadians,\" says Bozinoff.</p><p>\"They are saying these companies are doing millions of dollars worth of business and commercial activity in our country.</p><p>\"And they're not paying their fair share.</p><p>\"There is huge agreement.</p><p>\"This doesn't sit right with Canadians.\"</p><p>The Forum Poll was conducted Sept. 30 to Oct. 1 in a phone survey of 1,853 randomly selected Canadians. Results are considered accurate plus or minus three per cent 19 times out of 20.</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

We will be examining them all.\"</p><p>In an accompanying report, IFS researchers Robert Joyce and Xiaowei Xu set out a small selection of the key facts about inequality in the UK which have motivated the review. These include:</p><p>*income inequality in the UK is high by international standards and of other major economies, only the US has higher income inequality;</p><p>*despite this, inequality in total net household income has changed little since rising sharply in the 1980s with the UK's system of state transfers, especially tax credits, having been very successful at mitigating rising inequality;</p><p>*about one in six children in the UK are born to single parents, a phenomenon heavily concentrated in low-income and low-educated families and which is significantly less prevalent in continental Europe;</p><p>*women's employment has risen dramatically from 57 per cent in 1975 to 78 per cent in 2017 and</p><p>*the gender hourly wage gap is strongly associated with childbirth and rises from less than 10 per cent at the point of childbirth to 30 per cent 12 years after the first child is born, reflecting an extraordinary lack of earnings progression for mothers, particularly for those who work part-time.</p><p>John McDonnell for Labour said: \"With inequality tearing apart the fabric of our society, I'm delighted it's finally beginning to get the attention it deserves.</p><p>\"Sir Angus is right to highlight the problems of stagnant wages and regional inequality as well as the importance of trade unions for addressing inequality.</p><p>\"I congratulate the IFS on the launch of this important piece of research and look forward to studying its work,\" added the Shadow Chancellor.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HRDSCL-17637334</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HRDSCL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W3S-4WK1-F0JC-M08P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464262</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"575\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 NewsQuest Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Herald Scotland</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"2880\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 14, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>INSTITUTE FOR FISCAL STUDIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>PRINCETON UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0009RLP</classCode><className>RESEARCH INSTITUTES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000552</classCode><className>ECONOMIC POLICY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLA3</classCode><className>ECONOMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00096UR</classCode><className>INCOME DISTRIBUTION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001813</classCode><className>WAGES &amp;

This would mean messages - including text and imagery - being digitally scrambled so that only the sender and receiver can make sense of them. The company has been told this could risk increased sexual exploitation of children.</p><p>The NSPCC has called on the prime minister to urgently press ahead with new legislation in the online harms bill, which it says would help prevent offenders from using social media to target children for sexual abuse.</p><p>The NSPCC's\u00a0chief executive, Peter Wanless, who met Boris Johnson at a \"hidden harms\" summit last week, said: \"Child abuse is an inconvenient truth for tech bosses, who have failed to make their sites safe and enabled offenders to use them as a playground in which to groom our kids.</p><p>\"Last week the prime minister signalled to me his determination to stand up to Silicon Valley and make the UK the world leader in online safety.

Analyst: Tech sell-off was a 'healthy pull-back' Economist on stock market surge: Investors may be 'irrationally nuts' There's a hidden weakness in the stock market Sure, the S&amp;P 500 is up about 3% so far this year. That's not bad, especially given all the volatility in the market and the severe slump in the economy since March because of coronavirus. However, the index is is weighted by market value. That means that the strong performances of the five tech giants that dominate the blue chips -- Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB) -- distort the S&amp;P 500's overall return. It's one reason some half-jokingly refer to the S&amp;P 500 as the \"S&amp;P 5.\" But the index tells a different story when you look at the many other stocks in the S&amp;P 500. An Invesco S&amp;P 500 ETF () that equally weights all of the index members is down more than 6% this year. Market not as strong without the Fab 5 of tech Nearly 60% of the companies in the index were in the red for 2020 through Thursday's close, according to data from Refinitiv. \"Without Big Tech's influence, the broad market would not look quite as stable as it does today,\" analysts from Zacks Investment Research said in a report last week. The over-reliance on this tech quintet could become a problem if Congress and the president (whether it's Donald Trump in a second term or Joe Biden) decide to impose tougher regulations on or launch specific antitrust investigations against industry leaders sometime after the election. \"Though Congress is not likely to pass any meaningful legislation this year, there appears to be growing consensus that the current course for Big Tech is not sustainable. From an investment standpoint, the suggestion is that long-term outperformance may not be sustainable, either,\" the Zacks analysts wrote. International stocks have more momentum lately The strong gains of the top techs also make it look like the US market is doing better than international stocks. But dig deeper and that too is untrue. Strategists from Schwab (SCHW) recently noted that if you exclude the 5 giant tech stocks and compare the S&amp;P 500 only to international stocks, foreign companies have actually done slightly better than the US market over the past three months. The alphabet-soup-named SPDR MSCI ACWI ex-US ETF (CWI), which holds top international companies such as Alibaba (BABA), Tencent (TCEHY), Nestle (NSRGF), Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Roche (RHHBF), is up nearly 5% since mid-June while the equal weighted S&amp;P 500 ETF is up less than 1%. \"The outperformance by the biggest US stocks is hiding a change in leadership by the average stock: The average international stock has been outperforming the average US stock,\" said Jeff Kleintop, chief global Investment strategist for Charles Schwab, in a report. \"The recent imbalances in the stock market can lead to vulnerability,\" he added. Even Warren Buffett appears to be signaling that he's finding more value abroad. The Oracle of Omaha's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) recently bought stakes in five top Japanese trading firms. \"The fact that the world's most famous investor has committed to such large sums has ramifications for both domestic and international perceptions about Japanese equities,\" said John Vail, chief global strategist at Nikko Asset Management, in a report. Vail thinks the Berkshire endorsement \"marks a true turning point\" for Japanese stocks. He said that bears no longer have a good argument for their skepticism. \"No one will be able to speak quite as dourly, as the retort should typically be, 'But Buffett Disagrees,'\" Vail said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

U.S. stocks are dipping modestly in early trading Tuesday, July 7, 2020, as expanding coronavirus outbreaks dim hopes for a speedy recovery. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File)NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Most of Wall Street is slipping in midday trading on Tuesday, giving back some of the big gains made the past couple weeks, but a handful of tech giants bucked the trend and kept the market's losses in check. Seven out of 10 stocks in the S&amp;#38;P 500 were dropping, and the index was 0.1% lower, as of noon Eastern time. </p><p>Stocks sank more in France, Germany and elsewhere after the European Union's executive arm said this year's recession caused by the coronavirus pandemic will be deeper than forecast. It also said next year's expected rebound could be weaker than expected.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 173 points, or 0.7%, at 26,114, and stocks in Asia also fell following the big rally that swept markets worldwide on Monday.  Big technology stocks were an outlier, though, with Microsoft, Apple and other titans pushing higher. Because of their huge size, they have more sway over broad market indexes than other stocks, and together they helped the S&amp;#38;P 500 erase its earlier loss of 0.6% from the morning. By midday, it was flipping between small gains and losses.  They also helped lift the Nasdaq composite by 0.6%, extending its record set a day earlier. The U.S. stock market has been churning over the last month, with big daily moves up and down keeping it roughly in place. It's been a small-scale version of the market's movements since the start of the year, when a nearly 34% plunge on worries about the pandemic-caused recession quickly gave way to a tremendous rally that brought the S&amp;#38;P 500 nearly back to its record level.  Pulling markets higher on one end are reports showing budding improvements in the economy. The job market, retail sales and other economic indicators are all still well below where they were before the pandemic struck. But they've stopped plummeting and have begun to grow again as governments relax restrictions meant to slow the spread of the coronavirus. (Ad) In a form NS 43-101, two energy sector legends have told federal regulators that they may have found one of the world's biggest lithium discoveries - a massive 7 million tons near Tonopah, Nevada, worth around $70 billion. That's combined with unprecedented amounts of aid from central banks and governments around the world to prop up markets. It also helped send the S&amp;#38;P 500 up 1.6% on Monday, following up on a 4% rise the prior week, which itself helped cap the best decade for the index since 1998. But pulling markets lower on the other end are worries that the optimism is overdone. The pandemic isn't going away, with infection levels worsening across wide swaths of the U.S. South and West, among other global hotspots. The concern is that could keep households and businesses nervous and scare them away from spending. In the worst-case scenario, it could force governments to bring back some of the restrictions that sent the economy into its sudden recession.  Such worries spilled through markets Tuesday after the European Commission unveiled its more dour economic forecasts for 2020 and 2021.  'The road to recovery is still paved with uncertainty,' EU Economy Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni told reporters in Brussels. 'This is mostly linked to the epidemiological uncertainty.' The commission said the joint economy of the 27 nations in the European Union will shrink 8.3% this year, before growing 5.8% in 2021. In the previous forecasts released in May, it had forecast the economy would contract about 7.5% this year and bounce back 6% next year. Underscoring the fragility, a separate report showed that industrial production in Germany rebounded by less than economists expected in May, and remains far below levels from before the pandemic caused factories to close. Germany's DAX lost 0.9%, while France's CAC 40 fell 0.7%. The FTSE 100 in London dropped 1.5%.  In Asia, Japan's Nikei 225 fell 0.4%, the Kospi in South Korea dropped 1.1% and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong slipped 1.4%.  In the U.S. market, airlines and stocks of other companies that most need the economy to get closer to normal had the sharpest losses. United Airlines lost 5.8%, American Airlines slipped 5.6% and mall-owner Simon Property Group dropped 4.2%.  Energy stocks fell 1.5% for the largest loss among the 11 sectors that make up the S&amp;#38;P 500. They've swung sharply with expectations for the economy's health and demand for oil and gasoline. Devon Energy lost 4.7%, Valero Energy lost 4.2%. Benchmark U.S. crude was up 0.8% at $40.94 per barrel after earlier flipping between losses and gains. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 0.5% to $43.33 per barrel. On the winning end were the big tech-oriented companies that have been dominating the market for years. Investors have continued to pile into companies they believe are able to grow almost regardless of the economy and whether people are locked in quarantines. Microsoft rose 1.1%, Apple gained 0.8% and Google's parent company Alphabet added 1.1%.  The yield on the 10-year Treasury slipped to 0.66% from 0.68% late Monday. It tends to move with investors' expectations for the economy and inflation.  ___ AP Writers Yuri Kageyama and Samuel Petrequin contributed.

That was slightly larger than the 4.8 decline that was previously forecast. On the same day that GDP was released, we also learned that the ranks of those filing for unemployment claims exceeded 40 million. But as sobering as those numbers are, they're not completely surprising. The U.S. economy was effectively shut down as citizens did their part to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus. But the cost of those efforts is just being measured. And one of those measurements comes in the all-important Consumer Confidence Index. The index ticked up slightly in May to 86.6. While this number is about 30% lower than where the index sat In February, it's significantly higher than where it sat at the trough of the financial crisis and subsequent recession. And a big reason for that is that while the brick-and-mortar economy shut down, the digital economy helped give the economy a pulse. Consumption is a key part of our economy. That's why consumer confidence makes up 70% of the U.S. economy. And one of the key ways that consumers express that confidence or lack thereof, is in the retail sector. For the last few years, the story of retail has been about which retailers were going to be able to successfully compete in the e-commerce space that is still owned by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Sadly, we're discovering that some companies, like J.C. Penney, were late to adapt in a meaningful way. But that isn't the case for all retailers.
