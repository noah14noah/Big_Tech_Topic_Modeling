These are all kind of questions that I think a lot of people have in mind. Questions like these have increased tensions, and scrutiny of the whole project has intensified after several members of its advisory board resigned over privacy concerns. The project is also now facing a challenge in the courts. </p><p>The Canadian Civil Liberties Association is suing three different levels of government as well as waterfront Toronto over plans for the tech driven development. What is it that sidewalk is proposing that the CC LA is unhappy with or opposes? What we are unhappy with is that a private company is self-regulating in an area that involves people's constitutional rights, their privacy and their dignity. What the government in Canada and Ontario and Toronto has done, has said Sidewalk Labs, you figure out how to act in the public interest. You self regulate the way in which you are going to be collecting and storing data. And we, those of us who live in Toronto, or walk anywhere near or through this part of the waterfront, we are the lab rats. And number one, we never signed up for this, number two, there is no jurisdiction for waterfront Toronto to do this, and number three, there is no protection whatsoever by law of the data that is being collected and manipulated and stored and used in whatever form it is going to be used. Privacy and data, there are some huge concerns around privacy and especially data about what happens to it, who will manage it. Government, who has oversight of the data. This project is fundamentally about protecting everyone's privacy, it is built on the established laws we have in Canada. It is not asked that is planning to manage or make money off the data in this neighbourhood, is actually proposed that it is an independent non-profit public sector entity, we have co- -- altered in urban data trust, that will take response ability for managing and using the collection of data. Sidewalk has just submitted its thousand page long master plan document that outlines what has in store for the Quayside project in more detail. Waterfront Toronto says it will open it up for public discussion. I think you have a perfect storm, timing, players, actors and a pressure point on projects that could be a lighthouse of how you solve these issues if we get it right. If we get it wrong, then that would not be good. As more people become aware of the kind of data that is captured by big tech outfit, and how it is used, concerns around privacy mean decisions made in Toronto could end up having ramifications for future smart city project around the world. That was marked. Big tech companies offering services for free in turn -- written by data. It is a familiar theme from Toronto to Timbuktu. Originating in Silicon Valley, for some this type of business transaction has come to define the age we live in, and its consequences are good and bad, are only just beginning to shakedown. We have been looking at some of the most influential thinking in what is being described as\" surveillance capitalism\". We freely give out our personal data every day through the apps on our phone, conversations with smart home assistance or other so-called smart devices like toothbrushes and vacuum cleaners. It seems like an inevitable and perhaps cheap price to pay for living in a digitally connected world, giving us access to free services, like Google's surgeon match, and social media sites like Facebook. But the data we are giving away for free about our everyday lives is very valuable, and it is exploitation - if exploitation is the basis of a new economic paradigms which one author calls surveillance capitalism. She presented her book in Cambridge, also known as the UK's Silicon Valley. What surveillance capitalism does, is it claims private human experience, private human experience is unilaterally claimed to be brought into the marketplace, where it is translated into behavioural data. This behavioural data is combined with machine learning and artificial intelligence to create predictions of what people are going to do with their day, and what they might live. Professor Zuboff detail how this capability to make money</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-e7f1cae488f9429d805f2c2363befab4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WD2-VKX1-DY08-350C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"730\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

We just have to use the information in the right way. So your latest book, How To Make The World Add Up, was just being finished, I think, as we were going into lockdown, and I wonder whether you looked at what the virus was doing around the world and whether that taught you anything about statistics. Well, I'm sad to say it underlined the point that I was trying to make in the book, which was that while we tend to think of statistics as a kind of political weapon - you know, people lie with statistics and they try to win arguments with statistics - actually, statistics are a way of seeing the world around us, seeing things we can't see in any other way. </p><p>So, they're a bit like, you need radar to spot incoming bombers, we need statistics to spot the incoming virus. So, I'm trying to get people to take the numbers seriously as a way of seeing what's true. This isn't fog, it's smoke - California is a state reeling from wildfires. Flying into San Francisco this week from London, you could barely see the city. My name is James Clayton and I'm the new BBC and Click San Francisco technology reporter. And I've landed at a pretty weird time. I've been to San Francisco a few times before, but this was San Francisco, only different. Mandatory masks everywhere. The airport's almost completely empty, the streets quieter - much more so than London. I've come during a monster week for tech, though, many of the stories based on themes that are likely to dominate tech journalism in the years to come. On Monday, Oracle agreed a deal with TikTok to oversee its US operations after Mr Trump said it would ban the company if it couldn't find a US suitor. I'll be doing more on how tech is being dragged into a geopolitical battle between China and the US. It was also a week that Twitter launched its election hub to promote accurate information and resources for voters. How companies like Google and Twitter and Facebook regulate their platforms in the run-up to the elections are likely to have a massive impact on that November poll, and it's something that Click will be doing more on. It also happens to be a week when Mr Trump visited California, sparking controversy by refusing to acknowledge climate change's impact on the environment. Going forward, could big tech do more by not just being green companies themselves, but by leading the way in innovation, perhaps even reversing some of the damage that humans have done to our planet? At Apple's launch on Tuesday, the company didn't release an iPhone or ARM-based MacBooks, but it did centre its new iteration of products around health care, including a new Apple Watch that can measure oxygen levels in the blood. How the world of tech responds to Covid-19 in the coming years is likely to be crucial in our battle against the virus. And finally this week, Google was grilled by senators asking questions about antitrust. Or, in other words, are companies like Google monopolistic? Whether massive tech companies like Facebook and Apple and Amazon are simply too big, whether they should even be broken up, are central challenges to governments around the world. The tech stories that we've seen this week underpin perhaps the fundamental question of our age - how can we harness the progress that humanity has made for good and not bad? That was James Clayton, who, as he says, is our new man</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCWLD-818f42c7fbd94865aaec23f44fc4e0de</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCWLD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60W3-K1R1-JBH6-C1YM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402043</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"624\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

James, not even off the plane and we ask you to start filming, well done. What a time to move to San Francisco, though. It's a really strange time for two reasons. </p><p>I mean, obviously, you've seen those horrendous pictures of California under this huge blanket of smoke. And it's not just California, it's pretty much the whole of western America - it's Oregon, it's Washington. And then, of course, you have Covid-19. Covid-19 has affected the US very badly and California is no exception, and it's really noticeable. So, how do you feel about being there? If you look at all of the conferences that are coming up, literally all of them are virtual. So, the chances of me actually being able to get there and review products in the same way as my predecessor did, well, it's going to be quite unlikely for now. I know that different people feel differently about climate change within the US and the big tech giants have certainly committed to trying to go carbon neutral - or I think Google now says it is carbon neutral - do you think the arrival of the forest fires at the doors of these companies will change any of their behaviours or focus any of their attention? I think the next stage is, are they going to really invest in the kind of innovation that the world might actually need to try and reverse some of this climate change? And, at the moment, Microsoft have committed a lot of money to that, so have Amazon, so have Apple too, but really, it's only been the last year that that's happened. What else are you looking forward to covering? Well, the big tech story in the next five, six weeks is going to be on social media, with the US elections. You're already seeing all sorts of disinformation, all sorts of challenges and problems that companies like Facebook and Twitter and Google - that owns YouTube - are having to make when trying to regulate what should and shouldn't be on it. Well, we're looking forward to hearing more about it from you over the coming weeks. James, thank you very much and stay there! You know, all of these launch events that we've been talking about, and indeed the run-up to the US election, they're all like theatre, really, aren't they? And that links perfectly to the next bit of the programme. Yes, theatre has had a particularly tough time of it since March, and until actors can tread the boards again, technology is seeing whether it can fill the void. But can it really provide the excitement of a live performance? Marc Cieslak has disappeared down the rabbit hole to find out. We're late, we're late, However, in order to follow for a very important theatrical date. Alice down the rabbit hole for an adventure in Wonderland, all we have to do is log into a video chat call. Are you all OK? Alice - A Virtual Theme Park is actually an immersive theatre show which, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the audience experiences from the comfort of their homes, via the video chat platform Zoom. Had Matter, Mad Hatter - you see, everyone in Wonderland's a little bit mixed up! It's the result of a collaboration between theatre companies Creation, Big Telly and Fox Dog, partnering with tech outfit Charisma.ai. We have built an animated version of the Cheshire Cat that the audience talk to. You are now ready to go further into Wonderland... And before the show, they can chat to it, flirt to it. It's been asked out on dates a couple of times. And then the second thing we do is we've really pushed Zoom into sort of video game territory. So, we've taken the tiles that everyone's used to in video conferences, separated them out and then dropped them into a 3D games engine. And you can wave to all the other members of the audience, just before you zoom down the rabbit hole into Wonderland. I think, for us, we started experimenting really early on in lockdown. So, two weeks into lockdown, we did a production of The Tempest, and what we discovered with that was, what's really exciting, when it really comes alive, is when the audience are live and can be seen live too, so its performers live and its audience live, and you have moments where you see each other. A lot of our shows pre-lockdown were in site-specific locations, moving around, giving the audience, in small groups, little challenges to do. It's as much live film or live gaming, and I think what the pandemic has created is this opportunity to put real people into a digital world. Few industries have escaped the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. Theatre has been badly hit. What theatre is about, it's about physically being with other people. It's about being shoulder- to-shoulder with somebody.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCWLD-4f4b5be6d9a54db2849c05aebf98702e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCWLD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60W3-K1R1-JBH6-C226-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402043</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"828\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

But is the convenience worth the possible cost to privacy? In 2016, Amnesty International awarded the parent company of WeChat, Tencent, zero out of 100 for their privacy practices. I think there's a common perception that people in China don't care about their privacy and that perception is completely false. </p><p>The government, over the last few years, has been trying to roll out its own cybersecurity regulations and trying to educate consumers about the dangers of data being lost or leaked. WeChat's privacy policy says it will provide the Chinese government access to much of what you do in the app when legally required, including the things you type and data, like your location. It's hard to deny that social apps in China have taken on a life of their own, if not outpacing, then going in new directions to competitors in the West. The big question is whether more Chinese apps can follow TikTok in going global despite the concerns around privacy and censorship, or, if not, it could be the turn of tech companies in the West to play copycat themselves. That was Stephen Beckett's view of China. And since the explosion of TikTok in the West, other apps have been springing up to try and compete, and Chris Fox has been looking at some of the alternatives that are available. If you can't get enough of short, hyper-edited videos, luckily there are plenty of apps that have cottoned on to the format. This is Triller, which I think it's fair to say has taken a bit of inspiration from TikTok. You can record clips with special effects and share them onto an endless scrolling feed of content. Triller seems to have done quite well out of all this uncertainty. At the start of August. it topped the App Store charts on both iOS and Android, and it's managed to attract some big name TikTok stars and celebrities over onto its platform, including Mike Tyson and the magician Dynamo. Another app offering a similar experience is Byte, which has also been popping in and out of the App Store top download charts. Like TikTok, it offers you creative effects for your videos, although it is trailing behind Triller. It's been downloaded more than a million times on Google Play, whereas Triller's had more than ten million. TikTok's biggest competition may come from Instagram Reels, Instagram's newly launched rival. It has incorporated many of TikTok's core features, including that endlessly scrolling feed of short videos. Just in the past few weeks, Mark Zuckerberg has appeared at a Congressional hearing about big tech companies using their power to neutralise the competition. Isn't ripping off TikTok essentially doing that? There is innovation everywhere and people are constantly inspired by what they see. It's no longer a surprise to see a feed in a mobile social product. That wasn't necessarily the case until Facebook brought that to scale. We brought stories to Instagram in 2016 and give full credit to Snap for inventing that format, but then evolved it from there. So what is Instagram bringing to the table with this format that makes it different to TikTok? I think the ability to be discovered is unique to Reels. I think on Instagram, historically, if you had a large follower base, it was easy to kind of get bigger. This is now a product specifically designed to help creators find an audience. Now, to be fair to TikTok, I think the idea that you never know what video is going to go viral or who gets discovered is exactly what draws creators to TikTok - it's certainly not unique to Instagram Reels - but I think companies are seeing that TikTok has refined a winning formula and they want a piece of the action. And that's it for this week. Next week, we're going to be looking at another hugely important topic - the technology being used to fight climate change. Until then, you can keep up with us on social media, on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, @bbcclick. Thanks for watching and we'll see you soon.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCWLD-d4b23d6078b149bd8db04845aec84145</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCWLD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60KM-SB41-JBH6-C2M8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402043</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"693\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

If I want to cover my face, I'll cover my face. Don't push me over when I'm walking. This man didn't want to be caught by the police cameras, so he covered his face. they photographed him anyway, an argument followed. How would you like it if you walked in the street and someone grabbed you? Wind your neck in. You wouldn't. Wind your neck in! What's your suspicion? It's the fact that he's walked past clearly marked facial recognition... - I would do the same! - ...covering his face. - That's grounds to stop him. - No, it isn't. The police said this was disorderly behaviour, so they gave him a fine. The chap told me down the road, \"They've got facial recognition.\" So, I walked past like that, it's a cold day, as well, the police officer asked me to come to him, so I've got my back up. I said to him, \"... off\", basically. I said, \"I don't want my face shown on anything. \"If I want to cover my face, I'll cover my face.\" I've got a 90 pound fine. There you go. Look. Thanks, lads. 90 pound. Well done. He was caught up in the last of ten trials carried out by the Metropolitan Police. The Met have had successes. There were three arrests from facial recognition on this test day alone. But the trials have proved controversial. Opponents claim they're taking place in a legal vacuum. There is nothing in UK law that has the words \"facial recognition.\" There is no legal basis for the police to be using facial recognition. There are no legal limitations on how they can use it, no policy, no regulation. We don't know who's on the watch lists. We didn't know how long the images would be stored for. Police are making up the rules as they go along. My ultimate fear is that we would have live facial recognition capabilities on our gargantuan CCTV network, which is about six million cameras in the UK. the nature of life in this country would change. It would mean everywhere we go, we could be identified, tracked. That we would be leaving a location data trail. That your face could be searched and a detailed record of your movements gained. Police argue that in a time when every Smartphone camera</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCWLD-2b78b78b355148e6bf0f740712e76d9e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCWLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W3D-5P31-DY08-3037-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402043</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"685\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

You're replicating a video of someone sitting here and they are speaking and you sync their lips and head movements and things like that. If you try to do something like this with a voice, then the training data will be a lot more limited, so let's say even if you have two hours of you talking, that is still a very, very little part of all the things you could possibly say. So could I use your platform to upload a video of anyone, not me, and create a virtual version of them?</p><p> No. Why not? We need written consent from whoever is being uploaded. So everything goes through manual review and we only do custom avatars for corporate clients. So clearly you have protocols in place, but is the very existence of this technology, the fact that all of this is possible, not a pretty big risk in itself, that the wrong people will use it? We have seen these kind of things happen before. Definitely, synthetic media as a whole definitely comes with potential for misuse, that is something that is really important that we address. Both from a technical perspective but also from an educational perspective. I think any technology can be used for good and bad, I am not sure I think that deepfakes or video is uniquely different from being able to forge text or images, or tweets, which has been possible for the last 20 years, but it is certainly something we need to be really aware of. Thanks, Victor. So the reality is that making fake videos has become a lot more sophisticated. And we are already all-too-familiar with how false information can cause real harm, and has damaged people's trust in news. And even though most of the conversations have been centred around Facebook, YouTube has also been a big contributor to the spread of misinformation. Now the upcoming US election is going to place even more emphasis on this issue. And so the BBC's specialist disinformation reporter Marianna Spring has been finding out more. YouTube has an incredibly smart algorithm. At least smart enough to make the company a lot of money. More eyeballs on a video and more engagement equals more cash. It's simple. But what is not simple is how potent this combination has become. Videos from fringe groups with extreme ideas surfacing to the top and influencing users' views. The pandemic has pushed the issue to new levels, with false information about the coronavirus often finding a much larger audience than trusted sources. As the months have gone on, YouTube has become inundated with documentary-style films from pseudoscientists promoting conspiracy theories. This Plandemic documentary received millions of views. Despite efforts to remove it from YouTube, Facebook and Twitter, users were constantly re-uploading the clip. And recently demonstrators have taken to the streets in London to promote some of the most popular coronavirus conspiracy theories mainly seen online. A man who would like to remain anonymous got in touch with us after his mum decided to go along. Mum had two posters. One read \"Arrest Bill Gates for crimes against humanity\", the other had a QAnon hashtag, \"Save the children\". She was first taken in by coronavirus conspiracy theories on YouTube and now she has been radicalised by QAnon on there too. It is so hard to have a normal conversation. QAnon is a conspiracy theory that suggests President Trump is waging a secret war against satanic paedophiles in government, media and business. Since the last US election, the social media giants have had a bit of a reckoning. They are all trying to clean up their act to stave off heavy-handed regulation. Facebook with its oversight board, Twitter with more robust warning labels, and now YouTube says it has added a new tool to its arsenal to combat misinformation. It has partnered up with fact checking sites to warn users if the phrase they are searching has been refuted, and pointing them to information by a trusted source. Put simply, it is a tool where when users go to search for a particular topic on YouTube, if there happens to be a fact check, these fact checks are generated by third-party publishers, that will trigger in the results of that particular query, right at the top of the query, and it will link out to that fact check, saying whether that particular claim is false, oftentimes fact checking publishers have a rating of that type of claim, and that will be displayed as well. This is one of the many tools YouTube says it uses to reduce misinformation on the site. But none of these measures seem to be proactive and doing enough to reduce exposure to misleading information. The challenge about misinformation, as you know, on a platform like ours, which is an open platform, we really do value the fact that it's an open platform</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-ccc6843dab5e440fafee862aa4e38f90</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60XT-V8R1-DY08-315S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"877\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

Run those numbers, you test 1000 people, one of them has got the virus. And then 100 of them have, are wrongly flagged as having the virus, because you have a 10% false positive rate. So then you have 100 times as many people being given false positives as given a true positive. </p><p>So that sounds like a total disaster, it sounds like you couldn't possibly use that information. But think about it in another way - before you gave everyone the test, you would have thought 1 in 1000 people has the virus, but now you are able to zoom in on a subset of those people, 100 people, and now you know one out of 100 people has the virus. So the other 900 people are probably fine. But if the alternative is to lock down everybody, to tell everybody they have to stay home and tell everyone they can't go to school or a restaurant, maybe the imperfect test could be better. We just have to use the information in the right way. So your latest book, How to Make the World Add Up, was just being finished, I think, as we were going into lockdown. And I wonder whether you looked at what the virus was doing around the world, and whether that taught you anything about statistics? Well I am sad to say it underlined the point I was trying to make in the book, which was that while we tend to think of statistics as a kind of political weapon, that you know, people lie with statistics and they try to win arguments with statistics, actually statistics are a way of seeing the world around us, seeing things we can't see any other way. So they are a bit like you need radar to spot incoming bombers, we need statistics to spot the incoming virus. So I am trying to get people to take the numbers seriously as a way of seeing what is true. Hello, and welcome to the Week in Tech. This week, Apple announced the launch of a new workout subscription programme called Fitness+. It forms part of a bundle of services including News and Arcade, now branded as Apple One. Facebook unveiled a new version of its Oculus Quest VR headset with more power and higher resolution. The new device also comes with a significant price drop. The entry-level version will be #100 deeper than its predecessor. And Sony confirmed the price of the forthcoming PlayStation 5, matching the $500 price of its rival the Xbox One Series X. Google says it has gone beyond being carbon neutral, and has now compensated for all of the carbon it has ever produced. It comes as a range of big tech firms have committed to reducing or eliminating their carbon footprint. British-based chip designer Arm is being sold to the American graphics chip specialist Nvidia. Nvidia said the deal, worth $40 billion, will create the premier computing company for the age of artificial intelligence. And finally, is there life on...Venus? Scientists have discovered what they say could be potential signs of life floating in the clouds of the planet. A new scientific paper reveals the discovery of gas called phosphine, typically associated with living organisms. The future really is in the cloud. This isn't fog, it's smoke. California is a state reeling from wildfires. Flying into San Francisco this week from London, you could barely see the city. My name is James Clayton, and I am the new BBC and Click San Francisco technology reporter. And I have landed at a pretty weird time. I've been to San Francisco a few times before, but this was San Francisco only different. Mandatory masks everywhere, the airport almost completely empty. The streets quieter, much more so than London. I've come during a monster week for tech though. Many of the stories based on theme that are likely to dominate tech journalism in the years to come. On Monday, Oracle agreed a deal with TikTok to oversee its US operations, after Mr Trump said it would ban the company if it couldn't find a US suitor. I'll be doing more on how tech is being dragged into a geopolitical battle between China and the US.

It also happened to be a week when Mr Trump visited California, sparking controversy by refusing to acknowledge climate change's impact on the environment. Going forward, could big tech do more by not just being green companies themselves, but by leading the way in innovation, perhaps even reversing some of the damage that humans have done to our planet? At Apple's launch on Tuesday, the company didn't release an iPhone or ARM-based MacBooks But he did send its new iteration of products around healthcare. </p><p>-- But it did centre its new iteration of products around healthcare. Including a new Apple Watch that can measure oxygen levels in the blood. How the world of tech responds to Covid-19 in the coming years is likely to be crucial in our battle against the virus. And finally this week, Google was grilled by senators asking questions about anti-trust. Or, in other words, are companies like Google monopolistic? Whether massive tech companies like Facebook, Apple, and Amazon are simply too big and whether they should be broken up, remains a central challenge to governments around the world. The tech stories that we have seen this week perhaps underpin the fundamental question of our age - how can we harness the progress that humanity has made for good and not bad? That was James Clayton who, as he says, is our new man in San Francisco, and he's online now. James, not even off the plane and we ask you to start filming. Well done! What a time to move to San Francisco though! It's a really strange time for two reasons. I mean, obviously, you've seen those kind of horrendous pictures of California under this huge blanket of smoke. And it's not just California, it's pretty much the whole of western America. It is Oregon, it's Washington. And then, of course, you have Covid-19. Covid-19 has affected the US very badly, and California is no exception, and it's really noticeable. How do you feel about being there? If you look at all of the conferences that are coming up, literally all of them are virtual. So the chances of me actually being able to get there and, you know, review products in the same way as my predecessor did, well, it's going to be quite unlikely for now. I know that different people feel differently about climate change within the US, and the big tech giants have certainly committed to trying to go carbon neutral - or I think Google now says it is carbon neutral. Do you think the arrival of forest fires at the doors of these companies will change any of their behaviours or focus any of their attention? I think the next stage is are they going to really invest in the kind of innovation that the world might actually need to try and reverse some of this climate change? And at the moment, Microsoft have committed a lot of money to that - so have Amazon, so have Apple too - but it's really only been the last year that has happened. What else are you looking forward to covering? Well, the big tech story of the next 5-6 weeks is going to be about social media with the US elections. You're already seeing all sorts of disinformation and all sorts of challenges and problems that companies like Facebook and Twitter and Google, who owns YouTube, are having to make, you know, when trying to regulate what should and shouldn't be on it. Well, we're really looking forward to hearing more about it from you over the coming weeks. James, thank you very much and stay there! You know, all of these launch events that we have been talking about and, indeed, the run-up to the US election, they are all like theatre really, aren't they? And that links perfectly to the next bit of the program. Yes, theatre has had a particularly tough time of it since March, and until actors can tread the boards again, technology is seeing whether it can fill the void. But can it really provide the excitement of a live performance? Marc Cieslak has disappeared down a rabbit hole to find out. We're late, we're late for a very important theatrical date. However, in order to follow Alice down the rabbit hole for an adventure in Wonderland, all we have to do is log in to a video chat call. Are you all OK? Alice, A Virtual Theme Park is actually an immersive theatre show which, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the audience experiences from the comfort of their homes via the video chat platform Zoom. It's the result of a collaboration between theatre companies Creation, Big Telly and Fox dog, partnering with tech outfit Charisma AI. We have built an animated version of the Cheshire Cat</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-5475686542714401af5f3bd9e0e3e3c5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60WB-6MH1-DY08-319F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"824\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

The government over the last few years has been trying to roll out its own cybersecurity regulations and trying to educate consumers about the dangers of data being lost a leaked. WeChat's privacy policy says it will provide the Chinese government access to much of what you do in the app when legally required, including the things you type and data like your location. It's hard to deny that social apps in China have taken on a life of their own, if not outpacing, then going in new directions to competitors in the West. The big question is whether more Chinese apps can follow TikTok in going global, despite the concerns around privacy and censorship. Or, if not, it could it be the turn of tech companies in the West to play copycat themselves? That was Stephen Beckett's view of China. And since the explosion of TikTok in the West, other apps have been springing up to try and compete. And Chris Fox has been looking at some of the alternatives that are available. If you can't get enough of short, hyper-edited videos, luckily there are plenty of apps that have cottoned on to the format. This is Triller, which I think is fair to say, has taken a bit of inspiration from TikTok. You can record clips with special effects and share them onto an endless scrolling feed of content. Triller seems to have done quite well out of all this uncertainty, at the start of August, it topped the app store charts on both iOS and Android and has managed to attract some big-name TikTok stars and celebrities over to on its platform, including Mike Tyson and magician Dynamo. Another app offering a similar experience is Byte, which has also been popping in and out of the App Store top download charts. Like TikTok, it offers you creative effects for your videos, although it is trailing behind Triller, it's been downloaded over 1 million times on Google Play, whereas Triller has had more than ten million. Tiktok's biggest competition may come from Instagram Reels, Instagram's newly-launched rival. It has incorporated many of TikTok's core features, including that endlessly-scrolling feed of short videos. Just in the past few weeks, Mark Zuckerberg has appeared at a Congressional hearing about big tech companies using their power to neutralise the competition. Isn't ripping off TikTok essentially doing that? There is innovation everywhere and people are constantly inspired by what they see. It's no longer a surprise to see a feed in a mobile social product, that wasn't the case until Facebook brought that to scale. We brought stories to Instagram in 2016. And give full credit to Snap for inventing that format, but evolved it from there. So what is Instagram bringing to the table with this format, that makes it different to TikTok? I think the ability to be discovered is unique to Reels. I think in Instagram, historically, if you had a large follower base it was easier to kind of get bigger. This is now a product specifically designed to help creators find an audience. Now, to be fair to TikTok, I think the idea that you never know what video is going to go viral or who get discovered is what draws people to TikTok. It's certainly not unique to Instagram Reels, but I think companies are seeing TikTok has refined a winning formula and they want a piece of the action. And that's it for this week. Next week, we're going to be looking at another hugely important topic - the technology being used to fight climate change. Until then, you can keep with us on social media, on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter @BBCClick. Thanks for watching, and we'll see you soon. Hello there. We still have a lot of humid air across the UK, the same air mass that brought us the hot and sunny weather.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-364b3e87ab414911aa120363fe4cd8be</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60KW-74B1-DY08-31HD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"776\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

And number one, we never signed up for this, number two, there's no jurisdiction for Waterfront Toronto to do this, and number three, there is no protection whatsoever by law, of the data that is being collected and manipulated and stored and used in whatever form it's going to be used. Privacy and data, there are some huge concerns around privacy and especially data about what happens to it, who is going to manage it. Governance, who has oversight of that data? What I would say is that this project is fundamentally about protecting everyone's privacy, it's built on the established laws we already have in Canada. So it's not us actually that is planning to manage or make money off the data in this neighbourhood, is actually proposed that it's an independent non-profit public sector entity, we have called an urban data trust, that will take responsibility for managing and using the collection of data in this place. Sidewalk Labs has just submitted its thousand-page long master plan document, that outlines what has in store for the Quayside project in more detail. Waterfront Toronto will need to closely examine the paperwork, and it says it will open it up for public discussion. I think you have a perfect storm - timing, players, actors and a pressure point on projects that could be a lighthouse of how you solve these issues if we get it right. If we get it wrong, then that would not be good. As more people become aware of the kind of data that is captured by big tech outfits, and how it's used, concerns around privacy mean decisions made in Toronto could end up having ramifications for future smart city projects around the world. That was Marc. Big tech companies offering services for free in return for data. It's a familiar theme from Toronto to Timbuktu. Originating in Silicon Valley, for some, this type of business transaction has come to define the age we live in, and its consequences, good and bad, are only just beginning to shake down. Jen Copestake has been looking at some of the most influential thinking in what is being described as \"surveillance capitalism\". We freely give out our personal data every day through the apps on our phones, conversations with smart home assistants or other so-called smart devices like toothbrushes and vacuums. It seems like an inevitable and perhaps even cheap price to pay for living in a digitally connected world, giving us access to free services, like Google's Search and Maps, and social media sites like Facebook. But the data we are giving away for free about our everyday lives is very valuable, and its exploitation is the basis of a new economic paradigm which author Shoshana Zuboff calls \"surveillance capitalism.\" She presented her book in Cambridge, also known as the UK's Silicon Valley. What surveillance capitalism does, is it claims private human experience, private human experience is unilaterally claimed to be brought into the marketplace, where it's translated into behavioural data. This behavioural data is combined with machine learning and artificial intelligence to create predictions of what people are going to do with their day, and what they might buy. Professor Zuboff detail how this capability to make money from behavioural data was first discovered by Google when the company was struggling</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-e08ec87019b04c2a96b58420d44a7031</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WF5-1M21-JBH6-C2WV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"738\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

As the TVs have got thinner to the       modern sets we have now, where the       TVs are an inch thick at the most,       we have gone bigger and bigger in       our homes. Really we if we want to       go bigger still we need to improve       the resolution otherwise the       pictures will look grainy and in       the clear and sharp which is not       what we want ultimately. You will       see the first jump to 4 K       resolution I would imagine in a few       years and ultimately if you want       something like 145 inch screen that       we have on display today, you will       need to go to the AK resolution. </p><p>4       K like this is already being used       for surgical applications and       provisional video but you are       probably going to have to wait       until 2020 before 8 K is on the       market.       Another directionsome developers       are going in is with 3 D TV they       are ditching the glasses. Now with       some of these glassless sets you       need to watch the TV whilst stuck       to certain sweet spots, where the       picture unravels, but screen TV       works with a technology that they       say works, whatever your point of       view. I'm no fan of 3 D but stream       TV say they can see through the       eyes of 2 D pictures. The 3 D       module we give to a TV manufacturer       and they will add it to their       device and then it turns into 3 D       glasses television set. Eventually       we will have phones and tablets and       laptops and PCs all using this       technology.       A couple of manufacturers have come       out with transparent screens.       Samsung's a very impressive. One       idea is that you can put it on a       shop front and Samsung is       emphasising the environmental       benefits of doing away with energy-       burning backlights and using       natural light instead. TVs are       getting smarter, bigger, clearer,       if the idea is to make us feel       inadequate about our current       telllies, well, it's probably       working.       David Reid, glued to the screens,       as ever. OK, next up alike at this       week's other big tech news stories.       A slew of new smartphones has been       announced by some of the biggest       players in the industry, keen to       get jump on Apple which will launch       its new iPhone in the next few days.       First up Nokia showed off its Lumia       920 which features wireless       charging and runs micro-Windows 8       operating system and it has a       curved screen which can be used       while wearing gloves. Nokia is       hoping it claw back market share       after Samsung overtook it as the       world's biggest phone maker. The       Finnish firm is also extending its       free music service to handset       owners in America. It works off-       line by downloading music of jirch       genres to the device. Moat rollia       has launched its first handset       since it was acquired by Google in       May. Most notable is the RAZR M the       smallest phone in the 4 G-capable       line up which produces an edge--to-       edge screen in a super thin chassis.       And Motorola say one model can last       13 hours of phoning.       It is not just the phone space       hotting up, Amazon has sparked       interest in two new HD versions of       its popular Kindle. The new seven-       inch version will be available       outside the US where the 8.9 inch       looks set to give Apple's iPad a       run for its money priced at $299.       It is also slashing the price of       basic e-readers and introducing a       new higher res one, introducing a       frontlight making more it more       readable in darker kfpblts       Sweden turns out to be the best       country in the world for making the       web work for its citizens, beating       the US and UK to the top spot. A       new index, be launched by the Web       Foundation, led by the inVenter of       the web himself, analysed 61       countries to evaluate how useful       the web is, content and sensorship       and its political and economic       impact. Sir Tim Berners-Lee says       the high cost of access was the       biggest cost for barriers for most       people and he said he hopes the       index will spur nations and their       citizens to think again about how       the web is used costed and       regulated where they are.

You will       see the first jump to 4 K       resolution I would imagine in a few       years and ultimately if you want       something like 145 inch screen that       we have on display today, you will       need to go to the AK resolution. </p><p>4       K like this is already being used       for surgical applications and       provisional video but you are       probably going to have to wait       until 2020 before 8 K is on the       market.       Another directionsome developers       are going in is with 3 D TV they       are ditching the glasses. Now with       some of these glassless sets you       need to watch the TV whilst stuck       to certain sweet spots, where the       picture unravels, but screen TV       works with a technology that they       say works, whatever your point of       view. I'm no fan of 3 D but stream       TV say they can see through the       eyes of 2 D pictures. The 3 D       module we give to a TV manufacturer       and they will add it to their       device and then it turns into 3 D       glasses television set. Eventually       we will have phones and tablets and       laptops and PCs all using this       technology.       A couple of manufacturers have come       out with transparent screens.       Samsung's a very impressive. One       idea is that you can put it on a       shop front and Samsung is       emphasising the environmental       benefits of doing away with energy-       burning backlights and using       natural light instead. TVs are       getting smarter, bigger, clearer,       if the idea is to make us feel       inadequate about our current       telllies, well, it's probably       working.       David Reid, glued to the screens,       as ever. OK, next up alike at this       week's other big tech news stories.       A slew of new smartphones has been       announced by some of the biggest       players in the industry, keen to       get jump on Apple which will launch       its new iPhone in the next few days.       First up Nokia showed off its Lumia       920 which features wireless       charging and runs micro-Windows 8       operating system and it has a       curved screen which can be used       while wearing gloves. Nokia is       hoping it claw back market share       after Samsung overtook it as the       world's biggest phone maker. The       Finnish firm is also extending its       free music service to handset       owners in America. It works off-       line by downloading music of jirch       genres to the device. Moat rollia       has launched its first handset       since it was acquired by Google in       May. Most notable is the RAZR M the       smallest phone in the 4 G-capable       line up which produces an edge--to-       edge screen in a super thin chassis.       And Motorola say one model can last       13 hours of phoning.       It is not just the phone space       hotting up, Amazon has sparked       interest in two new HD versions of       its popular Kindle. The new seven-       inch version will be available       outside the US where the 8.9 inch       looks set to give Apple's iPad a       run for its money priced at $299.       It is also slashing the price of       basic e-readers and introducing a       new higher res one, introducing a       frontlight making more it more       readable in darker kfpblts       Sweden turns out to be the best       country in the world for making the       web work for its citizens, beating       the US and UK to the top spot. A       new index, be launched by the Web       Foundation, led by the inVenter of       the web himself, analysed 61       countries to evaluate how useful       the web is, content and sensorship       and its political and economic       impact. Sir Tim Berners-Lee says       the high cost of access was the       biggest cost for barriers for most       people and he said he hopes the       index will spur nations and their       citizens to think again about how       the web is used costed and       regulated where they are. And       finally if you keep missing Click,       iPhone and iPad users have another    </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-478bbf7195614516bb5f0cac9b5a8d88</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:570R-GWD1-DY08-325Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"819\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 TVEyes, Inc.

This one is testing a heating system embedded in the pavers, and we then heat the paver just enough so there is no ice that forms. Something we call the building raincoat, so for example it's a sunny day, it can adapt and provide more shade. If there is rain it can adapt to those conditions. </p><p>Sidewalk's plans include robotic refuse collection and self driving taxis, all assisted by a host of different sensors embedded in the neighbourhood. The whole endeavour will be driven by data - data about the weather, about the number of pedestrians and vehicles, and it's this use of data that's creating rising concerns in locals. There are just a couple of problems with this sci-fi sounding project. Number one, it's way behind schedule, which isn't unusual for redevelopment efforts. But number two, in a climate where the public is increasingly distrustful of big tech companies, do the people of Toronto now even want this plan to go ahead? Block Sidewalk is a local campaign group that opposes Sidewalk's plans. They are doing all this planning, bamboozling people with stories about nice paving stones and... But the fundamental issues, is this for our benefit or Alphabet's shareholders' benefit, never get answered, and I think I smell quite a large rat there. Trying to build a neighbourhood at the heart of Toronto on the waterfront, that is filled with sensors and technology that will be able to collect our data, our every move, is something that is very concerning to a lot of people. How our children be consenting to sharing their data, their behavioural data? These are all kind of questions that I think a lot of people have in mind. Questions like these have increased tensions, and scrutiny of the whole project has intensified after several members of its advisory board resigned over privacy concerns. The project is also now facing a challenge in the courts. The Canadian Civil Liberties Association is suing three different levels of government as well as Waterfront Toronto over plans for the tech-driven development. Michael, what is it that Sidewalk is proposing that the CCLA is unhappy with, or opposes? What we are unhappy with is that a private company is self-regulating in an area that involves people's constitutional rights, their privacy and their dignity. What the government in Canada and Ontario and Toronto has done, has said Sidewalk Labs, you figure out how to act in the public interest. You self-regulate the way in which you are going to be collecting and storing data. And we, those of us who live in Toronto, or walk anywhere near or through this part of the waterfront, we are the lab rats. And number one, we never signed up for this, number two, there's no jurisdiction for Waterfront Toronto to do this, and number three, there is no protection whatsoever by law, of the data that is being collected and manipulated and stored and used in whatever form it's going to be used. Privacy and data, there are some huge concerns around privacy and especially data about what happens to it, who is going to manage it. Governance, who has oversight of that data? What I would say is that this project is fundamentally about protecting everyone's privacy, it's built on the established laws we already have in Canada. So it's not us actually that is planning to manage or make money off the data in this neighbourhood, is actually proposed that it's an independent non-profit public sector entity, we have called an urban data trust, that will take responsibility for managing and using the collection of data in this place. Sidewalk Labs has just submitted its thousand-page long master plan document, that outlines what has in store for the Quayside project in more detail. Waterfront Toronto will need to closely examine the paperwork, and it says it will open it up for public discussion. I think you have a perfect storm - timing, players, actors and a pressure point on projects that could be a lighthouse of how you solve these issues if we get it right. If we get it wrong, then that would not be good. As more people become aware of the kind of data that is captured by big tech outfits, and how it's used, concerns around privacy mean decisions made in Toronto could end up having ramifications for future smart city projects around the world. That was Marc. Big tech companies offering services for free in return for data. It's a familiar theme from Toronto to Timbuktu. Originating in Silicon Valley, for some, this type of business transaction has come</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-b153ba634c414d59b5821d0d7092dd3e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WD9-9GJ1-JBH6-C0TJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"787\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

This is one of the micro drones flying around, don't crash. The public can try to have these very tiny drones and can hack into the system and try to take it over. </p><p>So if one falls on our heads... So we're just fixing our drones. They got a little bit mangled in the last competition. This is actually already flattened again. How do you flatten it? She stands on them. You stand on them? Our primary strategy was to use brute force which is why we have this gigantic machine. Motors get hit, it can fly without. If it gets damaged, it can still fly which we thought was amazing however as you can see right now, it is missing stabilisation, this is quite broken. But perhaps overall the event showed the human flying skills on show were often the deciding factor. It looks so easy because they are so adept at it. Your brain does somersaults and it's flicking back the other way and it's all bonkers and the speed with which those drones, they are flying over my head now, the speed with which they make decisions and flips and reverse is just nuts. This is an airborne version of Robot Wars. My kids know nothing of Robot Wars but they will know about this. Both my boys have drones so aerial battling drones, it doesn't get any better. There is a Tesla coil in there, for God's sake. On the fringes of the battlefield, companies and the growing business of taking down drones were showing off their This system is already operating at a Norwegian airport. It tracks and then identifies drones as a threat before jamming the frequencies used to control them. In a usual environment, when you jam the drone, it will either start hovering and go back to his sender, his operator or it will go down eventually on the battery. It can also jam the global positioning system. The drone will start hovering around, flying around because it doesn't know where it is and eventually it will go down also. This beast is the drone catcher, making use of radar systems already in the field to get its targets real-time 3D co-ordinates before automatically flying to the area and lining up its prey. We shoot the net over the drone. We can carry it away with a wire and drop it down with a parachute. And then there is this. The gun emits a powerful electromagnetic beam, knocking out the command and control, video link and GPS frequencies used by the drone. Strict regulations in Europe mean it can't be used here but its Dutch makers told me they are doing good business with governments in the Middle East. Back in the arena, and the final was under way. In the end, it came down to brute force and battery power, with Belgium's Team Slunse flying away with the 30k prize. The Dutch authorities certainly have a more entertaining way of learning how to down rogue drones than standing around and scratching their heads. Now, in some parts of the world it has become pretty commonplace for kids to learn to code, but for those with vision problems, it is still fairly inaccessible so we sent Paul Carter to find out what some of the big tech companies are doing to try and open up coding to children who are blind or partially sighted. And then what happens? I'm just having a word with this naughty pod. Oh, yes. It's trying to run away. This is eight-year-old Ellie. Like many other children her age she is learning how to code. She also happens to be blind. Do you have it on the one you want to happen first? Yeah. Ellie is using a physical, tactile coding language called Code Jumper. Developed by Microsoft, it is a block-based modular system consisting of a series of pods. Each of which contains a single line of code, making up a story, a poem or in this case, a song. _ Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream, life is but a dream..._ Coding is by its nature a visual medium and often requires being able to see the whole picture. What makes Code Jumper unique is that it allows blind and partially sighted children to have an overview of their code with their hands. The woman leading the project is Cecily Morrison, a computer scientist at Microsoft's Cambridge research laboratory, who herself has a blind son.

We just have to use the information in the right way. So your latest book, How To Make The World Add Up, was just being finished, I think, as we were going into lockdown, and I wonder whether you looked at what the virus was doing around the world and whether that taught you anything about statistics. Well, I'm sad to say it underlined the point that I was trying to make in the book, which was that while we tend to think of statistics as a kind of political weapon - you know, people lie with statistics and they try to win arguments with statistics - actually, statistics are a way of seeing the world around us, seeing things we can't see in any other way. </p><p>So, they're a bit like, you need radar to spot incoming bombers, we need statistics to spot the incoming virus. So, I'm trying to get people to take the numbers seriously as a way of seeing what's true. This isn't fog, it's smoke - California is a state reeling from wildfires. Flying into San Francisco this week from London, you could barely see the city. My name is James Clayton and I'm the new BBC and Click San Francisco technology reporter. And I've landed at a pretty weird time. I've been to San Francisco a few times before, but this was San Francisco, only different. Mandatory masks everywhere. The airport's almost completely empty, the streets quieter - much more so than London. I've come during a monster week for tech, though, many of the stories based on themes that are likely to dominate tech journalism in the years to come. On Monday, Oracle agreed a deal with TikTok to oversee its US operations after Mr Trump said it would ban the company if it couldn't find a US suitor. I'll be doing more on how tech is being dragged into a geopolitical battle between China and the US. It was also a week that Twitter launched its election hub to promote accurate information and resources for voters. How companies like Google and Twitter and Facebook regulate their platforms in the run-up to the elections are likely to have a massive impact on that November poll, and it's something that Click will be doing more on. It also happens to be a week when Mr Trump visited California, sparking controversy by refusing to acknowledge climate change's impact on the environment. Going forward, could big tech do more by not just being green companies themselves, but by leading the way in innovation, perhaps even reversing some of the damage that humans have done to our planet? At Apple's launch on Tuesday, the company didn't release an iPhone or ARM-based MacBooks, but it did centre its new iteration of products around health care, including a new Apple Watch that can measure oxygen levels in the blood. How the world of tech responds to Covid-19 in the coming years is likely to be crucial in our battle against the virus. And finally this week, Google was grilled by senators asking questions about antitrust. Or, in other words, are companies like Google monopolistic? Whether massive tech companies like Facebook and Apple and Amazon are simply too big, whether they should even be broken up, are central challenges to governments around the world. The tech stories that we've seen this week underpin perhaps the fundamental question of our age - how can we harness the progress that humanity has made for good and not bad? That was James Clayton, who, as he says, is our new man</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCWLD-b801ade307ce4a6391c5224e5c5eeb32</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCWLD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60WB-2381-JBH6-C1SC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402043</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"624\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

James, not even off the plane and we ask you to start filming, well done. What a time to move to San Francisco, though. It's a really strange time for two reasons. </p><p>I mean, obviously, you've seen those horrendous pictures of California under this huge blanket of smoke. And it's not just California, it's pretty much the whole of western America - it's Oregon, it's Washington. And then, of course, you have Covid-19. Covid-19 has affected the US very badly and California is no exception, and it's really noticeable. So, how do you feel about being there? If you look at all of the conferences that are coming up, literally all of them being able to get there are virtual. So, the chances of me actually and review products in the same way as my predecessor did, well, it's going to be quite unlikely for now. I know that different people feel differently about climate change within the US and the big tech giants have certainly committed to trying to go carbon neutral - or I think Google now says it is carbon neutral - do you think the arrival of the forest fires at the doors of these companies will change any of their behaviours or focus any of their attention? I think the next stage is, are they going to really invest in the kind of innovation that the world might actually need to try and reverse some of this climate change? And, at the moment, Microsoft have committed a lot of money to that, so have Amazon, so have Apple too, but really, it's only been the last year that that's happened. What else are you looking forward to covering? Well, the big tech story in the next five, six weeks is going to be on social media, with the US elections. You're already seeing all sorts of disinformation, all sorts of challenges and problems that companies like Facebook and Twitter and Google - that owns YouTube - are having to make when trying to regulate what should and shouldn't be on it. Well, we're looking forward to hearing more about it from you over the coming weeks. James, thank you very much and stay there! You know, all of these launch events that we've been talking about, and indeed the run-up to the US election, they're all like theatre, really, aren't they? And that links perfectly to the next bit of the programme. Yes, theatre has had a particularly tough time of it since March, and until actors can tread the boards again, technology is seeing whether it can fill the void. But can it really provide the excitement of a live performance? Marc Cieslak has disappeared down the rabbit hole to find out. We're late, we're late, for a very important theatrical date. However, in order to follow Alice down the rabbit hole for an adventure in Wonderland, all we have to do is log into a video chat call. Are you all OK? Alice - A Virtual Theme Park is actually an immersive theatre show which, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the audience experiences from the comfort of their homes, via the video chat platform Zoom. Had Matter, Mad Hatter - you see, everyone in Wonderland's a little bit mixed up! It's the result of a collaboration between theatre companies Creation, Big Telly and Fox Dog, partnering with tech outfit Charisma.ai. We have built an animated version of the Cheshire Cat that the audience talk to. You are now ready to go further into Wonderland... And before the show, they can chat to it, flirt to it. It's been asked out on dates a couple of times. And then the second thing we do is we've really pushed Zoom into sort of video game territory. So, we've taken the tiles that everyone's used to in video conferences, separated them out and then dropped them into a 3D games engine. And you can wave to all the other members of the audience, just before you zoom down the rabbit hole into Wonderland. I think, for us, we started experimenting really early on in lockdown. So, two weeks into lockdown, we did a production of The Tempest, and what we discovered with that was, what's really exciting, when it really comes alive, is when the audience are live and can be seen live too, so its performers live and its audience live, and you have moments where you see each other. A lot of our shows pre-lockdown were in site-specific locations, moving around, giving the audience, in small groups, little challenges to do. It's as much live film or live gaming, and I think what the pandemic has created is this opportunity to put real people into a digital world. Few industries have escaped the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. Theatre has been badly hit. What theatre is about, it's about physically being with other people. It's about being shoulder- to-shoulder with somebody. It's about having the freedom to laugh,</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCWLD-2322f8e786e944a786537ca50ba0d4d5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCWLD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60WB-6MH1-DY08-319W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402043</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"835\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

WeChat's privacy policy says it will provide the Chinese government access to much of what you do in the app when legally required, including the things you type and data, like your location. It's hard to deny that social apps in China have taken on a life of their own, if not outpacing, then going in new directions to competitors in the West. The big question is whether more Chinese apps can follow TikTok in going global despite the concerns around privacy and censorship, or, if not, it could be the turn of tech companies in the West to play copycat themselves. </p><p>That was Stephen Beckett's view of China. And since the explosion of TikTok in the West, other apps have been springing up to try and compete, and Chris Fox has been looking at some of the alternatives that are available. If you can't get enough of short, hyper-edited videos, luckily there are plenty of apps that have cottoned on to the format. This is Triller, which I think it's fair to say has taken a bit of inspiration from TikTok. You can record clips with special effects and share them onto an endless scrolling feed of content. Triller seems to have done quite well out of all this uncertainty. At the start of August. it topped the App Store charts on both iOS and Android, and it's managed to attract some big name TikTok stars and celebrities over onto its platform, including Mike Tyson and the magician Dynamo. Another app offering a similar experience is Byte, which has also been popping in and out of the App Store top download charts. Like TikTok, it offers you creative effects for your videos, although it is trailing behind Triller. It's been downloaded more than a million times on Google Play, whereas Triller's had more than ten million. TikTok's biggest competition may come from Instagram Reels, Instagram's newly launched rival. It has incorporated many of TikTok's core features, including that endlessly scrolling feed of short videos. Just in the past few weeks, Mark Zuckerberg has appeared at a Congressional hearing about big tech companies using their power to neutralise the competition. Isn't ripping off TikTok essentially doing that? There is innovation everywhere and people are constantly inspired by what they see. It's no longer a surprise to see a feed in a mobile social product. That wasn't necessarily the case until Facebook brought that to scale. We brought stories to Instagram in 2016 and give full credit to Snap for inventing that format, but then evolved it from there. So what is Instagram bringing to the table with this format that makes it different to TikTok? I think the ability to be discovered is unique to Reels. I think on Instagram, historically, if you had a large follower base, it was easy to kind of get bigger. This is now a product specifically designed to help creators find an audience. Now, to be fair to TikTok, I think the idea that you never know what video is going to go viral or who gets discovered is exactly what draws creators to TikTok - it's certainly not unique to Instagram Reels - but I think companies are seeing that TikTok has refined a winning formula and they want a piece of the action. And that's it for this week. Next week, we're going to be looking at another hugely important topic - the technology being used to fight climate change. Until then, you can keep up with us on social media, on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, @bbcclick. Thanks for watching and we'll see you soon.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCWLD-bb70ded967ac4b4385b239b7921d671b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCWLD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60KW-74B1-DY08-31JP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402043</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"622\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

At Apple's launch on Tuesday, the company didn't release an iPhone or ARM-based MacBooks, but it did centre its new iteration of products around health care, including a new Apple Watch that can measure oxygen levels in the blood. How the world of tech responds to Covid-19 in the coming years is likely to be crucial in our battle against the virus. And finally this week, Google was grilled by senators asking questions about antitrust. </p><p>Or, in other words, are companies like Google monopolistic? Whether massive tech companies like Facebook and Apple and Amazon are simply too big, whether they should even be broken up, are central challenges to governments around the world. The tech stories that we've seen this week underpin perhaps the fundamental question of our age - how can we harness the progress that humanity has made for good and not bad? That was James Clayton, who, as he says, is our new man in San Francisco, and he's online now. James, not even off the plane and we ask you to start filming, well done. What a time to move to San Francisco, though. It's a really strange time for two reasons. I mean, obviously, you've seen those horrendous pictures of California under this huge blanket of smoke. And it's not just California, it's pretty much the whole of western America - it's Oregon, it's Washington. And then, of course, you have Covid-19. Covid-19 has affected the US very badly and California is no exception, and it's really noticeable. So, how do you feel about being there? If you look at all of the conferences that are coming up, literally all of them are virtual. So, the chances of me actually being able to get there and review products in the same way as my predecessor did, well, it's going to be quite unlikely for now. I know that different people feel differently about climate change within the US and the big tech giants have certainly committed to trying to go carbon neutral - or I think Google now says it is carbon neutral - do you think the arrival of the forest fires at the doors of these companies will change any of their behaviours or focus any of their attention? I think the next stage is, are they going to really invest in the kind of innovation that the world might actually need to try and reverse some of this climate change? And, at the moment, Microsoft have committed a lot of money to that, so have Amazon, so have Apple too, but really, it's only been the last year that that's happened. What else are you looking forward to covering? is going to be on social media, Well, the big tech story in the next five, six weeks with the US elections. You're already seeing all sorts of disinformation, all sorts of challenges and problems that companies like Facebook and Twitter and Google - that owns YouTube - are having to make when trying to regulate what should and shouldn't be on it. Well, we're looking forward to hearing more about it from you over the coming weeks. James, thank you very much and stay there! You know, all of these launch events that we've been talking about, and indeed the run-up to the US election, they're all like theatre, really, aren't they? And that links perfectly to the next bit of the programme. Yes, theatre has had a particularly tough time of it since March, and until actors can tread the boards again, technology is seeing whether it can fill the void. But can it really provide the excitement of a live performance? Marc Cieslak has disappeared down the rabbit hole to find out. We're late, we're late, for a very important theatrical date. However, in order to follow Alice down the rabbit hole for an adventure in Wonderland, all we have to do is log into a video chat call. Are you all OK? Alice - A Virtual Theme Park is actually an immersive theatre show which, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the audience experiences from the comfort of their homes, via the video chat platform Zoom. Had Matter, Mad Hatter - you see, everyone in Wonderland's a little bit mixed up! It's the result of a collaboration between theatre companies Creation, Big Telly and Fox Dog, partnering with tech outfit Charisma.ai. We have built an animated version of the Cheshire Cat that the audience talk to. You are now ready to go further into Wonderland... And before the show, they can chat to it, flirt to it. It's been asked out on dates a couple of times. And then the second thing we do is we've really pushed Zoom into sort of</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCWLD-8e2cbaea14e14ec0bd240f5a2ad907a5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCWLD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60WM-9K71-DY08-301V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402043</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"821\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

But is the convenience worth the possible cost to privacy? In 2016, Amnesty International awarded the parent company of WeChat, Tencent, zero out of 100 for their privacy practices. I think there's a common perception that people in China don't care about their privacy and that perception is completely false. </p><p>The government, over the last few years, has been trying to roll out its own cybersecurity regulations and trying to educate consumers about the dangers of data being lost or leaked. WeChat's privacy policy says it will provide the Chinese government access to much of what you do in the app when legally required, including the things you type and data, like your location. It's hard to deny that social apps in China have taken on a life of their own, if not outpacing, then going in new directions to competitors in the West. The big question is whether more Chinese apps can follow TikTok in going global despite the concerns around privacy and censorship, or, if not, it could be the turn of tech companies in the West to play copycat themselves. That was Stephen Beckett's view of China. And since the explosion of TikTok in the West, other apps have been springing up to try and compete, and Chris Fox has been looking at some of the alternatives that are available. If you can't get enough of short, hyper-edited videos, luckily there are plenty of apps that have cottoned on to the format. This is Triller, which I think it's fair to say has taken a bit of inspiration from TikTok. You can record clips with special effects and share them onto an endless scrolling feed of content. Triller seems to have done quite well out of all this uncertainty. At the start of August. it topped the App Store charts on both iOS and Android, and it's managed to attract some big name TikTok stars and celebrities over onto its platform, including Mike Tyson and the magician Dynamo. Another app offering a similar experience is Byte, which has also been popping in and out of the App Store top download charts. Like TikTok, it offers you creative effects for your videos, although it is trailing behind Triller. It's been downloaded more than a million times on Google Play, whereas Triller's had more than ten million. TikTok's biggest competition may come from Instagram Reels, Instagram's newly launched rival. It has incorporated many of TikTok's core features, including that endlessly scrolling feed of short videos. Just in the past few weeks, Mark Zuckerberg has appeared at a Congressional hearing about big tech companies using their power to neutralise the competition. Isn't ripping off TikTok essentially doing that? There is innovation everywhere and people are constantly inspired by what they see. It's no longer a surprise to see a feed in a mobile social product. That wasn't necessarily the case until Facebook brought that to scale. We brought stories to Instagram in 2016 and give full credit to Snap for inventing that format, but then evolved it from there. So what is Instagram bringing to the table with this format that makes it different to TikTok? I think the ability to be discovered is unique to Reels. I think on Instagram, historically, if you had a large follower base, it was easy to kind of get bigger. This is now a product specifically designed to help creators find an audience. Now, to be fair to TikTok, I think the idea that you never know what video is going to go viral or who gets discovered is exactly what draws creators to TikTok - it's certainly not unique to Instagram Reels - but I think companies are seeing that TikTok has refined a winning formula and they want a piece of the action. And that's it for this week. Next week, we're going to be looking at another hugely important topic - the technology being used to fight climate change. Until then, you can keep up with us on social media, on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, @bbcclick. Thanks for watching and we'll see you soon.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCWLD-31771e77021b4d94900d5c4ce2b9af8f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCWLD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60M5-B311-DY08-30M2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402043</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"693\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

We just have to use the information in the right way. So your latest book, How To Make The World Add Up, was just being finished, I think, as we were going into lockdown, and I wonder whether you looked at what the virus was doing around the world and whether that taught you anything about statistics. Well, I'm sad to say it underlined the point that I was trying to make in the book, which was that while we tend to think of statistics as a kind of political weapon - you know, people lie with statistics and they try to win arguments with statistics - actually, statistics are a way of seeing the world around us, seeing things we can't see in any other way. </p><p>So, they're a bit like, you need radar to spot incoming bombers, we need statistics to spot the incoming virus. So, I'm trying to get people to take the numbers seriously as a way of seeing what's true. This isn't fog, it's smoke - California is a state reeling from wildfires. Flying into San Francisco this week from London, you could barely see the city. My name is James Clayton and I'm the new BBC and Click San Francisco technology reporter. And I've landed at a pretty weird time. I've been to San Francisco a few times before, but this was San Francisco, only different. Mandatory masks everywhere. The airport's almost completely empty, the streets quieter - much more so than London. I've come during a monster week for tech, though, many of the stories based on themes that are likely to dominate tech journalism in the years to come. On Monday, Oracle agreed a deal with TikTok to oversee its US operations after Mr Trump said it would ban the company if it couldn't find a US suitor. I'll be doing more on how tech is being dragged into a geopolitical battle between China and the US. It was also a week that Twitter launched its election hub to promote accurate information and resources for voters. How companies like Google and Twitter and Facebook regulate their platforms in the run-up to the elections are likely to have a massive impact on that November poll, and it's something that Click will be doing more on. It also happens to be a week when Mr Trump visited California, sparking controversy by refusing to acknowledge climate change's impact on the environment. Going forward, could big tech do more by not just being green companies themselves, but by leading the way in innovation, perhaps even reversing some of the damage that humans have done to our planet? At Apple's launch on Tuesday, the company didn't release an iPhone or ARM-based MacBooks, but it did centre its new iteration of products around health care, including a new Apple Watch that can measure oxygen levels in the blood. How the world of tech responds to Covid-19 in the coming years is likely to be crucial in our battle against the virus. And finally this week, Google was grilled by senators asking questions about antitrust. Or, in other words, are companies like Google monopolistic? Whether massive tech companies like Facebook and Apple and Amazon are simply too big, whether they should even be broken up, are central challenges to governments around the world. The tech stories that we've seen this week underpin perhaps the fundamental question of our age - how can we harness the progress that humanity has made for good and not bad? That was James Clayton, who, as he says, is our new man</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCWLD-1bf56a3e8d0b4ffa9abb49f1ace7e570</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCWLD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60X6-7W71-JBH6-C271-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402043</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"624\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

James, not even off the plane and we ask you to start filming, well done. What a time to move to San Francisco, though. It's a really strange time for two reasons. </p><p>I mean, obviously, you've seen those horrendous pictures of California under this huge blanket of smoke. And it's not just California, it's pretty much the whole of western America - it's Oregon, it's Washington. And then, of course, you have Covid-19. Covid-19 has affected the US very badly and California is no exception, and it's really noticeable. So, how do you feel about being there? If you look at all of the conferences that are coming up, literally all of them are virtual. So, the chances of me actually being able to get there and review products in the same way as my predecessor did, well, it's going to be quite unlikely for now. I know that different people feel differently about climate change within the US and the big tech giants have certainly committed to trying to go carbon neutral - or I think Google now says it is carbon neutral - do you think the arrival of the forest fires at the doors of these companies will change any of their behaviours or focus any of their attention? I think the next stage is, are they going to really invest in the kind of innovation that the world might actually need to try and reverse some of this climate change? And, at the moment, Microsoft have committed a lot of money to that, so have Amazon, so have Apple too, but really, it's only been the last year that that's happened. What else are you looking forward to covering? Well, the big tech story in the next five, six weeks is going to be on social media, with the US elections. You're already seeing all sorts of disinformation, all sorts of challenges and problems that companies like Facebook and Twitter and Google - that owns YouTube - are having to make when trying to regulate what should and shouldn't be on it. Well, we're looking forward to hearing more about it from you over the coming weeks. James, thank you very much and stay there! You know, all of these launch events that we've been talking about, and indeed the run-up to the US election, they're all like theatre, really, aren't they? And that links perfectly to the next bit of the programme. Yes, theatre has had a particularly tough time of it since March, and until actors can tread the boards again, technology is seeing whether it can fill the void. But can it really provide the excitement of a live performance? Marc Cieslak has disappeared down the rabbit hole to find out. We're late, we're late, for a very important theatrical date. However, in order to follow Alice down the rabbit hole for an adventure in Wonderland, all we have to do is log into a video chat call. Are you all OK? Alice - A Virtual Theme Park is actually an immersive theatre show which, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the audience experiences from the comfort of their homes, via the video chat platform Zoom. Had Matter, Mad Hatter - you see, everyone in Wonderland's a little bit mixed up! It's the result of a collaboration between theatre companies Creation, Big Telly and Fox Dog, partnering with tech outfit Charisma.ai. We have built an animated version of the Cheshire Cat that the audience talk to. You are now ready to go further into Wonderland... And before the show, they can chat to it, flirt to it. It's been asked out on dates a couple of times. And then the second thing we do is we've really pushed Zoom into sort of video game territory. So, we've taken the tiles that everyone's used to in video conferences, separated them out and then dropped them into a 3D games engine. And you can wave to all the other members of the audience, just before you zoom down the rabbit hole into Wonderland. I think, for us, we started experimenting really early on in lockdown. So, two weeks into lockdown, we did a production of The Tempest, and what we discovered with that was, what's really exciting, when it really comes alive, is when the audience are live and can be seen live too, so its performers live and its audience live, and you have moments where you see each other. A lot of our shows pre-lockdown were in site-specific locations, moving around, giving the audience, in small groups, little challenges to do. It's as much live film or live gaming, and I think what the pandemic has created is this opportunity to put real people into a digital world. Few industries have escaped the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. Theatre has been badly hit. What theatre is about, it's about physically being with other people. It's about being shoulder- to-shoulder with somebody. It's about having</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCWLD-b4795645019642f8be4eed20b985af1c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCWLD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60X6-7W71-JBH6-C27C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402043</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"831\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

We just have to use the information in the right way. So your latest book, How To Make The World Add Up, was just being finished, I think, as we were going into lockdown, and I wonder whether you looked at what the virus was doing around the world and whether that taught you anything about statistics. Well, I'm sad to say it underlined the point that I was trying to make in the book, which was that while we tend to think of statistics as a kind of political weapon - you know, people lie with statistics and they try to win arguments with statistics - actually, statistics are a way of seeing the world around us, seeing things we can't see in any other way. </p><p>So, they're a bit like, you need radar to spot incoming bombers, we need statistics to spot the incoming virus. So, I'm trying to get people to take the numbers seriously as a way of seeing what's true. This isn't fog, it's smoke - California is a state reeling from wildfires. Flying into San Francisco this week from London, you could barely see the city. My name is James Clayton and I'm the new BBC and Click San Francisco technology reporter. And I've landed at a pretty weird time. I've been to San Francisco a few times before, but this was San Francisco, only different. Mandatory masks everywhere. The airport's almost completely empty, the streets quieter - much more so than London. I've come during a monster week for tech, though, many of the stories based on themes that are likely to dominate tech journalism in the years to come. On Monday, Oracle agreed a deal with TikTok to oversee its US operations after Mr Trump said it would ban the company if it couldn't find a US suitor. I'll be doing more on how tech is being dragged into a geopolitical battle between China and the US. It was also a week that Twitter launched its election hub to promote accurate information and resources for voters. How companies like Google and Twitter and Facebook regulate their platforms in the run-up to the elections are likely to have a massive impact on that November poll, and it's something that Click will be doing more on. It also happens to be a week when Mr Trump visited California, sparking controversy by refusing to acknowledge climate change's impact on the environment. Going forward, could big tech do more by not just being green companies themselves, but by leading the way in innovation, perhaps even reversing some of the damage that humans have done to our planet? At Apple's launch on Tuesday, the company didn't release an iPhone or ARM-based MacBooks, but it did centre its new iteration of products around health care, including a new Apple Watch that can measure oxygen levels in the blood. How the world of tech responds to Covid-19 in the coming years is likely to be crucial in our battle against the virus. And finally this week, Google was grilled by senators asking questions about antitrust. Or, in other words, are companies like Google monopolistic? Whether massive tech companies like Facebook and Apple and Amazon are simply too big, whether they should even be broken up, are central challenges to governments around the world. The tech stories that we've seen this week underpin perhaps the fundamental question of our age - how can we harness the progress that humanity has made for good and not bad? That was James Clayton, who,</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCWLD-0903b2c9da9b4d60b905f2fdbd4baaa4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCWLD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60W4-JKV1-JBH6-C40H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402043</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"620\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

James, not even off the plane and we ask you to start filming, well done. What a time to move to San Francisco, though. It's a really strange time for two reasons. </p><p>I mean, obviously, you've seen those horrendous pictures of California under this huge blanket of smoke. And it's not just California, it's pretty much the whole of western America - it's Oregon, it's Washington. And then, of course, you have Covid-19. Covid-19 has affected the US very badly and California is no exception, and it's really noticeable. So, how do you feel about being there? If you look at all of the conferences that are coming up, literally all of them are virtual. So, the chances of me actually being able to get there and review products in the same way as my predecessor did, well, it's going to be quite unlikely for now. I know that different people feel differently about climate change within the US and the big tech giants have certainly committed to trying to it is carbon neutral - go carbon neutral - do you think the arrival of the forest fires at the doors of these companies will change any of their behaviours or focus any of their attention? I think the next stage is, are they going to really invest in the kind of innovation that the world might actually need to try and reverse some of this climate change? And, at the moment, Microsoft have committed a lot of money to that, so have Amazon, so have Apple too, but really, it's only been the last year that that's happened. What else are you looking forward to covering? Well, the big tech story in the next five, six weeks is going to be on social media, with the US elections. You're already seeing all sorts of disinformation, all sorts of challenges and problems that companies like Facebook and Twitter and Google - that owns YouTube - are having to make when trying to regulate what should and shouldn't be on it. Well, we're looking forward to hearing more about it from you over the coming weeks. James, thank you very much and stay there! You know, all of these launch events that we've been talking about, and indeed the run-up to the US election, they're all like theatre, really, aren't they? And that links perfectly to the next bit of the programme. Yes, theatre has had a particularly tough time of it since March, and until actors can tread the boards again, technology is seeing whether it can fill the void. But can it really provide the excitement of a live performance? Marc Cieslak has disappeared down the rabbit hole to find out. We're late, we're late, for a very important theatrical date. However, in order to follow Alice down the rabbit hole for an adventure in Wonderland, all we have to do is log into a video chat call. Alice - A Virtual Theme Park is actually an immersive theatre show which, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the audience experiences from the comfort of their homes, via the video chat platform Zoom. Had Matter, Mad Hatter - you see, everyone in Wonderland's a little bit mixed up! It's the result of a collaboration between theatre companies Creation, Big Telly and Fox Dog, partnering with tech outfit Charisma.ai. We have built an animated version of the Cheshire Cat that the audience talk to. You are now ready to go further into Wonderland... And before the show, they can chat to it, flirt to it. It's been asked out on dates a couple of times. And then the second thing we do is we've really pushed Zoom into sort of video game territory. So, we've taken the tiles that everyone's used to in video conferences, separated them out and then dropped them into a 3D games engine. And you can wave to all the other members of the audience, just before you zoom down the rabbit hole into Wonderland. I think, for us, we started experimenting really early on in lockdown. So, two weeks into lockdown, we did a production of The Tempest, and what we discovered with that was, what's really exciting, when it really comes alive, is when the audience are live and can be seen live too, so its performers live and its audience live, and you have moments where you see each other. A lot of our shows pre-lockdown were in site-specific locations, moving around, giving the audience, in small groups, little challenges to do. It's as much live film or live gaming, and I think what the pandemic has created is this opportunity to put real people into a digital world. Few industries have escaped the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. Theatre has been badly hit. What theatre is about, it's about physically being with other people. It's about being shoulder- to-shoulder with somebody.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCWLD-aee1d746941540b0bb901523b4117a9a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCWLD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60W4-JKV1-JBH6-C401-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402043</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"825\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

WeChat's privacy policy says it will provide the Chinese government access to much of what you do in the app when legally required, including the things you type and data, like your location. It's hard to deny that social apps in China have taken on a life of their own, if not outpacing, then going in new directions to competitors in the West. The big question is whether more Chinese apps can follow TikTok in going global despite the concerns around privacy and censorship, or, if not, it could be the turn of tech companies in the West to play copycat themselves. </p><p>That was Stephen Beckett's view of China. And since the explosion of TikTok in the West, other apps have been springing up to try and compete, and Chris Fox has been looking at some of the alternatives that are available. If you can't get enough of short, hyper-edited videos, luckily there are plenty of apps that have cottoned on to the format. This is Triller, which I think it's fair to say has taken a bit of inspiration from TikTok. You can record clips with special effects and share them onto an endless scrolling feed of content. Triller seems to have done quite well out of all this uncertainty. At the start of August. it topped the App Store charts on both iOS and Android, and it's managed to attract some big name TikTok stars and celebrities over onto its platform, including Mike Tyson and the magician Dynamo. Another app offering a similar experience is Byte, which has also been popping in and out of the App Store top download charts. Like TikTok, it offers you creative effects for your videos, although it is trailing behind Triller. It's been downloaded more than a million times on Google Play, whereas Triller's had more than ten million. TikTok's biggest competition may come from Instagram Reels, Instagram's newly launched rival. It has incorporated many of TikTok's core features, including that endlessly scrolling feed of short videos. Just in the past few weeks, Mark Zuckerberg has appeared at a Congressional hearing about big tech companies using their power to neutralise the competition. Isn't ripping off TikTok essentially doing that? There is innovation everywhere and people are constantly inspired by what they see. It's no longer a surprise to see a feed in a mobile social product. That wasn't necessarily the case until Facebook brought that to scale. We brought stories to Instagram in 2016 and give full credit to Snap for inventing that format, but then evolved it from there. So what is Instagram bringing to the table with this format that makes it different to TikTok? I think the ability to be discovered is unique to Reels. I think on Instagram, historically, if you had a large follower base, it was easy to kind of get bigger. This is now a product specifically designed to help creators find an audience. Now, to be fair to TikTok, I think the idea that you never know what video is going to go viral or who gets discovered is exactly what draws creators to TikTok - it's certainly not unique to Instagram Reels - but I think companies are seeing that TikTok has refined a winning formula and they want a piece of the action. And that's it for this week. Next week, we're going to be looking at another hugely important topic - the technology being used to fight climate change. Until then, you can keep up with us on social media, on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, @bbcclick. Thanks for watching and we'll see you soon.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCWLD-4245d0e914c045378ed4821960ca16ce</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCWLD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60KN-RS71-JBH6-C38H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402043</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"624\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

We just have to use the information in the right way. So your latest book, How To Make The World Add Up, was just being finished, I think, as we were going into lockdown, and I wonder whether you looked at what the virus was doing around the world and whether that taught you anything about statistics. Well, I'm sad to say it underlined the point that I was trying to make in the book, which was that while we tend to think of statistics as a kind of political weapon - you know, people lie with statistics and they try to win arguments with statistics - actually, statistics are a way of seeing the world around us, seeing things we can't see in any other way. </p><p>So, they're a bit like, you need radar to spot incoming bombers, we need statistics to spot the incoming virus. So, I'm trying to get people to take the numbers seriously as a way of seeing what's true. This isn't fog, it's smoke - California is a state reeling from wildfires. Flying into San Francisco this week from London, you could barely see the city. My name is James Clayton and I'm the new BBC and Click San Francisco technology reporter. And I've landed at a pretty weird time. I've been to San Francisco a few times before, but this was San Francisco, only different. Mandatory masks everywhere. The airport's almost completely empty, the streets quieter - much more so than London. I've come during a monster week for tech, though, many of the stories based on themes that are likely to dominate tech journalism in the years to come. On Monday, Oracle agreed a deal with TikTok to oversee its US operations after Mr Trump said it would ban the company if it couldn't find a US suitor. I'll be doing more on how tech is being dragged into a geopolitical battle between China and the US. It was also a week that Twitter launched its election hub to promote accurate information and resources for voters. How companies like Google and Twitter and Facebook regulate their platforms in the run-up to the elections are likely to have a massive impact on that November poll, and it's something that Click will be doing more on. It also happens to be a week when Mr Trump visited California, sparking controversy by refusing to acknowledge climate change's impact on the environment. Going forward, could big tech do more by not just being green companies themselves, but by leading the way in innovation, perhaps even reversing some of the damage that humans have done to our planet? At Apple's launch on Tuesday, the company didn't release an iPhone or ARM-based MacBooks, but it did centre its new iteration of products around health care, including a new Apple Watch that can measure oxygen levels in the blood. How the world of tech responds to Covid-19 in the coming years is likely to be crucial in our battle against the virus. And finally this week, Google was grilled by senators asking questions about antitrust. Or, in other words, are companies like Google monopolistic? Whether massive tech companies like Facebook and Apple and Amazon are simply too big, whether they should even be broken up, are central challenges to governments around the world. The tech stories that we've seen this week underpin perhaps the fundamental question of our age - how can we harness the progress that humanity has made for good and not bad?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCWLD-8828d41c2e414dfa8fdb72ffa7b8eff7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCWLD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60W6-P9W1-JBH6-C3TK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402043</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"615\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

James, not even off the plane and we ask you to start filming, well done. What a time to move to San Francisco, though. It's a really strange time for two reasons. </p><p>I mean, obviously, you've seen those horrendous pictures of California under this huge blanket of smoke. And it's not just California, it's pretty much the whole of western America - it's Oregon, it's Washington. And then, of course, you have Covid-19. Covid-19 has affected the US very badly and California is no exception, and it's really noticeable. So, how do you feel about being there? If you look at all of the conferences that are coming up, literally all of them are virtual. So, the chances of me actually being able to get there and review products in the same way as my predecessor did, well, it's going to be quite unlikely for now. I know that different people feel differently about climate change within the US and the big tech giants have certainly committed to trying to go carbon neutral - or I think Google now says it is carbon neutral - do you think the arrival of the forest fires at the doors of these companies will change any of their behaviours or focus any of their attention? I think the next stage is, are they going to really invest in the kind of innovation that the world might actually need to try and reverse some of this climate change? And, at the moment, Microsoft have committed a lot of money to that, so have Amazon, so have Apple too, but really, it's only been the last year that that's happened. What else are you looking forward to covering? Well, the big tech story in the next five, six weeks is going to be on social media, with the US elections. You're already seeing all sorts of disinformation, all sorts of challenges and problems that companies like Facebook and Twitter and Google - that owns YouTube - are having to make when trying to regulate what should and shouldn't be on it. Well, we're looking forward to hearing more about it from you over the coming weeks. James, thank you very much and stay there! You know, all of these launch events that we've been talking about, and indeed the run-up to the US election, they're all like theatre, really, aren't they? And that links perfectly to the next bit of the programme. Yes, theatre has had a particularly tough time of it since March, and until actors can tread the boards again, technology is seeing whether it can fill the void. But can it really provide the excitement of a live performance? Marc Cieslak has disappeared down the rabbit hole to find out. We're late, we're late, for a very important theatrical date. However, in order to follow Alice down the rabbit hole for an adventure in Wonderland, all we have to do is log into a video chat call. Are you all OK? Alice - A Virtual Theme Park is actually an immersive theatre show which, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the audience experiences from the comfort of their homes, via the video chat platform Zoom. Had Matter, Mad Hatter - you see, everyone in Wonderland's a little bit mixed up! It's the result of a collaboration between theatre companies Creation, Big Telly and Fox Dog, partnering with tech outfit Charisma.ai. We have built an animated version of the Cheshire Cat that the audience talk to. You are now ready to go further into Wonderland... And before the show, they can chat to it, flirt to it. It's been asked out on dates a couple of times. And then the second thing we do is we've really pushed Zoom into sort of video game territory. So, we've taken the tiles that everyone's used to in video conferences, separated them out and then dropped them into a 3D games engine. And you can wave to all the other members of the audience, just before you zoom down the rabbit hole into Wonderland. I think, for us, we started experimenting really early on in lockdown. So, two weeks into lockdown, we did a production of The Tempest, and what we discovered with that was, what's really exciting, when it really comes alive, is when the audience are live and can be seen live too, so its performers live and its audience live, and you have moments where you see each other. A lot of our shows pre-lockdown were in site-specific locations, moving around, giving the audience, in small groups, little challenges to do. It's as much live film or live gaming, and I think what the pandemic has created is this opportunity to put real people into a digital world. Few industries have escaped the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. Theatre has been badly hit. What theatre is about, it's about physically being with other people. It's about being shoulder- to-shoulder with somebody.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCWLD-2b165fa9cbcf4b30bb8e3076ec65c789</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCWLD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60W6-P9W1-JBH6-C3T7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402043</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"834\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

WeChat's privacy policy says it will provide the Chinese government access to much of what you do in the app when legally required, including the things you type and data, like your location. It's hard to deny that social apps in China have taken on a life of their own, if not outpacing, then going in new directions to competitors in the West. The big question is whether more Chinese apps can follow TikTok in going global despite the concerns around privacy and censorship, or, if not, it could be the turn of tech companies in the West to play copycat themselves. </p><p>That was Stephen Beckett's view of China. And since the explosion of TikTok in the West, other apps have been springing up to try and compete, and Chris Fox has been looking at some of the alternatives that are available. If you can't get enough of short, hyper-edited videos, luckily there are plenty of apps that have cottoned on to the format. This is Triller, which I think it's fair to say has taken a bit of inspiration from TikTok. You can record clips with special effects and share them onto an endless scrolling feed of content. Triller seems to have done quite well out of all this uncertainty. At the start of August. it topped the App Store charts on both iOS and Android, and it's managed to attract some big name TikTok stars and celebrities over onto its platform, including Mike Tyson and the magician Dynamo. Another app offering a similar experience is Byte, which has also been popping in and out of the App Store top download charts. Like TikTok, it offers you creative effects for your videos, although it is trailing behind Triller. It's been downloaded more than had more than ten million. a million times on Google Play, whereas Triller's TikTok's biggest competition may come from Instagram Reels, Instagram's newly launched rival. It has incorporated many of TikTok's core features, including that endlessly scrolling feed of short videos. Just in the past few weeks, Mark Zuckerberg has appeared at a Congressional hearing about big tech companies using their power to neutralise the competition. Isn't ripping off TikTok essentially doing that? There is innovation everywhere and people are constantly inspired by what they see. It's no longer a surprise to see a feed in a mobile social product. That wasn't necessarily the case until Facebook brought that to scale. We brought stories to Instagram in 2016 and give full credit to Snap for inventing that format, but then evolved it from there. So what is Instagram bringing to the table with this format that makes it different to TikTok? I think the ability to be discovered is unique to Reels. I think on Instagram, historically, if you had a large follower base, it was easy to kind of get bigger. This is now a product specifically designed to help creators find an audience. Now, to be fair to TikTok, I think the idea that you never know what video is going to go viral or who gets discovered is exactly what draws creators to TikTok - it's certainly not unique to Instagram Reels - but I think companies are seeing that TikTok has refined a winning formula and they want a piece of the action. And that's it for this week. Next week, we're going to be looking at another hugely important topic - the technology being used to fight climate change. Until then, you can keep up with us on social media, on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, @bbcclick.

Run those numbers, you test 1000 people, one of them has got the virus. And then 100 of them have, are wrongly flagged as having the virus, because you have a 10% false positive rate. So then you have 100 times as many people being given false positives as given a true positive. </p><p>So that sounds like a total disaster, it sounds like you couldn't possibly use that information. But think about it in another way - before you gave everyone the test, you would have thought 1 in 1000 people has the virus, but now you are able to zoom in on a subset of those people, 100 people, and now you know one out of 100 people has the virus. So the other 900 people are probably fine. But if the alternative is to lock down everybody, to tell everybody they have to stay home and tell everyone they can't go to school or a restaurant, maybe the imperfect test could be better. We just have to use the information in the right way. So your latest book, How to Make the World Add Up, was just being finished, I think, as we were going into lockdown. And I wonder whether you looked at what the virus was doing around the world, and whether that taught you anything about statistics? Well I am sad to say it underlined the point I was trying to make in the book, which was that while we tend to think of statistics as a kind of political weapon, that you know, people lie with statistics and they try to win arguments with statistics, actually statistics are a way of seeing the world around us, seeing things we can't see any other way. So they are a bit like you need radar to spot incoming bombers, we need statistics to spot the incoming virus. So I am trying to get people to take the numbers seriously as a way of seeing what is true. Hello, and welcome to the Week in Tech. This week, Apple announced the launch of a new workout subscription programme called Fitness+. It forms part of a bundle of services including News and Arcade, now branded as Apple One. Facebook unveiled a new version of its Oculus Quest VR headset with more power and higher resolution. The new device also comes with a significant price drop. The entry-level version will be #100 deeper than its predecessor. And Sony confirmed the price of the forthcoming PlayStation 5, matching the $500 price of its rival the Xbox One Series X. Google says it has gone beyond being carbon neutral, and has now compensated for all of the carbon it has ever produced. It comes as a range of big tech firms have committed to reducing or eliminating their carbon footprint. British-based chip designer Arm is being sold to the American graphics chip specialist Nvidia. Nvidia said the deal, worth $40 billion, will create the premier computing company for the age of artificial intelligence. And finally, is there life on...Venus? Scientists have discovered what they say could be potential signs of life floating in the clouds of the planet. A new scientific paper reveals the discovery of gas called phosphine, typically associated with living organisms. The future really is in the cloud. This isn't fog, it's smoke. California is a state reeling from wildfires. Flying into San Francisco this week from London, you could barely see the city. My name is James Clayton, and I am the new BBC and Click San Francisco technology reporter. And I have landed at a pretty weird time. I've been to San Francisco a few times before, but this was San Francisco only different. Mandatory masks everywhere, the airport almost completely empty. The streets quieter, much more so than London. I've come during a monster week for tech though. Many of the stories based on theme that are likely to dominate tech journalism in the years to come. On Monday, Oracle agreed a deal with TikTok to oversee its US operations, after Mr Trump said it would ban the company if it couldn't find a US suitor. I'll be doing more on how tech is being dragged into a geopolitical battle between China and the US. It was also a week that Twitter launched its election hub, to promote accurate information and resources for voters. How companies like Google and Twitter and Facebook regulate their platforms in the run-up to the elections are likely to have a massive impact on that November poll, and it is something that Click will be doing more on. It also happened to be a week when Mr Trump visited California, sparking controversy by refusing</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-cee0f9bced9f4d2d9a11ed474fd49a73</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60WC-CBS1-DY08-32VM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"798\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

It also happened to be a week when Mr Trump visited California, sparking controversy by refusing to acknowledge climate change's impact on the environment. Going forward, could big tech do more by not just being green companies themselves but by leading the way in innovation, perhaps even reversing some of the damage humans have done to our planet? At Apple's launch on Tuesday, the company didn't release an iPhone or ARM-based MacBooks but they did talk about its new healthcare products, including a new Apple Watch that can measure oxygen levels in the blood. </p><p>How the world of tech responds to Covid-19 in the coming years is likely to be crucial in our battle against the virus. And finally this week, Google was grilled by senators asking questions about anti-trust, or in other words, are companies like Google monopolistic? Whether massive tech companies like Facebook, Apple, and Amazon are simply too big and whether they should be broken up, remains a central challenge to governments around the world. The tech stories we have seen this week perhaps underpins the fundamental question of our age - how can we harness the progress humanity has made for good and not bad? That was James Clayton who, as he says, is our new man in San Francisco. And he's online now. James, not even off the plane and we ask you to start filming. Well done, what a time to move to San Francisco though. It's a really strange time for two reasons. Obviously, you've seen those kind of horrendous pictures of California under this huge blanket of smoke. And it's not just California but pretty much the whole of western America. It is Oregon, Washington, then of course you have Covid-19. Covid-19 has affected the US very badly and California is no exception. And it's really noticeable. How do you feel about being there? If you look at all of the conferences coming up, literally all of them are virtual. So the chances of me actually being able to get there and actually review products in the same way as my predecessor did, well, it's going to be quite unlikely for now. I know that different people feel differently about climate change within the US and the big tech giants have certainly committed to trying to go carbon neutral or I think, Google now says it is carbon neutral. Do you think the arrival of forest fires at the doors of these companies will change any of their behaviours or focus any of their attention? I think the next stage is, are they going to really invest in the kind of innovation that the world might actually need to try and reverse some of this climate change? At the moment, Microsoft have committed a lot of money to that, so have Amazon and Apple too, but it's really only been the last year that has happened. What else are you looking forward to covering? The big tech story of the next few weeks is going to be about social media with the US elections. You're already seeing all sorts of disinformation and all sorts of challenges and problems that companies like Facebook and Twitter and Google, who owns YouTube, are having to make when trying to regulate what should and shouldn't be on it. We're really looking forward to hearing more about it from you over the coming weeks. James, thank you very much and stay there. You know, all of these launch events that we have been talking about and indeed the run-up to the US election, they are all like theatre really, aren't they? And that links perfectly to the next bit of the program. Yes, theatre has had a particularly tough time of it since March and until actors can tread the boards again, technology is seeing whether it can fill the void. But can it really provide the excitement of a live performance? Marc Cieslak has disappeared down a rabbit hole to find out. We're late, we're late for a very important theatrical date. However, in order to follow Alice down the rabbit hole for an adventure in Wonderland, all we have to do is log in to a video chat call. Are you all ok? Alice, A Virtual Theme Park is actually an immersive theatre show, which due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the audience experiences from the comfort of their homes via the video chat platform Zoom. It's the result of a collaboration between theatre companies, Creation, Big Telly, and Fox dog,</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-31dfe08c97a74f659036859d4299213d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60W5-J4N1-DY08-32PF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"798\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

Going forward, could big tech do more by not just being green companies themselves, but by leading the way in innovation, perhaps even reversing some of the damage that humans have done to our planet? At Apple's launch on Tuesday, the company didn't release an iPhone or ARM-based MacBooks But it did centre its new iteration of products around healthcare, including a new Apple Watch that can measure oxygen levels in the blood. How the world of tech responds to Covid-19 in the coming years is likely to be crucial in our battle against the virus. </p><p>And finally this week, Google was grilled by senators asking questions about anti-trust. Or, in other words, are companies like Google monopolistic? Whether massive tech companies like Facebook, Apple, and Amazon are simply too big and whether they should be broken up, remains a central challenge to governments around the world. The tech stories that we have seen this week perhaps underpin the fundamental question of our age - how can we harness the progress that humanity has made for good and not bad? That was James Clayton who, as he says, is our new man in San Francisco, and he's online now. James, not even off the plane and we ask you to start filming. Well done! What a time to move to San Francisco though! It's a really strange time for two reasons. I mean, obviously, you've seen those kind of horrendous pictures of California under this huge blanket of smoke. And it's not just California, it's pretty much the whole of western America. It is Oregon, it's Washington. And then, of course, you have Covid-19. Covid-19 has affected the US very badly, and California is no exception, and it's really noticeable. How do you feel about being there? If you look at all of the conferences that are coming up, literally all of them are virtual. So the chances of me actually being able to get there and, you know, review products in the same way as my predecessor did, well, it's going to be quite unlikely for now. I know that different people feel differently about climate change within the US, and the big tech giants have certainly committed to trying to go carbon neutral - or I think Google now says it is carbon neutral. Do you think the arrival of forest fires at the doors of these companies will change any of their behaviours or focus any of their attention? I think the next stage is are they going to really invest in the kind of innovation that the world might actually need to try and reverse some of this climate change? And at the moment, Microsoft have committed a lot of money to that - so have Amazon, so have Apple too - but it's really only been the last year that has happened. What else are you looking forward to covering? Well, the big tech story of the next 5-6 weeks is going to be about social media with the US elections. You're already seeing all sorts of disinformation and all sorts of challenges and problems that companies like Facebook and Twitter and Google, who owns YouTube, are having to make, you know, when trying to regulate what should and shouldn't be on it. Well, we're really looking forward to hearing more about it from you over the coming weeks. James, thank you very much and stay there! You know, all of these launch events that we have been talking about and, indeed, the run-up to the US election, they are all like theatre really, aren't they? And that links perfectly to the next bit of the program. Yes, theatre has had a particularly tough time of it since March, and until actors can tread the boards again, technology is seeing whether it can fill the void. But can it really provide the excitement of a live performance? Marc Cieslak has disappeared down the rabbit hole to find out. We're late, we're late for a very important theatrical date. However, in order to follow Alice down the rabbit hole for an adventure in Wonderland, all we have to do is log in to a video chat call. Are you all OK? Alice, A Virtual Theme Park is actually an immersive theatre show which, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the audience experiences from the comfort of their homes via the video chat platform Zoom. It's the result of a collaboration between theatre companies Creation, Big Telly and Fox dog, partnering with tech outfit Charisma AI. We have built an animated version of the Cheshire Cat that the audience talk to. You are now ready to go further into Wonderland. And before the show, they can chat to it, flirt to it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-8e180e6e83cd4c7e92060dbaec010076</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60WC-CBS1-DY08-32XJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"800\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.
