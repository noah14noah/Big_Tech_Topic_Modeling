Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who is leading the investigation, told the Daily Caller News Foundation that the goal of the investigation is to 'have an open, fair and free market.' Google responded to the investigation saying, 'We look forward to showing how we are investing in innovation, providing services that people want, and engaging in robust and fair competition.' Attorneys general from 48 states, Puerto Rico and D.C. on Monday announced a bipartisan antitrust probe into Google and its potential to stifle market competition. </p><p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who is leading the investigation, joined a dozen other attorneys general at the U.S. Supreme Court for a Monday press conference, describing concerns that Google holds too much power over the online advertising market. 'It's really compelling that you have the interest of virtually the entire nation coming from different perspectives with their own different concerns about consumers. It's creating international interest,' Paxton explained to the Daily Caller News Foundation.(Article Continues Below Advertisement) WATCH:AGs TAKE ON TECH: Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, along with other state attorneys general, is announcing a multi-state investigation into Big Tech companies. <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/LmE4ztzCS1\">https://t.co/LmE4ztzCS1</url>[1] \u2014 NowThis (@nowthisnews) September 9, 2019[2] 'Everybody thinks the internet is free, and it's not,' he explained. 'When you have one player so dominant in the search engine, advertising market it's like a real estate transaction.  the buyers, they're on the seller side, they're the auctioneer, and they control the video platform that a lot of people use.'(Article Continues Below Advertisement) Sponsored Content  Google responded to the probe in a Friday statement[3], saying, 'It's of course right that governments should have oversight to ensure that all successful companies, including ours, are complying with the law,' but, the investigation 'is not new' for the company. 'We have always worked constructively with regulators and we will continue to do so. We look forward to showing how we are investing in innovation, providing services that people want, and engaging in robust and fair competition,' the statement added. Paxton said Google is 'a very dominant force' in the tech market, which 'allows them to charge premium pricing,' adding that 'it appears they've bought their competition or forced them out by other means.' The goal of the Google investigation, he said, is to 'have an open, fair and free market. If that's what's going on with Google, then fine. But if they're acting in a way that disincentivizes competition and forces people out unfairly, that's a problem.' The probe came three days after New York Attorney General Letitia James announced[4] an antitrust investigation with eight other attorneys general from Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nebraska, North Carolina and Ohio into Facebook for similar monopoly concerns. James's investigation will look into 'Facebook's dominance in the industry and the potential anticompetitive conduct stemming from that dominance,' according to a statement[5] from her office. Paxton said he is interested in joining James's probe and applauded her for the effort. NetChoice President Carl Szabo, whotestified[6] in a July 16 congressional hearing titled 'Online Platforms and Market Power' and previously told[7] the DCNF that an investigation into Google or Facebook would be a 'tech witch hunt,' said he thinks Paxton 'appears to have an open mind about this investigation.' 'Some [attroneys general] already have a conclusion, and then they look for the facts afterward, and that sets a dangerous precedent for any law enforcement body,' he added. Szabo also said, however, that he thinks the investigation is unnecessary. 'What you're seeing is kind of a pile-on where there's no real disincentive for a state AG to put their name on the investigation. A lot of people can go out searching for things like El Dorado and invest their time into looking for something that just doesn't exist,' he said. 'If you take a mere three minutes to think about the arguments for an antitrust case against Facebook and Google, they just don't exist. There's robust competition, and direct competitors can all simultaneously be monopolies. The American public overwhelmingly believes that on the list of things the government should look into, big tech is not a priority,' he continued. Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) Center for Technology Associate Director and Innovation Jessica Melugin[8] similarly said in a statement[9], 'These state attorneys general are expanding the power of their office and stretching the limits of what constitutes an antitrust violation. This sort of high-profile activism may benefit state AGs' political ambitions, but impose harmful costs on consumers, businesses, and the economy.' 'The only consistency among the various state, federal agency, and congressional antitrust investigations into big tech seems to be that none of them have much to do with the well-established test for antitrust law in the U.S.; consumer harm,' Melugin added. Paxton conversely made the point that the attorneys general he is working with to look into Google are simply 'in discovery mode,' adding, 'We want to understand what the issues are if there are any before we say what we think the remedy should be.' He said that if there really is no case for antitrust, then those who believe the investigation is unnecessary 'have nothing to worry about.' 'This is an investigation,' he told the DCNF. 'Hopefully  legitimately cooperative with this. Best case is, they're not acting in anti-competitive ways, and there is an opportunity for competitors to offer consumers the same products, and it will all be good.' U.S. Attorney General William Barr also announced a Justice Department probe[10] into Google and its potential to unlawfully stifle market competition in June, making it the first such investigation since the Federal Trade Commission closed[11] its longest-running probe into Google in 2013 without any penalties against the company.Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is availablewithout charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The Dems, the left wing national media, the deep state, all aided and abetted by RINO Senators have escalated. They're all out assault on the President of the United States. The Republicans in name only haven't the guts to stand with or support President Trump. Instead they cower before the powerful establishment interest who mean to destroy the Trump presidency no matter all that he has achieved, no matter all that he has done for America and Americans. This historic President has been investigated by the special counsel and the FBI for 22 months in a row. And not so much as an iota of evidence has been produced against him. And make no mistake whatsoever.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The globalist elites, the entrenched establishment are now desperate and making no pretense of adhering to law or standards of decency. Senators Mitch McConnell, John Cornyn, Chuck Grassley, Thom Tillis, among the RINOs working against President Trump, not for him, not for the Republican Party but for their money masters on K Street seeking to protect Special Counsel Robert Mueller and preserve at all costs his failed and now desperate investigation. Congressman Ron DeSantis has been pushing for Mueller's firing since last summer. He joins us here in just moments.</p><p>And also tonight, Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, those states announcing they're sending a combined 1600 National Guard troops to the border. California, the only border state prioritizing the rights of illegal immigrants ahead of the interest and rights of the the American citizens. We'll have a full report for you from the border.</p><p>And stocks today soaring. I said soaring. China's President offering the United States new trade concessions. China's Xi vowing to lower Chinese tariffs against American and Western products to cut Chinese tariffs on vehicles to allow more foreign competition and better protect foreign intellectual property. Worthy of note, many in the business press haven't apologized yet for sensationalizing the higher Trump tariffs that made all of this possible and they have certainly not acknowledged President Trump's success in moving talks with President Xi forward because of Presidents Trump and Xi, there is now at hand a real opportunity for balanced reciprocal trade between the United States and China and the world. We take up all of that here tonight.</p><p>Our top story, Special Counsel Robert Mueller, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein making a mockery of the judicial system. And President Trump today firing back at the unprecedented FBI raid on the New York office and residence of his personal attorney, Michael Cohen. The President tweeted this, attorney-client privilege is dead and a total witch-hunt. The New York Times today reported deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein personally approved the FBI raid and Federal prosecutors in Manhattan obtained a search warrant after receiving a referral in part from Special Counsel Robert Mueller. This is the same Rod Rosenstein who believes he can oversee the obstruction of justice investigation into the firing of former FBI Director James Comey even though it was Rosenstein who wrote the memorandum recommending that President Trump fire Comey, the same Rosenstein who signed off on FISA Court warrants that resulted in the Obama administration spying on the Trump presidential campaign.</p><p>The same Rosenstein who set the scope for Mueller's special counsel probe in May of last year. The Cohen raid is a clear sign of Mueller's desperation after he's failed to find any evidence of collusion, his original mandate as special counsel. The corrupt leadership of the Justice Department obviously believes Mueller's investigation must now be unfettered. RINO Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley doesn't criticize, he doesn't call for constraint by the special counsel, instead this is what Chairman Grassley, who's been in the Swamp for almost 40 years, said today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHUCK GRASSLEY (R-IA), CHAIRMAN, SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: I have confidence in Mueller, the President ought to have confidence in Mueller and I think to answer your question, it would be suicide for the President to want to talk about firing Mueller.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: Our first guest tonight, outraged over the FBI's stunning double standard, the special counsel targeting Cohen while Hillary Clinton's blatant violations of campaign finance laws are ignored all together by both the FBI and the Justice Department. He also says contempt proceedings need to occur now in the wake of the DOJ and FBI's failure to comply with Congress' constitutional right to oversight. Joining us tonight, Congressman Ron Desantis, member of several key committees, that include Oversight and Government Reform, Foreign Affairs and Judiciary. He is also the leading Republican candidate to be governor of the great State of Florida. Great to have you with us, Congressman.</p><p>Let's start - let's start with first of all, Grassley. He's been sitting in Washington in the Senate approaching four decades. And he has confidence in Mueller. Are you kidding me? What in the world is this man thinking?</p><p>REP. RON DESANTIS (R), FLORIDA: Lou, I think about how they handled say Cheryl Mills who was Hillary Clinton's attorney. They had her sitting in, you know, on the -- on the interview. They weren't raiding Cheryl Mills' office even though Cheryl Mills, you know, there were some issues with Cheryl Mills. And in this instance, to go to this extreme length for what's the underlying offense? They say a campaign finance violation? What about the Clinton campaign? They did millions and millions of dollars to the Perkins Coie Law Firm who then paid Fusion GPS. So that when they filed their FEC compliance reports, there was no trace of Fusion GPS or the dossier or any of that. So they camouflaged those payments. You're not supposed to do that.</p><p>Has Fusion GPS been raided? Has Perkins Coie been raided? And so the double standard here is really, really troubling Lou and it just seems that ever since the special counsel was appointed it was try to figure out whatever we can find any way and just throw it against the wall and hope it sticks. That's not the way you want law enforcement to go.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, law enforcement, I don't even know if there is such a thing left within the FBI or the Department of Justice. It is a -- the special counsel investigation is a political persecution, it's no longer an investigation. This is a joke. The people leading it are a joke. We're talking about 13 of 17 attorneys who are Democrats and I'm talking about -- I'm talking about ideologically left wing Democrats. These are not just passing Kiwanis Luncheon. These folks are committed. And this tells us all we need to know.</p><p>Why isn't there some standard either by the Department of Justice or at least by the leadership of the House and the Congress as to who can be involved in this investigation? There's just no question. This is corruption at its worst.</p><p>DESANTIS: We've raised that in the Congress, a handful of us has. Not the whole leadership, but you look at somebody like an Andrew Weissmann, not only is he a big Democrat, not only is he have a checkered reputation, but he was in Hillary Clinton's election party in 2016. He's reported to have made derogatory comments about President Trump before the special counsel investigation started. Why would you put somebody like him on this because when you're doing these things, the American public needs to have confidence and then here's the problem with all of this, Lou.</p><p>At this point, you have half of the country, the people that voted for Donald Trump, they're not going to have confidence in any type of negative outcome in this thing. That confidence is shot. And so I just think that this is doing a lot of damage to the country at this point.</p><p>DOBBS: It's doing a lot of damage to the country. It could be -- that damage though could be very specific and much broader based than half the country. We are dealing in some -- we have a President who is contending with so many perils from so many directions in foreign policy. It's extraordinary that the -- frankly Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell are nothing more than the stooges of K Street, the Chamber of Commerce, the business round table, and the establishment of this country. And they are behaving abominably.</p><p>DESANTIS: Well, what we're trying to do now this week, I mean, you mentioned it in your lead in, there are all of these documents we asked for for a long time, including just the two-page document that kicked off the so-called collusion investigation. Nnunes has been asking for that for months and months. And so here's the thing. Ei8ther they turned it over or we immediately have to move the hold these people in contempt, Lou. We can't just keep playing this game back and forth, running out the clock. The American people are entitled to this. We're entitled to this in the Congress and if we're not willing to put our constitutional muscle behind this request, they were going to continue to be treated like a lackluster institution that too often we are.</p><p>DOBBS: Tomorrow is that deadline, April 11th. That was extended by both committees. I mean, what are the odds that the deadline will be met and what are the odds that you can muster enough courage, enough principle, enough integrity and enough fire in the House of Representatives to actually move forward and hold officials of the corrupt Justice Department and FBI in contempt?</p><p>DESANTIS: So I'm not holding my breath that the -- that the deadline will be met and I don't think anyone should be holding their breath for that. And so I think it will be time to pull the trigger on contempt for these officials because they've stonewalled months and months and months. And think about the difference in behavior in terms of them responding when they're investigating their conduct in terms of the dossier and all of that. How slow they are. But then look how quick they are to go raid Michael Cohen's office when it suits them or how quick they are -- they're probing this donation, the Trump's charity from the Ukrainian businessman, it was 150,000. He gave millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation. They're not raiding the foundation, they're not -- they're not probing that. So, now is the time to act and we can't have them living under different rules than they're applying to the rest of the country.</p><p>DOBBS: It seems to me, congressman, that I have to tell you, we're listening to Mitch McConnell talk about the special counsel as if he wanted to have both arms around him, not just one, instead of stand with the President and demand a higher level of conduct of the special counsel. We don't even hear from Speaker Ryan. All of this could be shut down by the House of Representatives, could it not, if it simply said no more money will be appropriated for the special counsel. Why isn't there a level of integrity, a level of just outrage about the conduct of the Justice Department and the leadership of the Republican Party?</p><p>DESANTIS: There was an effort I think for members and I've actually tried to do it too to sunset the special counsel, put up or shut up. But with the omnibus bill, Lou, they packed it in and ran it through in like 12 hours. So there was no amendment, no opportunity for any rank and file member to participate. And so that was a deliberate choice to green light the funding for this thing going forward, at least until the end of the fiscal year. And I think -- I think that's a mistake. We could put constraints on it. If Rosenstein is not willing to do that, we could do it with the power of the purse.</p><p>DOBBS: Could have done it.</p><p>DESANTIS: Should have done it.</p><p>DOBBS: Amen. Congressman, thank you for your leadership there in Washington. Desperately needed. We appreciate everything you're doing. Thanks so much.</p><p>DESANTIS: Thanks, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Up next. Special Counsel Mueller now targeting a Ukrainian oligarch. Gregg Jarrett joins me here next. We take up the witch-hunt. Stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: Special Counsel Mueller is reportedly investigating now a $150,000 payment that a Ukrainian billionaire paid the Trump Foundation. But the real collusion that Mueller might be investigating would focus on the Clintons, the same oligarch is a long-time donor to the Clinton Foundation. He's given some $13 million to the Clinton Foundation since 2006. As far as we know, not even a mild hint of curiosity about those donations. Joining me now, Fox News Legal Analyst Greg Jarrett. You know, that becomes the theme here, doesn't it? There is a way in which President Trump is treated, there's a way in which Hillary Clinton is treated. There is a way in which President Trump is treated and there is another way that President Obama is treated without raising so much as the prospect of an investigation.</p><p>GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: If Donald Trump so much as sneezes, it's a crime. If Hillary Clinton sells out America's vital uranium assets and receives roughly at the same time about $140 million from Russia, that's, you know, oh, it's a wonderful foundation. It's a charity she runs and so forth. Ignoring the fact that her husband made $105 million while she was secretary of state, the majority of it coming from foreign governments that she was dealing with.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, speaking of Uranium One, part of that was an adjunct speaking fee for the former President Bill Clinton in Moscow --</p><p>JARRETT: Half a million bucks.</p><p>DOBBS: -- of a half a million dollars. No one seems interested in these elements. And this is such a obvious profound partisan driven investigation. I think this has risen to the level of a persecution. It's a political persecution and the Republican Party, the RINO leadership here, my god, Greg. I -- this is --</p><p>JARRETT: They should be outraged, but they aren't.</p><p>DOBBS: I mean, the American people are sitting here watching this and can't even believe it.</p><p>JARRETT: Well, you know, they're deaf, dumb and blind. I mean, that's the best description I have for McConnell and Paul Ryan.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, they're may be willfully so. The truth is they sold out. They've sold out a long time ago toying to establishment, to the K Street, to yes, the Chamber of Commerce, the business roundtable and they're the only masters that they recognize now.</p><p>JARRETT: The tragedy is what we saw unfold yesterday, going in and seizing the documents that are largely privileged of a lawyer, really to me is one of the most shameful episodes in American legal history. Yes, there's an exception. But what they did is they went in there and they just carted away just about everything. We're supposed to trust that a third person clean team or firewall is going to protect the attorney-client privilege. I -- trust me, I've been a lawyer for about 40 years now. It's not going to happen that way.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes. And there is no way that you ascribe a -- clean is the adjective of preference --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DOBBS: -- within the Justice Department. America, people think and understand what obviously the leadership of the Republican Party doesn't. What we have is a toxic corrupt Justice Department and an FBI whose leadership is rancid with political corruption.</p><p>JARRETT: And Mueller and Rosenstein, who are heading up this whole thing, the President was right when he said this is the most conflicted group of people he's ever seen. I mean, Mueller has not one but two disqualifying conflicts of interest and under the law it's mandatory that he recuse himself. Instead he stuck up his middle finger at the justice system. He didn't care. Rosenstein, he is a witness, he is a prosecutor, he is an investigator and basically judge and jury all rolled into one. And again - -</p><p>DOBBS: And should be under investigation himself for writing a letter that the President --</p><p>JARRETT: Right.</p><p>DOBBS: -- read and decided that he agreed with.</p><p>JARRETT: This is the definition of corruption. If you look up the word in the dictionary, should have photos of Mueller, Rosenstein and James Comey.</p><p>DOBBS: Maybe one of these days, you know, you've got to believe in the American way, that shall come to pass because without it the Republic is going to be deeply threatened beyond even where we are today. Tomorrow, the deadline to produce the 1.2 million documents to meet the deadline set by House Intelligence Committee Chair Devin Nunes. Talking earlier with Congressman DeSantis, he doesn't believe any of us should be holding our breath.</p><p>JARRETT: No.</p><p>DOBBS: And he believes we move straight to contempt if they do not make the deadline tomorrow.</p><p>JARRETT: In a fair and just world, contempt citations would be filed tomorrow. But it is probably not going to happen because Congress is slow- footed. Look at how long they waited. They issued these subpoenas in August, what is that, eight months ago?</p><p>DOBBS: Well, they were to produce the documents five months ago. That was when they first issued the order.</p><p>JARRETT: Right.</p><p>DOBBS: And now we're looking at an extension here from the first -- the original date was last week and now we're talking about tomorrow.</p><p>JARRETT: They should have moved for a contempt five months ago at the deadline. If you don't meet the -- if you don't meet the deadline, Lou, or I don't meet the deadline, we are held in contempt of court and they throw us in the (INAUDIBLE) within 24 hours.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, and I don't where they're going to throw the Republican Party or what's left of because when the American people watch this and there is no contempt of Congress filed against the Justice Department, the FBI leadership and they don't stand up for a President who is working harder than anyone in Washington.</p><p>JARRETT: Right.</p><p>DOBBS: There's going to be hell to pay.</p><p>JARRETT: Well, the approval rating of Congress hovers right around 11, 12 percent. And there's a good reason for that. They deserve it.</p><p>DOBBS: I suspect it's a little inflated. Greg, thanks so much. Gregg Jarrett.</p><p>JARRETT: All right.</p><p>DOBBS: Be sure to vote in our poll tonight. The question is, do you believe the Department of Justice and FBI will have to be completely purged before we can be returned to a nation of law and order?

None at all. The Dow up 429 points, the S&amp;P up 44, the NASDAQ 144 points. It's what we call a good day on Wall Street and a good day for America. Volume on the big board 3.6 billion.</p><p>President Trump's fair trade policies could have an enormous impact. Last quarter -- no one else is going to tell you this but we are going to make a point of telling you this. Last quarter the U.S. trade deficit cut 1.6 percentage points off economic growth, meaning that with better deals, that is with President Trump's balanced and reciprocal trade, we would have had a growth rate in the fourth quarter of just over four percent. It came in at 2.9 as a result of the deficit. U.S. producer prices rose more than expected in March.</p><p>We're pleased to tell you. Boosted by rising healthcare and food costs. I'm most especially pleased to tell you energy cost dropped by two percent. A reminder to listen to my reports three times a day Coast to Coast on the Salem Radio Network. Up next. Zuckerberg, it's something of an apology sip. We take up the need to regulate big tech. Ed Rollins joins me here next.</p><p>DOBBS: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifying before a joint Senate hearing today but he was not under oath. Irrespective of that, listen to some of the leading absurdities that Zuckerberg felt well, quite confident uttering, including the idea that Facebook should be able -- well, to police itself.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: As I've said a number of times today, I think we need to take a broader view of our responsibility around privacy than just what is mandated in the current law. I think the real question as the internet becomes more important in people's lives is what is the right regulation not whether there should be --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But you as a company welcome regulation?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: I think if it's the right regulation, then yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you think the Europeans have it right?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: I think that they get things right.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: Joining me now, former Reagan White House Political Director, Great America PAC Chairman, Fox Business political analyst, my friend Ed Rollins.</p><p>ED ROLLINS, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: And it is great to have you here. And what did you think of young Zuck contending with half of the power of the Senate?</p><p>ROLLINS: First of all, it's nice to see him in a suit. He's probably hasn't had a suit on since his first communion, he's catholic. Secondly, I think the idea that they're going to regulate themselves is absurd. They have taken all of this privacy information that people have given them, they never once said they could discloses that to the public or to consumers and they've done that and I think to a certain extent they've got -- I think the government has to regulate them. I think they have to basically control what they -- not how they make their profits but how they -- what they do with people's information.</p><p>LOU DOBBS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: Well what they're doing is they're trying to regulate the users rather than themselves. That's quite a different statement. And they have been decidedly anti-conservative and pro-liberal. And we watched The Daily Caller reporting, that quite a few people of from the Obama administration and from the Clinton administration have made their way to the top of the upper echelons of Facebook.</p><p>ROLLINS: They have and they clearly have used that material that's in there, that information to create their political organizations both Clinton's political organizations certain even more so the Obama administration. And you just have to basically people know what's going to happen, you want to submit data here then just understand they're going to sell it to somebody in. That's wrong.</p><p>DOBBS: The political issue is a profound one and that is, are we going to tax the Internet? Should transaction, should revenue be taxed on from the web at the same levels as in brick-and-mortar transactions?</p><p>ROLLINS: Well the bottom line if you make a profit you get taxed and no matter what you do and they should too. They should not be any different, they're an interstate worldwide consumer now not an inner state provider a consumer and I think they should be taxed.</p><p>DOBBS: But this is also Facebook and then Twitter --</p><p>ROLLINS: All of it.</p><p>DOBBS: -- other very powerful Amazon, are very powerful organizations and they're spending a lot of money lobbying to assure that they move forward with as few taxes as possible, which is fair and it's the American Way. But what is not fair is when something as powerful as Facebook has such an impact that it is deciding whose voices will be heard, in what order, in what priority not unlike Google and Alphabet. There needs to be an assurance of regulatory constraint against the mad partisan impulses that right now are ribboning a social media.</p><p>ROLLINS: Well, having done campaigns for 50 years they have changed the way we do campaigns in America. And so, you have to have -- you have to have a fairness to it. You can't let Democrats have the advantage or Republicans have the advantage. Whatever they're doing, whatever they're providing should be provided go both sides.</p><p>DOBBS: In the end, well, in fairness defined as equal access to the platform to government. (INAUDIBLE) then let it be decided. That this business about shutting down. Conservative voices is extraordinary.</p><p>The president has pulled off another extraordinary moment and that is President Xi announcing he will open China to Western products and services by cutting tariffs, reducing barriers and protecting foreign intellectual property rights as he does so.</p><p>ROLLINS: Well we've talked many, many nice about all the things that the president has done, and everybody sort of poopoo that he could do this when he promised he was going to do this in the course of the campaign. And I would argue that it's people on the other side now know he's a forceful leader and he's going to do it. When he says he's going to do something's going to do it. So, if you want to be on his good side then obviously if you're the head of China you want to be on his good side.</p><p>DOBBS: I have to say, I'm embarrassed for the business press, particularly the business press, the political press we stay embarrassed about, right? But the business press doesn't seem to understand basic economics and tonight we pointed out again, they're a trade deficit cuts into a nation's economic royalists. Reduces GDP squanders well. And when you think about that, that should be reported every month.</p><p>ROLLINS: Should be.</p><p>DOBBS: And I haven't seen a news organization report that element in that impact, that equation between a trade deficit and a reduced GDP growth rate.</p><p>ROLLINS: Well they don't even want to give them benefit of the doubt. They don't even want to basically hear his arguments, they want to dump all of the arguments before he's even able he talks about.</p><p>DOBBS: But these are craven, cowardly and I -- and frankly incompetent group of reporters. I'm talking about the political reporters that are accompanying this president. Some of them are terrific but I have to say at large, they're an embarrassment to the craft.</p><p>ROLLINS: But they're embarrassed by Trump. 90 percent of them like the Justice Department.</p><p>DOBBS: What the hell. What are they've got to be embarrassed about? What have they ever done?</p><p>ROLLINS: 90 percent of them and I've traveled with them and I've been around him for a long time or like the Justice Department lawyers 90 percent of them are Democrats or anti-Trump. So, anything Trump tries to do they're going to be against.</p><p>DOBBS: Well I'm sure that our friends in the press and there are so many of them. Will those liberals, those are mostly liberals are they?</p><p>ROLLINS: Mostly.</p><p>DOBBS: OK, well we want to extend the season's greetings to them nonetheless. Ed Rollins thank you so much.</p><p>ROLLINS: Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: Appreciate it. The nation's governors are mobilizing, responding to the president's call to protect our borders. One state conspicuously silent. You'll never guess which one, yes you will. We'll be right back.</p><p>DOBBS: The states of Texas, Arizona and New Mexico are answering president Trump's call to secure the border. FOX News National Correspondent William La Jeunesse in Phoenix tonight with our report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: A week after President Trump asked for 4,000 National Guardsmen to secure the border, three states answered the call. New Mexico, Texas and Arizona.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOVERNOR DOUG DUCEY (R), ARIZONA: I'm here to announce the deployment of the National Guard to the border.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: But other states like Oregon and Montana refused to offer their Guard to serve. While California Governor Jerry Brown says he's still reviewing the president's request. If he refused as the President does have the authority to nationalize the Guard. Typically used when troops are sent overseas or to national disasters.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. STEVE STIVERS (R) OHIO: The easiest thing to do would be to choose to put them on a title 10 status but you know, with almost half a million folks in the National Guard across the country the easier thing to do is to work with states who are willing to serve.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: But deployment doesn't necessarily mean a rival. National Guard officials say there's paperwork, processing, medical check-ups, where will they live, most important matching skills. The Border Patrol needs will determine where each Guardsman will be sent. That officials say takes time.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGADIER GENERAL JOHN HOEFERT, NATIONAL GUARD, ARIZONA: We're looking at a request for assistance up to about five to six hundred individual augmentees. Who will help us put badges back to the border that's the whole goal of this mission.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: In Santa Teresa New Mexico a primary corridor for drugs and human smuggling, the Border Patrol welcomes the help.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AARON HULL, SECTOR CHIEF, U.S. BORDER PATROL: They have a variety capabilities that we can use. Pickily things like aerial detection are important to us given the size of the border.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: The National Guard is sending drones and helicopters to track and apprehend immigrants. Larger Black Hawks can drop agents and remote canyons of capability the patrol has in short supply.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOEFERT: When you look at the engineering things that need to be done. The grubbing operations, clearing roads, all that. We're looking at how we package those capabilities together.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: Guardsmen will also monitor multiple video feeds that come in from cameras sensors and radar.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DUCEY: Do we stop the flow of illegal Drugs? Do we stop the flow of human trafficking? Can we stop the illegal migrants from coming over?</p><p>REP. JOE CROWLEY (D), NEW YORK: A very provocative move but at the same time it's not really solving the problem.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LA JEUNESSE: Now if history is any guide enforcement, one area tends to Bush illegal traffic to another, meaning could deterrence in Arizona and Texas redirect smugglers to the sanctuary of California? Posing the question. Will the president federalized troops in the Golden State over Governor Browns objection? Lou.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>DOBBS: William, thank you very much. William La Jeunesse. Up next that caravan of illegal immigrants in Mexico fowling to cross our Southern border. Congressman Paul Gosar of the Arizona joins us here next. We're coming right back.</p><p>DOBBS: Arizona's Supreme Court has ruled DACA recipients will no longer be able to receive in-state tuition rates at Arizona colleges. The high court decision affects more than 2,000 DACA recipients who were paying in-state rates. Organizers for that caravan of illegal immigrants apparently trying to cross our border saying some 200 still plan to seek -- to cross the border with Mexico as of right now. The illegal immigrants from Central America are in Mexico City. Joining us tonight, Congressman Paul Gosar, member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. And Congressman, it is great to see you. Your reaction to the Arizona Supreme Court ruling on in-state tuition for DACA recipients.</p><p>REP. PAUL GOSAR (R), ARIZONA: They got it right, Lou. It was unanimous against you know, the -- allowing the DACA recipients to getting in-state. They're not even in-state, they're out of state and they shouldn't be even getting that aspect because they're actually illegal in this country. So they got it right. But I'm sure it's not over. I'm sure this will be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p><p>DOBBS: And troops moving -- federal troops, the National Guard moving to the border with Mexico. We're looking at some numbers here and I'd like to share these with the audience. What we've seen happen is the surge in illegal immigration. In addition to that, the drugs, heroin, marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamines all raising, up 70 percent -- heroin is up 70 percent from a year ago, cocaine up almost 50 percent, methamphetamines up 25 percent and it still remains, the Mexican border separates us from a country that is also providing the majority of marijuana. Do you believe that this show of force that the President has ordered will be successful in stopping the drug smuggling?</p><p>GOSAR: I think this is a great start because there's something different this time and that is he's negotiating NAFTA at that current aspect. Wouldn't it be nice to say, listen, NAFTA goes away if you don't uphold our rule of law and start supporting us? You know, if you look back at history, Mexico hasn't been a good neighbor during World War I, even in the communist era of Cuba. So from that standpoint, maybe it's time to get tough on trade and that a little different though what's transpiring right now. I think having our military down on the border, our National Guard is going to actually help. We're not catching and releasing anymore so we've got to start following through. I think it's a great start.</p><p>DOBBS: By order of the President signing an executive order to end that. Well, let's hope that you're right, that things are going to move. This -- the latest maneuver by the Special Counsel and his agents in the FBI, raiding the President's personal attorney's home, his office, your real quick thoughts if we may.</p><p>GOSAR: This has nothing to do with Russia. This shows that this is totally out of bounds. It's time for Rod Rosenstein to go. It's time to impeach him and start putting the parameters back on what we actually asked for the special prosecutor. Rod Rosenstein has been an embarrassment in this aspect and it's time to go.</p><p>DOBBS: OK. And your conference and Republican Party has -- and your leadership, Speaker Ryan have the guts to actually do that?</p><p>GOSAR: Well, you know, we're going to call it into question because you know, at this point in time, you know, when you look at the sanctity of client-attorney relationships and the total violation here, this shows that Mueller has no intention of looking just at the Russia aspect which he was entitled to do. But now he wants to take away the Presidency because he doesn't agree that Trump should be the president. That's the whole mantra of this whole thing, Lou. And so it's time to start calling the cards into question and Congress has the oversight ability to do so.</p><p>DOBBS: All right. Well, we'll see. Congressman Gosar, good to have you with us as always.</p><p>GOSAR: Thanks, Lou. Always a pleasure.</p><p>DOBBS: China's President Xi and President Trump, well, they're having a meeting of the minds on trade, proving all of those Wall Street analysts and economics and did I mention the business press absolutely wrong? We'll take up the President's victory on trade. National Review Columnist and bestselling author Victor Davis Hanson joins us here next.</p><p>DOBBS: President Xi Jinping is opening up China to U.S. and western exports largely because President Trump took a strong stance on trade calling for balanced and reciprocal trade specifically between China and the United States, speaking at a business conference today in China. President Xi promised to cut auto tariffs, to improve intellectual property protections for foreign competitors. Joining us tonight, Hoover Institution Senior Fellow, bestselling author, and Author of the new book, The Second World Wars, How The First Global Conflict Was Fought And Won. It is great to have you back with us Victor. Great to see you. Let's start with first what appears to be a profound breakthrough in the trade discussions between China and the United States.</p><p>VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION: Well, I think it's part of a larger texture that the so-called establishment thinks that Trump is the aberration where in fact, the existing trade protocols we had with China were the aberrations. So this is a return to normality, at least a small step. China was demanding of American companies sort of what the Third Reich did in the 1930s with American companies that want to do business in Germany. That is mandatory technological transfers, usually for military purposes. But in a wider sense, whether you look at China or North Korea or the Iran deal, or the open borders with Mexico, what was going on was not a sustainable process and Trump he comes in as an outsider without military or prior political office and he looks at it in a different way and people get outraged. But he's brought -- he's brought more justice in 14 months in terms of trade with China than the previous three administrations.</p><p>DOBBS: Who actually did nothing but enable and cower before China and participate in the unprecedented transfer of wealth from this country to China and without perceptible benefit to the United States and anywhere.</p><p>HANSON: No. I think the premise that the more concessions that we gave China, we turn that magnanimity with reciprocal kindness whereas in fact, they have thought that it was a sign of weakness or that they are holding premise that would westernize them and they would be prosperous and they would join the family of nations and then democratize. It was flawed and they knew it was -- we were naive to believe it. And I think Trump doesn't believe it. He's cynical and he's right about that given human nature.</p><p>DOBBS: This President -- well, it's understandable that he would be cynical. He's assailed personally every day, attacked from every corner, even by members of his own party as he presses ahead. And he's accomplished more in the first not yet even 15 months of his presidency than his predecessors, most recent predecessors accomplished in any one of their terms and so it's striking. But at this point, the special counsel seems to have lost all direction is not following a moral compass nor a legal one. Your thoughts?</p><p>HANSON: Well, it's -- I hate to say this, but I think he's resembling Beria under Stalin that he said give the person and I'll find the crime. He starts with a premise that Donald Trump was a suspect, and whether it's collusion or obstruction of justice or now the Stormy Daniels matter, he's looking for a crime to fit the person. And each time he does this he erodes confidence in the quality and the quantity of the applicability of the law. So he wants to say that client-attorney relationship doesn't exist with Trump but it surely did with Cheryl Mills and Hillary Clinton when she sat in on FBI interviews and then said later that she could not be interviewed because she was Hillary Clinton's attorney. And the same thing with collusion. We know the Steele dossier was a prime example of collusion with the Russians. We know that if you're interested in obstruction of justice, the (INAUDIBLE) to go would have been the fraudulent circumstances under which those FISA requests were presented to FISA judges. And again and again, Mr. Mueller is ignoring a whole set of miscreants and that he's focusing on this obsession. He's sort of like Captain Ahab and the white whale. Trump is his whale and he can't let go.</p><p>DOBBS: Yes, I think there may be some greater purpose thought, here. It is -- he's got 13 of his 17 are Democrats and committed for most part, all of them committed ideologues. This looks like a continuation of the Obama administration's absolute assault on the Trump campaign to support Hillary Clinton. The insurance policy was the Russia collusion, contrivance and everybody knows it. And yet the Republican Party leadership hasn't got the guts to stand up and say, enough.</p><p>HANSON: Yes, well, I mean, it's even worse than that that there were attorneys on his team. Remember they were called the dream team, the A- team, all of these superlatives by the media but there were members of that team that are actually represented clients connected with Hillary Clinton's various scandal and that was not a conflict of interest. Four or five of them came from his own law firm, that was not a conflict, and they were mostly Democrats and many of them contributors. So if he wanted to project the appearance that he was not unbiased, he couldn't have done anything worse than what he did. It was almost as if he was attempting to show the nation that he was not going to be disinterested by the selections that he made.</p><p>DOBBS: There's -- no question that he is not concern about appearances at all. Let's -- we've got about a minute, Victor, your thoughts on the President's decision as he contemplates taking military action against Syria.</p><p>HANSON: Two quick things that -- he ran as a Jacksonian and he was going to be principled realismist to the doctrine so he's got to restore the terms that was lost under Obama and yet he cannot be a neo-conservative nation builder. He's in an ironic position that he wants to stop this if it exists, this use of chemical weapons. But the people who were going to be most suspect of intervening are the people who voted for him. And the people who will never vote for him are the people who egging him on to go in on a big way into Syria. So he's got to threat that needle politically and he's got to send a message to Putin. You cannot do this if he did it and yet we don't want another Afghanistan, so it's a tricky thing.</p><p>DOBBS: Victor Davis Hanson, good to see you. Thank you. Thanks for being with us tonight.

The Lone Star state's Republican attorney general says he rarely even uses the company's widely popular search engine, opting instead for rival services, because he has \"always been concerned about tracking.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But Paxton these days is more than a mere sideline skeptic: As one of the country's most powerful law-enforcement officials, he's forging ahead with a landmark investigation into Google's decades-long dominance of the web, armed with the help of 50 other attorneys general, a stable of savvy experts that includes Google's past foes, and a feeling that Washington for too long has turned a blind eye to some of Silicon Valley's most troubling practices.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For now, the investigation, which Paxton and his peers announced in September, focuses on online advertising, responding to complaints that Google puts consumers and competitors at a disadvantage by controlling the exchanges where ads are bought and some of the most popular websites where they're sold. It could result in tough punishments, Paxton signaled, if investigators determine Google broke the law.</p><p>\"We're prepared for whatever the right thing to do is for consumers,\" he said during an interview with The Washington Post in his office in the Texas capital. Whether it's standing down or forcing Google to sell off parts of itself, Paxton stressed: \"All of that's on the table based on what we learn.\"</p><p>The probe marks the first major U.S. antitrust action against Google in roughly a decade, after Texas joined other states and the federal government in scrutinizing the company's search engine in a competition probe that ended without major punishment for the tech giant.</p><p>Since then, Paxton said, Washington has failed to pursue key signs that Google and Silicon Valley are in violation of federal law. \"Antitrust seems like it hasn't been focused on for decades, through several administrations, not just Democrats but also Republicans,\" he said, later adding: \"I think this should have been looked at sooner than it is.\"</p><p>The result is a significant legal and political challenge on the horizon for Google and its executives. Bipartisan in nature, and born out of a belief that the tech industry has escaped government accountability for too long, Paxton and his team said nothing is off limits - words that threaten a broad review of Google's business in a way that could reshape not only the company but the rest of Silicon Valley.</p><p>\"If we end up learning things that lead us in other directions, we'll certainly bring those back to the states and talk about whether we expand into other areas,\" he said.</p><p>Google declined to comment.</p><p>Overseeing an office with nearly 800 lawyers, Paxton emerged this year as a convening force in the sort of antitrust probe that's long been sought by Democratic and Republican attorneys general alike. Eight states, including Arizona, Nebraska and North Carolina, are helping to steer the Google probe as part of an executive committee, but it's Texas that started the legal action by sending a legal demand with hundreds of questions to Google on behalf of the group.</p><p>It is not the only probe of the tech giant under way: Investigators at the Department of Justice in Washington also are homing in on Google and its lucrative ad empire, and they sent their own battery of questions to the company this summer. Members of Congress similarly have targeted Google and other tech giants as part of a sweeping review of federal antitrust laws. And European regulators continue to scrutinize Google and its search, ad and smartphone practices, having already slapped it with roughly $9 billion in antitrust fines over the past three years.</p><p>For state attorneys general in the U.S., the driving question comes down to dollars, Paxton said. Ads targeted to people's browsing behavior are Google's lifeblood, accounting for much of the company's roughly $117 billion in revenue last year, according to its financial statements. That puts Google in the pole position in the United States, where it takes in around 37 percent of all digital advertising revenue, according to eMarketer data from February. In search, Google captures even more -- 74 percent -- of the market, the firm computes.</p><p>Importantly, ads provide financial fuel for Google's popular, free services, such as search, email and mapping, as well as its more audacious gambits, including self-driving cars. Paxton acknowledged these products are widely liked around the world, even if he personally doesn't use all of them regularly. But the attorney general stressed Google's dominance of the ad industry still has stifled the Internet.</p><p>\"Consumers may feel really good about having free searches but the reality is nothing's free. And if there's no competition on the Internet for advertising, then consumers, unbeknownst to them, are paying much higher costs for products than they otherwise should,\" he said.</p><p>Google has sought to tell a different story about its business. Appearing on Capitol Hill in July, Adam Cohen, Google's director of economic policy, said that Internet advertising is cheaper and more effective than ever before. \"We have created new competition in many sectors, and new competitive pressures often lead to concerns from rivals,\" he said in testimony. \"We have consistently shown how our business is designed and operated to benefit our customers.\"</p><p>But Paxton said state investigators have heard from a torrent of competitors, particularly in the publishing industry, who say they cannot compete with Google's scale, meaning they lose out on revenue that might fund their content or services.</p><p>The vocal opponents include some of Google's long-time foes, such as News Corp., according to two Texas officials who requested anonymity to discuss private conversations in the probe. The Rupert Murdoch-backed empire previously has complained to antitrust regulators in Europe, Australia and elsewhere that Google's ad dominance results in fewer dollars for publishers, and News Corp. has gone as far as to call for the tech giant to be broken up at times.</p><p>A spokesman for News Corp., James Kennedy, declined to comment on the company's interactions with Texas. But, he added in a statement: \"Our position regarding Google's damaging anti-competitive behavior and existential threat to journalism has been made clear over the years.\"</p><p>In probing those allegations, Paxton and his attorney general allies have turned to one of News Corp.'s past advisers. Among the experts the state has retained is Cristina Caffarra, who has assisted News Corp. and other Google foes on antitrust issues. A competition expert and economist at the consulting firm Charles River Associates, Caffarra boasts deep experience in Brussels, where Google has been repeatedly fined for competition violations. In those cases, including a recent decision finding Google's Android smartphone violated regional competition laws. Caffarra has supplied considerable economic evidence in opposition to Google's practices.</p><p>Caffarra also has worked on behalf of other Google foes, including the Russian search engine Yandex on its complaint in Moscow and the EU about Google's business practices, she's indicated in public reports. She declined to comment on her role in the states' probe, other than to say that she is not working for a corporate client that's opposing Google presently. But her participation in the states' effort took center stage in September, when she appeared alongside more than a dozen attorneys general when they announced their plans from the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court.</p><p>For Google, the states' probe could easily broaden beyond its ad business and its effects on publishers. Democratic and Republican attorneys general long have criticized the company for the way it collects users' data and displays its search results, for example, along with the means by which it has piloted Android to become the world's most widely used smartphone operating system. Some state officials raised these issues when they announced their ads probe in September.</p><p>Paxton's office has additional concerns of its own: Texas is in the early stages of a consumer-protection investigation focused on allegations that Google makes decisions about the content it displays and suppresses that are biased against conservatives. Jeff Mateer, Paxton's first assistant attorney general, confirmed the state's interest last week, four months after he aired his concerns at a conference in Omaha that big tech should be \"held accountable\" if the industry misrepresents its political neutrality. Google has denied charges that it is politically biased.</p><p>Texas long has long been troubled by Google's behavior. Roughly nine years ago, it became one of the first to embark on an antitrust investigation of Google when it opened a probe into the way the company presents search results. It was Paxton's predecessor, Greg Abbott, now the state's governor, who sought to determine if Google demoted competing services, such as shopping-comparison sites, that rivaled its own offerings, violating a principle that Texas called \"search neutrality.\"</p><p>Texas issued some of the initial orders demanding key documents from Google, at one point going to court to battle the company over access to information. The answers the state obtained ultimately appeared to influence some of the thinking at the Federal Trade Commission, which assumed the role of Google's chief investigator in the United States. An inadvertently released staff report from that probe, which ended in 2013, cited emails, memos and other materials obtained by Texas in concluding Google had in fact put its rivals at a disadvantage.</p><p>In the end, though, the FTC opted against issuing steep penalties targeting the company's search practices, sparking widespread criticism that the federal government had failed to capitalize on the evidence trove that Texas helped amass.</p><p>Gary Reback, a lawyer at the firm Carr &amp; Ferrell and a longtime Google foe, said the documents at the time showed that Google had \"jimmied their normal algorithm to demote certain sites.\" It's hard to \"generalize\" from one investigation to another, he cautioned, \"but what we do know is the Texas attorney general can be effective in getting the kind of information that might lead to government action.\"</p><p>But the timing of the states' latest investigation - and the optics of their announcement - still triggered criticism that the attorneys general hoped to leverage their work for political gain. The Competitive Enterprise Institute, a advocacy group that opposes antitrust law and has received contributions from Google, blasted the probe in September as an exercise that would \"benefit state AGs' political ambitions, but impose harmful costs on consumers, businesses, and the economy.\"</p><p>Paxton, in particular, has issued at least two emails to supporters through his campaign, including an Oct. 2 note that said he needed $25 or more to \"fight Google's dominance over so much of our lives,\" including the effects it has on publishers.</p><p>As such scrutiny intensifies, Paxton and his team cautioned they're at the beginning, not the end, of an investigation. With Google, in particular, \"a lot of people just didn't understand the model\" until recently, he said. \"The way it's been done, it's been hard to get a grip on what's going on behind the scenes.\"</p><p>While he said that the broad, national participation reflects the seriousness of states' concerns, Paxton stressed they hadn't reached \"any kind of conclusion, there's so much we don't know.\"</p><p>\"Whatever that leads to,\" he added, \"it leads to.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-784303d4a58e43528fb5a106565ca0da</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X76-TX51-JB4M-V17K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1932\"/><timeReceived>1:55 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 8, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The Lone Star State's Republican attorney general says he rarely even uses the company's widely popular search engine, opting instead for rival services, because he has 'always been concerned about tracking.' But Paxton these days is more than a mere sideline skeptic: As one of the country's most powerful law-enforcement officials, he's forging ahead with a landmark investigation into Google's decades-long dominance of the web, armed with the help of 50 other attorneys general, a stable of savvy experts that includes Google's past foes, and a feeling that Washington for too long has turned a blind eye to some of Silicon Valley's most troubling practices. For now, the investigation, which Paxton and his peers announced in September[1], focuses on online advertising, responding to complaints that Google puts consumers and competitors at a disadvantage by controlling the exchanges where ads are bought and some of the most popular websites where they're sold. </p><p>It could result in tough punishments, Paxton signaled, if investigators determine Google broke the law. 'We're prepared for whatever the right thing to do is for consumers,' he said during an interview with The Washington Post in his office in the Texas capital. Whether it's standing down or forcing Google to sell off parts of itself, Paxton stressed: 'All of that's on the table based on what we learn.' The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one[2].The probe marks the first major U.S. antitrust action against Google in roughly a decade, after Texas joined other states and the federal government in scrutinizing the company's search engine in a competition probe that ended without major punishment for the tech giant. Since then, Paxton said, Washington has failed to pursue key signs that Google and Silicon Valley are in violation of federal law. 'Antitrust seems like it hasn't been focused on for decades, through several administrations, not just Democrats but also Republicans,' he said, later adding: 'I think this should have been looked at sooner than it is.' The result is a significant legal and political challenge on the horizon for Google and its executives. Bipartisan in nature, and born out of a belief that the tech industry has escaped government accountability for too long, Paxton and his team said nothing is off limits \u2014 words that threaten a broad review of Google's business in a way that could reshape not only the company but the rest of Silicon Valley. 'If we end up learning things that lead us in other directions, we'll certainly bring those back to the states and talk about whether we expand into other areas,' he said.Google declined to comment. Overseeing an office with nearly 800 lawyers, Paxton emerged this year as a convening force in the sort of antitrust probe that's long been sought by Democratic and Republican attorneys general alike[3]. Eight states, including Arizona, Nebraska and North Carolina, are helping to steer the Google probe as part of an executive committee, but it's Texas that started the legal action by sending a legal demand with hundreds of questions to Google on behalf of the group. It is not the only probe of the tech giant under way: Investigators at the Department of Justice[4] in Washington also are homing in on Google and its lucrative ad empire, and they sent their own battery of questions[5] to the company this summer. Members of Congress similarly have targeted Google and other tech giants as part of a sweeping review of federal antitrust laws[6]. And European regulators continue to scrutinize Google and its search, ad and smartphone practices, having already slapped it [7]with roughly $9 billion in antitrust fines over the past three years. For state attorneys general in the U.S., the driving question comes down to dollars, Paxton said. Ads targeted to people's browsing behavior are Google's lifeblood, accounting for much of the company's roughly $117 billion in revenue last year, according to its financial statements. That puts Google in the pole position in the United States, where it takes in around 37 percent of all digital advertising revenue, according to eMarketer data from February. In search, Google captures even more -- 74 percent -- of the market, the firm computes. The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one[8].Importantly, ads provide financial fuel for Google's popular, free services, such as search, email and mapping, as well as its more audacious gambits, including self-driving cars. Paxton acknowledged these products are widely liked around the world, even if he personally doesn't use all of them regularly. But the attorney general stressed Google's dominance of the ad industry still has stifled the Internet. \"Consumers may feel really good about having free searches but the reality is nothing's free. And if there's no competition on the Internet for advertising, then consumers, unbeknownst to them, are paying much higher costs for products than they otherwise should,' he said. Google has sought to tell a different story about its business. Appearing on Capitol Hill in July, Adam Cohen, Google's director of economic policy, said that Internet advertising is cheaper and more effective than ever before. 'We have created new competition in many sectors, and new competitive pressures often lead to concerns from rivals,' he said in testimony[9]. 'We have consistently shown how our business is designed and operated to benefit our customers.' But Paxton said state investigators have heard from a torrent of competitors, particularly in the publishing industry, who say they cannot compete with Google's scale, meaning they lose out on revenue that might fund their content or services. The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one[10].The vocal opponents include some of Google's long-time foes, such as News Corp., according to two Texas officials who requested anonymity to discuss private conversations in the probe. The Rupert Murdoch-backed empire previously has complained to antitrust regulators in Europe, Australia and elsewhere that Google's ad dominance results in fewer dollars for publishers, and News Corp. has gone as far as to call for the tech giant to be broken up at times. A spokesman for News Corp., James Kennedy, declined to comment on the company's interactions with Texas. But, he added in a statement: 'Our position regarding Google's damaging anti-competitive behavior and existential threat to journalism has been made clear over the years.' In probing those allegations, Paxton and his attorney general allies have turned to one of News Corp.'s past advisers. Among the experts the state has retained is Cristina Caffarra, who has assisted News Corp. and other Google foes on antitrust issues. A competition expert and economist at the consulting firm Charles River Associates, Caffarra boasts deep experience in Brussels, where Google has been repeatedly fined for competition violations. In those cases, including a recent decision finding Google's Android smartphone violated regional competition laws. Caffarra has supplied considerable economic evidence in opposition to Google's practices. Caffarra also has worked on behalf of other Google foes, including the Russian search engine Yandex on its complaint in Moscow and the EU about Google's business practices, she's indicated in public reports. She declined to comment on her role in the states' probe, other than to say that she is not working for a corporate client that's opposing Google presently. But her participation in the states' effort took center stage in September, when she appeared alongside more than a dozen attorneys general when they announced their plans from the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court. The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one[11].For Google, the states' probe could easily broaden beyond its ad business and its effects on publishers. Democratic and Republican attorneys general long have criticized the company for the way it collects users' data[12] and displays its search results, for example, along with the means by which it has piloted Android to become the world's most widely used smartphone operating system. Some state officials raised these issues when they announced their ads probe in September[13]. Paxton's office has additional concerns of its own: Texas is in the early stages of a consumer-protection investigation focused on allegations that Google makes decisions about the content it displays and suppresses that are biased against conservatives. Jeff Mateer, Paxton's first assistant attorney general, confirmed the state's interest last week, four months after he aired his concerns at a conference in Omaha that big tech should be 'held accountable'[14] if the industry misrepresents its political neutrality. Google has denied charges that it is politically biased. Texas long has long been troubled by Google's behavior. Roughly nine years ago[15], it became one of the first to embark on an antitrust investigation of Google when it opened a probe into the way the company presents search results. It was Paxton's predecessor, Greg Abbott, now the state's governor, who sought to determine if Google demoted competing services, such as shopping-comparison sites, that rivaled its own offerings, violating a principle that Texas called 'search neutrality.' Texas issued some of the initial orders demanding key documents from Google, at one point going to court to battle the company over access to information. The answers the state obtained ultimately appeared to influence some of the thinking at the Federal Trade Commission, which assumed the role of Google's chief investigator in the United States. An inadvertently released staff report[16] from that probe, which ended in 2013, cited emails, memos and other materials obtained by Texas in concluding Google had in fact put its rivals at a disadvantage. The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one[17].In the end, though, the FTC opted against issuing steep penalties targeting the company's search practices, sparking widespread criticism that the federal government had failed to capitalize on the evidence trove that Texas helped amass. Gary Reback, a lawyer at the firm Carr ...rrell and a longtime Google foe, said the documents at the time showed that Google had 'jimmied their normal algorithm to demote certain sites.\" It's hard to 'generalize' from one investigation to another, he cautioned, 'but what we do know is the Texas attorney general can be effective in getting the kind of information that might lead to government action.' But the timing of the states' latest investigation \u2014 and the optics of their announcement \u2014 still triggered criticism that the attorneys general hoped to leverage their work for political gain. The Competitive Enterprise Institute, a advocacy group that opposes antitrust law[18] and has received contributions from Google[19], blasted the probe in September as an exercise that would 'benefit state AGs' political ambitions, but impose harmful costs on consumers, businesses, and the economy.' Paxton, in particular, has issued at least two emails to supporters through his campaign, including an Oct. 2 note[20] that said he needed $25 or more to 'fight Google's dominance over so much of our lives,' including the effects it has on publishers.The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one[21].As such scrutiny intensifies, Paxton and his team cautioned they're at the beginning, not the end, of an investigation. With Google, in particular, 'a lot of people just didn't understand the model' until recently, he said. 'The way it's been done, it's been hard to get a grip on what's going on behind the scenes.' While he said that the broad, national participation reflects the seriousness of states' concerns, Paxton stressed they hadn't reached 'any kind of conclusion, there's so much we don't know.' 'Whatever that leads to,' he added, 'it leads to.'

PHOTO: Al Drago/New York Times</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Texas investigators are defending their decision to employ some of Google's longtime foes as part of an antitrust probe into the search giant, saying in a court filing that the recent legal objections raised by the company threaten to \"severely compromise\" states' scrutiny. At issue are a number of consultants retained by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who's leading an inquiry into Google's ad business that's backed by 50 other attorneys general. The experts include people who previously have worked on behalf of Google's rivals, including News Corp., in antitrust battles around the world. In October, Google lawyers asked a Texas court to limit those consultants' access to the tech giant's secrets. </p><p>Almost two months later, Texas officials told a judge in Travis County that Google's requests are highly problematic, serving only to try to block much-needed experts from contributing in a complicated matter. The Post obtained the documents, dated Dec. 9, through an open-records request. \"Google's Petition, under the guise of protecting confidential information, seeks to frustrate the (office of the attorney general's) statutorily prescribed investigative authority by severely hampering the (office's) lawful ability to employ the services of experts, consultants, and others for purposes of the investigation,\" lawyers for Texas argued in their filing. In response, Google spokesman Jose Castaneda in a statement described the attorney general's hires as an \"extraordinarily irregular arrangement,\" adding it is \"only fair to have assurances that our confidential business information won't be shared with competitors or vocal complainants.\" The back-and-forth between Texas and Google reflects the high stakes in what's likely to be a long, sweeping antitrust review of Google's business practices. The probe, announced in September, is focused on Google's online-advertising operation, which helped generate $117 billion for the company last year. Paxton and his Democratic and Republican colleagues are probing whether Google's ad practices harm a wide array of businesses, including news publishers, and results in higher prices, worse service or fewer choices for consumers online. The states' effort is one of a series of major antitrust probes into Google in the United States and around the world: The Justice Department in Washington similarly is scrutinizing the company, while House lawmakers have pored over Google records as part of a review of big tech and federal competition laws. Abroad, competition watchdogs in the United Kingdom have opened their own review into Facebook and Google. On Wednesday, they issued an interim report finding the companies \"may have become entrenched with negative consequences for the people and businesses who use these services every day.\" In response, Google has defended its practices on each of those fronts, claiming it actually has created competition, not limited it. But the company has taken special exception with Texas and Paxton in response to two experts the Lone Star State tapped this year to study the matter. The first, Cristina Caffarra, is a top competition expert at Charles River Associates, where she has represented clients including the Rupert Murdoch-backed News Corp., which previously has called for a breakup of Google. Caffarra has been most active in Europe, where regulators have repeatedly fined Google for violating competition laws. The second expert, Eugene Burrus, has been behind a series of lawsuits and investigations into Google's business practices, the tech giant contended in its October filing. Much like Caffarra, Google has expressed concerns with his selection, including fears he could take the knowledge gleaned from the Texas probe and battle the tech giant again in the future. In October, Google urged a judge to impose an order on Caffarra, Burrus and others from disclosing certain information or working for any of Google's rivals for a year after the probe concludes. In their response, Paxton's team argued it had already sought to protect Google's confidential information.

The experts include people who previously have worked on behalf of Google's rivals, including News Corp., in antitrust battles around the world.</p><p>In October, Google lawyers asked a Texas court to limit those consultants' access to the tech giant's secrets. Almost two months later, Texas officials told a judge in Travis County that Google's requests are highly problematic, serving only to try to block much-needed experts from contributing in a complicated matter. The Washington Post obtained the documents, dated Dec. 9, through an open-records request.</p><p>\"Google's Petition, under the guise of protecting confidential information, seeks to frustrate the [Office of the Attorney General's] statutorily-prescribed investigative authority by severely hampering the [office's] lawful ability to employ the services of experts, consultants, and others for purposes of the investigation,\" lawyers for Texas argued in their filing.</p><p>In response, Google spokesman Jose Castaneda in a statement described the attorney general's hires as an \"extraordinarily irregular arrangement,\" adding it is \"only fair to have assurances that our confidential business information won't be shared with competitors or vocal complainants.\"</p><p>The back-and-forth between Texas and Google reflects the high stakes in what's likely to be a long, sweeping antitrust review of Google's business practices. The probe, announced in September, is focused on Google's online-advertising operation, which helped generate $117 billion for the company last year. Paxton and his Democratic and Republican colleagues are probing whether Google's ad practices harm a wide array of businesses, including news publishers, and result in higher prices, worse service or fewer choices for consumers online.</p><p>The states' effort is one of several major antitrust probes into Google in the United States and around the world: In Washington, the Justice Department similarly is scrutinizing the company, while House lawmakers have pored over Google records as part of a review of big tech and federal competition laws. Abroad, competition watchdogs in the United Kingdom have opened their own review into Facebook and Google. On Wednesday, they issued an interim report finding the companies \"may have become entrenched with negative consequences for the people and businesses who use these services every day.\"</p><p>In response, Google has defended its practices on each of those fronts, claiming it has actually created competition, not limited it. But the company has taken special exception with Texas and Paxton in response to two experts the Lone Star State tapped this year to study the matter.</p><p>The first, Cristina Caffarra, is a top competition expert at Charles River Associates, where she has represented clients including the Rupert Murdoch-backed News Corp., which previously has called for a breakup of Google. Caffarra has been most active in Europe, where regulators have repeatedly fined Google for violating competition laws.</p><p>The second expert, Eugene Burrus, has been behind lawsuits and investigations into Google's business practices, the tech giant contended in its October filing. Much like Caffarra, Google has expressed concerns with his selection, including fears he could take the knowledge gleaned from the Texas probe and battle the tech giant again in the future.</p><p>In October, Google urged a judge to impose an order on Caffarra, Burrus and others from disclosing certain information or working for any of Google's rivals for a year after the probe concludes.</p><p>In their response, Paxton's team argued it had already sought to protect Google's confidential information. The attorney general's team said its contracts \"expressly provide that any information obtained via the investigation is not to be shared with any third party or used for any purpose other than the investigation.\"</p><p>The order that Google proposed, however, would be \"so expansive that it would severely compromise the [office's] ability to hire an expert, court reporter, or even graphic support for this investigation,\" Paxton's lawyers said.</p><p>And Texas charged that Google essentially would \"gate an investigative process which is, by its nature, fluid depending on the evidence that is uncovered.\" In doing so, Texas offered the latest indication that the 51 attorneys general involved in the investigation could easily expand their focus well beyond advertising.</p><p>\"As the subject matter of the investigation is initially broad (Google's potentially anticompetitive conduct), the specific behavior and acts at issue will likely change and evolve as the investigation progresses,\" lawyers for Paxton wrote.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-126efcddbdc04a4a93ab20a0c00c1d71</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XSB-XDD1-DXKP-J0H0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"847\"/><timeReceived>4:48 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 18, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

The city\u2019s commercial-property sales slid 54% compared with last year, a signal of the difficult recovery. The outbreaks in California and Florida continued to show signs of easing, while hospitalizations in Texas fell by more than half in August.   The pace of infections rose further in key European countries and German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned that more sacrifices lie ahead after the summer. French President Emmanuel Macron remained opposed to another national lockdown as new cases hit a five-month peak.   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration parted ways with its chief spokeswoman after the head of the agency exaggerated the benefits of an experimental therapy.

Colorado Court Upholds Mask Order (6:23 a.m. HK)   The Colorado Supreme Court declined Friday to hear a case against the statewide mask order issued by Gov. Jared Polis on 16 July. House Minority Leader Patrick Neville challenged the order, which Polis recently extended until Sept. 13. The Democratic governor said in a statement that wearing a mask is an effective weapon against Covid-19 and \u201cwill help keep businesses open, save lives, and keep our economy growing.\u201d   Pinterest Nixes Big San Francisco Lease Deal (6:20 a.m. HK)   Pinterest Inc. canceled a large office lease at a building to be constructed near its San Francisco headquarters, marking one of the most significant moves yet by a big tech company to scale back real estate plans in the city amid the Covid-19 pandemic.   \u201cAs we analyze how our workplace will change in a post-Covid world, we are specifically rethinking where future employees could be based,\u201d Todd Morgenfeld, Pinterest\u2019s chief financial officer and head of business operations, said in a statement Friday.   The social-sharing service is paying an $89.5 million termination fee to terminate its lease for 490,000 square feet (45,500 square meters) of space. It will keep its existing offices in the city.   Brazil Cases, Deaths Slow (6:07 a.m. HK)   Brazil reported 43,412 cases, fewer than the 44,235 from the previous day, for a total of 3,804,804, the Health Ministry said. Another 855 deaths were reported, a drop from the 984 reported the day before. Total fatalities in the nation with the worst outbreak after the U.S. are now 119,504.   Stocks of Potential Vaccine Doses Build (5:55 p.m. NY)   U.S. health official said Friday that hundreds of thousands of doses of coronavirus vaccines have already been manufactured in hopes that at least one of the candidates might succeed in clinical trials.   The Trump administration\u2019s \u201cOperation Warp Speed\u201d program has reached agreements for eight coronavirus vaccine candidates that are in various stages of development, none of which have yet been approved or authorized for use.   Paul Mango, deputy chief of staff for policy at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said three of those experimental shots have already been produced at mass scale, with hundreds of thousands of doses ready to be deployed should they receive clearance from the Food and Drug Administration. Three other candidates will soon go into manufacturing, he said.   Texas Hospitalizations Drop by Half (5:21 p.m. NY)   After rapidly climbing during June and July to more than 10,000, the number of people hospitalized for Covid-19 in Texas dropped by more than half in August, to 4,422 Friday.   The state health department confirmed an additional 4,025 virus cases, including some backlogged data, to bring the total to 601,762 since the outbreak began. Deaths climbed by 192, for a total of 12,266 people in the state who have lost their lives from the disease.   NYC Museums Begin to Reopen (5:05 p.m. NY)   After more than five months in hibernation, the museums of New York are slowly starting to reopen, reawakening part of the cultural life of the city.   On Saturday, the Metropolitan Museum of Art will greet the general public after members were allowed back on Thursday. The Museum of Modern Art just opened this week, the Whitney Museum of American Art will reopen next week and the Guggenheim plans to return in October.   \u201cWhen there\u2019s turmoil, that\u2019s the time when you want to go to a museum, to have that moment of connection with a work of art,\u201d said Tom Finkelpearl, the city\u2019s former cultural affairs commissioner. With practically no tourists, who usually make up the lion\u2019s share of visitors, and government restrictions on capacity, the impact of museum reopenings will be more symbolic than economic, Finkelpearl said.   California Retools Reopening After Surge (4:05 p.m. NY)   California Governor Gavin Newsom announced new guidance for reopening the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy, creating a statewide tier system rather than a county-by-county structure that has led to disparate approaches in restarting businesses.   The new framework creates four different categories as opposed to 58 separate metrics for each county to measure progress in the fight against the coronavirus. It also allows some sectors to be partially open as opposed to strictly being open or closed. Focus will shift from a broad set of metrics to just two -- case rates per 100,000 residents and test positivity rates -- to determine how a county is faring.   \u201cWe believe this is much more simple, much more transparent,\u201d Newsom said at a press briefing Friday.   U.S. Cases Rise 0.9% (4 p.m. NY)   Coronavirus cases in the U.S. increased 0.9% as compared with the same time Thursday to 5.9 million, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg News. The increase was higher than the average daily gain of 0.7% over the past week. Deaths rose by 0.6% to 181,409.  Florida reported 615,806 cases, up 0.6% from a day earlier, in line with the average increase in the previous seven days. Deaths reached 10,957, an increase of 89, or 0.8%. Iowa experienced a 4.4% increase in the number of cases from the same time yesterday, bringing the total to 62,334, according to the data from Johns Hopkins and Bloomberg News.  Illinois Widens Virus Spread Warning (3:40 p.m. NY)   Illinois increased the number of countries considered to be a a \u201cwarning level\u201d to 30 from 20 a week ago, according the state\u2019s health department. A warning level is triggered when two or more Covid-19 risk indicators increase.   \u201cCases connected to schools are beginning to be reported,\u201d the department said in a statement on its website. \u201cGeneral transmission of the virus in the community is also increasing.\u201d   Cases and hospitalizations have climbed over the last two months in Illinois, which reported 2,149 new coronavirus cases on Friday compared with 1,707 a day earlier. Deaths declined to 20 from 24.   Arizona Cases Remain Steady (2:35 p.m. NY)   Arizona on Friday reported 519 new virus cases, a 0.3% increase to 200,658 that matched the prior seven-day rise. Deaths rose by 49 to 4,978, while the test-positivity rate dropped to 5.7% from 8.5% the day before.   California Reports Below-Average New Cases (2:25 p.m. NY)   California reported 5,329 new virus cases, a 0.8% increase and less than the 14-day average of 6,270. There were 140 new deaths, greater than the two-week daily average of 121, bringing total virus fatalities to 12,690.   The state continued to show improvement in hospitalizations, which fell 2% to 4,205, a two-month low. The rate of positive tests over the past 14 days dropped to 6% from 6.1%. The trends show stark improvement compared with the beginning of the month, when the test positivity rate topped 7% and average daily cases exceeded 9,000.   FDA Ousts Spokeswoman (1:46 p.m. NY)   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has parted ways with its chief spokeswoman, according to a person with knowledge of the move, after the head of the agency exaggerated the benefits of an experimental therapy, and others in the Trump administration promoted the erroneous statements.   The spokeswoman, Emily Miller, joined the agency earlier this month. She came to the job with communications experience in past government positions, a stint at conservative media outlets, and work advocating for gun rights. But she had little to no health-care experience. The news was first reported by the New York Times.   Miller\u2019s ousting comes after a press conference Sunday at which FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said that convalescent blood plasma -- an experimental treatment that uses plasma from recovered Covid-19 patients to treat those currently infected -- could save 35 out of 100 people who would otherwise have died.   That was incorrect. The FDA only had data showing that a higher concentration of the treatment was better than a lower one.   NYC Commercial-Property Sales Slide 54% (1:05 p.m. NY)   Commercial real estate deals in New York City have taken a major hit as the pandemic continues to roil the local economy.   Investment sales totaled $10.5 billion in the first half of 2020, down 54% from a year earlier and a record low since the Real Estate Board of New York begin reporting the data in 2015.   \u201cWe continue to see the devastating and long-lasting impacts the pandemic has had on the health and stability of the New York economy,\u201d James Whelan, the trade group\u2019s president, said in a statement. \u201cReal estate is a fundamental driver of the city\u2019s economy.\u201d   Macron Sticks to No Lockdown (12:57 p.m. NY)   President Emmanuel Macron said the economic upheaval caused by the Covid-19 pandemic is an opportunity to speed up France\u2019s modernization. He also reiterated his opposition to another national lockdown even as France reported a five-month peak in cases.   The country reported 7,379 new Covid-19 cases on Friday, the most since March 31.   \u201cLockdowns have been the most unsophisticated measure, used since the Middle Ages,\u201d Macron said.   Avoiding restrictive measures similar to last spring\u2019s is \u201cfeasible\u201d thanks to discipline and social distancing, Macron told a group of reporters in a Paris briefing. Even so, \u201cthere can be another nationwide or regional lockdown,\u201d he said, \u201cif the virus continues to surprise us.\u201d   Argentina Virus Strategy Loses Support as Cases Surge (12:20 p.m. NY)   Argentine President Alberto Fernandez\u2019s approval rating for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic has reached its lowest point since he ordered a strict lockdown in March as cases surge to new highs.   Approval for Fernandez\u2019s coronavirus strategy fell to 54% in the third week of August, down from a high of 84% in mid-April, according to Buenos Aires-based polling firm Poliarquia. His disapproval rating climbed to 38% from 9% over the same period. The numbers reflect growing unrest with a strict quarantine in the Buenos Aires metro area, where most of the country\u2019s population resides.   On Friday Argentina reported its second straight day of new cases surpassing 10,000, while the test positivity rate - the percentage of people who test positive - averaged 41% for the past seven days, according to government data and Bloomberg News calculations.   Spain Hits Another High Since Spring (12:16 p.m. NY)   Spain\u2019s daily coronavirus infections rose to a new four-month high Friday, as the country struggles to control new outbreaks. The health ministry recorded 3,829 new infections in the past 24 hours, compared to 3,781 reported Thursday. That is the most since April 23.   Outbreaks in Spain have climbed since mid-July, fueled by summer-time social gatherings and by lax social distancing among certain groups, such as teenagers and young adults, in line with what is happening in other European nations, including Italy and France.   Earlier in the week, the government announced that it would make 2,000 soldiers available for contact tracing if requested by regional authorities, who oversee health policy, while it also dismissed the possibility of ordering a national lockdown.   U.K. Lifts Restrictions (12:12 p.m. NY)   U.K. authorities have lifted restrictions in parts of of Greater Manchester, Lancashire and West Yorkshire starting Sept. 2, according to a statement from the Department of Health and Social Care. People will be able to mix with others outside their household and businesses will be permitted to re-open.   Four People Tested Positive at RNC (11:40 a.m. NY)   Four people -- two attendees and two support staff members -- tested positive for coronavirus ahead of the Republican National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, this week, Mecklenburg County Public Health officials said Friday.   The agency said that approximately 792 Covid-19 tests were conducted at the start of Monday\u2019s meeting. The four individuals who were positive were immediately advised to quarantine and their contacts were also issued \u201cisolation instructions.\u201d   Greece Extends Virus-Control Measures (11:40 a.m. NY)   Greece is extending for another two weeks all measures currently in place to avoid spread of the virus, Deputy Citizen Protection Minister Nikos Haradalias said Friday. Measures include the mandatory wearing of masks in enclosed spaces, social distancing on beaches and limits on customer numbers in stores depending on size. Greece is also suspending flights to and from the Catalonia region of Spain and is ending the requirement for all travelers arriving from the Netherlands to have tested negative for the coronavirus at least 72 hours before arrival.   Vacation Travelers Lead to Italy Spike (11:15 a.m. NY)   Italy reported 1,462 cases Friday after 1,411 Thursday. That is the largest increase since May 2 and comes as Italians, especially younger ones, return from holidays at home and abroad. A record 97,065 tests were carried out, with the positivity rate broadly stable at 1.5%.   While the government has tried to stem the outbreaks by widening mask-use requirements and closing nightclubs, it has ruled out imposing a new nationwide lockdown. The main challenge for Premier Giuseppe Conte\u2019s cabinet now is to ensure that schools reopen as planned on Sept. 14. That is crucial for the economic recovery to continue as the country struggles with the fallout of the recession.   Florida Cases Continue to Slow (10:51 a.m. NY)   Florida reported 615,806 Covid-19 cases on Friday, up 0.6% from a day earlier, in line with the average increase in the previous seven days. The seven-day rolling case total was 22,520, the lowest since June 21, according to the health department report, which includes data through Thursday.   The new daily rate of people testing positive for the first time fell to 5.7% for Thursday, from 6.3% on Wednesday. It was the 16th day in the single digits, the longest such streak since mid-June   Deaths among Florida residents reached 10,957, an increase of 89, or 0.8%, and the seven-day rolling total was 789, the lowest since July 19. By that measure, it has now been under 1,000 for the past seven days, after peaking this month at nearly 1,300. Deaths often trail infections by weeks, and generally take even longer to be reflected in the data.   Netherlands Seeks End to Mink Farming (10:50 a.m. NY)   The Dutch government announced that mink farms will be forced to cease operations in March of next year, news agency ANP reported on Friday. The decision comes after infected minks were found on 42 farms, triggering mass cullings of the semi-aquatic, carnivorous mammals that are bred for their soft pelts. Before the outbreak, the mink industry in the Netherlands had been scheduled to close in 2024 on animal welfare grounds.   Amsterdam Mask-Wearing Requirement to End (8:10 a.m. NY)   A rule requiring face masks in crowded areas of Amsterdam and Rotterdam will expire on Aug. 31, after it met with mixed results. Many people ignored the regulation, including in Amsterdam\u2019s red light district, a tourist hot spot, even though the city handed out dozens of fines. Authorities are reviewing the results and may decide to re-implement a mask-wearing requirement.   Berlin Court Lifts Ban on Coronavirus Demonstration (8 a.m. NY)   A Berlin court ruled that a demonstration against coronavirus-related restrictions can go ahead on Saturday, reversing a ban announced by city authorities. A court spokesman said protesters -- 22,500 are expected to turn out -- will have to obey distancing rules and will be instructed to do so by police.   Merkel Warns of Difficult Times Ahead (6:30 a.m. NY)   Chancellor Angela Merkel started her annual summer address with a personal appeal to Germans, warning them that the situation will get tougher as the summer draws to a close. \u201cThere are indications that things will become more difficult in coming months,\u201d she said in Berlin. \u201cIt\u2019s serious, unchanged serious. Continue to take it seriously.\u201d   While Merkel has been praised for her handling of the pandemic, cracks have started to appear. She struggled to get state leaders aligned on response measures as infection rates surge. On Thursday, the chancellor urged Germans to avoid travel to virus-hit areas such as the U.S.   Germany needs to work hard to \u201cmaintain our economy as much as possible or bring it back in gear again,\u201d she said, adding that the country needed also to keep its eye on issues such as climate change and digitalization that will impact its competitiveness in the future.   \u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42948225727</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60PM-3PN1-JCSC-J2YN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3018\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>BNN Bloomberg</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 28, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Press Release</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>CC000DFL8</classCode><className>PINTEREST INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"62\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>New York Times Co</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>New York Times Co</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>New York Times Co</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>New York Times Co</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>New York Times Co</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>New York Times Co</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Pinterest Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Pinterest Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Pinterest Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Pinterest Inc</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Canada</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.ticker\"><classificationItem><className>NYT</className><className>BER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NYT</className><className>DUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NYT</className><className>FRA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NYT</className><className>STU</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NYT</className><className>MUN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NYT</className><className>NYS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>PINS</className><className>NYS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>2U9</className><className>ETR</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>2U9</className><className>FRA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>PINS</className><className>MEX</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

I'm Alex Marquardt at our Hudson Yards headquarters in New York. It is BREAKING NEWS right now on CNN. Gunfire and bloodshed, death and unimaginable fear at a Wal-Mart store earlier today in South Texas. Twenty people are now dead according to state officials killed by a man who opened fire with a rifle outside and then inside the crowded store in El Paso. I'm about to show you some video taken in a moment just after the massacre. We have to warn you, it does show people who are badly hurt and you may find it disturbing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Inaudible).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Help.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hey, (inaudible).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Help.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We need CPR.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We need CPR.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (Inaudible) ...</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARQUARDT: This happening in El Paso at about 10 o'clock in the morning, local time. All indications are that the man used a rifle to kill those 20 people and wound at least 26 others.</p><p>You can hear those single deliberate shots there. Police officers were on the scene within just minutes, getting praised for their quick response. They arrested the gunman without incident, without firing a shot. Texas officials are already planning to bring capital murder charges against the shooter who they describe is a white man, 21 years old who reportedly posted a four-page document online that El Paso's Police Chief has been calling a manifesto. Here is the Texas governor Greg Abbott.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOVERNOR GREG ABBOTT (R-TX): We are here to make clear that we stand united in support of this community. We are stand united in our efforts to make sure that Texas and the local community that we do everything we can to help these victims respond to this challenge. And we also want to thank the first responders for the way that they dealt with this, they were able to make sure that the shooter did not harm any more people as large as the tragedy was.</p><p>Twenty precious lives lost, 26 more injured. This was not going to be forgotten. The State of Texas is going to work side-by-side with the city of El Paso and with all of these victims to do everything we can to help repair their lives and put them back on a path of hope.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARQUARDT: That's Governor Greg Abbott there. CNN's Ed Lavandera is in El Paso right now. Ed, this is taking on a whole new dimension now as federal officials are saying that they are going to not only treat this mass killing as a possible hate crime, but also an act of domestic terrorism.</p><p>ED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely and that is a part of the news that is sending shockwaves and a great deal of concern through this border town here that has really been at the center of the immigration debate for much of the last year and a half. But it is also a city, Alex, that has prided itself on being one of the safest cities in America and that is why news like what happened here today has come at such a horrific time and sent horrific shockwaves to the community.</p><p>We are standing just behind the Wal-Mart where investigators still have the entire area cordoned off. There are dozens of cars still left in the parking lot of this Wal-Mart which really captures a scene of how packed it was here this morning. A routine Saturday morning where thousands of people come and go through this particular shopping center, not far from the border.</p><p>We heard reports of Mexican nationals who often come across the border to shop at Wal-Mart like this that were killed and wounded inside. And there is still a frantic sense from many victims and victims' families. One family in particular that we spoke with, the family of 86 year old Angie Englisbee who according to her son and a daughter, they have not heard from her since moments before the shooting took place. They say that one relative of hers had spoken with the elderly woman for about four minutes just minutes before the shooting that she was in a checkout line inside the Wal-Mart. Her family says this many hours later they still have not heard from her and they fear the worst.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EDIE HALLBERG, MOTHER OF WALMART CUSTOMER: So far we stayed at MacArthur School and we went to school there, she doesn't - then my niece took me to Pebble Hills. She wasn't there. The bus was empty. All the people were gone. [23:05:00] And we said - well, I asked the cops at MacArthur, I want to know where my mom is. Where are the people that are in Wal-Mart? Where did you put them all?</p><p>Where have they all gone? I want to just find my mom. Somebody needs to tell me where she is. I want to know if she's dead or alive or if she's still in Wal-Mart. We need to find her and this is the only way we're going to do it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Come down to the police, OK, let me get you down there.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAVANDERA: That desperation and anxiety just difficult to listen to and many witnesses walking away from the scene with the same experience. We spoke with a woman named Debbie Romero (ph) who was standing outside of the Wal-Mart when she started hearing the gunshots and she says, Alex, tonight that the one thing she cannot get out of the mind is an image that she saw as she stood there in front of the doors of the Wal-Mart and described to us what she saw.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEBBIE ROMERO: I was waiting for them to come but it was taking too long and then I heard the first one, so I was like, \"What's going on?\" But it was so loud, very loud and then I just saw that everybody dropping. So that's when I just ran in there like trying to, but then I saw him run this way, so I chased him and I thought he got shot.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And who was him that you're talking --</p><p>ROMERO: And the baby - my nephew. There's a baby that some man carried that got shot. The guy just gave it to the ambulance, I don't think. (Inaudible) confuse me. It was awful.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAVANDERA: So Alex that the image of a man holding a baby covered in blood and passing that baby off to a paramedic who was arriving at the scene and many of those people left wondering what happened and what kind of condition the people who were closest around them, what kind of condition they're in tonight and that's what many people are still scrambling to figure out, Alex.</p><p>MARQUARDT: Just heartbreaking to listen to, Ed. We can still see that there's a lot of activity behind you. This scene is far from clear. That's going to take several days. And we know that you're going to stay on this story. Ed Lavandera in El Paso. Thanks very much.</p><p>I want to bring in our CNN Law Enforcement Analyst Charles Ramsey, a former Washington, D.C. Police Chief. Charles, we've been talking all evening about how this went down, about the suspects and what clues that authorities might be looking into. But when you look at how this happened, when you look at the fact that this was someone from over 600 miles away, who drove uninterrupted to El Paso and walked into what is an incredibly soft target admittedly with thousands of people inside, is there anything that the authorities could have done to stop a shooting like this?</p><p>CHARLES RAMSEY, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST: Well, I don't know, Ed. More information will come out over time. I mean you certainly don't have a crystal ball when you start looking back at something, it's kind of easy to predict whether, well, maybe we should have done this or maybe we should have done that. But the bottom line is this guy drove all the way from Allen, Texas, 600 some miles.</p><p>I mean, how many soft targets that he pass up just to get to El Paso in that one Wal-Mart. I mean he wanted to be at the border. Whatever he wanted to do, he wanted to do it there and nowhere else. I don't know what was online, what could have been seen, what wasn't seen.</p><p>Obviously, somebody saw it and didn't notify authorities, but we'll find all that out later on. But the bottom line is we've got a lot of people on the fringe. We're in a very toxic environment right now. A lot of heated rhetoric especially when it comes to immigration and the border, both from elected officials, very high level elected officials as well as some media personalities and people that go to these rallies and start chanting racist things.</p><p>I mean this is just not good for us as a country and our Congress needs to do something. They need to come together and start having hearings and do something, but they're useless. I mean the U.S. Congress is not going to do anything at all. So they can say all they want to say, but when this is over, believe me, it's going to be over. If Sandy Hook didn't move the needle, don't think that this is going to move it, because it's not.</p><p>MARQUARDT: Right. Sandy Hook, of course, was all children and one teacher. Let's bring in former FBI Supervisory Special Agent Josh Campbell. Josh is on the scene. And Josh, sources are telling you that the FBI is now opening a domestic terror investigation. What is the significance of that?</p><p>JOSH CAMPBELL, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST: Yes. Alex, a law enforcement official familiar with the ongoing investigation tells us that the Bureau has opened what they're calling a domestic terrorism investigation that will run concurrently to the state investigation. Now, the stressing that the state is still in charge here, the state of Texas investigators have the lead but the FBI has opened a concurrent case to look into the possible motivation of the shooter to include ideology, if there is any type of hate crime angle to this, they'll be working that case, especially looking into this alleged manifesto that we've been talking about.</p><p>[23:10:06] Again, trying to get into the mindset of the shooter, was this someone who came here causing mass loss of life based on hate and obviously the FBI, the federal government has a host of resources that they can bring to bear. I was just in California last week, we were covering yet another mass shooting. In that instance, the FBI also providing resources. They provided their profilers from the Behavioral Analysis Unit at Quantico that helped them get into the mindset of this person based on these past incidents.</p><p>So we can bet that there will be a host of resources that the federal government will be bringing to bear. We're told there are different offices, satellite offices around Texas that are sending resources here and FBI assets at the headquarters in Washington are standing by to deploy to this location should they get any requests from state officials here that are leading investigation, Alex.</p><p>MARQUARDT: Charles, back to the fact that this is such a soft target. What can be done in this case?</p><p>RAMSEY: Well, I mean everybody is going to be looking at security in ways they can step it up. But a shopping mall is incredibly difficult to secure. I know they already do drills. One of the witnesses there said that about a month ago, I guess, they had an active shooter drill there. The police have them on a regular basis. Hopefully they coordinate with private security and so forth so that they all get on the same page if something like this happens.</p><p>But the reality is these malls are absolutely enormous and there are so many ways in and out of the mall that makes it difficult but certainly it'll be reviewed, not just in El Paso but across the country. I mean it won't be long before we'll be looking at the major shopping season around Thanksgiving and Christmas. So yes it's going to be on the minds of a lot of people, but today it's a mall, before we've had churches, we've had schools, I mean you never know what's going to be the next target and it makes it very, very difficult.</p><p>MARQUARDT: Josh, right now because the shooter was taken alive, they are diving into the shooter's background. Of course, what he's written in this manifesto. What are they going to be looking for? What are they going to be asking him? What are they going to be asking themselves about how they can stop someone like him in the future?</p><p>CAMPBELL: Yes. All good questions, Alex, and right now more questions than answers for us. Now, we've seen incidents in the past where a shooter either decides to engage with law enforcement and shot dead. We've seen instances where the shooter decides to take his or her own life and this is that instance where they actually have the person in custody, which means that they potentially have the ability to glean important information that can help them get to that motivation.</p><p>Now, if this person is proud of what he did, he may be willingly telling law enforcement interrogators what exactly he was doing, why he came here, there may be an instance where he decides to clam up and doesn't cooperate with law enforcement. But that's all the part of that investigative interview and that's why it's so important. Again, to get into his mindset, they'll be looking at what he says comparing that to the digital media investigation that is currently underway, going through his social media accounts, Facebook, all of the social media platforms that you can think of.</p><p>The FBI and local law enforcement will be digging into those again to get to the picture of what was in his mind and also as importantly who were the people in his orbit, did he have friends, did he have associates, were there others that may have known what he was going to do here, that'll all be part of that investigation.</p><p>MARQUARDT: And, of course, there's always the fear that someone will try to replicate this and use this as a copycat. Josh Campbell, Charles Ramsey, thank you as always for your expertise.</p><p>We're going to take a quick break. We'll be right back.</p><p>[23:17:08] MARQUARDT: Just in, we have learned that the FBI is opening a domestic terror investigation into the El Paso shooting that has left 20 people dead and 26 wounded. Police have identified the alleged shooter as a 21-year-old white male from Allen, Texas. That's just north of Dallas.</p><p>He was reported, sorry, excuse me, he was arrested at the scene. The police chief also saying that the shooting has what he calls a nexus to a potential hate crime, citing a manifesto that they have obtained that may be connected to the suspect. They say that they're still working to confirm that the suspect himself wrote it.</p><p>So joining me now for more on this is CNN Business Reporter Donie O'Sullivan. Donie, we have seen this four-page manifesto. It's entitled 'I'm probably going to die today'. He didn't. He was taken into custody without firing a shot and as being, we presume, questioned. What's your takeaway from this document?</p><p>DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: That's right, Alex. I mean this is a four-page document which is full of racist, hatred towards immigrants and Hispanics, particularly, and blames immigrants and first-generation Americans for taking away jobs and blending of cultures in the United States.</p><p>My colleague, Paul Murphy, estimates that the document was posted about 20 minutes before the incidents took place onto the message board 8chan.</p><p>MARQUARDT: Yes. So often as the big tech companies, it's the Instagrams, it's the Facebooks, it's the Twitters that get a lot of plaque from Capitol Hill and others for what they allow on. But the fact is there's a whole spectrum of blogs and message boards where you can post this vitriol, this hate and it's totally unregulated. Tell us first about what 8chan is and then what that landscape looks like.</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: Yes, 8chan is part of, I guess, the real underbelly of the internet. It's where there is just constant racist, anti-semitic vile post at every hour of the day and it is now part of a trend. We have seen that right before the New Zealand attack, the attacker there posted a manifesto similarly on 8chan as well as a link to his Facebook page where he later went live. The same thing happened in April in California ahead of the deadly attack on a synagogue there.</p><p>And if this manifesto turns out to be truly written by the suspect, again, this was posted right before the incident took place on 8chan. I mean, 8chan, it's quite disgusting when you look at the content there that folks are actually cheering on, encouraging, talking about the death toll as if it's a game. They've really seemed to just gamified these atrocities.</p><p>MARQUARDT: Is there no way that this can be regulated? I guess to some extent, it's protected by a free speech and this is the internet.</p><p>[23:20:00] But what could be done and, of course, the authorities will be asked why didn't they catch something like this. But the fact is there's so many of them, if there's so many posts, is there anything that can be done to alert this stuff and to regulate it?</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: Well, I'm sure that law enforcement now is keeping a close eye on a lot of websites like these. The difficulty is, of course, we put the Congress and the government put a lot of pressure on the major corporations like Facebook and Twitter to get a handle of what is happening there. But on these websites like 4chan and 8chan, some people will say, \"Well, why can't they even be just taken off the internet?\"</p><p>MARQUARDT: Right.</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: The issue is that if one hosting internet provider says we want to shut you down, they could just go to another provider who might be based in a different country. So it's difficult to just wipe something off the internet.</p><p>MARQUARDT: Yes, the internet is forever as they say. Are we hearing from some of the bigger tech companies?</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: Yes. So Facebook and Twitter both removed accounts that are under the name of the suspect. They've also told me that they are blocking sharing of the manifesto. But just very quickly, it doesn't take a lot to actually find the manifesto on both Facebook and Twitter so they clearly need to be doing a better job on that.</p><p>MARQUARDT: Right. All right. Well, Donie O'Sullivan, thanks so much for coming in.</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: Thank you.</p><p>MARQUARDT: I appreciate it. All right. We're going to take a quick break. We'll be right back after this.</p><p>[23:25:03] BURNETT: In the wake of the deadly mass shooting in El Paso today, there was an outpouring of support from the community. Many waiting in long lines to donate desperately needed blood. One organization says it hasn't seen this kind of response since the 9/11 attacks. David Veloz joins me now on the phone. He's the senior director of Donor Recruitment for the Vitalant Blood Bank system in El Paso.</p><p>David, thanks so much for joining me tonight.</p><p>DAVID VELOZ, SENIOR DIRECTOR, VITALANT BLOOD BANK: Thank you for having me.</p><p>MARQUARDT: I can't imagine the range of emotions that you must be feeling after a day like today. You must be feeling overwhelmed, I imagine.</p><p>VELOZ: Oh, absolutely. This tragedy is something that our community just didn't know and it just all the emotions from people that came in today to donate blood, I mean it's apparent that everybody has been shocked and we're just not used to things like this out here.</p><p>MARQUARDT: And officials and residents talking about how tight-knit this community was and how many people have been touched by it, affected by, I should say, by this attack. Do you personally know anyone who was involved?</p><p>VELOZ: Well, the ironic thing is that today we had a big effort planned at Cielo Vista mall. We had one of our larger blood drives scheduled. And so we were actually out there at Cielo Vista mall collecting blood and I got a call from one of my employees and asked if I had seen the news. But some of our employees did see the shooter run through the mall and it was just something that everybody was shaken up about.</p><p>MARQUARDT: And one of the best pieces of news that we've seen today and we just showed some of the pictures a moment ago, are these stories of two-hour long lines of residents and people turning out to donate their blood, someone from your company actually said that they hadn't seen anything like this since 9/11. How have you found the response?</p><p>VELOZ: Oh, absolutely it was overwhelming. I've been with this organization for more than 20 years and I was here on 9/11 and it was the same thing today. People showing up, wanting to do something to make sense out of this tragedy, wanting to help and so today, we did have long lines of people and the line just wound around the building. People didn't mind waiting for 2-3 hours.</p><p>Today we stopped taking donors at 5:00 pm and we were rescheduling people to come back tomorrow to come back on Monday, because the response was just overwhelming. But nonetheless we didn't close our operation till about 30 minutes ago. And so we were still processing those donors that had been waiting all this time.</p><p>MARQUARDT: That's so great to hear. Tell us how can we help? What you want people to know if people want to donate blood? What should they be doing? Is there a website? Is there a phone number? What can they do?</p><p>VELOZ: Yes. They can go on our website, bloodhero.com or they can also call for an appointment at 1877-258-4825. And I think the most important thing is that I hope people understand the importance of having a plentiful blood supply available at all times. This tragedy just brings into perspective the importance of the role of blood and saving lives.</p><p>And so when we ask you to donate blood, we need you to donate blood and to come out and support not only situations like this, but situations that we don't hear about, because every day someone is using blood in our communities. Every day blood is saving lives. Donors are saving lives and what's important, it's important that people understand that.</p><p>MARQUARDT: Such an important message is not just about today, blood is needed all the time. As David just mentioned, you can go and schedule an appointment to donate blood there in El Paso and elsewhere at bloodhero.com. David Veloz, from Vitalant Blood Bank. Thanks so much for joining us tonight.</p><p>VELOZ: Thank you.</p><p>MARQUARDT: And we'll be right back.</p><p>[23:33:18] MARQUARDT: Staying on top of the tragic mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, I want to get right to CNN Analyst Josh Campbell who has new reporting on the alleged gunman who took the lives of 20 people at a shopping center there in El Paso. Josh, what are you learning?</p><p>CAMPBELL: Alex, we're getting our first look here of the suspect. Authorities believed was responsible for yet the latest mass shooting here in the United States. This one taking the life of 20 people behind me injuring over two dozen. This is a 21-year-old resident of Allen, Texas who was taken into custody by law enforcement officers after this shooting.</p><p>Now, as they dig into this person's past and as we've been looking at available reports and talking to some of our sources, there are a couple things that stand out. First of which being this is a resident of Allen, Texas which is some 650 miles from this border city of El Paso. So there are questions out there about why did this person choose to come to this location and to attack this specific facility behind me, that's part of that investigation.</p><p>We're told that he was taken into custody alive, a key aspect of that next step for law enforcement will be trying to glean from him during the course of an interview. Anything that can help them get to the motivation was this someone who was proud of what he did, is this someone who is willingly going to tell law enforcement step-by-step what he did and why he did it, that is yet to be seen.</p><p>But again we're getting that first look here, a 21-year-old white male resident of Texas responsible here police believe for just the latest act of carnage here in the United States involving mass violence with a gun.</p><p>MARQUARDT: Josh, if this manifesto is connected to him, it would seem very evident what was motivating him and that was hatred. But who else would the authorities be looking to talk to you tonight?</p><p>[23:35:00] CAMPBELL: So right now they're orbiting this target right now. They want to talk to anyone who knew him, anyone that was associated with him, his family members. We can expect that as we speak right now, authorities are likely gathering search warrants to conduct searches at any residences or addresses that may have been associated with him, again, to gather evidence.</p><p>Again, the FBI and local law enforcement, they have a procedure and process in place whenever there's a situation like this. The first thing they want to do is to cease any type of social media out there. They'll actually lock it down. Some of these accounts that are out there will all of a sudden disappear that's because law enforcement works with these companies to seize this evidence to get it down from public view as it becomes part of that investigation. We can expect that that's happening right now.</p><p>Again, authorities want to get into not only his mindset, but try to determine was there anyone else who may have known, what was about to take place here, anyone who may have participated and just as important, are there any possible follow-on attacks. Again, if this was someone who is part of some group, that will be concerning to law enforcement. They really want to dig into this person complete 360 orbiting this target together as much as they can to get into that mindset and figure out what happened here in Texas.</p><p>MARQUARDT: And again if this document that's connected to him, the title said that he expected to die. He didn't, so we don't know really why that is, whether he had a change of heart. He wanted to be taken into custody alive. We really don't know. But he is in custody and he is alive and he is going to be questioned for a long time by these authorities.</p><p>Josh, you were at the FBI, if you were sitting down across the table from this young man, what would you be asking him?</p><p>CAMPBELL: So the key question is the why and again getting back to looking at past incidents, we've studied these. Oftentimes, you will have someone who has no qualms with admitting why they did what they did. They're sometimes proud of it and especially if this manifesto is indeed connected to him. We're told by our sources that authorities are working to determine whether they are associated.</p><p>Someone who pushes that information out publicly obviously doesn't hide what they're trying to achieve and the hate that they're trying to spew. So if he admits to that then obviously that will be key to investigators. We're also told, Alex, we've been reported that the FBI has opened a concurrent domestic terrorism investigation. They're working alongside state officials.</p><p>The state has the lead right now, but the FBI is pouring through this manifesto, trying to get to any type of ideology that may have motivated this attack. They have their profilers back at Quantico that are professionals at this again digging into the mindset of these people. But, again, should it be determined that he was motivated by either hate or some type of radical ideology that falls in the spectrum of domestic terrorism, we might see a greater role here for the federal government but again as of right now they are working behind the scenes.</p><p>The state has a lead. It remains a very much an ongoing investigation.</p><p>MARQUARDT: All right. Josh Campbell there on the scene. Let us know what else you learned. Thanks very much. All right. As you can imagine, when the news of this shooting in El Paso hit, the relatives rushed to the scene, searching for their loved ones and family members. Take a listen to this man who was looking for his mother.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILL ENGLISBEE, SEARCHING FOR HIS MISSING MOTHER: My brother spoke with her at 10:31. She was in the line at Wal-Mart in the checkout line. They spoke for four minutes till 10:35 and that was the last we've heard of her and that was - that she was at that Wal-Mart right there and she told him, \"I'm in line.\" My brother is on a flight back from Florida. He'll be here in a couple hours, but he was in Atlanta.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And you checked all of the - sorry, apologize for making you repeat this, you checked all of the hospitals, you checked all of them.</p><p>ENGLISBEE: Yes. Yes, we just don't know where she is and the buses haven't shown up at MacArthur. I guess there were some witnesses they're supposed to take over to MacArthur, I have two sisters over there, and no one has shown up.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You seem to be holding up all right there.</p><p>ENGLISBEE: We're trying. We're trying. We just wanted to walk down here ourselves and take a look to try to find her. I mean, because she won't hold up without water. I mean someone needs to take care of her. She needs water, she needs to be taken care of. She's very ...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And she's not answering her phone.</p><p>ENGLISBEE: No, sir. It's actually turned off. We use the iPhone app to try to find her.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And Will, are you worried that she may have been hit?</p><p>ENGLISBEE: Sir, I don't want to speculate. I'm hoping, I'm praying, I mean, please, God, bring her home.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARQUARDT: Now, I want to bring in the Mayor of El Paso, Dee Margo. Mr. Mayor, first of all, our thoughts go out to you and to your community, to the families of those who are hurt and killed. Can you give us an update on the victims and the wounded?</p><p>MAYOR DEE MARGO (R-TX): I don't really know anything more on the statistics of the numbers. The 20 dead and those that are in the hospital. They're still going through the process. The governor and I just visited with the families waiting on information over at one of the schools here in El Paso. It's tough. It's really, really tough. MARQUARDT: It's extremely tough and extremely heartbreaking. What about the investigation? What our federal authorities telling you? What is the governor telling you about the suspect? We understand he's a 21-year-old man who drove all the way from Allen, Texas. What more do we know about the investigation into him and to his motive?</p><p>[23:40:04] MARGO: Well, there isn't much to update since we had the press conference. We talked about this gentleman, I shouldn't say gentleman, this murderer who came from outside of El Paso and as I've said before, no one in El Paso would have ever done something like this. This is not what we're about as a community. The investigations are still going through in identifying the bodies and they're going through their normal forensic work and then they're families will be notified.</p><p>But nothing new was happening yet. We're here at the scene as it stands now.</p><p>MARQUARDT: Was the shooter, do you know, was he known at all to authorities?</p><p>MARGO: I don't know that. I do not know that. He came from out of, I think, Allen, Texas, is where they think they said he came from.</p><p>MARQUARDT: Yes.</p><p>MARGO: But my point is that just a real tragedy.</p><p>MARQUARDT: Can you describe the scene before the shooting? What would have been happening at a Wal-Mart in El Paso, Texas on a Saturday morning in early August?</p><p>MARGO: A lot of shoppers. Everybody getting ready for back-to- school, normal routines, just a normal Saturday for people and yet this tragedy struck.</p><p>MARQUARDT: You and others have talked about how tight-knit this community is. What has been the reaction since this horrific massacre happened now just over nine hours ago?</p><p>MARGO: Well, it's been reported, we've had significant blood donors. This is a very generous community. It is a community that goes back 350 years and people just don't understand. We are a close-knit, we are large and close-knit, we're the largest community of our type on the U.S.-Mexico border. There's nothing in North America that can equate to what we have here with El Paso, Juarez.</p><p>So this is just totally unexpected and as I say probably never would have occurred within El Paso.</p><p>MARQUARDT: You must be heartened to see those long lines of donors, of blood donors coming out to donate blood. There have been calls for people to sign up online. What can people do to help the community right now?</p><p>MARGO: Well, the Paso del Norte Health Foundation has set up a website for donations for victims and their families. And what we're telling other people is just continue to donate blood, that's what we need right now.</p><p>MARQUARDT: All right. Well Mayor Dee Margo, El Paso, Texas, our thoughts and prayers are with you in the coming hours and days which will obviously be extremely difficult. But we know that given how tight-knit and strong that community is that you will mourn together and then recover together and be stronger than ever. Mayor Dee Margo, thanks very much.</p><p>[23:46:52] MARQUARDT: We are hearing new eyewitness accounts of the horror that unfolded at an El Paso Wal-Mart store earlier today. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ADRIA GONZALEZ, SHOOTING WITNESS: We were going to Wal-Mart as normal morning. And me and my mom went to get up milk. And once we got the milk, we were going towards the fruit alley and when we got to the fruit alley we heard like shots like three shots, boom, boom, boom, one, two, three and I told my mother, \"Mom, they are gunshots. We need to go.\"</p><p>And she just froze and did not move and I told her, \"Let's move. Get down. Get down.\" And from far away maybe like 15 feet away I saw the shooter, he was wearing a black T-shirt, some brown khaki pants and he was wearing some mugs like those to protect your ears from. And he just started to shoot everyone, he just started to shoot and what I did - my first instant was to get people out of there.</p><p>I probably shouted, \"They're shooting. They're shooting. Get out.\" I believe I push people out of the exit maybe like probably like 48 people out of there and just told them to get out and then there was this senior citizen lady that I tried to help and I couldn't and I just told her to move faster, she couldn't move faster, so I left her there, and I needed to get out because the shooter was getting closer and closer.</p><p>So I was just - I just told her to get down and hide and then I left her and we just ran outside and got everybody and just told everybody to just run out and just go far, far away as we can so we actually started running. We came out to Sam's and then from Sam's we ran more farther away because we still heard some maybe like two gunshots more outside.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARQUARDT: And then from the Governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, came this message to his State.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Governor Abbott, I'm sure you've seen reports of the alleged shooter's manifesto, which is full of hatreds expressed towards - specifically immigrants. Can you think, sir, of anything in the political life of our country at this moment that contributes to that type of hatred?</p><p>ABBOTT: Listen, this is disgusting, intolerable, it's not Texan and we are going to aggressively prosecute it both as capital murder but also as a hate crime, which is exactly what it appears to be, without having seen all the evidence yet. I don't w get ahead of the evidence.</p><p>[23:50:05] But we have to be very, very clear that conduct like this, thoughts like this, actions like this, crimes like this are not who or what Texas is and will not be accepted here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARQUARDT: And as news of this shooting broke, most of the Democrats running for president were in Las Vegas, Nevada for a union event and many spoke about the shooting.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG (D-IN), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We are the only country in the world with more guns than people. It has not made us safer. We can respect the Second Amendment and not allow it to be a death sentence for thousands of Americans.</p><p>And two, white nationalism is evil, and it is inspiring people to commit murder, and it is being condoned at the highest levels of the American government and that has to end. The first time I became aware that our country was under attack like most people in my generation I think was 9/11 and for a hot minute, we all swore up and down that we were going to be different, that it was going to change us and that being attacked was going to bring out the best in this country, that's what we said, so how about this time.</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's not just today. It has happened several times this week. It has happened here in Las Vegas where some lunatic killed 50 some-odd people and wounded hundreds of people. And I think all over the world people are looking at the United States and wondering what is going on, what is the mental health situation in America where time after time after time we're seeing indescribable horrors.</p><p>JOE BIDEN, FORMER UNITED STATES VICE PRESIDENT, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Enough is enough is enough and it's been enough for the past five years. This is a sickness. This is well beyond anything that we should be tolerating.</p><p>REP. BETO O'ROURKE (D-TX), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm incredibly saddened and it's very hard to think about this, but I'll tell you El Paso is the strongest place in the world. This community is going to come together.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARQUARDT: President Trump has also been briefed on the situation and he has tweeted, quote, terrible shootings in El Paso, Texas. Reports are very bad, many killed. Working with State and Local authorities and Law Enforcement. Spoke to Governor to pledge total support of Federal Government. God be with you all.</p><p>And just in, protests outside the White House tonight, a group called Moms Demand Action, a gun control advocacy group. They were in Washington for an annual conference and tonight they marched towards the White House chanting the words, \"El Paso.\" Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So again this video is coming to you via Twitter from @MomsDemand.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, chanting El Paso. El Paso today in the national spotlight for a mass shooting, 20 people dead, 26 people in the hospital and ...</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARQUARDT: The devastated community of El Paso tonight mourning the lives lost, 20 of them and 26 more injured. Some now fighting for their lives at area hospitals. Texans held a candlelight vigil at a Catholic Church in El Paso this evening, moments of prayer and moments of cheers. The vigil concluding with a song for this wounded community.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MARQUARDT: Another candlelight vigil for El Paso shooting victims taking place tonight in Austin, Texas at St. Edward's University. Finally, tonight I imagine that many of you like I have spent the day and evening wondering how is this possible again, why is it that the United States of America is the only country in the world where this kind of thing happens on a regular basis, where time and time again we go through this same horrific routine of news alerts about an active shooter, scenes of people streaming out school or a mall or an office building, then early reports of injuries and deaths confirmations from the authorities.</p><p>The identity of the gunman is then revealed and in the vast majority of the cases, it is a man, usually a white man, as it was today. We ask ourselves, is it the racial divisions in our country, is it political divisions, is it the way we deal with mental health or is it numbers like these?</p><p>Consider this, the U.S. population is just under 5 percent of the world's population. But according to Gallup, we own almost half of the world's guns, approximately 42 percent. That number is hard to nail down, because in America guns are hard to track.</p><p>[23:55:04] But what is clear is that American citizens owned more guns than citizens of any other country in the world. In the coming hours and days we're going to be hearing a lot of politicians offering their thoughts and prayers as they should. But if past precedent neither thoughts nor prayers are a solution. We needed a solution yesterday. The 20 people killed in today's shooting deserve a solution. The victims in Gilroy, California last weekend, they deserve a solution. The list goes on and on. This needs to be fixed. Those of us who vote in this country must demand it. Our hearts go out to El Paso tonight. We will be with you as you mourn and as you recover and we know that you will recover.</p><p>Thanks for watching tonight. I'm Alex Marquardt in New York. Natalie Allen takes over our live coverage in a moment.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2019080314CNV11</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WRP-1H31-DXH2-6104-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6665\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 3, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>El Paso, Mass Shooting, Wal-Mart, Patrick Crusius</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000C40Z</classCode><className>GUNSHOT WOUNDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001932</classCode><className>CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp;

The research and tech complex that has been purchased by an investment unit of real estate firm Hines includes Comtech and Intevac among its tenants.    \u201cWe\u2019re excited to further diversify our global portfolio and provide our investors with exposure to a well-located, strategic asset in the dynamic Silicon Valley market,\u201d said Janice Walker, chief operating officer with Hines Global Income Trust.    Houston-based Hines paid $107.1 million for the tech center, a regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission states.     The seller was a group led by DRA Advisors, which had bought the Santa Clara site in 2015 as part of a portfolio of a big portfolio of Silicon Valley properties    The buildings that the Hines affiliate bought total 417,000 square feet and are leased to 10 tenants. The property is described as a research and light manufacturing center.    The transaction is a reminder that savvy investors continue to hunger for Silicon Valley commercial properties despite the economic uncertainties ushered in by the coronavirus. The property purchase was completed on Aug. 31, the SEC filing disclosed.    The just-purchased property is close to big tech companies as well as the Silicon Valley labor pool of technology talent, Hines said.    Research and development spaces of this kind that also accommodate light manufacturing are in demand these days, according to Hines executives.     \u201cWe believe in the long-term supply and demand fundamentals of this product type, which have proven to be resilient\u201d despite the economic uncertainties, said Sam Cheikh, a managing director in the Bay Area office of Hines.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42973557739</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RB-H331-JCSC-J3SJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"352\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>East Bay Times</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 1, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002BTV</classCode><className>INTEVAC INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS332410 POWER BOILER &amp;

The Lone Star State's Republican attorney general says he rarely even uses the company's widely popular search engine, opting instead for rival services, because he has \"always been concerned about tracking.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But Paxton these days is more than a sideline skeptic: As one of the country's most powerful law enforcement officials, he's forging ahead with a landmark investigation of Google's decades-long dominance of the Web, armed with the help of 50 other attorneys general, a stable of savvy experts that includes Google's past foes and a feeling that Washington for too long has turned a blind eye to some of Silicon Valley's most troubling practices.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For now, the investigation, which Paxton and his peers announced in September, focuses on online advertising, responding to complaints that Google puts consumers and competitors at a disadvantage by controlling the exchanges where ads are bought and some of the most popular websites where they're sold. It could result in tough punishments, Paxton signaled, if investigators determine that Google broke the law.</p><p>\"We're prepared for whatever the right thing to do is for consumers,\" he said during an interview with The Washington Post in his office in the Texas capital. Whether it's standing down or forcing Google to sell off parts of itself, Paxton stressed, \"all of that's on the table based on what we learn.\"</p><p>The probe marks the first major U.S. antitrust action against Google in about a decade, after Texas joined other states and the federal government in scrutinizing the company's search engine in a competition probe that ended without major punishment for the tech giant.</p><p>Since then, Paxton said, Washington has failed to pursue signs that Google and Silicon Valley are breaking federal law. \"Antitrust seems like it hasn't been focused on for decades, through several administrations, not just Democrats but also Republicans,\" he said, adding, \"I think this should have been looked at sooner.\"</p><p>The result is a significant legal and political challenge on the horizon for Google and its executives: bipartisan in nature and born out of a belief that the tech industry has escaped government accountability for too long. Paxton and his team have said nothing is off limits - words that threaten a broad review of Google's business in a way that could reshape not only the company but the rest of Silicon Valley.</p><p>\"If we end up learning things that lead us in other directions, we'll certainly bring those back to the states and talk about whether we expand into other areas,\" Paxton said.</p><p>Google declined to comment.</p><p>Overseeing an office with nearly 800 lawyers, Paxton emerged this year as a convening force in the sort of antitrust probe that's long been sought by Democratic and Republican attorneys general alike. Eight states, including Arizona, Nebraska and North Carolina, are helping to steer the probe as part of an executive committee, but it's Texas that started the legal action by sending a legal demand with hundreds of questions to Google on behalf of the group.</p><p>It is not the only probe of the tech giant underway: Justice Department investigators also are homing in on Google and its lucrative ad empire, and they sent their own battery of questions to the company this summer. Members of Congress similarly are targeting Google and other tech giants as part of a sweeping review of federal antitrust laws. And European regulators continue to scrutinize Google and its search, ad and smartphone practices, having already slapped it with roughly $9 billion in antitrust fines over the past three years.</p><p>For state attorneys general in the United States, the driving question comes down to dollars, Paxton said. Ads targeted to people's browsing behavior are Google's lifeblood, accounting for much of the company's roughly $117 billion in revenue last year, according to its financial statements. That puts Google in the pole position in the United States, where it takes in about 37 percent of all digital advertising revenue, according to eMarketer data from February. In search, Google captures even more - 74 percent - of the market, the firm computes.</p><p>Ads provide financial fuel for Google's popular, free services, such as search, email and mapping, as well as its more audacious gambits, including self-driving cars. Paxton acknowledged that these products are widely liked around the world, even if he personally doesn't use all of them regularly. But the attorney general stressed that Google's dominance of the ad industry still has stifled the Internet.</p><p>\"Consumers may feel really good about having free searches, but the reality is nothing's free. And if there's no competition on the Internet for advertising, then consumers, unbeknownst to them, are paying much higher costs for products than they otherwise should,\" he said.</p><p>Google has sought to tell a different story about its business. Appearing on Capitol Hill in July, Adam Cohen, Google's director of economic policy, said that Internet advertising is cheaper and more effective than ever before. \"We have created new competition in many sectors, and new competitive pressures often lead to concerns from rivals,\" he said in testimony. \"We have consistently shown how our business is designed and operated to benefit our customers.\"</p><p>But Paxton said state investigators have heard from a torrent of competitors, particularly in the publishing industry, that say they cannot compete with Google's scale, meaning they lose out on revenue that might fund their content or services.</p><p>The vocal opponents include some of Google's longtime foes, such as News Corp., according to two Texas officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations in the probe. The Rupert Murdoch-backed empire previously has complained to antitrust regulators in Europe, Australia and elsewhere that Google's ad dominance results in fewer dollars for publishers, and News Corp. has at times gone so far as to call for the tech giant to be broken up.</p><p>A spokesman for News Corp., James Kennedy, declined to comment on the company's interactions with Texas. But he said in a statement, \"Our position regarding Google's damaging anti-competitive behavior and existential threat to journalism has been made clear over the years.\"</p><p>In probing those allegations, Paxton and his attorney general allies have turned to one of News Corp.'s past advisers. Among the experts the state has retained is Cristina Caffarra, who has assisted News Corp. and other Google foes on antitrust issues. A competition expert and economist at the consulting firm Charles River Associates, Caffarra has deep experience in Brussels, where Google has been repeatedly fined for competition violations. In those cases, including a recent decision finding that Google's Android phone violated regional competition laws, Caffarra has supplied considerable economic evidence in opposition to Google's practices.</p><p>Caffarra also has worked on behalf of other Google foes, including helping the Russian search engine Yandex with its complaint in Moscow and the European Union about Google's business practices, she's indicated in public reports. She declined to comment on her role in the states' probe, other than to say she is not working for a corporate client that's opposing Google currently. But her participation in the states' effort took center stage in September, when she appeared alongside more than a dozen attorneys general when they announced their plans from the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court.</p><p>For Google, the states' probe could easily broaden beyond its ad business and its effects on publishers. Democratic and Republican attorneys general long have criticized the company for the way it collects users' data and displays its search results, for example, along with the means by which it has piloted Android to become the world's most widely used smartphone operating system. Some state officials raised these issues when they announced their ads probe in September.</p><p>Paxton's office has additional concerns of its own: Texas is in the early stages of a consumer-protection investigation focused on allegations that Google makes decisions about the content it displays and suppresses that are biased against conservatives. Jeff Mateer, Paxton's first assistant attorney general, confirmed the state's interest last week, four months after he said at a conference in Omaha that big tech should be \"held accountable\" if the industry misrepresents its political neutrality. Google has denied charges that it is politically biased.</p><p>Texas has long been troubled by Google's behavior. Nine years ago, it became one of the first to embark on an antitrust investigation of Google when it opened a probe into the way the company presents search results. Paxton's predecessor, Greg Abbott, now the state's governor, sought to determine whether Google demoted competing services, such as shopping-comparison sites, that rivaled its own offerings, violating a principle that Texas called \"search neutrality.\"</p><p>Texas issued some of the initial orders demanding key documents from Google, at one point going to court to battle the company over access to information. The answers the state obtained ultimately appeared to influence some of the thinking at the Federal Trade Commission, which assumed the role of Google's chief investigator in the United States. An inadvertently released staff report from that probe, which ended in 2013, cited emails, memos and other materials obtained by Texas in concluding that Google had in fact put its rivals at a disadvantage.</p><p>In the end, though, the FTC opted against issuing steep penalties targeting the company's search practices, sparking widespread criticism that the federal government had failed to capitalize on the evidence trove that Texas helped amass.</p><p>Gary Reback, a lawyer at the firm Carr &amp; Ferrell and a longtime Google foe, said the documents at the time showed that Google had \"jimmied their normal algorithm to demote certain sites.\" It's hard to \"generalize\" from one investigation to another, he cautioned, \"but what we do know is the Texas attorney general can be effective in getting the kind of information that might lead to government action.\"</p><p>The timing of the states' latest investigation - and the optics of their announcement - triggered some criticism that the attorneys general are hoping to leverage their work for political gain. The Competitive Enterprise Institute, an advocacy group that opposes antitrust law and has received contributions from Google, blasted the probe in September as an exercise that would \"benefit state AGs' political ambitions, but impose harmful costs on consumers, businesses, and the economy.\"</p><p>Paxton, in particular, has issued at least two emails to supporters through his campaign, including an Oct. 2 note that said he needed donations of $25 or more to \"fight Google's dominance over so much of our lives,\" including its effects on publishers.</p><p>As such scrutiny intensifies, Paxton and his team cautioned that they're at the beginning, not the end, of the investigation. With Google, in particular, \"a lot of people just didn't understand the model\" until recently, he said. \"The way it's been done, it's been hard to get a grip on what's going on behind the scenes.\"</p><p>While he said that the broad, national participation reflects the seriousness of states' concerns, Paxton stressed that they hadn't reached \"any kind of conclusion, there's so much we don't know.\"</p><p>\"Whatever that leads to,\" he added, \"it leads to.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tony.romm@washpost.com\">tony.romm@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-2167e790e9e311e985c085a098e47b37</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7B-DG41-JCDY-T0MJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1931\"/><timeReceived>2:47 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 9, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The Lone Star State's Republican attorney general says he rarely even uses the company's widely popular search engine, opting instead for rival services, because he has \"always been concerned about tracking.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But Paxton these days is more than a sideline skeptic: As one of the country's most powerful law enforcement officials, he's forging ahead with a landmark investigation of Google's decades-long dominance of the Web, armed with the help of 50 other attorneys general, a stable of savvy experts that includes Google's past foes and a feeling that Washington for too long has turned a blind eye to some of Silicon Valley's most troubling practices.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For now, the investigation, which Paxton and his peers announced in September, focuses on online advertising, responding to complaints that Google puts consumers and competitors at a disadvantage by controlling the exchanges where ads are bought and some of the most popular websites where they're sold. It could result in tough punishments, Paxton signaled, if investigators determine that Google broke the law.</p><p>\"We're prepared for whatever the right thing to do is for consumers,\" he said during an interview with The Washington Post in his office in the Texas capital. Whether it's standing down or forcing Google to sell off parts of itself, Paxton stressed, \"all of that's on the table based on what we learn.\"</p><p>The probe marks the first major U.S. antitrust action against Google in about a decade, after Texas joined other states and the federal government in scrutinizing the company's search engine in a competition probe that ended without major punishment for the tech giant.</p><p>Since then, Paxton said, Washington has failed to pursue signs that Google and Silicon Valley are breaking federal law. \"Antitrust seems like it hasn't been focused on for decades, through several administrations, not just Democrats but also Republicans,\" he said, adding, \"I think this should have been looked at sooner.\"</p><p>The result is a significant legal and political challenge on the horizon for Google and its executives: bipartisan in nature and born out of a belief that the tech industry has escaped government accountability for too long. Paxton and his team have said nothing is off limits - words that threaten a broad review of Google's business in a way that could reshape not only the company but the rest of Silicon Valley.</p><p>\"If we end up learning things that lead us in other directions, we'll certainly bring those back to the states and talk about whether we expand into other areas,\" Paxton said.</p><p>Google declined to comment.</p><p>Overseeing an office with nearly 800 lawyers, Paxton emerged this year as a convening force in the sort of antitrust probe that's long been sought by Democratic and Republican attorneys general alike. Eight states, including Arizona, Nebraska and North Carolina, are helping to steer the probe as part of an executive committee, but it's Texas that started the legal action by sending a legal demand with hundreds of questions to Google on behalf of the group.</p><p>It is not the only probe of the tech giant underway: Justice Department investigators also are homing in on Google and its lucrative ad empire, and they sent their own battery of questions to the company this summer. Members of Congress similarly are targeting Google and other tech giants as part of a sweeping review of federal antitrust laws. And European regulators continue to scrutinize Google and its search, ad and smartphone practices, having already slapped it with roughly $9 billion in antitrust fines over the past three years.</p><p>For state attorneys general in the United States, the driving question comes down to dollars, Paxton said. Ads targeted to people's browsing behavior are Google's lifeblood, accounting for much of the company's roughly $117 billion in revenue last year, according to its financial statements. That puts Google in the pole position in the United States, where it takes in about 37 percent of all digital advertising revenue, according to eMarketer data from February. In search, Google captures even more - 74 percent - of the market, the firm computes.</p><p>Ads provide financial fuel for Google's popular, free services, such as search, email and mapping, as well as its more audacious gambits, including self-driving cars. Paxton acknowledged that these products are widely liked around the world, even if he personally doesn't use all of them regularly. But the attorney general stressed that Google's dominance of the ad industry still has stifled the Internet.</p><p>\"Consumers may feel really good about having free searches, but the reality is nothing's free. And if there's no competition on the Internet for advertising, then consumers, unbeknownst to them, are paying much higher costs for products than they otherwise should,\" he said.</p><p>Google has sought to tell a different story about its business. Appearing on Capitol Hill in July, Adam Cohen, Google's director of economic policy, said that Internet advertising is cheaper and more effective than ever before. \"We have created new competition in many sectors, and new competitive pressures often lead to concerns from rivals,\" he said in testimony. \"We have consistently shown how our business is designed and operated to benefit our customers.\"</p><p>But Paxton said state investigators have heard from a torrent of competitors, particularly in the publishing industry, that say they cannot compete with Google's scale, meaning they lose out on revenue that might fund their content or services.</p><p>The vocal opponents include some of Google's longtime foes, such as News Corp., according to two Texas officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations in the probe. The Rupert Murdoch-backed empire previously has complained to antitrust regulators in Europe, Australia and elsewhere that Google's ad dominance results in fewer dollars for publishers, and News Corp. has at times gone so far as to call for the tech giant to be broken up.</p><p>A spokesman for News Corp., James Kennedy, declined to comment on the company's interactions with Texas. But he said in a statement, \"Our position regarding Google's damaging anti-competitive behavior and existential threat to journalism has been made clear over the years.\"</p><p>In probing those allegations, Paxton and his attorney general allies have turned to one of News Corp.'s past advisers. Among the experts the state has retained is Cristina Caffarra, who has assisted News Corp. and other Google foes on antitrust issues. A competition expert and economist at the consulting firm Charles River Associates, Caffarra has deep experience in Brussels, where Google has been repeatedly fined for competition violations. In those cases, including a recent decision finding that Google's Android phone violated regional competition laws, Caffarra has supplied considerable economic evidence in opposition to Google's practices.</p><p>Caffarra also has worked on behalf of other Google foes, including helping the Russian search engine Yandex with its complaint in Moscow and the European Union about Google's business practices, she's indicated in public reports. She declined to comment on her role in the states' probe, other than to say she is not working for a corporate client that's opposing Google currently. But her participation in the states' effort took center stage in September, when she appeared alongside more than a dozen attorneys general when they announced their plans from the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court.</p><p>For Google, the states' probe could easily broaden beyond its ad business and its effects on publishers. Democratic and Republican attorneys general long have criticized the company for the way it collects users' data and displays its search results, for example, along with the means by which it has piloted Android to become the world's most widely used smartphone operating system. Some state officials raised these issues when they announced their ads probe in September.</p><p>Paxton's office has additional concerns of its own: Texas is in the early stages of a consumer-protection investigation focused on allegations that Google makes decisions about the content it displays and suppresses that are biased against conservatives. Jeff Mateer, Paxton's first assistant attorney general, confirmed the state's interest last week, four months after he said at a conference in Omaha that big tech should be \"held accountable\" if the industry misrepresents its political neutrality. Google has denied charges that it is politically biased.</p><p>Texas has long been troubled by Google's behavior. Nine years ago, it became one of the first to embark on an antitrust investigation of Google when it opened a probe into the way the company presents search results. Paxton's predecessor, Greg Abbott, now the state's governor, sought to determine whether Google demoted competing services, such as shopping-comparison sites, that rivaled its own offerings, violating a principle that Texas called \"search neutrality.\"</p><p>Texas issued some of the initial orders demanding key documents from Google, at one point going to court to battle the company over access to information. The answers the state obtained ultimately appeared to influence some of the thinking at the Federal Trade Commission, which assumed the role of Google's chief investigator in the United States. An inadvertently released staff report from that probe, which ended in 2013, cited emails, memos and other materials obtained by Texas in concluding that Google had in fact put its rivals at a disadvantage.</p><p>In the end, though, the FTC opted against issuing steep penalties targeting the company's search practices, sparking widespread criticism that the federal government had failed to capitalize on the evidence trove that Texas helped amass.</p><p>Gary Reback, a lawyer at the firm Carr &amp; Ferrell and a longtime Google foe, said the documents at the time showed that Google had \"jimmied their normal algorithm to demote certain sites.\" It's hard to \"generalize\" from one investigation to another, he cautioned, \"but what we do know is the Texas attorney general can be effective in getting the kind of information that might lead to government action.\"</p><p>The timing of the states' latest investigation - and the optics of their announcement - triggered some criticism that the attorneys general are hoping to leverage their work for political gain. The Competitive Enterprise Institute, an advocacy group that opposes antitrust law and has received contributions from Google, blasted the probe in September as an exercise that would \"benefit state AGs' political ambitions, but impose harmful costs on consumers, businesses, and the economy.\"</p><p>Paxton, in particular, has issued at least two emails to supporters through his campaign, including an Oct. 2 note that said he needed donations of $25 or more to \"fight Google's dominance over so much of our lives,\" including its effects on publishers.</p><p>As such scrutiny intensifies, Paxton and his team cautioned that they're at the beginning, not the end, of the investigation. With Google, in particular, \"a lot of people just didn't understand the model\" until recently, he said. \"The way it's been done, it's been hard to get a grip on what's going on behind the scenes.\"</p><p>While he said that the broad, national participation reflects the seriousness of states' concerns, Paxton stressed that they hadn't reached \"any kind of conclusion, there's so much we don't know.\"</p><p>\"Whatever that leads to,\" he added, \"it leads to.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tony.romm@washpost.com\">tony.romm@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-2167e790-e9e3-11e9-85c0-85a098e47b37</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7B-J9V1-DXXY-3360-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1929\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Suburban Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 9, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It is a bet that the app can introduce a new generation of users to the Silicon Valley giant's ever-expanding social media universe. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  In doing so, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>immediately reignited a furious debate about how young is too young for children to use mobile apps and how parents should deal with the steady creep of technology into family life, especially as some fight to reduce the amount of time their sons and daughters spend in front of screens. On one side are parents like Matt Quirion of Washington, who said <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>snaking its way into his children's lives at an early age would most likely do more harm than good.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  ''I'm an avid social media user, but I don't feel my kids need more social interaction,'' said Mr. Quirion, 39, whose three children are between ages 3 and 9. ''They need their personal time to process all the social interaction and learn to grow into mature people.''</p><p>  Just as vocal are parents like Parker Thompson of Alameda, Calif., who said children's adoption of technology is an inevitability and who appreciated <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>approach with the new app.</p><p>  ''Today, much of the time our options come down to giving kids devices and trusting things will work out, watching them closely at all times, or banning technology,'' said Mr. Thompson, 38, a father of three children between 6 months to 8 years old. ''Tech is going to be something kids adopt. The question is how this will happen.''</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>official entry into the children's market is a watershed moment both for families and for the social network. Preteens and teenagers already flock to YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat and Musical.ly, general interest sites whose policies state that they are not for use by children under 13. Preteens are also avid senders of text messages.</p><p>  But only a handful of messaging and social apps -- like Kudos, a photo-sharing app -- are designed for younger children to use with parental permission and supervision. That's because of a federal law, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, known as Coppa, which requires services aimed at children to obtain verifiable parental consent before collecting, using or disclosing personal information from a child under 13 -- like photos, videos, voice recordings, location, contact information and names.</p><p>  Until this year, even big tech companies had been loath to set up children's sites with a parental consent system lest they violate the law. In 2011, for example, an operator of virtual worlds that had been acquired by the Walt Disney Company agreed to pay $3 million to settle Federal Trade Commission charges that it illegally collected and disclosed personal information from children under 13 without parents' consent.</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>said the point of Messenger Kids was to provide a more controlled environment for the types of activity that were already occurring across smartphones and tablets among family members. The company said it had spent months talking to parenting groups, child behavioral experts and safety organizations to aid in developing the app, as well as thousands of hours interviewing families on the ways that members communicate with one another. The app is compliant with Coppa, it added.</p><p>  ''Right now for kids, the time they spend on devices is very passive,'' said David Marcus, vice president of messaging products at <person><nameText>Facebook. </nameText></person>''It's not really a device that helps you connect with others close to them.''</p><p>  Messenger Kids is built so that children do not sign up for new <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>accounts themselves; <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>terms of service require that users be 13 or older. The app requires an adult with a <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>account to set up the app for his or her child. After adults enter their <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>account information into the app, they are asked to create the child's profile and which friends or relatives he or she will be allowed to connect with on Messenger. Every additional friend request requires approval by the parent.</p><p>  The app is fairly limited in scope, allowing for text and video chat, as well as sending photos. As with Instagram, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>or Snapchat, children can add filters or playful drawings to the photos they send.</p><p>  Loren Cheng, product director for Messenger Kids, said <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>would not use for marketing purposes the details it collected from children. He also said the company would not automatically convert children's accounts to adult accounts when they turned 13.</p><p>  The app, which will be in a preview release on Apple's iOS devices before rolling out to a wider audience in the coming months, is <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>latest effort to increase the number of people who rely on its service to connect with one another regularly. More than two billion people use <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>every month, while its other apps, like Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram, also have billions of users.</p><p>  If Messenger Kids proves popular, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>may reap many benefits. The company could see increased messaging activity and more engaged, regularly returning users, not to mention insights and data on how families interact on Messenger.</p><p>  Some children's and privacy groups commended <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>for saying that Messenger Kids would give parents control over children's messaging and not show ads to children. But they also described Messenger Kids as a marketing effort to increase consumer loyalty.</p><p>  ''This is an attempt to create a feature that will help <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>win over young people and keep their parents tied to the site,'' said Jeffrey Chester, the executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a privacy and children's advocacy group in Washington. ''With YouTube monetizing the youngest children, it's too lucrative a market for <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>to overlook -- plus the company is losing youth market share to Snapchat.''</p><p>  Others cautioned that the app raised concerns about children's privacy.</p><p>  According to Messenger Kids' privacy policy, the app collects registration details from parents such as children's full names. It also collects the texts, audio and videos children send, as well as information about whom the child interacts with on the service, what features they use and how long the children use them.</p><p>  The privacy policy also says that ''Messenger Kids is part of <person><nameText>Facebook</nameText></person>'' and that the company may share information collected in the app with other <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>services. While parents can delete their children's Messenger Kids accounts, the policy says, the messages and content that a child sent to and received from others ''may remain visible to those users.''</p><p>  James Steyer, the chief executive of Common Sense Media, a children's media ratings and advocacy group, said European regulators had previously fined <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>for reneging on privacy commitments. Given that history, he suggested that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>make a public and permanent commitment to keeping Messenger Kids free of advertising and to not using the app to prime children for grown-up accounts later.</p><p>  ''Why should parents simply trust that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>is acting in the best interest of children?'' Mr. Steyer asked.</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>can ill afford more controversies. The company has been in the cross hairs of Congress over the role it played in the 2016 presidential election, with the spread of fake news and divisive content on all of its platforms. The company has said more than 150 million people across <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and Instagram could have seen content linked to Russian agencies.</p><p>  Still, the company said that issue was largely separate from Messenger. <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>said its overall mission remained centered on bringing the world closer together.</p><p>  ''We can't let the current state of things prevent us from doing our jobs, which is to solve real problems in people's lives,'' Mr. Marcus, the head of Messenger at <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>said.</p><p>  Mark Zuckerberg, <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>chief executive, did not weigh in on the start of Messenger Kids. Over the weekend, Mr. Zuckerberg, whose second child was born over the summer, posted on <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>that he was going on paternity leave.</p><p>  Follow Mike Isaac and Natasha Singer on Twitter: @MikeIsaac and @natashanyt.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>Messenger Kids app is fairly limited in scope, allowing for text and video chat, as well as sending photos.

Legislators and regulators often set their sights on the likes of Facebook, Amazon, and Google out of concern about their market power.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Cengage isn't quite a household name. But critics are lumping in the Boston textbook publisher with the giants. And that could spell trouble for its game-changing merger with a similarly sized rival, McGraw-Hill.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Case in point: The Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition, a group funded by university libraries, sent a letter to the Department of Justice this week urging the agency's antitrust division to block the merger.</p><p>The letter focuses on how much of the college textbook market the combined company will control once the merger is complete. (The company will be called McGraw Hill, the better-known name, but will drop the hyphen.) By SPARC's estimates, the combined company will control 45 percent of the US market, compared to 40 percent for the current No. 1, Pearson \u2014 resulting in a textbook duopoly. That wouldn't leave much room for smaller players.</p><p>SPARC also raises the specter of a \"potentially enormous data empire,\" because so much of the materials are digital now. The Facebook bogeyman rears its head.</p><p>The situation vexes Cengage chief executive Michael Hansen, whose company just moved into fancy new digs on the South Boston waterfront two months ago. Hansen, who would lead the combined company after the deal closes in early 2020, bills his merger-of-equals as a way to help make texts more accessible to students. The May 1 press release announcing the combination of the two private-equity-owned publishers is littered with references to affordability.</p><p>Although Hansen notes that per-student textbook spending has dropped in recent years, he knows texts remain out of reach for many students. That's one reason, he says, why Cengage developed an all-you-can read plan for $120 a semester or $180 a year. Think of Cengage Unlimited like a Netflix for textbooks. Launched a year ago, more than 1 million students have signed up. The industry, he says, desperately needs more innovation, an easier accomplishment in a bigger company with beefed-up resources.</p><p>Hansen also says the market is \"hugely fragmented\" if secondhand sales, rentals, and digital options are considered. And he took umbrage with the data-mining critique: Cengage, he says, doesn't sell data to third parties, and only uses the information it collects to help improve its products.\u00a0</p><p>Still, the amount of student information in the hands of digital publishers has raised concerns in Congress. Earlier this week, US Senators Dick Durbin, Ed Markey, and Richard Blumenthal sent letters to dozens of \"EdTech\" businesses, including Cengage and McGraw-Hill, seeking more information about their data collection and protection practices.</p><p>The digital shift raises another concern: an increasing use of access codes to lock down digital versions of their products. The goal, critics say, is to prevent material from being resold on the secondary market, the way physical textbooks are now.</p><p>Robert Lande, a University of Baltimore law professor helping SPARC on a pro bono basis, says he doesn't think Cengage and McGraw-Hill can divest enough book lines to satisfy antitrust concerns; the combined company would still be too powerful. If the merger isn't stopped, he says, prices would inevitably go up, and choices would go down. The apocalyptic scenario he paints: Five years from now, we're left with two huge companies, and essentially no used market for texts.</p><p>The merger announcement rang alarm bells at the U.S. PIRG's offices. Kaitlyn Vitez, the activist group's higher ed campaign director, says she worked with her legal team and the Open Markets Institute to craft a letter to the Department of Justice complaining about practices like automatic billing and access codes that expire. The textbook market is broken, she says, but this deal will make it worse. With PIRG's help, student leaders at a few universities also called for the merger to be stopped.</p><p>Regardless of the outcome, the entire episode could provide a valuable lesson in antitrust laws and how they apply in a digital age \u2014 the kind of lesson that might make it into a textbook someday.</p><p>Jon Chesto can be reached at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:jon.chesto@globe.com\">jon.chesto@globe.com</email> Follow him on Twitter @jonchesto.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BGLOBE-b7ed2f52-bed9-11e9-9f72-fd267e6f171a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BGLOBE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WV2-PY51-JC2G-C51B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8110</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"753\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Boston Globe</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 17, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0009YJ9</classCode><className>CENGAGE LEARNING INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC0002L5Z</classCode><className>S&amp;P GLOBAL INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>SIC2731 BOOKS: PUBLISHING, OR PUBLISHING &amp;

In that event, I emphasized that the Bank of Thailand's financial sector policy focused on improvements in three key areas: productivity, inclusivity, and immunity. In order to uplift our economy's competitiveness and the standard of living of the people, financial technology will be instrumental in helping us meet these three objectives. It is this strategic direction that has guided our approach to the digitalization of Thailand's payment system and set the stage for many ongoing FinTech developments today. These three objectives of productivity, inclusivity, and immunity will continue to guide our financial sector policy in the world of digital finance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since the First Bangkok FinTech Fair was held here in March 2018, we have witnessed a remarkable progress in advancing digital financial services and creating foundations needed to digitally transform our financial system. Let me highlight some of them:</p><p>Almost 50 million IDs are now linked to bank accounts via PromptPay, and the number of merchants accepting payments via standardized Thai QR code has reached 5 million. The number of electronic payment transactions increased from only 440 million transactions per month a year and a half ago to almost 700 million transactions in May of 2019. Many value-added digital payment services have been developed on top of our faster pay infrastructure to meet the needs of digital economy. The Thailand Blockchain Community Initiative, with 22 financial institutions participating, has started executing electronic letters of guarantee through blockchain, one of the very first to do so in the world. Many cross-border payment platforms were introduced to lower the cost of international fund transfers and improve financial connectivity in ASEAN, many of which will be showcased here throughout our two-day event. Project Inthanon, our central bank digital currency, has completed its second phase, and is recognized as a leading central bank digital currency initiative. You will also hear more about Project Inthanon and other central bank digital currency initiatives later on today. Lastly, a number of laws and regulations were introduced to facilitate digital payment and digital finance, including the new Payment Act, the Electronic Transaction Act, Digital Asset Law, as well as regulations on peer-to-peer lending platforms. These developments are results of our shared visions and collaborative efforts undertaken by all stakeholders to advance our digital finance ecosystem. These include Thai banks' aim to reduce cash usage and payment cost, leading to collective investment in the new faster pay infrastructure; banks' and non-banks' leveraging on the interoperability of our open infrastructure and common standards to compete and expand the range of products and services; and regulators' and policy agencies' active roles in promoting financial innovations and digital adoption.</p><p>FinTech and digital finance have been and will continue to be among the top policy agenda of the Bank of Thailand. We need to further develop digital finance infrastructure, promote innovation, enable dynamic competition, and enhance adoption by the Thai people and businesses.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>While technology advancement and technology adoption will remain crucial, there is another important aspect of financial services that we must not forget as we move on with our FinTech agenda: the value of financial network.</p><p>Unlike other products and services, financial services will serve the people and the society best only when money-either in the form of physical cash or digital money-can freely flow without cost and friction. In today's digital world, it is equally important that individuals and society can benefit from financial transaction data. Therefore, preserving and strengthening the value of financial network will be imperative in advancing the development of our financial system.</p><p>On the opposite end of a strong financial network is fragmentation, whereby financial systems and payment services become fragmented by the use of different core infrastructures or different standards that are controlled by a few dominant players. With different standards and core systems, financial transactions and data flows will face frictions, which will discourage competition, collaboration, and innovation. In the world of Big Tech, strengthening the value of our financial network is critical for a small economy like Thailand, and it needs to be done so that our network remains dynamic and efficient, fostering an ecosystem conducive to innovation and competition. The nature of financial services requires that we emphasize on strengthening the value-added of our financial network. Therefore, the transformation towards digital finance cannot be efforts of individual firms alone, and we need to focus on creating the digital finance ecosystem with active collaboration from a wide range of stakeholders.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Today I would like to take this opportunity to highlight four important principles that have underpinned our recent developments and will continue to guide our FinTech agenda. These are principles that will strengthen the value of our financial network and develop our digital finance ecosystem.</p><p>The first principle is the open architecture framework. Important infrastructure must be made open, allowing both old and new market participants to easily connect as long as they meet the required security standards, appropriately share the cost of development and maintenance, and do not pose financial stability risks. The open architecture framework will level the playing field and eliminate barrier to entry for new players who often enter the market with innovations.</p><p>The second principle is interoperability of systems. Because every financial service provider is different and they might operate on different systems, we need to make sure that these different systems can communicate, that money and data can flow among them-in other words, that they are interoperable. And this is where standards come in. Common standards-be they for data structure, QR code payment, or biometric authentication-would allow us to benefit from competition between systems, while ensure that the competing systems are interoperable, and the financial network as a whole does not become fragmented. The concept of interoperability can also be extended internationally, as we have seen in the case of cross-border QR codes for payment in ASEAN.</p><p>The third principle is creating the right incentive structure. Ensuring that both service providers and customers benefit from any given financial technology and digital financial services is critical for the adoption, the continued development, and ultimately the sustainability of those innovative financial services. In addition to convenience and pricing, an important aspect that would incentivize customers to adopt digital financial services is the confidence in digital finance. Customers need to be safeguarded against technology-related risks. A desirable incentive structure must also be able to limit distortion of market power, especially by dominant market powers who could undermine ongoing competition, and hence innovation. Making sure that our digital finance ecosystem has the right incentive structure will provide a foundation for wide adoption by customers, ongoing innovation and upgrade of services by financial service providers, and market access among new innovative players.</p><p>The fourth principle is creating regulatory framework that promotes agility and innovation while preserving financial stability. Regulators must continually review and ensure that their governing frameworks remain relevant in the context of the fast-changing digital world. Outdated and inflexible laws and regulations need to be amended accordingly. With the advancement of technology, financial innovations usually start off small and scale up quickly. Regulators must therefore keep in mind the concept of proportionality, allowing themselves to be more tolerant towards low-risk financial activities and more scrutinizing towards activities that might pose risks to the financial system.</p><p>We also need to keep in mind that financial products and activities are expanding across jurisdiction of different agencies. Regulatory framework must shift from entity-based regulations, which have formed the core of our regulatory framework, to activity-based ones.</p><p>Most importantly, the regulations must be agile and able to adapt to the ever-changing environment of the digital world. To give you an example, our regulatory sandbox scheme that was introduced less than two years ago might be too slow and out of sync with market requirements today. In response, we have decided to allow financial institutions to develop their own sandbox and move from the approval concept to registration concept, with a view to reducing time-to-market and increasing flexibility for innovation and investments. We have also amended our regulations governing banks' IT-related services with the aim to facilitating partnerships between banks and tech companies, and enhancing connectivity between banks and the digital world.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>It is my firm belief that these four guiding principles will be key to building a sustainable digital finance ecosystem that will strengthen the value of our financial network-the network that will eventually lead to a better society through improvements in productivity, inclusivity, and immunity. In doing this, close collaboration among key stakeholders within our financial system is crucial. And this is why Collaboration for the Future of Finance has been selected as the theme for the 2019 Bangkok FinTech Fair.</p><p>The 2019 Bangkok Fintech Fair presents an exciting venue for stakeholders to learn from leaders of financial innovation on different aspects of collaboration-from the art of multiple-stakeholder engagement to the various types of partnership. The panel discussions will highlight how collaboration can help benefit customer experience, improve financial inclusion, and advance competitiveness of our digital finance ecosystem. You will also learn of many exciting new innovations from the Technology Talk room, the ASEAN FinTech Connectivity room, as well as booth presentations throughout our venue.</p><p>I would like to thank our speakers, participants, and the audience for your presence at the 2019 Bangkok Fintech Fair. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank our partners and the Bank of Thailand staff for their tremendous and tireless efforts in organizing this event.</p><p>The Bank of Thailand looks forward to working closely with all of you to create the digital finance ecosystem in Thailand and ASEAN that encourages innovation and close collaboration among stakeholders.</p><p>Thank you very much for your participation. I wish you a productive and joyful conference ahead.</p><p>(Bank of Thailand)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMJ-PD61-DXMS-8274-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1858\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 22, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"/><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST00632417</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DM8Y</classCode><className>BUSINESS NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N521100MM</classCode><className>CENTRAL BANKS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D17D</classCode><className>NEWS BRIEFS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009SVL</classCode><className>BANKING &amp;

nitf:lede=\"true\"> June 12 -- Thailand on Tuesday approved a draft bill requiring foreign digital service providers to pay a value-added tax (VAT), becoming the latest country in Southeast Asia to seek to boost tax revenues from international tech companies.\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>Last month, Indonesia passed a law requiring big internet companies to pay VAT on sales of digital products and services from July, and in the Philippines a lawmaker introduced a similar bill in parliament to tax digital services.</p><p><br/>The Thai bill, which still has to be voted on by Thailand's parliament, requires non-resident companies or platforms that earn more than 1.8 million baht ($57,434.59) per year from providing digital services in the country to pay a 7 percent VAT on sales, deputy government spokeswoman Ratchada Thanadirek told reporters.<br/>Thailand is expected to add about 3 billion baht ($95.72 million) to its coffers annually from the move, which will affect services such as music and video streaming, gaming, and hotel booking, she added, without naming any companies.<br/>Thailand, Southeast Asia's second-largest economy, has mulled taxing digital businesses for years, hoping to tap the country's internet economy, one of the fastest growing in the region.<br/>Thanawat Malabuppha, president of the Thai e-Commerce Association, told Reuters he welcomed the move, as it will help level the playing field for rival Thai businesses.<br/>\"Anyone who makes money from Thai people should pay taxes to the country,\" he said.<br/>Analysts say the COVID-19 pandemic has accentuated a push by governments around the world to tax internet companies, who could see a boost in revenues as people stay at home during global lockdowns.<br/>Nearly 140 countries from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) are negotiating the first major rewriting of tax rules to take better account of the rise of big tech companies such as Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Google.<br/>Southeast Asian regulators held talks last year on a region-wide effort to tax tech giants more, while industry groups have warned that over-regulation could blunt the region's booming digital economy.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

nitf:lede=\"true\"> June 12 -- Thailand on Tuesday approved a draft bill requiring foreign digital service providers to pay a value-added tax (VAT), becoming the latest country in Southeast Asia to seek to boost tax revenues from international tech companies.\u00a0Last month, Indonesia passed a law requiring big internet companies to pay VAT on sales of digital products and services from July, and in the Philippines a lawmaker introduced a similar bill in parliament to tax digital services.\u00a0The Thai bill, which still has to be voted on by Thailand's parliament, requires non-resident companies or platforms that earn more than 1.8 million baht ($57,434.59) per year from providing digital services in the country to pay a 7% VAT on sales, deputy government spokeswoman Ratchada Thanadirek told reporters.\u00a0Thailand is expected to add about 3 billion baht ($95.72 million) to its coffers annually from the move, which will affect services such as music and video streaming, gaming, and hotel booking, she added, without naming any companies.\u00a0\"These businesses would've had to pay VAT if they had been Thai, which is unfair,\" Ratchada said.\u00a0Thailand, Southeast Asia's second-largest economy, has mulled taxing digital businesses for years, hoping to tap the country's internet economy, one of the fastest growing in the region.\u00a0Thanawat Malabuppha, president of the Thai e-Commerce Association, told Reuters he welcomed the move, as it will help level the playing field for rival Thai businesses.\u00a0</p><p><br/>\u00a0<br/>\"Anyone who makes money from Thai people should pay taxes to the country,\" he said.\u00a0<br/>Analysts say the COVID-19 pandemic has accentuated a push by governments around the world to tax internet companies, who could see a boost in revenues as people stay at home during global lockdowns.\u00a0<br/>Nearly 140 countries from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) are negotiating the first major rewriting of tax rules to take better account of the rise of big tech companies such as Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Google.\u00a0<br/>Southeast Asian regulators held talks last year on a

Last month, Indonesia passed a law requiring big internet companies to pay VAT on sales of digital products and services from July, and in the Philippines a lawmaker introduced a similar bill in parliament to tax digital services. The Thai bill, which still has to be voted on by Thailand's parliament, requires non-resident companies or platforms that earn more than 1.8 million baht (US$57,434.59) per year from providing digital services in the country to pay a 7per cent VAT on sales, deputy government spokeswoman Ratchada Thanadirek told reporters. </p><p>Thailand is expected to add about 3 billion baht (US$95.72 million) to its coffers annually from the move, which will affect services such as music and video streaming, gaming, and hotel booking, she added, without naming any companies. \"These businesses would've had to pay VAT if they had been Thai, which is unfair,\" Ratchada said. Thailand, Southeast Asia's second-largest economy, has mulled taxing digital businesses for years, hoping to tap the country's internet economy, one of the fastest growing in the region. Thanawat Malabuppha, president of the Thai e-Commerce Association, told Reuters he welcomed the move, as it will help level the playing field for rival Thai businesses. \"Anyone who makes money from Thai people should pay taxes to the country,\" he said. Analysts say the COVID-19 pandemic has accentuated a push by governments around the world to tax internet companies, who could see a boost in revenues as people stay at home during global lockdowns. Nearly 140 countries from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) are negotiating the first major rewriting of tax rules to take better account of the rise of big tech companies such as Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Google. Southeast Asian regulators held talks last year on a region-wide effort to tax tech giants more, while industry groups have warned that over-regulation could blunt the region's booming digital economy.

value-added tax (VAT), becoming the latest country in Southeast Asia to seek to boost tax revenues from international tech companies, Trend reports with reference to Reuters.</p><p>Last month, Indonesia passed a law requiring big internet companies to pay VAT on sales of digital products and services from July, and in the Philippines a lawmaker introduced a similar bill in parliament to tax digital services.</p><p>The Thai bill, which still has to be voted on by Thailand's parliament, requires non-resident companies or platforms that earn more than 1.8 million baht ($57,434.59) per year from providing digital services in the country to pay a 7% VAT on sales, deputy government spokeswoman Ratchada Thanadirek told reporters.</p><p>Thailand is expected to add about 3 billion baht ($95.72 million) to its coffers annually from the move, which will affect services such as music and video streaming, gaming, and hotel booking, she added, without naming any companies.</p><p>\"These businesses would've had to pay VAT if they had been Thai, which is unfair,\" Ratchada said.</p><p>Thailand, Southeast Asia's second-largest economy, has mulled taxing digital businesses for years, hoping to tap the country's internet economy, one of the fastest growing in the region.</p><p>Thanawat Malabuppha, president of the Thai e-Commerce Association, told Reuters he welcomed the move, as it will help level the playing field for rival Thai businesses.</p><p>\"Anyone who makes money from Thai people should pay taxes to the country,\" he said.</p><p>Analysts say the COVID-19 pandemic has accentuated a push by governments around the world to tax internet companies, who could see a boost in revenues as people stay at home during global lockdowns.</p><p>Nearly 140 countries from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) are negotiating the first major rewriting of tax rules to take better account of the rise of big tech companies such as Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Google.</p><p>Southeast Asian regulators held talks last year on a region-wide effort to tax tech giants more, while industry groups have warned that over-regulation could blunt the region's booming digital economy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

This forum presents a great opportunity for business leaders and policymakers to exchange thoughts on how this vibrant region fits in the picture of the new world, and how we could prepare ourselves to become the new value chain hub.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's great to hear of all the progress that has been made, both within ASEAN and more specifically within the CLMVT region, and to see ways we could collaborate to build up regional value chains that would become the new value chain hub of Asia, which is very fittingly the theme for this year's meeting.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">My talk today is supposed to be an Inspirational Talk, but I doubt very much that a conservative central banker will be able to inspire business leaders like yourselves.</p><p>I'd like to take on this year's theme from another angle, and instead paint a picture of what the new form of value chain might look like, 5 or 10 years from now. How will the nature of the future value chains change? How will the technological advancement transform the value chains in this region?</p><p>I intend for this talk to inspire us to really start thinking about what the future might bring, and what we can do to be ready for it. In my talk today, I'll highlight 3-4-5: three driving factors behind the changes we see, four key implications these driving factors bring, and five steps moving forward.</p><p>Let me start with the first driving factor: the growth of the CLMVT region. With each passing year, the gap between the so-called advanced economies and emerging markets are closing, and our region is catching up very fast.</p><p>As people get wealthier, they consume more. We have already seen this happening. Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s up to the GFC, the share of imported consumption goods into the CLMVT region had been steady at around 0.7 percent of world imports. Over the past decade, this share more than doubled to 1.6 percent of world imports. Consequently, we can expect domestic consumption in CLMVT to be an important driving force for the value chain going forward. Not only consumption volume will increase with per capita income, types of products consumed, together with their quality and diversity will also improve. CLMVT will soon become an important and high potential market within ASEAN. The other important aspect that will go up in conjunction with the standard of living is rising wages. Soon, we will not be able to rely on low labor cost as the source of comparative advantage.</p><p>The second driving force shaping the new form of value chains is the rapid advancements in technology. Automation is on its way to replace low-skilled and semi-skilled manufacturing jobs, making it much harder for a country to be competitive with low wages alone. While the use of robots in factories in the '70s were limited to precision tasks in a controlled environment, artificial intelligence and machine learning have expanded the roles of robots in the manufacturing world.</p><p>I'll give you an example. In one egg farm in China, it takes only one employee to oversee 170,000 hens. A traditional farm would have to employ at least 170 employees. Machines do all the collecting and sorting of eggs. Sensors could be trained to spot sick or dead hens and alert the controller so he could take appropriate actions.</p><p>Humanless warehouses are also becoming more prevalent, and some e-commerce giants are trying to go further: Amazon is exploring automated delivery systems, and China's JD.com is looking to automate the entire process, starting from shipping containers.</p><p>Technological advancements have also made many non-tradable services tradable. While what we generally think of when talking about tradable service is a tech support call center or business process outsourcing, we have moved a long way from that. Today, tradable services include product designs, entertainment, and even medical services. The first 5G-enabled remote surgery was done in Spain earlier this year. As services become more tradable, the concept of borders between products and borders between nations starts to fade away.</p><p>The third driving force that I would like to highlight is increasing geopolitical tensions. While technological advancements are slowly erasing the borders between countries and making people more connected than ever, an opposing force-the increasing and prolonged geopolitical tensions among major countries-is also at work.</p><p>Perhaps no tension has been getting as much attention as the ongoing trade conflict between the US and China, but this is just one of the many ongoing tensions around the world. Think about the more recent US-Iran tensions as well as other conflicts in the Middle East, India-Pakistan tensions, the highly uncertain outcome of Brexit, the unresolved nuclear situation in the Korean Peninsula, disputes in the South China Sea, and domestic political instability in various parts of the world. These tensions introduce new type of risks into the design of value chains-risks whose premiums are difficult to evaluate. Regardless of whether these tensions are prolonged or short-lived, they will have real effects on trade and investment patterns. Trade diversion, production relocation, and investment decisions driven by geopolitical pressure today will have a long-run effect in dictating the shape of our future value chains.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>The growth of emerging market economies and the CLMVT in particular, technological advancements, and prolonged geopolitical tensions... What implications do these key driving forces have on the new form of value chains? I would like to highlight four key movements that we will see in the coming years.</p><p>The first movement is the regional consolidation of goods-producing supply chains: goods will be traded more with our own neighbors and countries in our region rather than with some far-off countries.</p><p>Even though it was masked by the Global Financial Crisis, the offshoring movement is said to have ended a decade ago. Over the past decade, the share of goods produced in the world that are exported through value chains declined from 28 percent to 22 percent. Robotization and automation made cheap labor less relevant when companies decide where to place production. A recent study done by McKinsey Global Institute has found that, contrary to common perception that trade flows from low- to high-wage countries, only about 18 percent of global trade is driven by labor-cost arbitrage.</p><p>In the same way that the lowered cost of transportation sparked globalization in the '90s, the lowered cost of manufacturing through automation set off the current nearshoring and onshoring movements, and regional consolidation becomes a key character of tomorrow's value chains.</p><p>In addition to the lowered cost of production, mass customization and the need to adjust the product's design quickly to respond to consumers' preferences are also key factors in the process of nearshoring and onshoring. Rising geopolitical tensions-trade issues and geopolitical conflicts-help induce many companies to move production for US consumers from Asia to the US and Mexico. March of this year was the first time since 2003 that the US imported more goods from Mexico than from China.</p><p>Aside from the nearshoring and onshoring, the accelerated growth of countries in our region will drive further regional consolidation of value chains. If we look at the map, we will see that our region is located right in the middle of the three most populous countries in the world: China, India, and Indonesia. Together, they are home to 40 percent of the world population. High income growth and the rise of the middle class observed in many emerging markets will increase demand in this region going forward. China, for example, used to export 17 percent of what it produced in 2007; the portion of goods exported dropped down to only 9 percent in 2017.</p><p>Looking ahead, with the driving forces mentioned, the share of goods traded within our region will only keep increasing. Although today the US and Europe remain important export destinations for all of us, goods produced in CLMVT in the future will be servicing more regional demand. The larger regions surrounding us-ASEAN, China, East Asia, and India-will increasingly become destinations by themselves, and regional consolidation will become a more prominent feature of the new value chains.</p><p>The second movement is the increased importance of services in the economy. According to McKinsey Global Institute, cross-border service trade is growing more than 60 percent faster than trade in goods. This trend will continue in at least two ways: the creation of supply chain for the service sector, and the increasing value-added share of services within the manufacturing supply chain.</p><p>A good example comes from the automotive industry. Daimler and BMW, two German automobile giants, joined hand earlier this year and pledged 1.1 billion USD to explore alternative service-focused business models by setting up joint ventures providing services in taxi-hailing, car sharing, parking, and EV charging.</p><p>As our people's wealth increases, they will also shift their consumption profiles towards service, ranging from tourism, entertainment, medical services, financial services, and educational services. Regional hospital chains are also expanding, serving the growing demand of people in the region, and each hospital in the chains become a niche player with different role and specialization.</p><p>Even in manufacturing supply chains, the value-added share of services is increasing. Firms around the world today are spending more on brands and intellectual property: the share of revenue firms spent on intangible assets such as design, , marketing, and after-sale services increased from 5.4 percent in 2000 to 13.1 percent in 2016.</p><p>Rapid technological progress brings about shorter product life cycles, and manufacturing firms in many areas start providing leasing services, adding value to downstream processes and blurring borders between products and services. All this is made possible with the help of technology that reduces the cost of maintaining customer profiles, and IoT, sensors, and data analytics that help firms monitor how the leased products are being used as well as predicting when maintenance will be needed.</p><p>The increase in demand of services through the region's rising middle-income group and the increase in supply of services through firms' changing business model mean that services will have a large role to play in tomorrow's value chains. I should also point out that trade in services is seldom a victim of trade tensions, giving it all the more potential to grow.</p><p>The third major shift that we will see is the increased role of online platforms and sharing economy in value chains.</p><p>In my view, the ability to connect buyers and sellers from all over the world through technological platforms is one of the most radical ideas of the past decade. Platforms help reduce search cost and make economic transactions that would have not happened otherwise possible. Middlemen-most of the time large corporations-who traditionally took on this role of connecting different nodes in a value chain, dictating the path of the value chain, could be replaced by online platforms that make potential buyers and sellers more visible to everyone. Buyers see what sellers are offering and are able to efficiently choose products or services that best suit their needs. Similarly, sellers see more clearly what the market demands and are able to adjust their production accordingly.</p><p>Quality assurance and review systems found in modern online platforms help create a new form of trust between buyers and sellers. Technology could also come into play in the quality assurance process. One example is EasyRice, a startup based in Thailand that connects rice farmers directly to rice mills, providing AI-based quality assessment through images of rice samples to both the farmers and the mills and a price that is fair to all.</p><p>In addition to facilitating economic transactions, sharing platforms eliminate the need for individual firms to make huge investment. Cloud services, for example, eliminate the need for companies to make heavy investment in their own IT infrastructure.</p><p>Platforms will also lower the barrier of entry for SMEs into both manufacturing and service value chains. The reduced cost of entry through sharing economy and the direct connection and trust between buyers and sellers created by online platforms pave way for firms-especially SMEs-to design their own product flows and become integral parts of the new value chains.</p><p>The fourth change that will happen to value chains is that a country's competitiveness will no longer be based on low-wage labor, but on the ability of the country's workforce to adapt to new technologies.</p><p>As firms focus less on the production part of the new value chains and more on processes that require high-skilled labor such as design and marketing, the new value chains will be more knowledge-intensive and less reliant on low-skilled labor, who will most likely be replaced by automation. This does not mean that more people will be unemployed, but other skills will be required. Robots, for example, reduce the need for manual labor, but increase the need for technicians and software designers. The World Economic Forum actually projected that robotization will affect number of jobs positively.</p><p>The workforce of the new value chains, nonetheless, must be able to keep up with the technology and be able to acquire new skills as needed, and the challenges for all of us is not only how to train new generation of workforce to have the capacity to learn, but also how to prepare the 123 million people currently in the region's workforce for the changes to come, and, more importantly, how to transform them into lifelong learners in the world of fast-changing technology.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Thus far I have outlined for you the three driving factors: economic growth in our region, rapid technological advancements, and increased geopolitical tensions. These are the factors that will bring about significant changes to the value chains of the future, which will be more concentrated regionally with higher service component that requires knowledgeable, high-skilled workers. I also expect that sharing platforms will play a major role in allowing smaller players into the playing field by reducing investment required, promoting competition in the market.</p><p>That is the picture of the new form of value chains that we will see in the coming years. The big question now is, of course, how do we as a region prepare ourselves for it.</p><p>Two things are clear. First: we cannot rely on manufacturing employment and manufacturing workers' income alone as key drivers of growth. Second: no matter what you're doing today, strengthening the country's service capabilities will be vital.</p><p>To end my talk, I'd like to humbly offer five points for policymakers and business leaders who are here today.</p><p>The first point is the need to markedly upgrade digital infrastructure in the region. While traditional physical infrastructure is indeed crucial for the region to become the value chain hub of Asia, our regional cooperation needs to extend beyond that and shift to digital infrastructure, since it will be a key factor that would support value chains of the digital world.</p><p>Fast and reliable data connection is a necessity for modern businesses. This means laying down more fiber optic cables and expanding 4G and 5G mobile network coverage, the latter of which should be high on the policymakers' priority list.</p><p>My view is that our people will be able to leverage on digital technology quickly once digital infrastructure is in place. Internet penetration of the CLMVT is around 65 percent, compared to the world average of 57 percent. The average cost of data usage is also relatively cheap in this region. However, most of the internet users in CLMVT are concentrated in the urban areas, and there is much room for improvement. Upgrading and expanding coverage of our digital infrastructure will present tremendous opportunities to our firms-especially SMEs-and workforces, allowing them to benefit from modern value chains and new digital platforms.</p><p>In addition to digital infrastructure, we need to reduce frictions for service connectivity and data transfer within the region, and this is my second point. Mutual recognition, harmonization of rules and regulations, and interoperability of standards will greatly facilitate connectivity in our regional value chains.</p><p>In the digital age, the flow of data is growing at a much higher rate than goods traded or financial flows. For many global companies, data have become the most valuable asset that could be used to provide new and better services for their customers.</p><p>Another area where I think friction for service connectivity can be reduced is the language barrier within our region. While English is still indispensable, its use within our region is still limited. Without a widely-used common language within our region, we would benefit greatly from platforms that would cut cross the language barrier. Today, translation technology has matured to a point where live translation is possible and it's only getting better. The region could leverage more on the technology to reduce language friction that could impede service connectivity and productive collaborations in the region.</p><p>Aside from digital infrastructure, standardization, and interoperability, regulations also need to change. According to the World Bank's latest Doing Business report, it takes on average 62 days to deal with regulations to start a business in CLMVT. With the speed of technological progress that's only getting faster, the brilliant idea we had two months ago might have already been outdated by the time we get the permission to start a company.</p><p>In order to improve the ease of doing business, it is important that we overhaul existing laws and regulations, taking into account the current fast-moving digital environment.</p><p>In addition, regulating new technologies has its own challenges. Being too eager to adopt new technologies could pose unnecessary risks to the system, but being too cautious, waiting until the technology is proven safe, could mean that it's too late for domestic firms to compete with firms from outside who have accumulated years of experience with the technology. Sandbox approach, common among central banks, where new technologies are welcomed but are deployed only in a limited scope, could provide a platform where both the players and regulators learn the benefits and limitations of new technologies together.</p><p>My fourth point is the liberalization of the service sector. In my view, the barriers obstructing service connectivity within our region are still very high, and we need to think more about professional mobility within the region as well as licensing schemes that would allow service providers to serve customers in the region more freely and allow service-sector value chains to develop within the region.</p><p>As the world grows toward services, the region needs to build up service capability in order to stay relevant and connected to the new global value chains. Service liberalization within the region would promote competition and reallocation of resources. Air transport liberalization in ASEAN, for example, helped promote competition in the industry and is responsible for the boom of our tourism industry during the past decade.</p><p>Competition created through service liberalization would also lead to specialization. The diversity of services provided within the region can complement one another and benefit the creation of new regional service value chains, as we have witnessed in goods-producing value chains.</p><p>My last point is the reskilling and upskilling of our workforce. As mentioned earlier, the decreased value-added from the actual manufacturing process through automation means that there will be less left to gain for countries who still try to compete with wages and tie themselves to the manufacturing portion of the value chain. In addition, the new value chains will be dynamic, and workers need to be able to adapt quickly to the ever-changing demand. We need to train new generations to have the capacity to learn and fully utilize new technologies, as well as prepare the region's current workforce to adapt to technologies and transform them into lifelong learners.</p><p>All these points might sound daunting, but they are steps we need to take in order for us to keep up with the fast-changing world. It is important that we do not shy away from big challenges. We should dream big, aim high, but start from small steps today.</p><p>Coming from the Bank of Thailand, I'd like to share one example of small steps in the financial sector that central banks in the region have taken. Earlier this year in April, we held an event to showcase the ASEAN Payment Connectivity initiatives that aimed to reduce cross-border costs of remittances and fund transfers. At present, blockchain technology is being used for remittances and fund transfers between Thailand and Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar. The use of third-party blockchain technology means that banks do not have to make large individual investments. Interoperable QR payment system based on EMV standard being deployed across ASEAN countries is one example of standardizations that I hope would grow to be foundation for cross-border payments in the region in the future. Furthermore, Thailand's National ITMX-the main switch for our faster pay system-has developed the capability to process domestic fund transfers and payments for other countries should they wish to rely on the ITMX platform to launch domestic faster pay system. Using the same system would facilitate the intraregional financial connectivity and greatly reduce the investment cost each country would need to incur.</p><p>Within Thailand, we have recently amended many of our financial regulations, for example, allowing Thai banks to lend to firms in CLMV in Thai Baht, reducing the Thai ownership requirement of money transfer businesses from 75 to 25 percent, and initiating regulatory reforms, making digital financial transactions much easier and allowing banks to step into modern business of the digital world.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>The wave of change is coming and will continue to move fast. More goods and services will be traded within the CLMVT region due to technological advancement, geopolitical tension, and regional economic growth. Future value chains will have to answer more to regional demand, whose emphasis will shift from goods to services.</p><p>In the digital world, the ability to move fast before some global big-tech companies take control in setting the standard is crucial. Each of us, I'm afraid, is too slow and too small to tackle this wave alone. Only by banding together can we prepare for it and ride this wave of challenges and opportunities. Ultimately, I believe that regional collaboration-building digital infrastructure, reducing connectivity frictions, liberalizing services, and getting our people ready by providing platforms to reskill and upskill the workforce-will be key to the success of our region.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, I look forward to riding this wave of challenges and opportunities with all of you.</p><p>Thank you very much.</p><p>(Royal Thai Government)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDV-FRN1-DXMS-841Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3935\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 26, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Commercial Law (UCC)</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUI5QjdCNzBDNjY0NEY3QzlGRTNCQTMzQ0IwQ0MzRUQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzdDRDRFMzY5MDJBNDgxQjhCNTEwMjNGMERFQUI5QTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYyOEQ1QzBDQzA4NDQ1RDk4MTI5NzdCMUUxMjZBMDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DIYD</classCode><className>ASEAN COUNTRIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DM8Y</classCode><className>BUSINESS NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000895</classCode><className>IMPORT TRADE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D17D</classCode><className>NEWS BRIEFS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N521100MM</classCode><className>CENTRAL BANKS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000591</classCode><className>EMERGING MARKETS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

This forum presents a great opportunity for business leaders and policymakers to exchange thoughts on how this vibrant region fits in the picture of the new world, and how we could prepare ourselves to become the new value chain hub.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's great to hear of all the progress that has been made, both within ASEAN and more specifically within the CLMVT region, and to see ways we could collaborate to build up regional value chains that would become the new value chain hub of Asia, which is very fittingly the theme for this year's meeting.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">My talk today is supposed to be an Inspirational Talk, but I doubt very much that a conservative central banker will be able to inspire business leaders like yourselves.</p><p>I'd like to take on this year's theme from another angle, and instead paint a picture of what the new form of value chain might look like, 5 or 10 years from now. How will the nature of the future value chains change? How will the technological advancement transform the value chains in this region?</p><p>I intend for this talk to inspire us to really start thinking about what the future might bring, and what we can do to be ready for it. In my talk today, I'll highlight 3-4-5: three driving factors behind the changes we see, four key implications these driving factors bring, and five steps moving forward.</p><p>Let me start with the first driving factor: the growth of the CLMVT region. With each passing year, the gap between the so-called advanced economies and emerging markets are closing, and our region is catching up very fast.</p><p>As people get wealthier, they consume more. We have already seen this happening. Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s up to the GFC, the share of imported consumption goods into the CLMVT region had been steady at around 0.7 percent of world imports. Over the past decade, this share more than doubled to 1.6 percent of world imports. Consequently, we can expect domestic consumption in CLMVT to be an important driving force for the value chain going forward. Not only consumption volume will increase with per capita income, types of products consumed, together with their quality and diversity will also improve. CLMVT will soon become an important and high potential market within ASEAN. The other important aspect that will go up in conjunction with the standard of living is rising wages. Soon, we will not be able to rely on low labor cost as the source of comparative advantage.</p><p>The second driving force shaping the new form of value chains is the rapid advancements in technology. Automation is on its way to replace low-skilled and semi-skilled manufacturing jobs, making it much harder for a country to be competitive with low wages alone. While the use of robots in factories in the '70s were limited to precision tasks in a controlled environment, artificial intelligence and machine learning have expanded the roles of robots in the manufacturing world.</p><p>I'll give you an example. In one egg farm in China, it takes only one employee to oversee 170,000 hens. A traditional farm would have to employ at least 170 employees. Machines do all the collecting and sorting of eggs. Sensors could be trained to spot sick or dead hens and alert the controller so he could take appropriate actions.</p><p>Humanless warehouses are also becoming more prevalent, and some e-commerce giants are trying to go further: Amazon is exploring automated delivery systems, and China's JD.com is looking to automate the entire process, starting from shipping containers.</p><p>Technological advancements have also made many non-tradable services tradable. While what we generally think of when talking about tradable service is a tech support call center or business process outsourcing, we have moved a long way from that. Today, tradable services include product designs, entertainment, and even medical services. The first 5G-enabled remote surgery was done in Spain earlier this year. As services become more tradable, the concept of borders between products and borders between nations starts to fade away.</p><p>The third driving force that I would like to highlight is increasing geopolitical tensions. While technological advancements are slowly erasing the borders between countries and making people more connected than ever, an opposing force-the increasing and prolonged geopolitical tensions among major countries-is also at work.</p><p>Perhaps no tension has been getting as much attention as the ongoing trade conflict between the US and China, but this is just one of the many ongoing tensions around the world. Think about the more recent US-Iran tensions as well as other conflicts in the Middle East, India-Pakistan tensions, the highly uncertain outcome of Brexit, the unresolved nuclear situation in the Korean Peninsula, disputes in the South China Sea, and domestic political instability in various parts of the world. These tensions introduce new type of risks into the design of value chains-risks whose premiums are difficult to evaluate. Regardless of whether these tensions are prolonged or short-lived, they will have real effects on trade and investment patterns. Trade diversion, production relocation, and investment decisions driven by geopolitical pressure today will have a long-run effect in dictating the shape of our future value chains.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>The growth of emerging market economies and the CLMVT in particular, technological advancements, and prolonged geopolitical tensions... What implications do these key driving forces have on the new form of value chains? I would like to highlight four key movements that we will see in the coming years.</p><p>The first movement is the regional consolidation of goods-producing supply chains: goods will be traded more with our own neighbors and countries in our region rather than with some far-off countries.</p><p>Even though it was masked by the Global Financial Crisis, the offshoring movement is said to have ended a decade ago. Over the past decade, the share of goods produced in the world that are exported through value chains declined from 28 percent to 22 percent. Robotization and automation made cheap labor less relevant when companies decide where to place production. A recent study done by McKinsey Global Institute has found that, contrary to common perception that trade flows from low- to high-wage countries, only about 18 percent of global trade is driven by labor-cost arbitrage.</p><p>In the same way that the lowered cost of transportation sparked globalization in the '90s, the lowered cost of manufacturing through automation set off the current nearshoring and onshoring movements, and regional consolidation becomes a key character of tomorrow's value chains.</p><p>In addition to the lowered cost of production, mass customization and the need to adjust the product's design quickly to respond to consumers' preferences are also key factors in the process of nearshoring and onshoring. Rising geopolitical tensions-trade issues and geopolitical conflicts-help induce many companies to move production for US consumers from Asia to the US and Mexico. March of this year was the first time since 2003 that the US imported more goods from Mexico than from China.</p><p>Aside from the nearshoring and onshoring, the accelerated growth of countries in our region will drive further regional consolidation of value chains. If we look at the map, we will see that our region is located right in the middle of the three most populous countries in the world: China, India, and Indonesia. Together, they are home to 40 percent of the world population. High income growth and the rise of the middle class observed in many emerging markets will increase demand in this region going forward. China, for example, used to export 17 percent of what it produced in 2007; the portion of goods exported dropped down to only 9 percent in 2017.</p><p>Looking ahead, with the driving forces mentioned, the share of goods traded within our region will only keep increasing. Although today the US and Europe remain important export destinations for all of us, goods produced in CLMVT in the future will be servicing more regional demand. The larger regions surrounding us-ASEAN, China, East Asia, and India-will increasingly become destinations by themselves, and regional consolidation will become a more prominent feature of the new value chains.</p><p>The second movement is the increased importance of services in the economy. According to McKinsey Global Institute, cross-border service trade is growing more than 60 percent faster than trade in goods. This trend will continue in at least two ways: the creation of supply chain for the service sector, and the increasing value-added share of services within the manufacturing supply chain.</p><p>A good example comes from the automotive industry. Daimler and BMW, two German automobile giants, joined hand earlier this year and pledged 1.1 billion USD to explore alternative service-focused business models by setting up joint ventures providing services in taxi-hailing, car sharing, parking, and EV charging.</p><p>As our people's wealth increases, they will also shift their consumption profiles towards service, ranging from tourism, entertainment, medical services, financial services, and educational services. Regional hospital chains are also expanding, serving the growing demand of people in the region, and each hospital in the chains become a niche player with different role and specialization.</p><p>Even in manufacturing supply chains, the value-added share of services is increasing. Firms around the world today are spending more on brands and intellectual property: the share of revenue firms spent on intangible assets such as design, , marketing, and after-sale services increased from 5.4 percent in 2000 to 13.1 percent in 2016.</p><p>Rapid technological progress brings about shorter product life cycles, and manufacturing firms in many areas start providing leasing services, adding value to downstream processes and blurring borders between products and services. All this is made possible with the help of technology that reduces the cost of maintaining customer profiles, and IoT, sensors, and data analytics that help firms monitor how the leased products are being used as well as predicting when maintenance will be needed.</p><p>The increase in demand of services through the region's rising middle-income group and the increase in supply of services through firms' changing business model mean that services will have a large role to play in tomorrow's value chains. I should also point out that trade in services is seldom a victim of trade tensions, giving it all the more potential to grow.</p><p>The third major shift that we will see is the increased role of online platforms and sharing economy in value chains.</p><p>In my view, the ability to connect buyers and sellers from all over the world through technological platforms is one of the most radical ideas of the past decade. Platforms help reduce search cost and make economic transactions that would have not happened otherwise possible. Middlemen-most of the time large corporations-who traditionally took on this role of connecting different nodes in a value chain, dictating the path of the value chain, could be replaced by online platforms that make potential buyers and sellers more visible to everyone. Buyers see what sellers are offering and are able to efficiently choose products or services that best suit their needs. Similarly, sellers see more clearly what the market demands and are able to adjust their production accordingly.</p><p>Quality assurance and review systems found in modern online platforms help create a new form of trust between buyers and sellers. Technology could also come into play in the quality assurance process. One example is EasyRice, a startup based in Thailand that connects rice farmers directly to rice mills, providing AI-based quality assessment through images of rice samples to both the farmers and the mills and a price that is fair to all.</p><p>In addition to facilitating economic transactions, sharing platforms eliminate the need for individual firms to make huge investment. Cloud services, for example, eliminate the need for companies to make heavy investment in their own IT infrastructure.</p><p>Platforms will also lower the barrier of entry for SMEs into both manufacturing and service value chains. The reduced cost of entry through sharing economy and the direct connection and trust between buyers and sellers created by online platforms pave way for firms-especially SMEs-to design their own product flows and become integral parts of the new value chains.</p><p>The fourth change that will happen to value chains is that a country's competitiveness will no longer be based on low-wage labor, but on the ability of the country's workforce to adapt to new technologies.</p><p>As firms focus less on the production part of the new value chains and more on processes that require high-skilled labor such as design and marketing, the new value chains will be more knowledge-intensive and less reliant on low-skilled labor, who will most likely be replaced by automation. This does not mean that more people will be unemployed, but other skills will be required. Robots, for example, reduce the need for manual labor, but increase the need for technicians and software designers. The World Economic Forum actually projected that robotization will affect number of jobs positively.</p><p>The workforce of the new value chains, nonetheless, must be able to keep up with the technology and be able to acquire new skills as needed, and the challenges for all of us is not only how to train new generation of workforce to have the capacity to learn, but also how to prepare the 123 million people currently in the region's workforce for the changes to come, and, more importantly, how to transform them into lifelong learners in the world of fast-changing technology.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Thus far I have outlined for you the three driving factors: economic growth in our region, rapid technological advancements, and increased geopolitical tensions. These are the factors that will bring about significant changes to the value chains of the future, which will be more concentrated regionally with higher service component that requires knowledgeable, high-skilled workers. I also expect that sharing platforms will play a major role in allowing smaller players into the playing field by reducing investment required, promoting competition in the market.</p><p>That is the picture of the new form of value chains that we will see in the coming years. The big question now is, of course, how do we as a region prepare ourselves for it.</p><p>Two things are clear. First: we cannot rely on manufacturing employment and manufacturing workers' income alone as key drivers of growth. Second: no matter what you're doing today, strengthening the country's service capabilities will be vital.</p><p>To end my talk, I'd like to humbly offer five points for policymakers and business leaders who are here today.</p><p>The first point is the need to markedly upgrade digital infrastructure in the region. While traditional physical infrastructure is indeed crucial for the region to become the value chain hub of Asia, our regional cooperation needs to extend beyond that and shift to digital infrastructure, since it will be a key factor that would support value chains of the digital world.</p><p>Fast and reliable data connection is a necessity for modern businesses. This means laying down more fiber optic cables and expanding 4G and 5G mobile network coverage, the latter of which should be high on the policymakers' priority list.</p><p>My view is that our people will be able to leverage on digital technology quickly once digital infrastructure is in place. Internet penetration of the CLMVT is around 65 percent, compared to the world average of 57 percent. The average cost of data usage is also relatively cheap in this region. However, most of the internet users in CLMVT are concentrated in the urban areas, and there is much room for improvement. Upgrading and expanding coverage of our digital infrastructure will present tremendous opportunities to our firms-especially SMEs-and workforces, allowing them to benefit from modern value chains and new digital platforms.</p><p>In addition to digital infrastructure, we need to reduce frictions for service connectivity and data transfer within the region, and this is my second point. Mutual recognition, harmonization of rules and regulations, and interoperability of standards will greatly facilitate connectivity in our regional value chains.</p><p>In the digital age, the flow of data is growing at a much higher rate than goods traded or financial flows. For many global companies, data have become the most valuable asset that could be used to provide new and better services for their customers.</p><p>Another area where I think friction for service connectivity can be reduced is the language barrier within our region. While English is still indispensable, its use within our region is still limited. Without a widely-used common language within our region, we would benefit greatly from platforms that would cut cross the language barrier. Today, translation technology has matured to a point where live translation is possible and it's only getting better. The region could leverage more on the technology to reduce language friction that could impede service connectivity and productive collaborations in the region.</p><p>Aside from digital infrastructure, standardization, and interoperability, regulations also need to change. According to the World Bank's latest Doing Business report, it takes on average 62 days to deal with regulations to start a business in CLMVT. With the speed of technological progress that's only getting faster, the brilliant idea we had two months ago might have already been outdated by the time we get the permission to start a company.</p><p>In order to improve the ease of doing business, it is important that we overhaul existing laws and regulations, taking into account the current fast-moving digital environment.</p><p>In addition, regulating new technologies has its own challenges. Being too eager to adopt new technologies could pose unnecessary risks to the system, but being too cautious, waiting until the technology is proven safe, could mean that it's too late for domestic firms to compete with firms from outside who have accumulated years of experience with the technology. Sandbox approach, common among central banks, where new technologies are welcomed but are deployed only in a limited scope, could provide a platform where both the players and regulators learn the benefits and limitations of new technologies together.</p><p>My fourth point is the liberalization of the service sector. In my view, the barriers obstructing service connectivity within our region are still very high, and we need to think more about professional mobility within the region as well as licensing schemes that would allow service providers to serve customers in the region more freely and allow service-sector value chains to develop within the region.</p><p>As the world grows toward services, the region needs to build up service capability in order to stay relevant and connected to the new global value chains. Service liberalization within the region would promote competition and reallocation of resources. Air transport liberalization in ASEAN, for example, helped promote competition in the industry and is responsible for the boom of our tourism industry during the past decade.</p><p>Competition created through service liberalization would also lead to specialization. The diversity of services provided within the region can complement one another and benefit the creation of new regional service value chains, as we have witnessed in goods-producing value chains.</p><p>My last point is the reskilling and upskilling of our workforce. As mentioned earlier, the decreased value-added from the actual manufacturing process through automation means that there will be less left to gain for countries who still try to compete with wages and tie themselves to the manufacturing portion of the value chain. In addition, the new value chains will be dynamic, and workers need to be able to adapt quickly to the ever-changing demand. We need to train new generations to have the capacity to learn and fully utilize new technologies, as well as prepare the region's current workforce to adapt to technologies and transform them into lifelong learners.</p><p>All these points might sound daunting, but they are steps we need to take in order for us to keep up with the fast-changing world. It is important that we do not shy away from big challenges. We should dream big, aim high, but start from small steps today.</p><p>Coming from the Bank of Thailand, I'd like to share one example of small steps in the financial sector that central banks in the region have taken. Earlier this year in April, we held an event to showcase the ASEAN Payment Connectivity initiatives that aimed to reduce cross-border costs of remittances and fund transfers. At present, blockchain technology is being used for remittances and fund transfers between Thailand and Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar. The use of third-party blockchain technology means that banks do not have to make large individual investments. Interoperable QR payment system based on EMV standard being deployed across ASEAN countries is one example of standardizations that I hope would grow to be foundation for cross-border payments in the region in the future. Furthermore, Thailand's National ITMX-the main switch for our faster pay system-has developed the capability to process domestic fund transfers and payments for other countries should they wish to rely on the ITMX platform to launch domestic faster pay system. Using the same system would facilitate the intraregional financial connectivity and greatly reduce the investment cost each country would need to incur.</p><p>Within Thailand, we have recently amended many of our financial regulations, for example, allowing Thai banks to lend to firms in CLMV in Thai Baht, reducing the Thai ownership requirement of money transfer businesses from 75 to 25 percent, and initiating regulatory reforms, making digital financial transactions much easier and allowing banks to step into modern business of the digital world.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>The wave of change is coming and will continue to move fast. More goods and services will be traded within the CLMVT region due to technological advancement, geopolitical tension, and regional economic growth. Future value chains will have to answer more to regional demand, whose emphasis will shift from goods to services.</p><p>In the digital world, the ability to move fast before some global big-tech companies take control in setting the standard is crucial. Each of us, I'm afraid, is too slow and too small to tackle this wave alone. Only by banding together can we prepare for it and ride this wave of challenges and opportunities. Ultimately, I believe that regional collaboration-building digital infrastructure, reducing connectivity frictions, liberalizing services, and getting our people ready by providing platforms to reskill and upskill the workforce-will be key to the success of our region.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, I look forward to riding this wave of challenges and opportunities with all of you.</p><p>Thank you very much.</p><p>(Royal Thai Government)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDV-FB61-JB5P-J06T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3935\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 26, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Commercial Law (UCC)</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUI5QjdCNzBDNjY0NEY3QzlGRTNCQTMzQ0IwQ0MzRUQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzdDRDRFMzY5MDJBNDgxQjhCNTEwMjNGMERFQUI5QTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYyOEQ1QzBDQzA4NDQ1RDk4MTI5NzdCMUUxMjZBMDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DIYD</classCode><className>ASEAN COUNTRIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DM8Y</classCode><className>BUSINESS NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000895</classCode><className>IMPORT TRADE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D17D</classCode><className>NEWS BRIEFS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N521100MM</classCode><className>CENTRAL BANKS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000591</classCode><className>EMERGING MARKETS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

But by doing \u2018the right thing\u2019\u2014placating those privacy concerns\u2014it could expose itself to similarly vociferous calls for it to be broken up under antitrust rules.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One half of the digital duopoly has to choose whether it wants to cut off its hand or chop off its leg in order to survive. No matter which path Google goes down, it comes out different, if not weaker than when it started. And so does the entire media ecosystem. There used to be a phrase, \u2018as goes GM, so goes the nation.\u201d Today, it wouldn\u2019t be completely wrong to say, \u201cAs goes Google, so goes advertising. And marketing. And email. And video. And ad tech.\u201d And you get the idea.</p><p>Just even the thought that Google is thinking about restricting third-party ad-targeting in its market-leading web browser Chrome caused a burp across the industry. Should Google actually go through with limiting this access, every single tier of the industry will experience considerable hardship in continuing to do their jobs. The impact could be specifically and especially cataclysmic for those ad-tech and martech players whose value proposition is primarily based on third-party cookies. We need only look at the turbulent stock prices of publicly-traded ad-tech companies since the reports first emerged as evidence of the concern.</p><p>Institutional investors are starting to see potential trouble down the line and (if fears are realized) the pain won\u2019t be isolated either if Apple\u2019s rollout of intelligent track prevention (ITP)\u2013a similarly conceived measure with its Safari browser\u2013is anything to go by.</p><p>Sources have indicated that post-ITP even the most premium of publishers have struggled to monetize website views coming via the Apple web browser and when we consider that Chrome\u2019s market share is estimated to be three times of Safari, the trepidation is understandable.</p><p>Buyers won\u2019t bid on inventory they can\u2019t see and publishers across the industry, themselves faced with multiple prescriptions from a variety of browser providers, are starting to try to correct course in their digital revenue strategies.</p><p>And while marketers always have the option of doubling-down on Google in order to meet their advertising campaign KPIs, the strategic shortsightedness of such a decision is more widely known than ever before.</p><p>However, nothing is a fait accompli. But it is worth examining some of the issues that are likely to be governing Google\u2019s decision making, a process that is seldom aired in public.</p><p>The internal conflicts of any company that can boast annual revenues of almost $137 billion and founders that can legitimately lay claim to have changed the world are unlikely to generate sympathy among those in the industry it dominates. Although, Google is often keen to voice how it is cognizant of the far-reaching implications of its policy decisions, even if many in the industry beg to differ.</p><p>Google, like its digital duopoly brother-in-arms Facebook, is beset with privacy issues, algorithm issues, and let\u2019s call them \u201cpolitical headwinds.\u201d At the center of the storm is the P word: privacy. Silicon Valley suffers from the privacy plague, which has seen the largest \u2018big tech\u2019 CEOs answering questions in front of Congress. Privacy issues have also pushed U.S. lawmakers and presidential candidates to take a cue from counterparts in the E.U. following the enforcement of General Data Protection Regulations as the 2020 elections draw near.</p><p>Doubtless, Google mulling such a move of choking off third-party access in order to mollify the legislators, as well as the public, is a maneuver to pre-empt any potential GDPR-like privacy regulations and stay clear of the very public criticisms that have marred the consumer-facing kudos of Facebook since early 2018.</p><p>Some point to the ITP rollout and similar moves by Firefox-creator Mozilla as a precedent that would vindicate potential\u00a0Chrome tracking restrictions, but Google\u2019s business heads will want to protect the largest ad business in the history of the industry.</p><p>Meanwhile, Google\u2019s legal team must also be wary of how any decisions to bar third-party cookies within Google Chrome, a.k.a. competition to its lucrative display ad business, may invite antitrust scrutiny and grant succor to those calling for the divestiture of its ad tech offering that formerly went under the umbrella DoubleClick moniker.</p><p>The public emergence of such internal debates at Google may have sparked concern among the wider industry, but some have started to get past the hand-wringing stage and discussing an advertiser ID that\u2019s tied to the browser, not unlike a mobile device ID.</p><p>Regardless of its final decision, the powers at Google are likely coming to the realization that it is likely to become a victim of its own success and that sacrifices will have to be made somewhere along the line. That said, the speculation will make next month\u2019s Google I/O conference\u2013one where it has historically made some key product and policy reveals\u2013a hotly anticipated event.</p><p>If you\u2019re Google, do you value your hand or your leg more?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADWEEK-1035700</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADWEEK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VT1-3GT1-JC8H-T21G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7907</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"852\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Mediabistro Holdings, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>adweek.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 2, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

I might say angry - at the news that part of the Rolle College site has been sold off to developers (Journal, February 12). <br/><br/>Those of us who bought shares in the social enterprise company which would have delivered a true community-based facility on that land (which, after all, had originally been given to Plymouth University) will even feel betrayed a second time as the memories of that episode flood back. <br/><br/>One assumes that the Deaf Academy had a business plan (including the sale of their two sites in Exeter) which did not require such a sale. <br/><br/>If so, this is opportunistic at best and might be called asset-stripping. <br/><br/>If not, it reveals the project to be seriously under-funded from the start. <br/><br/>No wonder they are still asking for charitable donations!<br/><br/>Peter Brain<br/><br/>Exmouth<br/><br/>I refer to two Exmouth councillors one of whom was Geoff Jung talking about Exmouth beach on the regional news on Friday night.<br/><br/>They were saying how much people respected cleaning up after themselves regarding rubbish etc. <br/><br/>On that particular day I was on the beach to the right of the Octagon where he was standing (but not at the same time unfortunately) it was 10am and luckily I was watching where I was walking as I came across a pile of fresh dog mess. <br/><br/>And along they all went with their dogs racing around, one came and started pawing the back of my coat and proceeded to jump up until I shouted to the owners could they please call their dog off me!<br/><br/>Has Mr Jung been down to the beach in the summer? <br/><br/>I refer to the area next to the Harbour View caf\u00e9 where the shelters are that lead directly on to the beach.  <br/><br/>By 6pm, they are full of takeaway cartons, discarded drink cans and any other kind of litter you can find, also this area operates a dog ban which is continually flouted because the dog warden goes home at 5pm. <br/><br/>However, the dog ban signs are so small and faded that  I am not surprised that  holiday makers and residents don't know which parts they can and can't take dogs.<br/><br/>Hence the title!<br/><br/>Mrs C Goodall<br/><br/>Exmouth<br/><br/>I'm hugely encouraged by the landmark plans announced by the government to give Ofcom powers to regulate social networks.<br/><br/>The safety of children online has been compromised for too long, but this breakthrough could pave the way in setting a global standard in protecting children in their digital worlds.<br/><br/>The government has shown a commitment to leading change by standing up to big tech firms.<br/><br/>Now, ministers must move swiftly to ensure that Ofcom is given the necessary powers, allowing it to enforce substantial fines to social networks not doing enough to prevent adults grooming children on their sites.<br/><br/>The internet is a wonderful place for young people to learn and social networks form a big part of their friendships, enabling them to seek support from peers.<br/><br/>However, no longer should children be exposed to harmful content and abuse because of a slap-dash approach by tech giants.<br/><br/>It's why we've long called for, through our Wild West Web campaign, an independent regulator, safe accounts for children and detailed reporting on how tech firms are keeping children safe.<br/><br/>An estimated 90 online child sexual offences have taken place each day since the government published the Online Harms White Paper last April.<br/><br/>It's gone on too long and social networks must not be allowed to continue dragging their heels.<br/><br/>Emma Motherwell<br/><br/>NSPCC, local campaigns manager for the South West of England<br/><br/>\"Why was Great-grandma crying when we went to see her?<br/><br/>\" Because some people want to knock down Shandford, the big house she lives in.\"<br/><br/>\"Why?\"<br/><br/>\"Because they want to replace her home with lots of flats and make money.\"<br/><br/>\"Isn't that very naughty?\"<br/><br/>Try to explain to a small child why money is the root of all evil.<br/><br/>Kindness and care should not require either explanation or justification in a civilized society.<br/><br/>Anita Jennings<br/><br/>Budleigh Salterton<br/><br/>I was astonished to read the letter from Mr Rodgers (Exmouth Journal, February 26, 2020) suggesting that the Council's dog control order regarding dogs on the beach could be bypassed on a legal technicality. <br/><br/>This is surely the last thing that someone claiming to be a responsible dog owner would consider. The council sets the rules in an attempt to satisfy the requirements of the 25 per cent who own dogs and the 75 per cent who don't (and I would suggest the rules are currently very much in favour of the 25 percent). To try and bypass these rules is the antithesis of responsible.<br/><br/>I am a dog lover myself, although I don't own one. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, regardless of legal loopholes, the council makes no effort to enforce their existing rules, and dogs are a normal sight in the 'dog free' area, and of course these are the ones belonging to irresponsible owners, not on a lead and taking no notice of their owners' attempts to control them.<br/><br/>It needs to be considered that many local shops and caf\u00e9s are dependent on the tourist trade, and that dogs on the beach are a major deterrent to tourists. <br/><br/>We have been told on more than one occasion by visitors that they would not consider bringing their children to the beach in Exmouth because of the dogs.<br/><br/>We routinely head off to Scarborough and Whitby in June or July, where the beaches are very well managed with both dog and dog free areas. <br/><br/>And that will be the price of the insistence of a few irresponsible dog owners to disregard the rules - a town with little but charity shops and very few tourists. <br/><br/>Contrast that with Whitby, which has a very successful range of local shops and restaurants in far greater number than Exmouth, despite it being a much smaller town in a fairly remote location. Yes, there are other reasons, such as the cheap long term parking close to the town centre, and the abbey,  but the well managed beach is surely a large part of their success.<br/><br/>I would add that both Scarborough and Whitby allocate almost half the beach to dogs, although in both cases the half nearest the town is the dog free area, and that in my opinion the area from Orcombe Point to the lifeboat station could be a permanent dog area, which might reduce the desire of irresponsible dog owners to spoil the experience of the seventy five per cent.<br/><br/>Thomas Thorley<br/><br/>Exmouth<br/><br/>As one of the nation's 22,000 heritage railway volunteers, I am concerned at the government's decision to ban sales of bituminous coal.<br/><br/>The All-Party Parliamentary Group on Heritage Railways (APPGHR) in its report Steaming Ahead, published last July, warned of the unintended consequences of such a ban, advising that 'the government's policy (ie Clean Air Strategy)  will reduce demand for domestic coal with the likely consequence that the mining of British coal suitable for steam locomotives will cease'.<br/><br/>The loss of a domestic market of 130,000 tonnes per annum will render the home production of 35,000 tonnes pa for steam railways, ships and traction engines uneconomic, necessitating the importation of low-sulphur coal. <br/><br/>The establishment of a joint purchase scheme for heritage railways would incur set up costs of \u00a31.5 million whilst conversion to oil-firing is uneconomic.<br/><br/>There is a serious risk that by imposing the ban next year with insufficient time for the industry to adapt the government will throw the baby out with the bathwater. <br/><br/>No-one would take issue with the government's objective but further consideration must be given as to how these goals are to be achieved, without needlessly placing the future of our heritage railways which bring pleasure to millions in jeopardy.<br/><br/>AL (Tony) Venning<br/><br/>Volunteer, South Devon Railway</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EXMJNL-85024759</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EXMJNL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YC0-0521-F0YS-019C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388380</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1643\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Archant Regional Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Exmouth Journal</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56873\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 5, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

And what a two years it has been. The dedicated men and women of the Attorney General's Office have confronted the powerful, the privileged, and those who perpetrate wrong, all to protect the good people of our state. And we have gotten results.</p><p>Start with the opioid epidemic. Missouri, and the rest of the nation, faces a mounting public health crisis fueled by the widespread abuse of opioid drugs. This is a crisis that touches every community in our state, from our small towns to our cities and suburbs.</p><p>But when I came to office, no one in the state had held the opioid manufacturers responsible for their role in this disaster. The truth is, the big pharmaceutical companies made billions of dollars flooding our streets with opioids and then lied about the drugs' addictive effect. The people of Missouri deserve better. We took action, filing the largest lawsuit in Missouri history to make the pharma companies pay. Now multiple states have followed our lead and banded together to hold big pharma accountable.</p><p>Our children are also threatened by the growing evil of human trafficking, a form of modern-day slavery that has found its way into every part of our state. I vowed to confront the traffickers and shut them down. And we did. We led the largest anti-trafficking raid in Missouri history, raiding over a dozen businesses in southwest Missouri that were acting as fronts for trafficking.</p><p>I also formed the state's first permanent anti-trafficking task force, bringing together leaders from law enforcement, health care, and the victims' rights community. We created an Anti-Trafficking Unit to go after traffickers around the state. And we launched the first statewide business coalition against trafficking.</p><p>In the past two years, we have led the way protecting your data privacy. In 2017, I launched major investigations of Google and Facebook, perhaps the two most powerful corporations in the world. These companies collect more personal, private and confidential information from you than any corporations in history, yet they answer to virtually no one when it comes to explaining what they do with your data. We served  subpoenas to find out whether these tech giants have misled consumers, inappropriately sold  data, or violated antitrust laws. Now other states are joining the effort, and for perhaps the first time the tech companies are facing real legal scrutiny, and Missourians' rights are getting a real defense.</p><p>Whether it's taking on big tech or conducting the first statewide audit of untested rape kits; fighting big government regulation on farmers or suing the St. Louis Housing Authority for its failure to provide decent living conditions to its residents, the Attorney General's Office has stood up to protect the people. Thank you for the privilege of serving as your attorney general. I promise to continue the fight as your next U.S. senator.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Sen.-elect Josh Hawley talks to supporters at his campaign office in Springfield on June 28.</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>News-Leader file photo</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNWSLD-spr-1820056793</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNWSLD2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V32-03T1-JC3H-0182-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">252050</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"494\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Springfield News-Leader All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Springfield News-Leader (Missouri)</publicationName><edition>1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 30, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

I'm afraid that's what I'm about to do. The antitrust reformers at the University of Chicago's Stigler Center recently paid me a generous compliment, and I'm going to reply with an argumentative blog post. I guess that's just the kind of guy I am.First, some background. </p><p>In mid-February the White House released its Annual Report of the Council of Economic Advisors[1]. This CEA Report examines digital platforms and competition issues in some depth. In particular, it criticizes a September 2019 report[2] by the Stigler Center (hereinafter the Final Report or Final Stigler Report). The Final Report recommends that the U.S. create a single, sector-specific Digital Authority to regulate digital companies, but the CEA Report rejects that recommendation.In response, Luigi Zingales and Filippo Maria Lancieri of the Stigler Center posted 'The Trump Administration Attacks the Stigler Report on Digital Platforms[3].' Zingales and Lancieri push back on the CEA's conclusions. And here they pay me an unexpected compliment. From their blog post:The section [of the CEA Report] on the digital economy is centered on an attack on the proposal of the Stigler Report to create a Digital Agency, saying it 'raises a host of issues' and 'that the downsides of new, far-reaching regulation need to be taken seriously.' In doing so, the Council of Economic Advisers repeats, almost verbatim, a claim already advanced by Charles Koch Institute's Neil\u202fChilson in theWashington Post[4], an argument already refuted in an earlierProMarketpost.[5] (emphasis added)I am flattered that the Stigler Center would connect my op ed with the thoughtful analysis of the experts at the Council of Economic Advisors. I like to think my op ed influenced the CEA's report. But I suspect this is just a case of independent folks saying relatively obvious things about regulatory capture. However, I'm a bit put out by their claim that my op ed was 'already refuted in an earlier ProMarket post.' It is true that Fiona Scott Morton and Luigi Zingales published a post in November[6] criticizing my op ed. At the time I found it so unpersuasive that I thought it unnecessary to respond with anything more than one tweet[7]: Still, the November post has occasionally[8] been[9] promoted[10] by various U. Chicago-related twitter accounts. And now the Stigler Center claims that post refuted my op ed (and, by implication, the CEA Report). So, it's time to respond to the November post more fully. My Washington Post op ed[11] made two relevant points, one observational and one substantive. First, I observed the irony of a center named after George Stigler proposing a new agency. Stigler was a Nobel-prize winning economist. He popularized the term 'regulatory capture' and warned that 'regulation is acquired by the industry and is designed and operated primarily for its benefit.' As my op ed points out, it's a fair bet that he would be skeptical of creating a new agency like that recommended by the Final Stigler Report. Second, my op ed argues against establishing a single new agency to regulate digital companies, primarily because such single-industry agencies are more vulnerable to regulatory capture. That is, such specialized agencies are more likely than generalist agencies to serve the interests of the regulated companies rather than the public. It would be better to subject the digital companies to an existing economy-wide enforcement agency like the Federal Trade Commission, I argue. In the November blog post Morton and Zingales did not rebut either of these points. They exaggerate how thoroughly the Final Stigler Report evaluated and addressed such concerns. But more importantly, they do not refute my substantive claim about the capture of single-industry agencies - indeed, they appear to begrudgingly agree with me. Let's look at each argument.First, the Report eagerly recommends a new independent agency but barely acknowledges regulatory capture risks and offers only a last-minute, hardly discussed fix. The body of the Final Stigler Report, which draws from four separate subcommittee reports, enthusiastically endorses a stand-alone, industry-specific Digital Authority (DA). As the Report's Policy Brief[12] summarizes, 'The strongest indication emerging from the four reports is the importance of having a single powerful regulator capable of overseeing all aspects of DPs [digital platforms].' This conclusion represents a common theme throughout the Final Stigler Report: 'Therefore, the report suggests that Congress should consider creating a specialist regulator, the Digital Authority.' (p 32) 'For the reasons above, we believe the establishment of a sectoral regulator should be seriously considered.' (p 100)'Finally, because the problems we identify may require action beyond antitrust, we also propose the establishment of a new digital regulatory agency, or Digital Authority.' (p 120) Despite this enthusiastic support for a new agency, the 313-page body of the Final Report offers no institutional design solutions to address regulatory capture concerns. The Final Report does mention 'regulatory capture' or similar phrases a few times, mostly in citations or in platitudes like 'it is important to remain cognizant of the dangers of regulatory capture.' In one example, the Final Report points to the sector-specific Federal Communications Commission as a model for the Digital Authority even as it acknowledges the FCC's deep historic problem with regulatory capture. (My op ed dives deep into the lessons for a Digital Authority from the FCC's history of capture - analysis wholly ignored by Morton and Zingales's post.) So, the body of the Final Report offers very little to support Morton and Zingales' claim that regulatory capture concerns were addressed.However, the Final Report's 17-page 'Policy Brief' summary does contain a single paragraph that acknowledges the importance of institutional design and suggests a potential mitigation: The Dangers of a Digital Authority: As George Stigler would readily point out, a new Digital Authority runs the risk of being captured by industry, becoming a new barrier to entry rather than a promoter of competition. This risk can be minimized, albeit not eliminated, by a careful institutional design. This is one reason why we envision\u2014at least initially\u2014to have the Digital Authority as a subdivision of the FTC, an across-industry authority with a better-than-average record of avoiding capture. Most importantly, the Digital Authority will have to be very transparent in all its activities. The Reports discuss a range of different institutional design mechanisms that can be explored to protect the Digital Authority from capture. (emphasis added)Morton and Zingales point to this lone paragraph in the Policy Brief as proof that the Stigler Center had considered regulatory capture implications for institutional design, saying:To avoid the legitimate concern raised by Chilson, the Stigler Center proposal suggests, as one option, that the Digital Authority be placed inside the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), an agency even Chilson appreciates, having worked there. Rotating FTC staff between consumer protection, antitrust, and digital authority could create useful synergies and expertise and minimize the risk that DA employees will be captured by industry. More stringent restrictions to revolving doors would help minimize this risk.Yet this single paragraph in the Policy Brief is the Final Report's only proposed mitigation of regulatory capture. And it is the only mention of a FTC-embedded approach in all the reports, including the subcommittee reports. In fact, Morton and Zingales' blog post, in suggesting rotating FTC staff and revolving door restrictions, provides more detail about the potential institutional design of the DA than do the Policy Brief and the Final Report combined. This is not strong evidence of a thoughtful approach to regulatory capture. Instead, as I pointed out in my tweet, this tack-on paragraph looks more like someone raised last-minute concerns that George Stigler might have objected to creating an entire new agency.Morton and Zingales also claim that the four preliminary reports 'discuss a range of different institutional design mechanisms.' But there isn't much in the subcommittee reports, either. Neither the Market Structure and Antitrust Subcommittee's report[13] nor the Privacy and Data Protection Subcommittee's report[14] offer any mechanisms to prevent capture. The Media Industry Subcommittee's report[15] actually agrees with my op ed, noting that 'industry regulators are often more prone to capture than the antitrust regulator' and suggests some transparency requirements. The Political Systems Subcommittee's report[16] contains four paragraphs with some relevant discussion. Those paragraphs discuss whether the new Digital Authority should be modeled on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or instead designed like the Securities Exchange Commission- or FTC. However, the Subcommittee primarily expresses concern about politicization rather than industry capture. And it never makes a recommendation, concluding that '[t]here is probably no single way to balance the concerns for preventing industry capture and those related to political manipulation.'So, does the Final Report address regulatory capture concerns generally, as Morton and Zingales claim? To sum up, across the hundreds of pages in five reports there are a few mentions of regulatory capture. One report briefly suggests transparency as a remedy. Another considers two different institutional designs for the DA but mostly worries about politicization. Finally, one sentence of the Final Report's Policy Brief offers a novel alternative to the DA that is counter to the recommendations in the body of the Final Report. Perhaps these brief, contradictory discussions would be enough to address George Stigler's presumptive concerns about regulatory capture, but I remain skeptical. Second, Morton and Zingales do not refute my argument that industry-specific agencies are more likely to be captured - indeed, they appear to begrudgingly agree with me. Most of Morton and Zingales' blog post furiously battles a strawman, which is why I didn't feel a strong need to respond last November. For example, they claim that, 'Chilson's argument, taken at face value, eliminates all government agencies.' Not at all - I focus on the downsides of industry-specific regulators. They accuse me of a laissez-faire approach toward tech companies. Yet my piece applauds FTC enforcement. They accuse me of evidence-free fear mongering and lacking concern for our democracy while they hypothesize about TikTok monopolizing social media (odd hypo, given five paragraphs earlier they claimed Facebook has a monopoly on social media) and say I don't care about disclosure of foreign spending on political ads. None of this has anything to do with the argument my op ed. All it does is distract from the fact that, as they admit, I raise 'a legitimate concern' about regulatory capture. And they must admit this, because the Policy Brief essentially agrees with my op ed when it rejects, at the last minute, the Final Report's recommendation for a stand-alone industry-specific Digital Authority. Compare the Policy Brief's 'Dangers of a Digital Authority' paragraph quoted above with the final paragraphs of my op ed:[G]eneralist agencies that broadly regulate many industries are more resistant to capture. Further, agencies that primarily enforce laws (like the DOJ) are far less attractive targets for regulatory capture than those that mostly write rules (like the FCC). In the United States, we already have an economywide enforcement agency: the Federal Trade Commission. Charged by Congress to promote competition and to protect consumers, the FTC has decades of experience addressing antitrust and consumer protection issues in the tech industry. [I]f new capabilities are needed to police digital companies, doesn't it make sense to give such authority to an experienced agency that has been resistant to regulatory capture?Thus, Morton and Zingales don't refute my op ed at all. I'm honestly not sure why they claim to. Perhaps I poked a sore spot. After all, there is a clear tension between the body of the Stigler Center Final Report, which recommends a stand-alone agency, and the Policy Brief, which in one sentence rejects that approach because of concerns over regulatory capture of an industry-specific regulator. I share the concerns of that one sentence in the Policy Brief. So does the President's Council of Economic Advisors. It remains to be seen where the Stigler Center settles on this point.  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F03%2F13%2Fthank-you-stigler-center-for-the-compliment-now-heres-why-youre-wrong%2F&amp;linkname=Thank%20you%2C%20Stigler%20Center%2C%20for%20the%20Compliment.%20Now%20Here%E2%80%99s%20Why%20You%E2%80%99re%20Wrong.https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F03%2F13%2Fthank-you-stigler-center-for-the-compliment-now-heres-why-youre-wrong%2F&amp;linkname=Thank%20you%2C%20Stigler%20Center%2C%20for%20the%20Compliment.%20Now%20Here%E2%80%99s%20Why%20You%E2%80%99re%20Wrong.https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F03%2F13%2Fthank-you-stigler-center-for-the-compliment-now-heres-why-youre-wrong%2F&amp;linkname=Thank%20you%2C%20Stigler%20Center%2C%20for%20the%20Compliment.%20Now%20Here%E2%80%99s%20Why%20You%E2%80%99re%20Wrong.https://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F03%2F13%2Fthank-you-stigler-center-for-the-compliment-now-heres-why-youre-wrong%2F&amp;title=Thank%20you%2C%20Stigler%20Center%2C%20for%20the%20Compliment.%20Now%20Here%E2%80%99s%20Why%20You%E2%80%99re%20Wrong.The\">https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F03%2F13%2Fthank-you-stigler-center-for-the-compliment-now-heres-why-youre-wrong%2F&amp;linkname=Thank%20you%2C%20Stigler%20Center%2C%20for%20the%20Compliment.%20Now%20Here%E2%80%99s%20Why%20You%E2%80%99re%20Wrong.https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F03%2F13%2Fthank-you-stigler-center-for-the-compliment-now-heres-why-youre-wrong%2F&amp;linkname=Thank%20you%2C%20Stigler%20Center%2C%20for%20the%20Compliment.%20Now%20Here%E2%80%99s%20Why%20You%E2%80%99re%20Wrong.https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F03%2F13%2Fthank-you-stigler-center-for-the-compliment-now-heres-why-youre-wrong%2F&amp;linkname=Thank%20you%2C%20Stigler%20Center%2C%20for%20the%20Compliment.%20Now%20Here%E2%80%99s%20Why%20You%E2%80%99re%20Wrong.https://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F03%2F13%2Fthank-you-stigler-center-for-the-compliment-now-heres-why-youre-wrong%2F&amp;title=Thank%20you%2C%20Stigler%20Center%2C%20for%20the%20Compliment.%20Now%20Here%E2%80%99s%20Why%20You%E2%80%99re%20Wrong.The</url> post Thank you, Stigler Center, for the Compliment.

Jordan had no obvi...</p><p>When the House Judiciary\u2019s antitrust subcommittee hosted the big tech CEOs earlier this week, the hearing veered off into chaos several times. Each time it was caused by the hysterics of the GOP\u2019s resident attack dog, Jim Jordan of Ohio.    Jordan had no obvious understanding of, or interest in, tech antitrust issues, but used his time to harangue the CEOs about their companies\u2019 alleged censorship of conservative viewpoints (an old saw that shows up every time Congress talks to tech)\u2014particularly Google.    While questioning Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Jordan accused Google of siding with the World Health Organization over the American people, of backing Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, and generally stifling conservatives\u2019 access to information online.    It was a surprising stance from the Congressman, given that Google gave $10,000 to the man\u2019s reelection campaign in 2020, and has been funding him every cycle going back to 2012, according to Federal Election Commission filings. In this hearing, the attack dog truly bit the hand that was feeding him.    Despite this, Jordan demanded a commitment from Pichai that Google would not \u201cconfigure its search engine\u201d to back Joe Biden in the election, and that Google would not use its search engine to silence conservatives.       The real fireworks started when Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon (D-PA) who spoke just after Jordan, said, \u201cLadies and gentlemen, I\u2019d like to redirect your attention to antitrust law rather than fringe conspiracy theories.\u201d Then Jordan exploded, demanding to address the jab from his colleague. He yelled, he waved his arms, he refused to put his mask back on and be quiet. (Google, by the way, contributed just $2,000 to Scanlon\u2019s reelection campaign.)    Google\u2019s contributions to Jordan\u2019s reelection campaign are also noteworthy because of recent news about the Congressman. Jordan has been accused of turning a blind eye to the sexual abuse of student wrestlers during his time as an assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State University in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The allegations have earned Jordan his oft-used \u201cGym Jordan\u201d moniker on social media .    Google didn\u2019t immediately respond to the question of whether or not it intended to continue funding Jordan.    The antitrust subcommittee has been investigating the big tech companies for more than a year now, as have the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission. But that hasn\u2019t stopped some tech companies from continuing to give to the campaigns of Congresspeople, including some on the antitrust subcommittee. The following chart shows the donations the big five tech companies have made to the 2020 reelection campaigns for each member of the House antitrust subcommittee.       For the 2020 election, Google donated to committee vice chair Joe Neguse (D-CO), Judiciary Committee chair Jerry Nadler (D-NY), Ken Buck (R-CO), W. Gregory Steube (R-FL), Hank Johnson (D-GA), and Mary Gay Scanlon (D-PA). Ranking Republican member Jim Sensenbrenner is retiring from Congress, but Google donated to each of his Congressional campaigns dating back to 2008. None of this money stopped Google from having to face hard questions about its monopoly power during Wednesday\u2019s hearing.    Google isn\u2019t the only big tech company donated to Congresspeople on the subcommittee. Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook have all made campaign contributions to at least one subcommittee member for the 2020 election cycle. Both Google and Microsoft have donated to seven different Congresspeople who\u2019ve been actively investigating anti-competitive practices.    Campaign donations are just part of a multi-pronged strategy big tech companies use to influence policy in the Capital. They also fund  think tanks , some of which devise policy proposals for better ways to regulate competitive markets. Even though the antitrust committee members may end up writing new laws that directly affect the businesses of big tech companies, there\u2019s nothing illegal about the campaign contributions. It\u2019s how the system works.    For the tech companies, the dollar amounts of the campaign donations are small potatoes considering how much they make every quarter. There\u2019s a symbolic value to them. The donations don\u2019t buy easy treatment from lawmakers, and they don\u2019t prevent the adoption of broadly-supported regulations, but they can cause the voices of the donors to be heard more clearly in the midst of the debate.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42737694973</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GR-C141-F07F-82D3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"785\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Fast Company</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 1, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Our working assumption is that the insistence upon regulating the site - as with Google and other Big Tech enterprises - is nothing actually to do with whether regulation is necessary or not. They're simply big organisations and a certain mindset insists that bureaucracies and politics must regulate such. </p><p>Despite, you know, the inability of bureaucracies and politics to ever create such. Either that or there are an awful lot of bored prodnoses around.Today's reason why the regulation is what would happen if the sites failed[1]? Like banks in the 2008 financial crisis, Facebook and other tech giants are 'too big to fail', according to research from Oxford University that calls for new regulations to protect users, and society, in the event of a possible collapse.That's to misunderstand what too big to fail actually means. Which isn't that the organisation is big enough that we don;t want to see it fail therefore we'll rescue it if that failure looks likely. Rather, failure would bring the rest of the system down with it which is why we'll save such organisations. Losing Facebook - their example - would be somewhere between annoying and damaging but it wouldn't cause the collapse of Google, or Apple, or other social media and certain not the web or the internet. Sure, it's big and valuable but it's not systemically important and therefore not too big to fail. The other mistake in the analysis is this, from the actual paper[2]:Indeed, the closure of an online social network would not in itself be unprecedented. Over the last two decades, we have seen a number of social networks come and go \u2014 including Friendster, Yik Yak and, more recently, Google+ and Yahoo Groups. Others, such as MySpace, continue to languish in a state of decline. Although Facebook is arguably more resilient to the kind of user flight that brought down Friendster (Garcia et al., 2013; Seki and Nakamura, 2016; York and Turcotte, 2015) and MySpace (boyd, 2013), it is not immune to it. These precedents are important for understanding Facebook's possible decline. Critically, they demonstrate that the closure of Facebook's main platform does not depend on the exit of all users; Friendster, Google+ and others continued to have users when they were sold or shut down. Furthermore, as we examine below, any user flight that precedes Facebook's closure.Their method of Facebook closing own is that most to all users have already left to go elsewhere. In which case it's clearly not worth saving because the reason for the failure is that it's not being used - is not worth saving.Which rather neatly seems to skewer this justification for regulation of the platform. Not that that will stop people talking it up, For there really are a lot of bored prodnoses out there - or perhaps people who just cannot live with the idea that voluntary cooperation can be left to get on with itself without the oversight of bureaucracies or politicians.

Which isn\u2019t that the organisation is big enough that we don;t want to see it fail therefore we\u2019ll rescue it if that failure looks likely. Rather, failure would bring the rest of the system down with it which is why we\u2019ll save such organisations. Losing Facebook - their example - would be somewhere between annoying and damaging but it wouldn\u2019t cause the collapse of Google, or Apple, or other social media and certain not the web or the internet. Sure, it\u2019s big and valuable but it\u2019s not systemically important and therefore not too big to fail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"\"&gt;The other mistake in the analysis is this, from the actual paper:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"\"&gt;Indeed, the closure of an online social network would not in itself be unprecedented. Over the last two decades, we have seen a number of social networks come and go \u2014 including Friendster, Yik Yak and, more recently, Google+ and Yahoo Groups. Others, such as MySpace, continue to languish in a state of decline. Although Facebook is arguably more resilient to the kind of user flight that brought down Friendster (Garcia et al., 2013; Seki and Nakamura, 2016; York and Turcotte, 2015) and MySpace (boyd, 2013), it is not immune to it. These precedents are important for understanding Facebook\u2019s possible decline. Critically, they demonstrate that the closure of Facebook\u2019s main platform does not depend on the exit of all users; Friendster, Google+ and others continued to have users when they were sold or shut down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"\"&gt;Furthermore, as we examine below, any user flight that precedes Facebook\u2019s closure\u2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"\"&gt;Their method of Facebook closing own is that most to all users have already left to go elsewhere. In which case it\u2019s clearly not worth saving because the reason for the failure is that it\u2019s not being used - is not worth saving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"\"&gt;Which rather neatly seems to skewer this justification for regulation of the platform. Not that that will stop people talking it up, For there really are a lot of bored prodnoses out there - or perhaps people who just cannot live with the idea that voluntary cooperation can be left to get on with itself without the oversight of bureaucracies or politicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\" class=\"\"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Elizabeth Warren is right to call for more aggressive enforcement of antitrust laws in our new digital era. Google and Facebook particularly deserve greater scrutiny from U.S. regulators. Washington voters should follow closely, however, because the tech giants Warren called out  Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Facebook  are responsible for a large share of the state\u2019s recent job growth and increased tax revenue.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Warren, a consumer advocate and former law professor, is well qualified to start this conversation. But she may be squandering the opportunity. Her antitrust treatise, posted last week, seems designed to stoke resentment of big companies as much as protect consumers. It sets an arbitrary threshold on revenues of big tech companies, above which they are prohibited from selling products that use their platform. This could raise prices and stifle innovation, because services help cover the cost of investing in cloud services.</p><p> Breaking these companies up is likely to cause massive price increases or losses in quality, said Herbert Hovenkamp, an antitrust expert at the University of Pennsylvania. This would be particularly painful for Warren\u2019s Democratic working-class constituents who earn less and are more sensitive to price increases, he noted.</p><p> While it may play well with her activist labor base, demonizing popular companies like Amazon won\u2019t always fly with voters. This was demonstrated last year in deep blue Seattle, where city hall killed its \u201cAmazon tax\u201d on jobs only after labor polling found widespread public opposition to the measure.</p><p> The timing of Warren\u2019s attack on mergers is significant. She\u2019s part of a last-ditch, labor-affiliated effort to scuttle the merger of Sprint and T-Mobile US, a deal expected to bring enormous benefits to Washington.</p><p> Disappointingly, U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Seattle, has joined with Warren and other left-leaning members of Congress in opposing the deal, even though it\u2019s expected to preserve jobs held by many of Jayapal\u2019s constituents, create thousands of new jobs and prevent the loss of the Seattle area\u2019s last major telecom company.</p><p> Jayapal was unavailable to comment. But she recently co-signed a letter, leaning on research by the Communications Workers of America, opposing a \u201cdeal designed to destroy jobs and drive down wages, hurting American workers and consumers and threatening our economy.\u201d</p><p>T-Mobile\u2019s merger would combine the third- and fourth-place wireless companies to create a stronger competitor for the giants, Verizon and AT&amp;T. T-Mobile also plans to use Sprint\u2019s spectrum to push into home broadband, creating new competition for Comcast and other broadband providers.</p><p> Although T-Mobile isn\u2019t unionized, the company has benefited working people by driving down wireless prices. It\u2019s forcing larger carriers to offer more affordable wireless options to compete with its aggressive pricing. Some sort of merger is all but inevitable.</p><p>T-Mobile\u2019s Bellevue headquarters is in the congressional district of another progressive, U.S. Rep. Adam Smith. He said the merger \u201cholds great promise for our region\u2019s workers and local economy.</p><p> \u201cIf approved by regulators, I expect this merger to promote greater competition within the wireless industry; benefiting the Puget Sound area through the preservation and growth of jobs as well as our country\u2019s wireless customers through innovation and competition,\u201d Smith said in a statement.</p><p> Also supporting the merger is U.S. Rep. Suzan DelBene, a Medina Democrat whose district includes many T-Mobile employees. \u201cEven combined, T-Mobile and Sprint will still be No. 3 in terms of market,\u201d she noted.</p><p> Politicians calling for antitrust enforcement and stronger regulation of the internet\u2019s dominant gatekeepers are more than welcome. Especially if they avoid grandstanding and focus on truly protecting consumers and increasing competition.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LEWMT-3031810</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F1E11471D3CA2DB LEWMT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMS-7X31-JBCN-41RV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11805</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"654\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Tribune Publishing Co.

Never before have five companies held such powerful sway over the index, according to Morgan Stanley strategists. </p><p>The swelling at the top increasingly matters for regular investors, who have been putting more of their 401(k) accounts into funds that mimic the S&amp;P 500 and other indexes. The majority of money invested in U.S. stock funds is now in index funds, according to Morningstar, and any $100 going into an S&amp;P 500 index fund is automatically putting nearly $18 of it into just those five stocks. </p><p>The trends mean investors are increasingly beholden to the fortunes of five companies. Consider Jan. 30,  when Microsoft alone accounted for two thirds of S&amp;P 500 index funds' gains. These tech giants can carry just as much weight on the way down, and that increases risk for investors, particularly when the threat of additional, profit-reducing government regulation is hanging over the industry. </p><p>\"This doesn't have to correct itself immediately,\" Morgan Stanley strategists wrote in a recent report for investors, but they nevertheless see it as unsustainable. </p><p>Morgan Stanley sees the top 1% loosening its hold on the S&amp;P 500 in one of two ways. The first scenario has investors deciding on their own to move their dollars to less-loved areas of the market, which would be a positive for the overall stock market. The second would be more negative: Investors leave once the Big Five show they're unable to sustain their eye-popping growth. </p><p>Until then, the concentration at the top of the S&amp;P 500 puts more pressure on investors to keep their portfolios diversified, said Emily Roland, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VAPILT-VA0108384580</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VAPILT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y8K-NCT1-JBM5-R2HV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144571</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"335\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Virginian-Pilot Companies LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Virginian - Pilot (Norfolk, VA.)</publicationName><edition>1ST Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 23, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009QBX</classCode><className>MORGAN STANLEY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Apple[3] and Microsoft[4] both boast market caps above the four-comma threshold, while Amazon[5] sank to a $930 billion valuation after first breaching the level[6] in September 2018. The record-high valuation for Big Tech comes amid heightened regulatory scrutiny around data privacy and calls from governments around the world to break up the massive companies. Here are the five highest-valued tech stocks, ranked in ascending order. Visit the Business Insider homepage for more stories[7].Google-parent Alphabet[8] on Thursday became the fourth US company to reach a $1 trillion market valuation[9], pushing the total value of the five biggest tech companies to a record $5 trillion. </p><p>Apple[10] and Microsoft[11] sit well above the $1 trillion level, surging through the new year after massive gains in 2019. The S...00's information tech sector, which includes the two aforementioned companies, is up more than 5% year-to-date, outperforming all other groups in the benchmark index. Amazon[12] previously held a market value above the four-comma threshold but has since sank to roughly $930 billion. Facebook[13] sits at the lowest valuation among the group of five with a market cap of about $630 billion. Including Facebook in the group drives Big Tech's collective value above $5.2 trillion. CNBC[14] first reported on the milestone valuation for Big Tech. The record-high valuation for Big Tech arrives amid heightened scrutiny from regulators and US legislators. Calls to break up the most valuable tech firms have taken center stage at congressional hearings, Democratic primary debates, and in governments abroad as many view the companies as reaching monopolistic levels of influence. The European Union's antitrust regulators recently homed in on Big Tech following the Cambridge Analytica scandal, and the group is now grilling Google[15] over its data collection policies. State attorneys general in the US are also investigating the search engine giant[16], yet the months of regulatory pressure haven't held shares down. Alphabet jumped more than 30% in 2019 and is already up nearly 9% in the new year. Here are the five highest-valued tech companies, ranked in ascending order by market cap. Data is as of market close on January 16. 5. Facebook Markets InsiderMarket cap:$632 billion Year-to-date performance: up 8.5%4. Amazon Markets InsiderMarket cap:$931 billion Year-to-date performance: up 1.7%3.

Hype Cycle for Digital Advertising, 2020            Source: Gartner (July 2020)     Advanced Supply-Side Bidding (ASSB)   Demand for ASSB \u2013 techniques that allow publishers to solicit bids from multiple sources to fill an available ad spot \u2013 is a clear signal that removing barriers to open competition in media markets can yield major economic benefits for buyers and sellers. Marketers should expect continued innovation and pressure to be directed at similar attempts to level the playing field by addressing impediments to a less concentrated market.    However, the impact of regulatory developments on ASSB remains unpredictable, especially in regard to curtailing of trade in targeting data for advertising. As  programmatic ad markets  take the brunt of a pandemic-induced recession\u2019s impact on media budgets, it will likely take ASSB at least three more years to reach the Plateau of Productivity.    Ad Blocking    Over the last few years, ad blocking \u2013 the use of software to remove or filter the delivery of content identified as advertising from material published on the internet \u2013 has gained significant traction. However, attention and hysteria surrounding ad blocking have been recently eclipsed by concerns about the demise of third-party cookies and the chilling impact of COVID-19 on the digital ad market.    Underlying issues with ad blocking are still very much unresolved and unlikely to stabilize within the next two years. In the meantime, marketers must look to better balance customer choice and engagement with increasing demands for transparency.    Identity Resolution (IDR)    IDR holds great promise for marketers as they shift their sights to customer retention goals, do more with a  stagnant or cut budget  and apply first-party data to marketing programs. However, the technology is among the most active battlegrounds in a volatile power struggle between business interests, privacy regulators, and the largest digital platform providers \u2013 with consumers caught somewhere in the middle. Privacy obstacles put tremendous pressure on IDR practices, leading to its position on this year\u2019s Hype Cycle \u2013 the Trough of Disillusionment.    The future of IDR depends heavily on standardization \u2013 or supporting a universal user token compliant with consent requirements \u2013 which has been a rocky road. Marketers that altogether abandon efforts at using IDR to understand and communicate with customers, and those that rely on weak enforcement or sketchy privacy workarounds to obtain personal data, all risk negative impact.    Brand Safety    Brand safety has a renewed focus as of late, as marketers pay more attention to the  context in which their ads appear . Previously included in the profile for ad verification, brand safety has been separated based on its unique requirements and trajectory, as it is measured and managed separately from fraud and viewability.    As publishers evolve their ability to filter content, marketers will have a more reliable and direct way to manage their ad buys. However, as influencer marketing gains more investments, marketers will need to more closely scrutinize the process of influencer selection and look to technology to provide an efficient and reliable way to manage campaigns.    Ad Verification and Viewability    Ad verification and viewability \u2013 a fraud-prevention technology that verifies humans, not bots are the source of impressions and clicks \u2013 has emerged from the Trough of Disillusionment into the Slope of Enlightenment due to the recent trend of provider acquisitions by strategic buyers.    Marketers investing in digital advertising have a great deal to lose from ad fraud and viewability violations. Verification will be a necessary part of the settlement systems of buyers and sellers as the category moves toward maturity. Marketers will need to institute an approach to ad verification and viewability to ensure they can take full advantage of it and have confidence in the investment.

He's a narrative anti-catalyst, who takes all the elements of a fantastic story, and renders them lifeless, probably on purpose. The latest New Yorker contains about <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/09/17/can-mark-zuckerberg-fix-facebook-before-it-breaks-democracy\">14,000 exceedingly well-crafted words</url> about Zuckerberg, and yet, not once do we catch a glimpse the man outside his carefully managed cocoon of self-awareness. When there is a reporter around, he's never thinking aloud, or hanging around with his friends, or talking shit. He is never in the heat of the moment. He is the anti-Elon Musk.</p><p><br/>But Zuckerberg says what he means to say. If you <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/11/the-mark-zuckerberg-theory-of-community/546290/?utm_campaign=The+Interface&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=feed\">go back through Facebook's history</url>, Zuckerberg has telegraphed what his company will do. With that in mind, here are eight things that Zuckerberg said that are worth paying attention to, beginning with his argument against regulation.<br/>1. Why shouldn't Congress regulate big-tech companies?<br/>In the past,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/facebook-says-eus-privacy-investigations-hurt-innovation-economy/\">Facebook executives have warned</url>, with straight faces, that more onerous regulation would hurt smaller internet companies, further entrenching the company's own power. But in the New Yorker profile, Zuckerberg gave a different justification for the government to keep its hands off: American global competitiveness, and the specter of an internet dominated by Chinese companies.<br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/01/zuckerberg-2020/513689/?utm_source=feed\">Zuckerberg 2020?</url><br/>\"I think that anything that we're doing to constrain [big-tech companies] will, first, have an impact on how successful we can be in other places,\" he said. \"I wouldn't worry in the near term about Chinese companies or anyone else winning in the U.S., for the most part. But there are all these places where there are day-to-day more competitive situations-in Southeast Asia, across Europe, Latin America, lots of different places.\"<br/>2. Why has the company been so passive about ethnic cleansing in Myanmar?<br/>The       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-41566561\">brutal treatment of the Rohingya people</url> has garnered coverage around the world, with many       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-rohingya-facebook/u-n-investigators-cite-facebook-role-in-myanmar-crisis-idUKKCN1GO2PN\">humanitarian observers</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://slate.com/technology/2018/03/facebook-is-amplifying-ethnic-violence-in-myanmar-should-it-leave.html\">pointing their fingers</url> at Facebook's role in whipping up divisive fervor. Yet the company struggled to even face the problem       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/sheerafrenkel/fake-news-spreads-trump-around-the-world\">for years</url>. Zuckerberg offered the promise that the company knows it has problems there.<br/>\"We're taking this seriously,\" he said. \"You can't just snap your fingers and solve these problems. It takes time to hire the people and train them, and to build the systems that can flag stuff for them.\"<br/>He also said that he \"hates\" that Facebook is \"not moving as quickly as would like.\"<br/>3. Why is Mark Zuckerberg obsessed with Augustus, the Roman emperor? <br/>In perhaps the most fascinating section of the profile, Zuckerberg described his interest in Augustus, who, by his description, \"through a really harsh approach, he established two hundred years of world peace.\"<br/>His interest is longstanding. \"My wife was making fun of me, saying she thought there were three people on the honeymoon: me, her, and Augustus,\" Zuckerberg said of a 2012 trip to Rome. \"All the photos were different sculptures of Augustus.\"<br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/04/the-strangest-moments-from-the-zuckerberg-testimony/557672/?utm_source=feed\">The 13 strangest moments from the Zuckerberg hearing</url><br/>Osnos suggests that Zuckerberg is interested in the way the Roman leaders had to deal with very tough \"trade-offs,\" as Zuckerberg put it. Ancient Rome had \"good and bad and complex figures\" who were working out issues of power and the common good. What should one be willing to do to bring 200 years of world peace? Mark Zuckerberg has clearly considered this particular scale of justice.<br/>4. Is \"fake news\" an overblown problem?<br/>Here, we're talking about the original definition of \"fake news,\" which is hoax stories created whole-cloth from nothing. Many analyses found that these stories were very popular in the run up to the 2016 election, but were also a small percentage of the overall Facebook conversation around the election.<br/>Given the definition, Zuckerberg continues to think this kind of \"fake news\" is overblown. \"The average person might perceive, from how much we and others talk about it, that there is more than ten times as much misinformation or hoax content on Facebook than the academic measures that we've seen so far suggest,\" he said.<br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/10/what-facebook-did/542502/?utm_source=feed\">Did these hoaxes have an effect on the 2016 election?</url> \"I still think that's the kind of thing that needs to be studied,\" he told Osnos.<br/>5. Will one social network rule them all?<br/>The world is increasingly socially networked. Nonetheless, Zuckerberg tells the New Yorker \"there's a natural zero-sumness\" to these competing platforms. Facebook can't just build the \"best features,\" but has to build \"the best community.\"<br/>It would be interesting to know how Zuckerberg reconciles this belief with the fact that Facebook operates three different huge social networks-the core service, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Can there be multiple best communities?<br/>6. Does Zuckerberg read a traditional newspaper?<br/>\"There's really no newspaper that I pick up and read front to back,\" he said. \"Well, that might be true of most people these days-most people don't read the physical paper-but there aren't many news Web sites where I go to browse.\"<br/>7. Can technologists and doctors end disease? <br/>Zuckerberg talks briefly about the ambitions he has for the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the expansive,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/12/assessing-mark-zuckerbergs-non-charity-charity/418719/?utm_source=feed\">mostly philanthropic</url> effort he's committed 99 percent of his family's wealth to. One stated aspiration is to \"help cure all disease in our children's lifetime,\" but does Zuckerberg really think that's possible?<br/>\"On average, every year for the last 80 years or so, I think, life expectancy has gone up by about a quarter of a year. And, if you believe that technological and scientific progress is not going to slow, there is a potential upside to speeding that up,\" he said. \"We're going to get to a point where the life expectancy implied by extrapolating that out will mean that we'll basically have been able to manage or cure all of the major things that people suffer from and die from today. Based on the data that we already see, it seems like there's a reasonable shot.\"<br/>So, yes, he does believe there is a \"reasonable shot\" at helping cure all diseases in the next, say, 100 years.<br/>8. Does Mark Zuckerberg have emotions? <br/>I asked Zuckerberg whether he finds it insulting when people speculate that he lacks emotions. \"Insulting?\" he asked, and then paused for several seconds to consider. \"I don't find it insulting. I don't think it's accurate. I mean, I definitely care a lot. There's a difference between letting emotions drive impulsive decisions and caring.\" He went on, \"Ultimately, I think the reason that we built this successful thing is because we just solve problem after problem after problem, and typically you don't do that by making impulsive, emotional decisions.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLNOL-markzuckerbergscaseagainstregulatingfacebook569791</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLNOL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T7J-XSV1-JCG7-V42S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1098\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

Self-driving trucks. Practical quantum computers. 2017 has been an exciting year for science, technology - and digital health! It's that time of the year again when it's worth looking back at the past months; and list the inventions, methods and milestone events in healthcare to get a clearer picture what will shape medicine for the years to come.2017 - Amazing year for science and healthcareScientists, researchers, and innovators come up with amazing breakthroughs every year, and that was no different in 2017 either. </p><p>No matter whether we look at physics (proving the existence of gravitational waves[1]), astronomy (discovering new planets[2]) or biology (detecting a fluorescent frog in Brazil[3]), we come across mind-blowing scientific findings everywhere. Healthcare was no exception, moreover, some say the field of medicine is one of the most innovative fields today. Looking back at our expectations in digital health for 2017[4] in terms of trends, innovations or breakthroughs, there were at least three developments and three trends, which proved to be foresightful. The beginning of a new era in diabetes care is upon us with the realities of the FDA-approved artificial pancreas[5] or such small, but significant innovations as a glucose monitor built into phone cases[6]. Artificial narrow intelligence (ANI), mainly computer vision and natural language processing, started to take its place in healthcare - in spite of such bumps on the road until widespread use as overhyping the technology[7]. Precision medicine is incrementally reshaping cancer care methods: DNA-tests from tumors and patients are used to work out targeted treatments in the fight against cancer. Moreover, I predicted that a health insurance company will launch a package which will include fitness trackers and wearables; that a big tech company will step up its efforts in digital health; and further steps will be made in the development of the CRISPR genome-editing method. Although we still have to wait for the first clinical trials, New Scientist has already reported in April 2017 that there are as many as 20 human trials underway, mostly in China. But I rushed ahead of myself. Let's dive into the details step by step! If you prefer videos, here are the top 5 stories described in less than 3 minutes: Play Video[8] 1)\u00a0Canada started to embrace digital health[9]New technological solutions and breakthrough methods produced by the market cannot be fruitful without the appropriate regulations ensuring the safety, the rights and the freedom to innovate for every player. The Canadian government recognized the current challenges in their healthcare system and decided to take action. The Standing Senate Committee on Social Affairs, Science and Technology invited researchers, ethicists, entrepreneurs, and futurists like me to discuss the way forward. In October 2017, they published a report entitled Challenge Ahead: Integrating Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, and 3D Printing Technologies into Canada's Healthcare Systems[10] with actionable recommendations for the future. The Senate Committee realized the transformative power of 3D printing, A.I., and robotics, while it also seems to be willing to tackle ethical concerns, legal issues around these new technologies and their consequences on the labor market. The group recommended the government to host a Forum for Health Discovery so entrepreneurs and innovators could present their latest healthcare related work; to convene a National Conference on Robotics, A.I. and 3D Printing in Healthcare and establish various working groups to deal with technological, ethical and regulatory concerns of innovations in the industry. I believe this is the way for every responsible government to bring its healthcare system into the 21st century. 2) Insurance companies integrated fitness wearables into their programsLast year, I predicted that the accumulation of personal data stemming from wearables will lead a huge insurance company to launch a package containing wearable sensors and guidance about living a healthy life by measuring data. In November, Qualcomm and United Healthcare announced[11] that they have integrated Samsung and Garmin wearables into their national wellness program. It enables eligible plan participants to earn more than $1,000 per year by meeting daily walking goals. As according to estimations[12] 245 million wearable devices will be sold in 2019, more and more accurate data sets about our lifestyle through trackers and wearables become available. It is inevitable insurance companies will try to utilize them. I believe that in the future, smoking, drinking heavily, eating trashy food and not doing any sports might not only cost people a lot in terms of their expenses and their health on the long run, but it might also heavily burden their health insurance - e.g. through not being able to access certain privileges. 3) Artificial Intelligence ...diologyAs briefly mentioned above, the two most radically improving subfields of ANI, computer vision, and natural language processing, are taking their place in healthcare. Researchers achieved amazing results with computer vision in the field of medical imaging. Scientists at the University of Adelaide have been experimenting with an AI system that is said to be able to tell if you are going to die[13]. But that's just the tip of the iceberg. From IBM Watson through Philips, Agfa, Siemens until GE, giant healthcare players have already started integrating AI into their medical imaging software systems. Moreover, the FDA approved the first cloud-based deep learning algorithm for cardiac imaging developed by Arterys in 2017[14]. It is a giant leap towards integrating A.I. into radiology which might become part of radiologists' daily routine sooner than you think. Anna Fernandez, Health Informatics/Precision Medicine Lead at Booz Allen Hamilton told me that within 3 years we'll have many machine learning algorithms in active clinical pilot testing and in approved use. It will help diagnose simpler cases and take over repetitive tasks. However, I'm sure that radiologists' creative work will be necessary in the future to solve complex issues and supervising diagnostic processes. A.I. will not replace radiologists, but make them better! 4) The FDA approved the first 'digital pill'The amazing advancement of nanotechnology is making the production of 'digestibles[15]' as a potential way for drug making possible. These tiny pills or gadgets combined with a sensor could track digestion and the absorption of drugs after swallowing them. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the FDA, granted a green light for the first pill with a digital ingestion tracking system in 2017[16]. The drug called Abilify MyCite was developed by the Japanese Otsuka Pharmaceutical, augmented by an accompanying wearable patch produced by Proteus Digital Health. With the patient's approval, the ingestible sensor communicates with the wearable sensor patch if the drug is taken; then the information is transmitted to a smartphone or tablet of the caretaker or the patient himself. The ultimate aim is to measure drug adherence in the treatment of adults with schizophrenia, acute treatment of manic and mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder, and as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of major depressive disorders in adults. 5) Medical chatbots and health assistants on the riseChatbots, A.I. supported messaging apps or voice controlled bots[17] are forecasted to replace simple messaging apps soon. In healthcare, they could help solve easily diagnosable health concerns or support patient management, e.g. general organizational issues. In the last months, several signs have pointed to the direction that a more widespread use is forthcoming. Ada Health[18] has been the fastest growing medical app in Europe in 2017. Over 1.5 million people already tried the health companion app, which is able to assess the user's health based on the indicated symptoms using its vast, A.I.-based database. The UK's National Health Service (NHS) started to use[19] a chatbot[20] app for dispensing medical advice for a trial period in 2017, with the aim of reducing the burden on its 111 non-emergency helplines. The NHS is developing the app with Babylon Health[21], one of the new breed of paid, doctor-on-demand services[22]. Although the initial results how patients utilize the new resource show somewhat mixed achievements[23], I believe, this is the way to go in the future. 6) Medical VR for pain managementVirtual reality has been marching triumphantly into healthcare. In the past months, it turned out that it can offer an out-of-the-box solution for managing chronic pain and an effective prevention of the use of prescription opioids. Brennan Spiegel and his team at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center are experimenting with the technology and they found a significant drop in pain scores in case of VR therapies[24]. Josh Sackman, President of applied VR[25], a Los Angeles-based company offering patients a non-drug escape route out of pain or panic through virtual reality, told The Medical Futurist, that VR can help increase access to a low cost, yet effective pain management resource. He added, that in the US, there are currently 100 million sufferers of chronic pain; and VR offers an effective alternative for opioid painkillers supporting the fight against the recent opioid crisis[26]. Play Video[27] 7) Roche acquired mySugrAustrian diabetes management start-up, mySugr[28] has been specializing in app-based, all-around care for people with diabetes since 2012. Pioneer in gamification and creator of the diabetes monster, mySugr has already over a million registered users, is available in 52 countries and in 13 different languages. The successful venture was acquired by the global pharmaceutical company, Roche[29] during the summer. While the start-up itself remained a separate legal entity, its app became an integral part of Roche's new patient-centered digital health services platform in diabetes care. The acquisition made it possible for users to connect their mySugr app with Roche's Accu-Chek tools, such as the Accu-Chek Guide glucose meter. The deal is important as it shows that huge pharma companies started to understand the value of health tech start-ups' solutions and unique expertise. So, instead of trying to come up with their products and services on their own, they rather team up with market players coming up with niche, value-based results. I believe we'll see more similar arrangements in the future. 8) Microsoft launched a new healthcare divisionLast December, I predicted that the race among tech giants will not tone down when it comes to healthcare. Although Google, Apple, Microsoft, IBM, they all showed interest in medicine they should and they will step up their efforts[30]. Google has made steps forward in healthcare with Calico[31]. Human Longevity Inc.[32] joined forces with Cleveland Clinic for a human genomics collaboration aimed at disease discovery and making aging a chronic condition. IBM has been developing its artificial intelligence program, Watson, and puts it to use in cardiology and cancer care. For this year, I expected another tech giant making extra efforts in improving research in healthcare. In September 2017, Microsoft announced the launch of its new healthcare division[33] at its Cambridge research facility, as part of plans to use its artificial intelligence software to enter the health market. Its research plans include monitoring systems that can help keep patients out of hospitals, and large studies into conditions such as diabetes. 9) CRISPR and the first gene-edited embryosThe amazing genome editing method, CRISPR has the potential to transform medicine as we know it. Although its research is in its infancy, studies and clinical probes show the method's rapid development and incredible power. While in 2016, experiments showed how[34] scientists were able to treat mice with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy through gene editing, a year later the MIT Technology Review reported[35] about the first known attempt at creating genetically modified human embryos in the United States. I predicted that in 2017, we would have a great chance for launching the first clinical trials to test the real power of CRISPR in changing devastating diseases. It's happening. As I mentioned before, in May, New Scientist reported that as many as 20 human trials will be underway soon[36], mostly in China. A few months later, in October, Nature reported that Chinese researchers created cloned embryos with a genetic mutation[37] for a potentially fatal blood disorder; then precisely corrected the DNA through 'base editing', a modification of the CRISPR/Cas-9 to show how to potentially prevent the condition at the earliest stages of development. These stories will keep multiplying in the future and we have to pay a lot more attention to the ethical consequences! 10) The FDA about the future of 3D PrintingOn 4 December 2017, the FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb released a statement[38] reaffirming the agency's commitment to a 'new era of 3D printing of medical products[39].' The statement outlines that the regulatory institution has reviewed over a hundred 3D printed medical devices currently on the market: from spinal implants[40] and custom facial reconstructions to 3D printed pills - the first of which was given a green light by the FDA in 2015.[41] The FDA's document shows its confidence about the further spread of 3D printing in medicine and healthcare, and it also demonstrates its preparation for the coming developments in synthetic organ production and biomedical additive manufacturing. As for example, Organovo's first bioprinted products are expected to make it to the FDA in 201[42]9, we'll definitely hear a lot of regulatory discussions about 3D printing in 2018.2017 has indeed been an incredibly exciting year. We can't wait for all the amazing innovations coming our way next year. But whatever happens, The Medical Futurist team will be here and all over our social media channels to cover exciting news and provide the necessary context in order to step into the future well-informed and confident.

Representative Louie Gohmert who has refused to wear a mask, tested positive for the coronavirus Wednesday shortly before he was expected to travel with President Donald Trump to Texas.

Day 1,287 of the Trump administration, leaving exactly 97 days to go until the Presidential Election.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The President was in Texas today campaigning before a largely unmasked crowd in the midst of a terrible spike in illness there locally, trying to project the picture of strength as the coronavirus ravages that state. His visit came as Texas set a new single day death toll of 313. Trump didn`t mention that nor the thousands of Texans now infected with the virus. Here is some of what he did say.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DONALD TRUMP, (R) UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: It`s not just Texas oil, that the radical Democrats want to destroy, they want to destroy our country. These people are sick, there`s no respect but there is by you. And there is by 95% of our people. Our people love our country. And our people love our anthem and they love our flag. They don`t love our country in any way, shape or form.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: There are now over 4.4 million confirmed cases in our country and our national death toll has climbed past 151,000. Think of it this way the first death was five months ago today. Five months later, over 151,000 dead. Over 1300 people have died in just the past 24 hours.</p><p>California and Florida also reporting record numbers of fatalities and now Florida is facing a possible Tropical Storm running right up the middle of the state, which is already shutting down testing centers for the next several days.</p><p>Two key reports out today make it clear the nation is not winning this fight one from Johns Hopkins says \"the United States is not currently on course to get control of this epidemic.\" If that doesn`t get your attention, this will, from the Association of American Medical Colleges, \"If the nation does not change its course and soon, deaths in the United States could be well into the multiple hundreds of thousands.\"</p><p>Yet the President today was repeating his defense of Dr. Stella Immanuel, the Houston based physician and minister who has spoken of in no particular order, alien DNA, demon sperm and spontaneous pregnancies. She`s the one on that video talking about a cure for coronavirus saying, no one`s needs masks and talk up the malaria drug that the President once again is promoting.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I was very impressed with her and other doctors that stood with her. I know nothing about, I just saw her, you know, making a statement with very respected doctors. She was making a statement about hydroxychloroquine with other doctors that swear by it, they think it`s great.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: Earlier on this network, Dr. Anthony Fauci was adamant as he tried to set the record straight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: The scientific data, the cumulative data on trials, clinical trials that were valid, namely clinical trials that were randomized and controlled in the proper way. All of those trials show consistently that hydroxychloroquine is not effective in the treatment of coronavirus disease, or COVID-19.</p><p>We`ve got to follow the science and when there`s a video out there for a bunch of people spouting something that isn`t true. The only recourse you have is to be very, very clear in presenting the scientific data that essentially contradicts that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: Most medical experts agree that right now masks are the frontline defense against the virus. Also the simplest thing we can do. Today Republican Congressman Louie Gohmert of Texas tested positive. He`s been an ardent mask denier who just recently started wearing one. He apparently learned about his results this morning as he was about to board Air Force One for the trip to Texas with the President. In a statement, the Congressman offered his theory about his infection.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE LOUIE GOHMERT, (R) TEXAS: I can`t help but wonder if by keeping your mask on and keeping it in place that if I might have put some germs and wire some of the virus onto the mask and breathed it in, I don`t know. But I got it. We`ll see happens from here.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: If you miss the nuance there Gohmert is apparently blaming his mask wearing for the coronavirus. He`s on the House Judiciary Committee took part in yesterday`s hearing with the Attorney General. The two we`re seeing talking outside of the hearing room neither with a mask. Barr was tested today, his results were negative.</p><p>Speaker Pelosi has now mandated masks be worn on the floor of the House of Representatives. Coupled with concern over Trump`s response to the health crisis here within the U.S. there is growing alarm over his handling of a key global rival. In a portion of an interview with Axios, the President said during his recent call with Vladimir Putin, he never raised those reports of Russian bounties on the heads of our servicemen and women in Afghanistan.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You had a phone call with Vladimir Putin on July 23. Did you bring up this issue?</p><p>TRUMP: No, that was a phone call to discuss other things and frankly that`s an issue that many people said was fake news. If you look at some of the wonderful folks from the Bush administration, some of them not any friends of mine were saying that it`s a fake issue. But a lot of people said it`s a fake issue.</p><p>We had a call talking about nuclear proliferation, which is a very big subject where they would like to do something and so when I. We discussed numerous things. We did not discuss that, no.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And you`ve never discussed it with it him?</p><p>TRUMP: I have never discussed it with him, no. I would, I have no problem with it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Since you don`t believe the intelligence, that`s why?</p><p>TRUMP: Everything, you know, it`s interesting, nobody ever brings up China though, is bring Russia, Russia, Russia. They didn`t think it was real. They didn`t think it was worthy. I wouldn`t mind if it reached my desk, I would have done something about it. It never reached my desk because --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you read your recent brief?</p><p>TRUMP: I do. I read a lot. I comprehend extraordinarily well, probably better than anybody that you`ve interviewed in a long time. I read a lot.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: This morning at the White House, Trump claimed Colin Powell was the Bush administration figure who called it a fake issue. That was not the case. In fact, on this network Powell only spoke about media coverage of the report. Trump also added this about the reports of Russian bounties.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I don`t know why they`d be doing it, but if you tell me they`re doing it, I will certainly take that under consideration.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: How would you respond if Russia did turn out to have done that? How would you respond if --</p><p>TRUMP: I would respond appropriately. Nobody has been tougher on Russia.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: On another front today, the administration confirmed it intends to withdraw almost 12,000 of our troops from Germany, something a lot of people believe has been at or near the top of Vladimir Putin`s wish list for years. Those militarized federal agents in this country cracking down on protests in Portland may also be on the move the governor of Oregon says federal authorities have agreed to withdraw the forces tomorrow afternoon. But the Department of Homeland Security says the feds are staying there for now.</p><p>Also tonight, Atlanta, the city that became the center of nonviolent resistance during the civil rights struggle is paying final tribute to the late Congressman John Lewis. His funeral will take place there tomorrow. Barack Obama will deliver the eulogy, former presidents Clinton and Bush will also reportedly attend.</p><p>One more late item, tonight we learned Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is back in the hospital this time in New York. But again for a non-invasive procedure as it`s being called to clear a bile duct she`s expected to be out and well in a few days.</p><p>It`s a lot. Nothing our big three can handle as we start things off on a Wednesday night was Shannon Pettypiece, Veteran Journalist, Senior White House Reporter for us at NBC News Digital. Dr. Irwin Redlener Pediatrics, Physician and Clinical Professor at the School of Public Health at Columbia University, where he is also the Director of Columbia`s National Center for Disaster Preparedness. And Jeremy Bash, Former Chief of Staff at CIA and the Pentagon, former Chief Counsel to the House Intel Committee.</p><p>Good evening, and welcome to you all. And Shannon, I`d like to begin with. No briefing today because the President was on the road, not a peep from the Coronavirus Task Force. They have been invisible as a group of late. No mentioned by the President of the staggering death toll. Based on your reporting, is this just the way it`s going to be?</p><p>SHANNON PETTYPIECE, NBC NEWS.COM SENIOR WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: Well, inside the White House, the administration there is a big push to try and get messaging out specifically to the states that they see either experiencing a surge right now or on the cusp of seeing another surge. There`s about a dozen states, they`re watching very closely right now that they feel are at risk of becoming the next Florida or Arizona or California. So within the White House, within the administration, there was a big effort to get the message to the governors in those states, the mayors of the cities in those states and the public to follow the very basic principles that doctors have been trying to get people to follow for months now, the mask wearing, social distancing, avoid big crowds, don`t go to bars. That within the White House is acknowledged as the way to get out of this crisis that we are in.</p><p>There`s Dr. Birx has been pushing mayors and governors do these universal math mandates. Acknowledging that at this point, masks are the best way to get these cases under control and to get us to the point where we can have schools and sports and eat indoors again. So that`s what`s happening within the White House and behind the scenes and the White House is starting to push these doctors out more to do local media interviews, targeted interviews. But while the administration and the Coronavirus Task Force and the doctors are focused on governing, President Trump is clearly focused on the culture war issues, not the governing issues and when you see things like and this is how was explained to me by, you know, someone who`s one of the close advisor to the President, when you see things like tweeting out this hydroxychloroquine video of the doctor motive, the alien DNA and the demon spirits and all of that, that`s part of his culture war battle. It`s not about governing to him. It`s about this fight against the mainstream media that is -- that he perceives is trying to unfairly characterize hydroxychloroquine.</p><p>It`s about this culture war, about masks and independence and opening up the economy. That`s what he is focused on waging. And also, of course, trying to shift the attention to issues like crime and anarchy with sending these federal agents to Portland, and continuing to bring up this idea that the suburbs are going to be destroyed by people living in low income housing. He`s fighting a culture war. Other people in the administration are trying to govern to get this virus under control. And they clash when you see these contradictory messages like we are running into over and over again on these basic public health principles.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Dr. Redlener, Shannon, of course is 100% right. I know you signed up to fight disease and not a culture war. But here`s the question now that even mask wearing is caught up in a partisan culture war. And now that this virus right now is eating up so much real estate in our country, could you make a case that the danger we face right now is in its own way worse than say, March and April?</p><p>DR. IRWIN REDLENER, EXPERT ON PANDEMIC INFLUENZA: Yeah, of course. And what we`re playing now is a very lethal game of whack a mole, Brian, it`s not even a second wave, it`s just that it popped up, of course, and had a major epicenter consequence for America in the northeast and in New York City in particular. And now it`s in the Sun Belt and Phoenix and California and so on.</p><p>And a couple of points here, you know, the case, count right now is about 4,300,000 or so cases. But as Dr. Fauci pointed out, and the CDC confirmed, these are only the test confirmed cases, it`s actually probably 10 times that. So we`re dealing with about 45 million cases in the United States right now. And there`s no doubt that this death toll is going to rise to many hundreds of thousands of people have been saying, I wouldn`t be surprised we`ve reached 800,000 by the end of this year.</p><p>So we have just a massive problem going on here with a confluence of the public health concerns and the politicalization of this horrendous problem. You know, the issue about wearing masks has become so politicized and, Brian and I have talked about this before, you don`t even need a mag hat anymore to know where you stand. So if you`re defying wearing a face mask, the basic public health threat that we have here, you don`t need the mag hat. Everyone knows where you stand if you`re not wearing a face mask. This is the responsibility of the president United States. And it`s really just extraordinarily irresponsible.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Jeremy Bash in the frog boiling experiment that has become American life in 2020. Please note, no one was surprised today when Jonathan Swan got the president to answer that, no, he in fact, didn`t say to Putin, hey, are you paying bounties to kill our guys and Afghanistan? That elicited no surprise. I want to play this for you though. This is a woman who has spent her professional life studying former KGB agent Vladimir Putin. Here is Fiona Hill from today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FIONA HILL, FORMER NSC SENIOR DIRECTOR FOR EUROPEAN AND RUSSIAN AFFAIRS: Who is looking to see what he can get out of it no matter who it is. I mean, clearly he wants to have a weaker U.S. president as a matter of who. And you know, he`ll be looking to see if that`s the kind of the case because the more that the U.S. is bogged down in its own internal contradictions and the weaker the president is domestically but also perceived internationally, the less likely it is for the U.S. to try to restore a leadership role.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: So Jeremy Bash, what might this mean for what`s going to be our second straight, susceptible to Russian interference presidential election?</p><p>JEREMY BASH, FORMER, CIA CHIEF OF STAFF: Well, Brian every hour that the President spends being commander-in-chief in a culture war, he`s abdicating his constitutional responsibility to be commander-in-chief for the national security of the United States. And there was no greater example, I think, in this interview that you referenced with Axios, in which the President acknowledged that he has not raised the issue with Vladimir Putin of Putin`s potential payments to the Taliban to target U.S. forces. So the President not only failed to rebuke the Russian leader, but in fact, he acquiesced to it. He is allowing it and he`s dismissing the credible reports the intelligence that did land on his desk, when he said it didn`t come to my desk. That`s a flat out lie. It came to his desk in a written presidential daily brief after the President claimed, well, I don`t read that, but it wasn`t even brought up orally. His aides did discuss it with him, and he has done precisely nothing, precisely nothing to push back on Russia and protect those men and women that he himself sends into harm`s way to defend our freedom.</p><p>WILLIAMS: And Jeremy while I have you explained to the good people watching why will make Putin very happy to withdraw 12,000 U.S. troops from Germany?</p><p>BASH: Well, to Fiona Hill`s point Brian, you know, the U.S. has enjoyed a strong relationship with Germany, Germany is a key NATO ally. And Vladimir Putin`s whole agenda is to disintegrate the U.S.-Europe Alliance, the NATO Alliance, the alliance between the United States and Germany. Germany, of course, was the country where the Berlin Wall fell, where the Iron Curtain was lifted after the reunification of Germany in 1991. So it`s very symbolic when Trump orders the withdrawal of 12,000 troops from Germany including 6000 out of Europe all together. This is exactly what Vladimir Putin wants. He thinks that makes America weaker. He thinks that makes Europe weaker, and he believes it makes Russia stronger.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Shannon, back to issues domestic is the extra benefit for those out of work going to just evaporate on Friday without anything to replace it?</p><p>PETTYPIECE: I mean, we`ve watched enough of these battles now between this administration and Congress, they`re really anything could happen. You know, it certainly seems like you have people whose financial livelihoods are on the line here. If this expires, you would think there`ll be a short term deal. But of course, remember that government shutdown when again, you had people`s financial livelihoods on the line, and they shut down the government for weeks on end.</p><p>You know, that`s still a lot of time between now and Friday in congressional hours. So there could be some short term deal and it sounded today like the President, Steve Mnuchin were open to the idea of something that just addresses eviction moratorium and extending that as well as some short-term unemployment. They got to get Democrats on the page. And right now there`s about a $2 trillion divide between where Democrats and Republicans are.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Dr. Redlener, the governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis said today, he would have no problem sending his children to school. CNN quickly pointed out he doesn`t have school aged children. Have you seen anything this week that would make you less reluctant to send your grandson to a classroom?</p><p>REDLENER: Well, there`s so much confusion about this, Brian. There`s actually no perfect solution to all this, except if we doubled or tripled the number of classrooms, which we do, by the way, we just take money. So we could actually separate people. And we can have ways of protecting teachers and staff and so on.</p><p>But right now, many, many jurisdictions are hitting towards this solution of, you know, random schedules for kids, some kids going one week and alternating that going the following week, or some children going one or two days a week and that`s it. And this is, you know, a solution but not a very good one because parents that are working and especially low income, and low income jobs, need to have a dependable regular school day for their kids.</p><p>So these solutions that are cropping up all over the country are generally inadequate in one way or another and it`s never going to satisfy everyone. So we`re in a big dilemma right now but the last thing we want to do is either expose children or their teachers to conditions that are unsafe. It`s fixable, but we need a lot more money and a lot more support from the federal government to make sure we have the money to create safe conditions in the classrooms.</p><p>That said, it is critical that kids get back on the educational trajectory. My grandchild will be fine one way or another, they can handle the remote access to school and they have the hardware and the access to the internet. But for many, many low income families, their children do not have access to the internet. They don`t have support for doing remote learning and most in many cases. So we have a huge problem where we`re getting the necessary educational trajectory for children against the public health conditions. And since we`ve done such a horrible job, and getting this epidemic under control, we`re left with no good choices at the moment with respect to returning to school unfortunately, Brian.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Much obliged to our three experts for starting us off tonight, Shannon Pettypiece, Dr. Irwin Redlener and Jeremy Bash. Thank you all.</p><p>Coming up for us a big voice from the smallest state in our union takes on Bill Barr, the titans of tech, and now a mask averse colleague from across the aisle with the coronavirus. We`ll talk to him next.</p><p>And later Joe Biden`s been waiting for his moment now he`s days away from revealing what will be his most consequential decision to date. We`ll preview the possible pics with Obama`s campaign manager as the 11th Hour is just getting underway on this Wednesday night.</p><p>WILLIAMS: So as we mentioned, Louie Gohmert tested positive for the coronavirus and he is actually, as we heard him say, blaming his mask wearing for it.</p><p>And Politico has this new detail. They received an email from one of the congressman aides. And it reads, thank you for letting our office know Louie tested positive for the coronavirus. When you write your story, can you include the fact that Louis requires full staff to be in the office including three interns, so that we would be an example to America on how to open up safely? When probing the office, you might want to ask how often we were often where people be rated for wearing masks.</p><p>For more on this and other topics we welcome to the broadcast congressman David Cicilline, the Rhode Island Democrat. He`s a member of both the House Foreign Affairs and judiciary committees.</p><p>Congressman, thanks very much for coming on. Do you worry about your exposure to Gohmert? And have you had your mask check for the coronavirus because that`s apparently how you get it?</p><p>REPRESENATATIVE DAVID CICILLINE, (D) RHODE ISLAND DUCIALLY COMMITTEE MEMBER: Yeah, it`s a really reckless thing to say. Of course, everyone should be following your public health guidelines and wearing a mask. Unfortunately, many of my Republican colleagues refused to do so. Thankfully the speaker put into place a requirement that everyone must wear a mask while in capital buildings that should not have been necessary. It really is a matter of not only public safety and public health, but it`s being responsible.</p><p>And Mr. Gohmert, unfortunately, was one of those people who didn`t wear a mask very often during committee hearings, endangering other people potentially, and really reckless behavior.</p><p>WILLIAMS: We played the following on the broadcast last night. We`re going to play it again. You were there for it. Here`s part of your exchange, with your apparent close personal friend, the Attorney General yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CICILLINE: Is it ever appropriate, sir, for the President to solicit or accept foreign assistance in an election?</p><p>BILL BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: It depends what kind of assistance.</p><p>CICILLINE: Is it ever appropriate for the president or presidential candidate to accept or solicit foreign assistance of any kind in his or her election?</p><p>BARR: No, it`s not appropriate.</p><p>CICILLINE: OK. Sorry, you had to struggle with that one, Mr. Attorney General.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: Congressman, why isn`t that a lay-up shot for him? Is that a close call?</p><p>CICILLINE: It`s -- it was shocking. Of course, it`s not a close call is always inappropriate to accept or solicit foreign assistance in a presidential campaign. The American people get to decide who will be the president United States, not any foreign government. It was shocking to hear the Attorney General first answer that by saying, it depends what kind of assistance. That`s a ridiculous claim.</p><p>And I think it was in part because he`s worried about the response from the President United States who we know has in fact accepted foreign assistance from 2016 solicited from Ukraine and the upcoming election and has publicly invited other foreign countries to come and help and study publicly. He would accept it.</p><p>So I think the Attorney General was actually afraid to answer the question the way he should have immediately and said, it is of course improper any legal for the president United States or any presidential to accept foreign assistance. And I think he finally realized that he had to finally acknowledge that that was the right answer. But it was very disappointing, but not surprising that he struggled with it.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Never a dull moment in front of your committee, you had the Four Kings of tech are the four horsemen depending on your persuasion today, the four largest tech firms in the country. Devil`s advocate is it their fault that they have grown so big their companies have grown so big and have the influence they have in American life? Or is that not the point?</p><p>CICILLINE: Well, it`s not the point. Look, they have grown and we began a hearing today that was really the culmination of a more than a year long investigation that has been done by the antitrust subcommittee, the first major antitrust investigation done by Congress in 50 years. These dominant technology platforms have enormous market power, really monopoly power. And today`s hearing really confirm. That that allows them to abuse competitors that allows them to favor their own products and services. It allows them to diminish innovation, and to really keep people on their platforms because they don`t really have any competition.</p><p>We have a long history in this country of battling democracy against monopolies. We have not done good antitrust enforcement, both Republican and Democratic administrations. Congress has not properly asserted its role in conducting oversight. But this is the beginning of a new era. This was a bipartisan investigation that began a year ago. Today`s hearing, I think there were tough questions by Republicans and Democrats really getting at the dangers of this kind of market power, the kind of concentration that these big large technology platforms have that allow them to harm consumers to really decrease innovation, to bully competitors, and to really behave like monopolies. And so we`re going to finish our investigation, prepare a report with a set of recommendations to get the digital marketplace working properly to bring real competition back into this space.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Congressman Cicilline with the great state of Rhode Island, thanks for working late. Thanks for having us in and sparing a couple minutes for our broadcast. Great to have you appreciate it very much.</p><p>CICILLINE: My pleasure. Thanks.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Coming up for us. Joe Biden says he`ll announce his VP pick within days. We`ll talk to Barack Obama`s former campaign manager about what we know about the shortlist.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>MICHELLE OBAMA, FORMER FIRST LADY: I think too many young people who question whether voting, whether politics is worth it.</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: Well, partly because they have been told the message is sent every day that government doesn`t work. But all government is us, collectively making decisions together.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: Michelle Obama kicked off the inaugural episode of her new podcast with a special guest who sounded a lot like the 44th president, their discussion focused on community and working together to change government. A few hours ago, the 45th president took a noticeably different route.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: They don`t love our country, in any way, shape, or form. They don`t love our country is no respect but there is by you. And there is by now 95 percent of our people, our people love our country and our people love our anthem and they love our flag.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: Back with us again tonight, David Plouffe, former Obama Campaign Manager, Senior Advisor to President Obama also is on the Board of Directors of the Obama Foundation. His latest work is \"A Citizens Guide to Beating Donald Trump\" which if nothing else, tells you which side of the political spectrum he is on.</p><p>Hey, David, this tweet from the president this morning. I`m happy to inform all of the people living their Suburban Lifestyle Dream, capitalized like it`s a magazine, title that you will no longer be bothered or financially hurt by having low income housing built in your neighborhood. Your housing prices will go up based on the market and crime will go down. He has rescinded the Obama-Biden Fair Housing rule.</p><p>David unless your dog is deaf, this is no longer dog whistle. This is stuff he is straight up saying out loud other than the base. Who is he going to attract with that?</p><p>DAVID PLOUFFE, FORMER OBAMA CAMPAIGN MANAGER: Right, Brian, he`s not disguising it anymore. It makes me think that the Republican Convention is going to be like a white power hour every night.</p><p>So, so first of all, Brian, it`s so true. I think Trump must have been briefed by his campaign team that he`s eroding in the suburbs. He`s losing what support he had Biden`s strengthening. And you know, rather than thinking, what could I change about my response to the pandemic, or the way I talk about issues, he`s just saying Biden`s going to get rid of the suburbs, and, you know, you`re going to have hordes of criminals in your community and on the person that keep you safe. No one`s buying, by the way, I`m not this wouldn`t have worked back in the 50s. Much less, you know, 2020. So it`s very puzzling to me.</p><p>So I think Trump at least now accepts that he`s having political problems in the suburbs, which could cost him a second term, but he has no earthly idea what to do about it, other than his ridiculous scare tactics which I think for the most part, people are tuning out.</p><p>WILLIAMS: David, I note the DNC named Mayor Bottoms, and Senator Duckworth, co-chairs of the upcoming convention, even while it may be on Zoom, people immediately wondered if that was a consolation prize of sorts, knowing you`re probably not going to answer this. I`m duty bound to ask you anyway, who would you like it to be? Who do you think it`s going to be?</p><p>PLOUFFE: Well, Brian, this is not just a dodge. I mean, Joe Biden went through this process in 2008. He was selected, he served in the job. So this is mostly about his partner in the White House, not as partner on the campaign trail. And so I think 90 percent of this will be who do I want serving by my side if I win, and so that`s much less about who helps me win a state which I don`t think really is a factor who was going to help you raise more money.</p><p>You want in the campaign, you know, somebody who`s going to do well in that one debate with Mike Pence, assuming there is one, someone who would give good speech, the day that they`re selected, somebody gives a good convention speech. That`s really the extent of it. And somebody who`s ready to be president on day one, and I think anybody that Joe Biden`s going to have on his really shortlist, I think will pass that bar. So I know that`s a boring answer. But that`s the truth.</p><p>I will say, I went through this process with President Obama. It is a very lonely decision for these people. So people like me who are advisor, you know, it`s the thing they were least interested in our opinion, and quite frankly, they listened to it. He listened to it, but he had to live with this decision.</p><p>So this is Joe Biden`s first executive decision. And it`s a very lonely decision, a very personal decision. But I`m sure he`ll get it right because he served in the job. And he knows that this is unusual times. He needs somebody who can help him deal with pandemic, getting a vaccine distributed, digging out of an economic recession will be luckily if we`re not in depression, rebuilding alliances, you know, protecting healthcare. So the task here is enormous. So he needs somebody who`s a great partner in terms of a counselor, but somebody who can take on MIDI projects.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, you put it that way. It sounds like an important choice that we will learn about just days from now. David Plouffe, thanks for having us in. Always a pleasure to have you. Thank you very much for coming on.</p><p>Coming up for us, four of the richest men in the world trying to defend their tech industry to lawmakers with why any of that matters and what we learned after this long day coming up.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JIM JORDAN (R), OHIO: I`ll just cut to the chase big techs out the gate conservatives.</p><p>REP. MATT GAETZ (R), FLORIDA: I believe it is in fact your company that is engaging in election interference. And it`s not just my view.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think at this point, it`s fairly obvious that technology platforms have been stifling Conservative News and opinions.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: So that`s the one side, that`s what Republicans were focused on as they question four of the nation`s big tech execs today, but the purpose of today`s House hearing, as we heard in our earlier segment was to talk about antitrust issues.</p><p>The Times puts it this way, Democrats on the committee quickly dug into the issue of competition, citing documents obtained from inside the tech companies that they said showed their anti-competitive conduct.</p><p>For more and long last we welcome to this broadcast Scott Galloway. He`s a professor at the NYU Stern School of Business. I knew I was going to screw that up and the author of \"The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google,\" also co-host of New York Magazine podcast Pivot alongside our friend, the technology journalist Kara Swisher.</p><p>Big fan. Thank you for coming on. And I hope it`s the first of many appearances and I`ll start with a devil`s advocate question in a pandemic. Why should Americans who may view Amazon as a lifeline during this time, who casually pick up their Apple phone, use it to Google something, use to hop on Facebook have baked all of this into their lives. Why was today important for them? Why should they care about this hearing?</p><p>SCOTT GALLOWAY, NYU PROFESSOR, STERN SCHOOL OF BUSINESS: First off, thanks for your generous words. It`s good to be with you, Brian. So I think that today was typically these things are more spectacle than historic. And I would argue that this was fairly historic and that this might have been the beginning of the end, big tech, as we know it. This was more confirmation of the 13 or the combination of a 13 month investigation over a million documents.</p><p>And these witnesses were really just props for the committee to basically go through all the reasons that they feel that these companies are suppressing innovation, avoiding taxes, crushing competition. So why should we care as citizens? I think our prices have gone up if you`re a parent, your prices have gone up in terms of teen depression because there`s no reason for Facebook to compete and put in place safeguards. If you`re an entrepreneur the fastest growing parts of our economy are dominated by Google, obviously prices have gone up. And if you`re a taxpayer, the most profitable companies in the world seem to have overwhelmed Washington and engage in massive tax avoidance.</p><p>So our prices which is typically kind of the measure for any trust have skyrocketed. So I think this was more historic and spectacle. I think this is the beginning of the end, as big tech as we know it, Brian.</p><p>WILLIAMS: So you and I are old enough to remember one phone company and you had to even buy the phone from that phone company until Judge Green came along and busted it up. Can I assume from your answer that in our remaining lifetime, we`re going to see real regulation and or busting up of some of these de facto monopolies?</p><p>GALLOWAY: I believe so. What was interesting o telling is before the hearings kicked off, you had tweets advocating to break these firms up from Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump. This is a rare bipartisan issue now.</p><p>Now, it felt like we went to committee hearings today. The Republicans want to break them up because of what they pursue -- Democrats want to break them up because what they feel are anti-competitive practices. But it`s rare that you see some sort of consensus now, regardless of why they want to break them up, there seems to be some consensus.</p><p>And you brought up AT&amp;T, Brian, there`s few things our government seems to get right all the time and breaking up companies seems to be one of those things. When we broke up AT&amp;T, there was the same nationalist argument. We need a national champion. We need a big company to make the requisite investments. Big is good. We broke these companies up and just 10 years later, these companies each were worth more than the original company and we unlocked incredible innovation and shareholder value, fiber, data cell, that it all ended up were lying dormant. PayPal spun from eBay is now worth multiple times more than the parent company.</p><p>So there`s a lot of great reasons to break up a company. It`s good for shareholders, it`s good for the tax base. It`s good for employees. The only thing that -- the only individual that it`s bad for is the CEO who wants to remain in front of Westeros, just not just not one of the seven rounds. So this is one of the few things that government always seems to get right is breaking up companies.</p><p>WILLIAMS: This is what we are trying to tell our viewers you will gain by listening to the podcast we mentioned. Scott Galloway, please come back on and talk about your point, your point on higher education that it`s become a very expensive streaming service these days. But please come back on the broadcast. Thank you for having us in and sharing a few minutes with us tonight.</p><p>GALLOWAY: Thank you.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Coming up, it`s a seven-month trip starting with tomorrow`s rocket launch. And when it lands, the whole world will be watching this little thing. The story when we continue.</p><p>WILLIAMS: So if you want to go to the moon in space terms, it`s relatively easy. If you push it you can be there in three days. Mars, something else entirely. Just the launch window opens once every 26 months. That`s when the orbits of Earth and Mars align.</p><p>So, tomorrow morning, weather permitting, NASA`s Mars rover will lift off from Cape Canaveral on its mission to Mars. It`s a hall. It takes about seven months to get there before the rover can begin its search for evidence of life. We get the full story tonight from NBC News correspondent Tom Costello.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TOM COSTELLO, NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Headed for Mars tomorrow, a new rover named Perseverance and boy is it loaded with cameras and probes and drills to collect soil and rock samples for a future trip to Earth. Even a microphone so we can all hear what Mars sounds like, but it`s the tiny helicopter or drone that`s getting the most attention. It`ll fly just 15 feet off the ground, surveying the Martian landscape.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We`re shooting hoping to be like the Wright brothers moment. But on another planet at Mars. Yes, we`re extraordinarily excited.</p><p>COSTELLO: The Mars 2020 mission is headed for a cold dry crater wants an ancient lake where scientists hope to find signs that microbial life did or does exist. NASA Chief Jim Bridenstine.</p><p>JIM BRIDENSTINE, NASA ADMINISTRATOR: I`m not saying it was inhabited, I don`t know. But I can tell you this. It looked a lot like Earth about 3 billion years ago.</p><p>COSTELLO: This mission also laying the groundwork for eventual human trips to Mars.</p><p>ASAD ABOOBAKER, NASA INSTRUMENTS SYSTEMS ENGINEER: Getting to Mars, obviously with humans is very difficult surviving on Mars is very difficult. Getting back from Mars is very difficult.</p><p>COSTELLO: We often assign human qualities to our space probes envious of the places they go. Tomorrow, Perseverance is headed to Mars leaving us to wait and wonder. Tom Costello, NBC News, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILLIAMS: And while it`s way too early for those of us on this shift lift off from Cape Canaveral, 7:50 a.m. tomorrow. Coming up, creepy packages from the other side of our planet arriving in American homes. Problem is no one asked for them. We`ll have the story after this.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Last thing before we go here tonight also happens to be our consumer news segment. People in at least 28 states over half the country have reported receiving small packages lately that they didn`t order. They usually come by mail in yellow or white envelopes or small pouches. They often have Chinese rights because they are from China. The packages contain seeds that no one in this country ordered. No one knows what they grow. No one wants to find out. Here is a portion of the reporting on this story from our NBC station in Chicago WMAQ.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>AMBER ECKERT, ILLINOIS RESIDENT RECEIVED MYSTERY SEEDS: This is the package it says it has jewelry.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The delivery from China showed up at Amber Eckert`s house in Wheaton.</p><p>ECKERT: I didn`t even think twice to open it. And I thought jewelry I mean even it kind of felt like maybe like a little chain or something. I thought what I ordered I don`t remember, what my husband`s buy.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Packed inside was a tiny bag of seeds that no one ordered.</p><p>ECKERT: It`s pretty weird. I figure the world feels upside down the way it is anyways, so to have these mystery seeds being sent out, who knows a little bizarre.</p><p>MARYANN BROWER, MINNESOTA RESIDENT RECEIVED MYSTERY SEEDS: This is so bizarre.</p><p>UNIDENTIDIED MALE: Similar seeds are ending up in mailboxes across the country.</p><p>BROWER: Getting seeds from China. It`s like what the heck is this, to be perfectly out of.</p><p>(END VIDOETAPE)</p><p>WILLIAMS: It straight up creepy and it`s believed to be an e-commerce tactic called brushing. It means someone gets your name and address from somewhere, usually a third party seller and is sending you something unsolicited to claim you as a customer so they can then post a bogus positive review for any product they wish.</p><p>As for the seeds, this is really important. They could be an invasive species. They could carry disease or agricultural blight or harm animals. Ideally, your state Agriculture Department would like to examine them and dispose of them for you.</p><p>But one firm request they`re making of people is don`t throw these in the trash, because they could take root in landfills. The experts are actually asking you to destroy them any other way. So smash them with a hammer bake them in the oven throw them in a fire.</p><p>Again creepy but there are now warnings posted in all 50 states to be on the lookout for these as they are arriving unsolicited every day. So be warned. And isn`t this story as the woman said perfectly in keeping with the year we are having so far.</p><p>That`s our broadcast on a Wednesday night. Thank you so very much for being here with us. On behalf of all my colleagues at the networks of NBC News, good night.</p><p>THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

That`s in \"The 11th Hour with Brian Williams,\" and that starts now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BRIAN WILLIAMS, THE 11TH HOUR, HOST: Tonight, the new NBC News reporting on a series of sit-downs between Trump and special counsel legal teams as an aggressive strategy place out. Trump singles out Mueller by name and hires a new lawyer from the ranks of cable news.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, pay no attention to the chaos behind the curtain. The latest reporting from the White House saying the President is now more comfortable in the job. And the Friday night firing that sends shockwave to through Washington, a former colleague of Andrew McCabe weighs-in on the weekend of personal attacks from the President.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The 11th Hour\" on a Monday night getting under way now.</p><p>And good evening once again from our NBC News headquarters here in New York. Day 424 of the Trump administration. And the President`s response to the Mueller investigation moves into a new phase.</p><p>\"The Washington Post\" reporting that the President is shaking up his legal team, adding a former federal prosecutor, former U.S. attorney as well, who is well known to viewers of Fox News who says Mr. Trump is the target of an FBI conspiracy. More on that in just a moment.</p><p>We are also learning from the \"Post\" about how the President`s lawyers are trying to curtail the scope of the special counsel`s potential interview with the President. According to their reporting, two sources say, attorneys \"provided the special counsel`s office with written descriptions that chronicle key moments under investigation in an effort to limit any session between the President and Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III to a few select topics. Trump has told aides he is chomping at the bit to sit for an interview, according to one person.\"</p><p>Trump lawyer, John Dowd call this report old news but our NBC News colleague, Kristen Welker reports, a source tells her that there`s ongoing communication between the President`s legal team and the special counsel, which includes turning over some documents. And our Senior White House Correspondent, Hallie Jackson, tells us tonight, the two legal teams met recently and that such meetings happened \"regularly,\" in other words, they`ve been talking and they continue to talk.</p><p>As we mentioned, Donald Trump has hired another lawyer for the team handling the Russia Investigation. He is Former U.S. Attorney, Joseph diGenova. DiGenova is a frequent contributor to the President`s network of choice where he made public his allegation of an FBI Justice Department plot against the President.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOSEPH DIGENOVA, DONALD TRUMP LAWYER: Make no mistake about it. A group of FBI and D.O.J. people were trying to frame Donald Trump of a falsely created crime.</p><p>They were going to exonerate Hillary and they were going to frame Donald Trump.</p><p>What they have done to the department and the FBI is undermine the confidence of the American people in federal law enforcement. It is disgraceful. And it all stems from their animus towards President Trump.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: Joe diGenova has been around a long time. He`s well known in Washington.</p><p>This quote from a \"Wall Street Journal\" op-ed written by him in 1997 during the investigation of Bill Clinton is getting a wide circulation tonight for reason you`re about to see. \"Nobody should underestimate the upheaval that a prosecution of the President would cause. But we went through it once before, in Watergate, and survived. The nation, in fact, could conceivably benefit from the indictment of a President. It would teach the valuable civics lesson that no one is above the law.\"</p><p>President Trump spent the weekend criticizing the investigation and for the first time, he went after the special counsel by name. \"The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime. It was based on fraudulent activities and a fake dossier paid for by crooked Hillary and the DNC and improperly used in FISA court for surveillance of my campaign. Witch hunt.\"</p><p>Trump`s lawyer, John Dowd, also called for an unending investigation fueling new concerns about the special counsel`s future. Ty Cobb, another member of the legal team tried to allay those fears with a statement saying, the President was not considering firing Robert Mueller.</p><p>Republican Congressman Trey Gowdy warned of the consequences of moving against the special counsel.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. TREY GOWDY (R), SOUTH CAROLINA, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: I would just counsel the President, it`s going to be a very, very long, bad 2018. And it`s going to be distracting from other things that he wants to do and was elected to do.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: There is also more fallout from the firing of former FBI Deputy Director, Andrew McCabe, whom the President targeted before he was dismissed. \"The Associated Press\" reporting that McCabe kept personal memos about his interactions with the President, which are now in the hands of the special counsel and are similar to the contemporaneous notes and memoranda to file that were made by James Comey about his own conversations with Donald Trump.</p><p>That report brought this tweet from the President. \"Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe, but he never took notes when he was with me. I don`t believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them fake memos?\"</p><p>With that, we have a terrific starting panel as we start a new week here. Philip Rucker, White House Bureau Chief for \"The Washington Post\", Tamara Keith, White House Correspondent for NPR and Sam Stein, Veteran Political Journalist, now Politics Editor for \"The Daily Beast\" and an MSNBC Contributor.</p><p>Good evening and welcome to you all.</p><p>Phil, I`d like to read you a quote from some of your colleagues at \"The Washington Post\". We`ll call this byline the law firm of Parker, Dawsey, Leonnig and Costa. And we begin, \"Trump is not consulting with top advisers, including Chief of Staff John F. Kelly and Chief White House Lawyer, Don McGahn on his Russia legal choices or his comments about the probe, according to one person with knowledge of his actions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive conversations.\" A lot of that going around.</p><p>\"He is instead watching television and calling friends, this person said. The President continues to complain that his lawyers are not protecting him and that Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, who is supervising the probe, is up to mischief, said the person who spoke to Trump in recent days.\"</p><p>Philip, can you shed any light on what mischief Rosenstein is up to and help us fill in the blanks here?</p><p>PHILIP RUCKER, WHITE HOUSE BUREAU CHIEF, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\": Well, Brian, I think what`s happening here is two-fold. First of all, the White House staff, the people working in the government, John Kelly, Don McGahn and others, frankly, would rather not be a part with the Russia discussions. They don`t want to have anything to do with the President`s legal strategy with regard to the Mueller probe. But the President feels increasingly emboldened to make his own decisions, to act as his own lawyer, his own counsel, his own strategist, his own P.R. specialist, if it were.</p><p>He feels comfortable in his job. He wants to call his shots and he wants to handle this Mueller probe as he sees fit, which is by these tweets that he had over the weekend. He`s been -- I know from my reporting that he`s been spending a lot of time talking about it on the phone with his friends, less so with his political advisers in the White House, but more so with the people that he communicates with, you know, old pals from New York, even some of the hosts over at Fox News channel and watches a lot of T.V. commentary about all of this. And he`s been using that phrase witch hunt a lot.</p><p>And I would just make a historical parallel, Brian. A colleague of mine dug up an old clip in \"The Washington Post\" under the bilines Woodward and Bernstein, who you`ll remember from the Watergate period, and that`s exactly what Richard Nixon was doing in the White House as the Watergate hearings were under way. He was fuming to his friends and his adviser that this is a witch hunt out to get him. When you read that story it`s just eerily similar to what we have playing out today.</p><p>WILLIAMS: It certainly is. Tamara, isn`t it striking to know that Mueller and Trump forces meet at some point late in the week last week? Let`s presume Trump`s lawyers go back to the White House and break it to the boss that this is not going to be over last Thanksgiving or New Years and then we see the President go to social media. Then we see the President hire the very familiar Joe diGenova from Fox News.</p><p>TAMARA KEITH, NPR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I think it had become increasingly clear that the timeline was slipping when it slipped from Thanksgiving to New Years to, well, it`s late March now at this point. And President Trump is bringing on this new lawyer, who based on all of his public comments is very much in line with what President Trump sees of this investigation, which is this idea of it as a witch hunt. And, you know, President Trump, as we`ve well documented, really likes people who he sees on T.V. defending him. And often tries to find ways to bring them into his circle.</p><p>Interestingly, diGenova, he`s definitely going to be part of the outside team, not part of the inside team. When I asked White House lawyer, Ty Cobb about this, he made it abundantly clear that diGenova was not going to be part of his team.</p><p>Cobb has been more -- has been this lawyer who has been more about trying to cooperate with Mueller`s investigation in hopes that the cooperation will speed things up and not seeing the benefit in pushing back on it. Obviously the President and some of his outside lawyers have a very different view of how this is should be approached.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I`m told we`re going to have more reporting on that in about 60 seconds.</p><p>Sam Stein, I want to show you an example of the President tweeting something this weekend, and an instant fact checking of him that was kind of breathtaking to read. First, from the President`s Twitter feed. \"Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big crooked Hillary supporters and zero Republicans?\"</p><p>Again, you`ve got to admire the capitalization. \"Another Dem recently added, does anyone think this is fair? And yet, there is no collusion.\"</p><p>But here came the almost real-time fact checking from Glenn Kessler of \"The Washington Post.\" \"The way Trump tweets about how investigators can`t be trusted because they donated to Democrats, it`s easy to forget he donated to Hillary Clinton in 2002, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2009. Melania, Ivanka and Don Jr. also made donations to Clinton.\"</p><p>Facts are stubborn things, Sam.</p><p>SAM STEIN, POLITICS EDITOR, \"THE DAILY BEAST\": Yes. You know, sometimes it`s helpful to step back and just remind ourselves how loose this President is with the truth. You know, he take to social media and things happen in such a rapid pace that we sometimes forget to notice the clear errors among the tweets.</p><p>I will say this, I don`t think this weekend was a particular great sign for the President and his legal team in terms of the strategy that they`re bring in to the Mueller probe. The idea that -- well, first of all, let`s step back and just recognize what is sort of a well-established truth in this city, which is he already has two lawyers who most people regard as a little bit long in the tooth, a little bit unable to keep up with the Mueller team, a little bit in over their heads. Now, that being said, if the reports are true tonight and bringing in this new lawyer is, you know, angering the current legal team and potentially compelling John Dowd even quick or Ty Cobb to resign, that would be a huge setback. You`d essentially be starting at ground zero again.</p><p>And I think, you know, Trump`s outburst aside, they are having kind of impacts on the legal case that they`re trying to bring against Mueller. But the bigger story, and I would just clause, this is not exactly what`s happening in the White House. I would argue that it`s what happening on the Capital Hill, because after the tantrum this week on social media, there was a spotlight on Congressional Republican leadership to see if they would do anything, whether it was in their public reactions or maybe a legislative response to inoculate Bob Mueller.</p><p>And what we heard today after that Trey Gowdy clip you play from Sunday is basically crickets. Still there is disbelief on Capitol Hill that he would actually take the step to fire Mueller. And so we have no legislative attempt to inoculate him from the firing.</p><p>WILLIAMS: So, Tamara, as you were speaking, you made our printer go off, which I`ve never seen done before. But as you were making the point that had been discussed throughout the day and that is how un-Ty Cobbian, a guy, Joe diGenova is.</p><p>Our friends over at \"The New York Times,\" Michael Schmidt and Maggie Haberman are on the board. I`ll read just the first three graphs because this was just handed to me.</p><p>\"President Trump`s legal team was poised for a shake-up on Monday, according to two people briefed on the matter. As he openly discussed firing, one of his lawyers, another considered resigning and a third who pushed theories on television that Mr. Trump was framed by the FBI, joined the roster. Mr. Trump has weighed allowed in recent days to close associates whether to dismiss his lawyer, Ty Cobb, who had pushed most strongly a strategy of cooperating fully with the special counsel investigation.\"</p><p>Here`s where it gets interesting. \"The President reassured Mr. Cobb that he had no plans to fire him, according to a person who spoke with the President late Monday, in part to prevent a narrative that his team was in disarray after the \"New York Times\" began making inquiries. Mr. Trump`s lead lawyer, John Dowd, had contemplated leading his post because he had concluded he has no control over the behavior of the President, the two people briefed on the matter said. Ignoring his lawyers` advice, Mr. Trump has reverted to a more aggressive strategy and so on.\"</p><p>So, Tamara, there you have it. What could possibly go wrong?</p><p>KEITH: Yes. As someone who has covered this White House, this is a familiar narrative applied not just to the legal team, but also to various White House aides. It`s why you`ve had such an incredible level of turnover, both in the President`s Cabinet and in his top aides in the White House. It`s like off-the-charts historically unprecedented amounts of turnover.</p><p>President Trump has not settled on the team that he likes and this is not the first shake-up of his legal team. And we should say, we don`t know that this is a shake-up just yet, it might be just an addition. But certainly, you know, there was a shake-up not too long ago that put Dowd in charge of this team and brought in Jay Sekulow. So it is a cycle that repeats itself with some frequency.</p><p>WILLIAMS: So, Philip, the question becomes who remains to be able to say, \"Mr. President, it`s one thing to want the people around you that you want? If there is something about making a hire that gives you the great feeling of a warm bath, that`s fine, but please remember that hire may not help to achieve your goal.\"</p><p>RUCKER: Well, it`s a good question, Brian. I think President Trump is making a lot of his own decisions at this point. Ty Cobb is a lawyer at the White House who is effectively doing a lot of the paperwork. He`s literally responding to document requests at the White House, arranging interviews for White House staff. John Dowd is the one dealing with the President personally in his personal approach.</p><p>But again, I think Mr. Trump -- President Trump is making a lot of these decisions. He`s deciding when to issue these tweets. He`s deciding to attack Bob Mueller personally by name, as he did over this weekend. He`s deciding to call it a witch hunt and he`s deciding he wants to sit down for an interview, even though his lawyers are very concerned that and understandably so because he has a history of exaggerating the facts and sometime outright lying. And so, there`s a real genuine concern about whether he can truthfully answer questions face to face with the special counsel investigators.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Sam, I`m reminded over the weekend of what John Brennan said on social media. \"Friday night here, we were talking about the words of Barry McCaffrey and now John Brennan on the board with this. It`s a Sorkin-esque statement. When the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude, and political corruption becomes known, you will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history.\"</p><p>\"You may scapegoat Andy McCabe but you will not destroy America. America will triumph over you,\" said the former CIA director whose job included but was not limited to going to his counterpart in Russia, saying knock it off, something not done in the spy trade very often.</p><p>STEIN: No. I like the use of Sorkin-esque. You can see it in a \"West Wing\" episode for sure.</p><p>I will say, you know, John Brennan got a lot of pushback because in line from Conservatives over that, in part because it was hyperbolic. But maybe that`s what the times call for. The firing of Andrew McCabe is a really interesting case study in what this President has done vis-a-vis the entirety of the Mueller probe.</p><p>Now, McCabe, you know, conclude in a two ways. One is he may have been fired for cause, in this case, a lack of candor. And he went through a process within the DOJ that did require political -- I`m sorry, civil servants, not political hacks, to make a judgment on the case. But because Trump had weighed in so heavily and aggressively on this matter because he`d essentially called for his firing and because he tooted his own horn, so to speak, after the firing was done, it created an aura around this, a bad stench of sorts about the whole firing.</p><p>And we have to wonder why did he do it in the first place? What was the point two days before McCabe was supposed to get his pension? And the only one conclusion once again is that he was trying to spoil a potential witness against him. He`s trying to gas light the process. And so, this is what John Brennan was responding to, not necessarily two men or one man in the FBI, but the gas lighting of the American institutions and Americans` trust in their institutions.</p><p>nd I think, you know, we`ll end up finding out at some point in time whether John Brennan is right or Donald Trump is.</p><p>WILLIAMS: We have only been on the air for 18 minutes, yet another eventful night on this shift. With our thanks to Phil Rucker, to Tamara Keith, and Sam Stein for starting us off as we begin a new week.</p><p>STEIN: Thanks, Brian</p><p>WILLIAMS: And coming up for us, Trump being Trump, the President described as emboldened now, more comfortable in the job as we`ve seen tonight, expect to see and hear even more candor from the President.</p><p>And later, a man who worked alongside Andrew McCabe for 20 years weighs-in on his firing and the damage being done when the President attacks the FBI. \"The 11th Hour\" just getting started on a busy Monday night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: North Korea, Kim Jong-un, would like to meet with President Trump. This doesn`t happen. You know, they`re saying, oh, well, Obama could have done that. Trust me, he couldn`t have done that.</p><p>Today, I`m defending America`s national security by placing tariffs on foreign imports of steel and aluminum.</p><p>If we don`t get tough on the drug dealers, we`re wasting our time. Just remember that. We`re wasting our time. And that toughness includes the death penalty.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: With remarks like those, just a small sampling over the past few weeks President Trump has gone against the advice and counsel of his staff and closest allies to push parts of his policy agenda. And we also saw the firing of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson via Twitter.</p><p>The \"New York Times\" reports today that feeling newly emboldened, Trump is saying what he really feels now. This weekend, as we`ve said, he unleashed the tirade on Twitter against Special Counsel Robert Mueller attacking him by name for the first time.</p><p>\"Time\" tells it this way, \"For months, President Trump`s legal advisers implored him to avoid so much as mentioning the name of Robert Mueller. Ignoring that advice over the weekend was the decision of a President who ultimately trusts only his own instincts, and now believes he has settled into the job enough to rely on them rather than the people who advise him.\"</p><p>We`re joined by two more friends here tonight to react and join our conversation. Anita Kumar, White House Correspondent for McClatchy Newspapers and John Heilemann, Veteran Journalist and MSNBC National Affairs Analyst.</p><p>Anita, again, we try not to veer into the gale he/she Dr. Phil Guardrail. But is it possible this President`s happiness comes a result of enough rage to cause an outburst and then ergo the aftereffect?</p><p>ANITA KUMAR, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, MCCLATCHY NEWSPAPER: Right. I mean, it just depends who you`re talking to, you know. People I`m speaking to who are close to the White House, you know, take this as a really actually a good sign, you know, that he is feeling more confident. You would have thought that he would have felt this when he was coming in, becoming the President of the United States.</p><p>This is a man who didn`t think he was going to be President. He didn`t think he would win so he wasn`t sort of prepared for that. But he`s feeling better about it. He`s felling like he knows what he`s doing and people close to the White House and close to him are pretty happy about it.</p><p>This is, you know, the President they thought he would be, he`s taking sort of control of things. You mentioned the firing of Rex Tillerson, that`s the thing that I keep hearing over and over, that he`s kind of cleaned house into the White House and now he`s venturing out into the Cabinet secretaries. There are a lot of people that wish he would do more with that. But of course, if you talk to the critics, Democrats, they`re afraid of what he`s going to do next.</p><p>WILLIAMS: John, we`re not here to advice.</p><p>JOHN HEILEMANN, MSNBC NATIONAL AFFAIR ANALYST: Or consent, God knows.</p><p>WILLIAMS: We do occasionally judge.</p><p>HEILEMANN: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: What if getting rid of a white shoe legal team is politically suicidal in this case for the President?</p><p>HEILEMANN: It could well be. I mean, look, it`s interesting that in the past Presidents you and I have covered, you often see a phenomenon where --</p><p>WILLIAMS: I started with Coolidge, I guess.</p><p>HEILEMANN: -- new President arrives in Washington, D.C. with a bunch of coterie of people from home, you know. They`re loyalists. They arrive in the White House and they don`t really know what they`re doing, but they have some governing experience.</p><p>And one of the things that they learn in the first year or so is that they need to adjust to the ways of Washington. And so, you see the chief of staff or the chief counsel, who was kind of a vestige of the old -- of home, whether it`d be Arkansas, or Texas, or wherever --</p><p>WILLIAMS: Or Georgia?</p><p>HEILEMANN: -- or Georgia, dispensed with in favor of the old Washington hand. Trump is in so many ways like the bizarre owe world President who came to Washington with no political background and so hired a bunch of people, a bunch of generals for instance and white shoe law firms or assemblage of lawyers. And now because he feels more comfortable as President do after about a year, he`s doing the opposite, which kind of getting rid of the experienced hands and bringing in the flame throwers, bringing in the Fox News personalities, bringing in the war Cabinet, the loyalists who he thinks as things get tougher will be there just to defend him and say yes, yes, yes, your instincts are right.</p><p>But the basic thing of arriving in the office, being uncertain and getting more comfortable, he has that in common with his predecessors. It`s just that he came from such a different place that his reaction to it now is exactly 180, opposite from what the other have done.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Terrific point. And, Anita, as is your custom, you have written to remind all of us about the down ballot effects. This is all -- we think we`re watching this closely? Imagine having the letter \"R\" after your name and being an incumbent member of Congress knowing that your neck is going to be on the block come November and you know that it`s going to feel like we wake up tomorrow and it`s Labor Day and the campaign is on, but the down ballot effect is really going to be something dramatic to watch.</p><p>KUMAR: It is. I mean, it already was, right? This is a President who is not doing well in the polls. So we already didn`t know exactly what was going to happen except things are not looking good for Republicans. But now, he`s actually making it worse. He`s feeling better. He`s doing what he wants to do, but he`s making it worse because they really don`t know what`s coming.</p><p>So, Republicans who, you know, want to say depending on their district, fund raise with him or campaign with him or not run away or don`t know whether to run towards him or away from him are going to have a President now who they don`t really know what to expect policy wise. So, his aides told him, let`s not do this, you know, let`s not do the tariffs, you talked about that before, but he didn`t listen. And he went against something that the bulk of the Republican Party is opposed to.</p><p>How is this going to be for the people that are on the ballot who, you know, this is the thing that President Trump is pushing right now, the tariffs, they`re opposed to that. So they`re just not going to know what to expect and it`s going to cause them a lot of problems.</p><p>WILLIAMS: John, a question I mean seriously, how did the Trump agenda advance today?</p><p>HEILEMANN: Not at all. I don`t think it advanced at all today and I think in some ways to go back to your original point, I think the President is in greater legal jeopardy today than he was yesterday. And I think the legal jeopardy for him is an existential threat and it`s kind of the thing, you tried to point me, I had to point but I wanted to make, but the point you were trying to make, which I think is a good one, to return to you here. It is one thing to bring in people who will encourage your instincts, even if your instincts are at odds with the conventional wisdom.</p><p>He was an anti-establishment candidate. He`s going to pursue polices that a lot of people in the establishment don`t like. When it comes to legal jeopardy, there`s a reason why you surrounded yourself with good lawyers, because of that old adage about how a lawyer who represents himself has a fool for a client.</p><p>You don`t want to give -- he doesn`t know the law. He doesn`t understand the jeopardy he`s in. None of us do when we go before a tribunal, before a judge, before -- let alone a special prosecutor. So he want to bring in, that`s where the place where you have to say, you know what? My instincts are not, all of us, or my instincts are not going to be the right instincts. I have to trust somebody else here because this is the very, the future of my presidency at stakes and my instincts are not going to be the right instincts because this is a world I do not understand well enough.</p><p>And so, to your point before, I this is the place where he -- by following his own instincts., he puts himself in enormous risk because he`s now going to be bringing in essentially yes man into the one arena where, yes, where being a yes man is not rewarded typically in the realm of both law and high, high stakes politics.</p><p>BRIAN WILLIAMS, MSNBC ANCHOR: Our thanks to two really smart friends of ours, Anita Kumar and John Heilemann.</p><p>Coming up here tonight, the President goes after as we said Robert Mueller has investigation by name. The question is, who are the Republicans willing to warn the President not to interfere here? That and more when we continue.</p><p>WILLIAMS: With these reports, we`ve already mentioned tonight that the President`s becoming more comfortable in his role, the job of president. Some have worried aloud that his attempts to discredit Robert Mueller, as we saw on social media this weekend, perhaps are just getting started.</p><p>We want to bring back to our broadcast, Jill Wine-Banks, Attorney, former Assistant Watergate Special Counsel and an MSNBC Legal Analyst. Jill, we`re you surprised to learn our reporting tonight that both sides, both counsel, and we don`t know what the Trump legal team is going to look for - - by close of business tomorrow? Have been meeting for some time and it`s on a continuum, they still -- they`ve kept talking?</p><p>JILL WINE-BANKS, MSNBC LEGAL ANALYST: No, I think that they need to be talking. I think it`s a good thing for them to be doing it. Although, I would say Mueller has the upper hand in this.</p><p>He is really in control because he has subpoena power and can bring in the President at any time and they ask him anything he wants. The President would have to either claim a Fifth Amendment privilege or answer the questions.</p><p>I`m not sure what they are still negotiating. Obviously, you want to be kind to the President, you want to agree on a time that`s convenient so that the business of our government can continue. But in terms of whether it happens or not, it`s really not a question that his lawyers can be negotiating, and especially when they`re attacking Mueller at the same time as they`re negotiating with him.</p><p>WILLIAMS: When you read the reporting, and you really do kind of do have to set aside of your day every day to read the journalism. And then, you need to read a second wave every night. When you read that the Mueller attorneys report back that they`re really honing in on the Flynn and Comey dismissals, and that that was what they brought back to the White House, what does that tell you about the Mueller investigation?</p><p>WINE-BANKS: Well, that could mean that they`re looking at obstruction because they`re focusing on the actions that happened while he was in the White House, as opposed to during the campaign. But I -- you know, we`re basing this on reporting that we don`t know how complete and accurate it is.</p><p>I`m sure it`s not coming from Mueller`s office so it may be in the best interest of the President to have us believe that it`s a narrow thing, that they aren`t looking at, for example, follow the money. And that they aren`t looking at the conspiracy with the Russians. So it may be that we are being a little misled by this. We don`t know.</p><p>It`s also curious what they`re saying about we`re providing documents in the hopes that this will limit the scope of the interview.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes.</p><p>WINE-BANKS: I`m kind of surprised about that. And one report actually says that this documents were summaries of things. And I can tell you that during Watergate, we were offered summaries of the tapes and we said absolutely not. And that is actually what really led to the Saturday night massacre was -- are saying, \"We have to have the original tapes. We cannot have a summary of them.\" We need admissible evidence and a summary is hearsay, it not admissible evidence, so it does us no good to get a summary. And I was very curious about that is something they are actually seriously trying to offer.</p><p>It wouldn`t be a Monday night if I didn`t ask you about a porn star. And I`m going to ask you to watch and exchange on this network tonight between Ari Melber and her attorney. We`ll talk about it on the other side.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARI MELBER, NBC NEWS HOST: Mr. Trump has been fully aware, you alleged. Does that mean you have evidence or reason to believe he was aware of the threat against MS. Daniels?</p><p>MICHAEL AVENATTI, STORMY DANIELS` ATTORNEY: Yes.</p><p>MELBER: And what does that say to you?</p><p>AVENATTI: Well, I think it`s serious. I mean, there`s no question that it`s serious.</p><p>MELBER: You think his threat to her was made on Donald Trump`s authority?</p><p>AVENATTI: Again, I don`t want to get into the details and my opinion of this threat. We`re going to let the American people judge for themselves as to what happened and judge for themselves as to what my client says and her credibility.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: So, Jill, you may not want to go near that, but what was being alleged there is that a sitting president was aware, is aware in real time of threats being made to Stormy Daniels. That`s a heck of a charge that we`re going to learn more about, apparently.</p><p>WINE-BANKS: I can`t wait to learn more about it. I also would like to know what the timing of the threat was. Because of course, if the threat preceded her signing the nondisclosure agreement, it completely voids that agreement.</p><p>You cannot reach a fair contract if you are doing so under the duress of threat. But even if the threat came afterwards, it is a serious allegation that the president is involved in threatening witnesses. So we know that it`s happened before and it`s almost not surprising. The president himself has said that he could do almost anything, and wouldn`t lose political support.</p><p>So maybe he`s trying to prove it to us. I think we`ll all know a lot more after the Sunday night interview, which I`m sure all of your viewers are looking forward to as much as I am.</p><p>WILLIAMS: All the things we talk about around here these days.</p><p>WINE-BANKS: I know.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Jill Wine-Banks, you always have our thanks. Thank you very much for joining us on this Monday night.</p><p>WINE-BANKS: Thank you.</p><p>WILLIAMS: And coming up for us, we`ll talk to a former FBI official who has known Andrew McCabe for two decades. We`ll talk about the President`s continued attacks on the FBI as now hundreds of federal agents swarm to Austin, Texas to help stop a serial bomber when we continue.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Even though we say this a lot these days, you don`t see this often. President Trump praised the dismissal of former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe over the weekend, writing this on Twitter, \"Andrew McCabe fired, a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI, a great day for democracy.\"</p><p>With us tonight is Robert Anderson, former FBI Executive Assistant Director of the Criminal, Cyber, Response and Services Branch. He`s known Andrew McCabe for 20 years and this is the important part. He was the Assistant Director of Counterintelligence while McCabe was the Assistant Director of Counterterrorism.</p><p>Mr. Anderson, I note that you got up either very late or very early for us in London to do this and I thank you for doing that. As I ask you to describe the Andy McCabe you know and part two of that is how do you square the FBI internal findings against him?</p><p>ROBERT ANDERSON, FORMER ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF COUNTERINTELLIGENCE: Yes. Thanks, Brian, great to be with you here tonight.</p><p>The one thing I`ll tell but Andy and I don`t think people have said this enough on television. I`ve worked with him for a number of years on the highest levels of the FBI. And what people don`t understand in those jobs as you pointed out, when he was the assistant director of Counterterrorism and I was the assistant director of Counterintelligence, or when we are both executive assistant director of Operations, you basically split the FBI to 35,000 men and women, and he was running one side of it, I was running the other.</p><p>And in those positions, you have to make decisions on some of the most complicated, sophisticated operations that the FBI has ever done. And whether it was meetings Eric Holder, Bob Mueller, Jim Comey, numerous people in the Congress or White House, I`ve always found Andy to not only be a trustworthy individual but a man of honor and integrity. And I think it can`t be said enough about that.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I want to read you a tweet from one of the many tweets from our President over the weekend about McCabe and specifically something that McCabe shares with Comey and so many of you come up just knowing reflexively, and that`s note taking, contemporaneously dictating notes to file. The President kind of expressed doubt spent very little time with Andrew McCabe but he never took notes when he was with me. I don`t believe he made memos except to help his own agenda.</p><p>First of all, there`s no way someone would take notes in the middle of a conversation, but it is a skill set and a mindset that seems to confound the President. He hasn`t been around that ethos before.</p><p>ANDERSON: No. But I got to tell you. It`s FBI agent 101, especially men and women that came into the bureau 20-plus years ago like myself, or Andy, or others. You took notes on everything, and whether it was interviews or interrogations or investigational leads, it`s actually quite a routine. And back in the old days, we used to put those notes into one that`s called a 1A envelope. And later on if you developed material or evidence or testimonial information you would pull that information from that and then write informational or what was called FD-302s, which is the report that an FBI agent would testify from court.</p><p>So in our side of the world when it comes to law enforcement especially in the FBI, it`s quite a routine.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I have to ask you about Austin, Texas. Because as a citizen, it`s calming to see the pictures we keep showing of all those people arriving and putting on that blue FBI or ATF jacket in many cases because this is terrorism by a different name, four bombings around that community. Isn`t it the danger of having a President diminish law enforcement at the federal level, these men and women we now ask them to go into a dangerous place, calm down an entire metropolitan area, oh, and by the way, could you please find this serial bomber before he or her strikes again?</p><p>ANDERSON: Yes, I think it`s a great point, Brian. I think the tweets unfortunately are odd at best and at worst. I think they make bad influences on people that don`t understand what you`re talking about. What people need to understand is that the men and women in the federal law enforcement, state and local law enforcement and really ever since 9/11 happened in this country, there is a huge bond between all those inner agencies operational task forces. And really this is when you see it shine, in times of tragedy like this, what`s going on in Texas, the men and women come together and they`ll find whoever has been doing this. And I really think we need to hear more about that.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Robert Anderson, who is been terrific with us and very generous with your time in joining us so early in the morning from our London bureau. Really appreciate it. Thank you.</p><p>ANDERSON: Thanks, Brian.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Coming up for us, how one American company, a big one at that, managed to lose more than $36 billion in market value just today. We`re back with that after this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRAD PARSCALE, TRUMP CAMPAIGN DIGITAL DIRECTOR: I understood early that Facebook was how Donald Trump was going to win. Twitter is how he talked to the people. Facebook was going to be how he won.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And Facebook is how he won?</p><p>PARSCALE: I think so. I mean, I think Donald Trump won, but I think Facebook was the method. It was the highway in which his car drove on.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: That was the Trump campaign Digital Director Brad Parscale appearing on \"60 Minutes.\" He has already been put in charge of the Trump reelection campaign.

And now Facebook is under heavy pressure to provide answers.</p><p>Facebook has always maintained it`s just a platform, a massive one at that. The problem for Facebook is they were used by some as a propaganda platform to get Donald Trump elected. And big tech might be looking at some big- time regulations.</p><p>We get our report on it tonight from NBC News Business Correspondent Jo Ling Kent.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JO LING KENT, NBC NEWS BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Tonight, Facebook stock tanking, dropping nearly 7 percent after allegations that data firm Cambridge Analytica secretly harvested the personal information of 50 million unsuspecting Facebook users.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER WYLIE, WHISTLE-BLOWER: They are not just a social network. They are also an information battle space.</p><p>KENT: Whistle-blower Christopher Wylie helped us found Cambridge, which later was brought on to help the Trump campaign.

We have lots of history of things.</p><p>KENT: Tonight, Cambridge Analytica denies misusing Facebook data, and says we entirely refute any allegation that Cambridge Analytica or any of its affiliates used entrapment, bribes or so-called honey traps for any purpose whatsoever.</p><p>Facebook, which also owns Instagram, banned Cambridge Analytica from its platform and hired a digital forensics firm to investigate, saying \"we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people`s information.\" Amid new calls for more regulation of social media companies.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We`re seeing the beginning of the breakup of big tech. Big tech has not been held to the same scrutiny as the rest of corporate America.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KENT: Brian, privacy experts warn that anything you post to Facebook, whether it`s a like, an update, a photo, a video, can be used to target you. It can reveal your location, your political preferences or what you like to shop for. And this has Capitol Hill on alert. What has happened with Cambridge Analytica is drawing more scrutiny.</p><p>Now, Senators Klobuchar and Wyden want more answers from the founder and CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg. Brian?</p><p>WILLIAMS: NBC News Correspondent Jo Ling Kent reporting for us tonight from our Los Angeles bureau. We`ll take another break. An update on some late news coming up when we continue</p><p>WILLIAMS: Just a few last items before we go here tonight. Starting in Pennsylvania, where as you may know one of the most famously gerrymandered political maps in the country is about to get redrawn.</p><p>Its final hurdle came today. The case went all the way the Supreme Court, and by declining to hear it. The new map goes into effect. And some have theorized this new map could result in a net gain of anywhere from two to five more Democrats in Congress representing the commonwealth.</p><p>The next government shutdown deadline is looming. Our kick the can Congress has passed five spending bills so far this year, all of them just long enough to put off the larger conversation of funding the government. Last one temporarily funds our government only through this coming Friday. This time around, there is an effort to actually fund our government all the way to September. Can you imagine that?</p><p>As we mentioned, the bombings continue in Austin, Texas after another blast there last night, the toll thus far two dead, four injured. 350 FBI special agents have arrived in Austin, 500 total working on the case. They believe this is the work of a serial bomber who is now emboldened using a trip wire on this last bombing, the reward for information standing at $100,000.</p><p>That`s our broadcast for this Monday as we start of a new week. Thank you so very much for being here with us. Goodnight.</p><p>THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

New Jersey has the best school districts in the country, while North Dakota has the second lowest pupil-teacher ratio after Vermont. Here are the 15 best states to be a teacher. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[2] Some states treat teachers better than others. </p><p>Personal finance site WalletHub analyzed the states where teachers enjoy the highest salaries and most supportive administration in their annual ranking of the best and worst places to teach[3]. Read more: 31 teachers across the US reveal their exact salary, and how much of it goes to paying for school supplies like chalk and pencils[4] WalletHub ranked the states that scored highly in two key categories: \"Opportunity and competition,\" which includes how competitive salaries were, teacher pensions, and income growth. \"Academic and work environment,\" which includes the quality of the school system, how many students per teacher, and the rate of turnover. North Dakota, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania topped the list. New Jersey has some of the best school districts[5] in the country, while North Dakota has the second lowest pupil-teacher ratio after Vermont. Illinois ranks as the sixth best state for teachers, despite talk of a looming strike among Chicago-area teachers. Unionized teachers say classrooms have become overcrowded and that low-income districts lack resources, NBC News reported[6]. Here are the best states for teachers in 2019: 15.

Yet Sea Ltd. has quietly become the world\u2019s best-performing large-cap stock, stoking a debate on Wall Street over whether the Singapore-based gaming, e-commerce and...</p><p>It gets far less attention than Tesla, the FAANGs or even the Robinhood flavor of the week.  Yet Sea Ltd. has quietly become the world\u2019s best-performing large-cap stock, stoking a debate on Wall Street over whether the Singapore-based gaming, e-commerce and payments company is the next great internet colossus or just Exhibit A in a global tech bubble that\u2019s destined to burst.  For now at least, bulls have the upper hand. Swelling optimism that loss-making Sea may one day become both the Tencent and Alibaba of Southeast Asia has boosted its New York-listed shares   If Sea Chief Executive Officer Forrest Li is paying attention to any of this, he\u2019s not letting on. The 42-year-old billionaire said in a video interview that he\u2019s been working seven-day weeks in the office since April, leading his company through what may be its most pivotal year. Demand for Sea\u2019s mobile games and online-shopping platform has surged during the pandemic, and the company is bidding on a Singapore digital-banking license to accelerate its push into financial services. Li is also looking for potential acquisitions in gaming, logistics and e-commerce.  \u201cWe don\u2019t like to think too much about our success or how we got here,\u201d he said when asked about Sea\u2019s stock price. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if the environment is good or bad. It doesn\u2019t change a company or a person.\u201d  Even by the standards of today\u2019s tech boom, Li\u2019s ascent has been remarkable. Born in the Chinese port city of Tianjin, he worked for the local units of Motorola Solutions Inc. and Corning Inc. before enrolling in Stanford\u2019s MBA program. He founded Sea, then known as Garena, in 2009 and took it public with backing from Tencent in 2017.  After a rocky first year of trading, Sea\u2019s stock has gone on to trounce everything in its class. Initially, the gains were fueled by the runaway success of Sea\u2019s first self-made mobile game \u2014 a battle royale called Free Fire that has attracted as many as 80 million daily active users in more than 130 markets.  But Sea\u2019s e-commerce and financial services units are now increasingly important pillars of the bull case. Its Shopee platform overtook Alibaba\u2019s Lazada in the fourth quarter of 2019 to become the top e-commerce provider in Southeast Asia, according to research firm iPrice, and the business accounted for more than 40% of Sea\u2019s revenue in 2019, up from 2.3% in 2017.  SeaMoney, which offers everything from e-wallets to micro loans, could ultimately be just as large, according to Li. \u201cWe think this is a huge business opportunity,\u201d he said.  The soft-spoken founder has some big-name believers. Tencent still owns about 20% of Sea, and the stock was the biggest holding as of May in Noah Blackstein\u2019s Dynamic Power Global Growth Class fund, one of the world\u2019s top-performing equity mutual funds of the past decade. Other prominent shareholders include Chase Coleman\u2019s Tiger Global Management LLC and Kora Management LP, an emerging markets-focused hedge fund in New York, according to regulatory filings as of March.  Kora began investing in Sea in early 2018 after meeting with Li, Daniel Jacobs, the hedge fund\u2019s founding partner, said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen over the last two years a company that\u2019s got a great team and great products going after a big market and just executing incredibly well,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think this is a mini Tencent and has the ability to be a really successful, large company in a global context.\u201d  Sea has already claimed the title of biggest company in Southeast Asia after its market value swelled to $65 billion, topping DBS Group Holdings Ltd. and PT Bank Central Asia for the first time earlier this year. Revenue has also grown quickly, jumping 163% to $2.2 billion in 2019, though it\u2019s still just a fraction of DBS\u2019s $11 billion.  As for Sea\u2019s $1.46 billion net loss last year? Jacobs isn\u2019t bothered by it. \u201cThey are thoughtful and prudent about building a business,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are very much of the view that the company has all this under control.\u201d  Not everyone is convinced.  DBS Bank Ltd. analyst Sachin Mittal downgraded his recommendation on Sea to sell in July, citing Indonesia\u2019s new tax regulations for cross-border transactions and the likelihood of the company burning through cash to grow its payments business. \u201cThere is a tech bubble right now,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cSea\u2019s stock is overvalued and it\u2019s partly a reflection of the industry.\u201d  While short sellers have closed out bets against Sea at a rapid clip in recent weeks, they still have a bearish position worth more than $3 billion, or about 8% of the stock\u2019s free float, according to S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm. \u201cMark-to-market losses may have forced shorts out of their position,\u201d said Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of predictive analytics at S3. \u201cBut they may still have a negative outlook.\u201d  Skeptics note that Sea faces deep-pocketed competitors in all of its main businesses, from Lazada to Grab Holdings Inc. and a slew of other up-and-comers in digital finance. Meanwhile, Sea\u2019s gaming unit has yet to prove it\u2019s more than just a one-hit wonder.  \u201cWe could have a post-Covid situation where the jack-up in revenue does not materialize, and the gaming business is doing well but rests on only one popular game,\u201d said Nirgunan Tiruchelvam, head of consumer equity research at Tellimer Ltd.  Sea optimists see little reason to cash in. In fact, Georg Krijgh, founder and head of the investment team at Amsterdam-based Fratres, said his firm\u2019s Knight Tech Fund, which has 150 million euros ($177 million) under management, plans to add to its Sea holdings.  The stock is already the fund\u2019s second-largest position after Shopify Inc., a Canadian e-commerce company that has gained more than 500% in the past 18 months. \u201cThere are always people who like to short excellent companies such as Sea, Tesla or Carvana, mainly based on the argument of a high valuation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an inferior strategy.\u201d  Sea\u2019s biggest challenge now may have less to do with execution than with meeting investors\u2019 \u201csky-high\u201d expectations, said Matthew Kanterman, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. In the past seven days alone, Sea\u2019s stock has soared 28% to record.  For his part, Li appears well aware that the bar has increased. It\u2019s been hard not to notice with everyone calling his company a Southeast Asian mashup of Tencent and Alibaba, two of the most successful businesses in history.  \u201cWe learned a lot from those pioneers,\u201d said Li, who has an estimated net worth of $7.5 billion. \u201cBut at the end of the day, we don\u2019t need to be their mini versions. We can just be ourselves.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Not this time. The 2010s can be comprehensively understood through a single artefact \u2014 the smartphone. In August 2008, Apple launched the iPhone 3G in India, the Android smartphone debuted later that year, and within a few years, more affordable models of touchscreen phones and tablets flooded India.</p><p>Till then the cellphone was just to make calls and send texts.

But in India, it\u2019s done more than that. Here, mobiles have brought mobility, and let aspirations soar</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Usually, it is difficult to find that one thing that binds a decade together. Not this time. The 2010s can be comprehensively understood through a single artefact \u2014 the smartphone. In August 2008, Apple launched the iPhone 3G in India, the Android smartphone debuted later that year, and within a few years, more affordable models of touchscreen phones and tablets flooded India.</p><p>Till then the cellphone was just to make calls and send texts. It is only after we started tapping and swiping on these glowing slabs of glass and metal that the internet finally went mobile. The smartphone outpaced the TV as the consumer technology with the fastest adoption rate, says MIT's Technology Review. The phone became a digital Swiss army knife, loaded with apps. It cannibalised other physical things like cameras and diaries and music players, and nestled in our palms. We filled our phones with photos, music, books and entertainment. We browse and buy our stuff through them. We swipe our phones for romantic connections, we summon and see our loved ones when we want, wherever they are. They guide us on the roads, robot voices telling us where to turn. We spend all our time with our phones, checking them incessantly, holding them close. They mediate our relationships, they are an extension of our minds. Now, the entire planet is a dense mesh with billions of connected devices. When you eat a meal and post it on Instagram, it exists in the here-and-now, but also as an image in the minds of others. As Laurence Scott said, this gives a wonderful, weird fourth dimension to our world, one of constant connection and ambient awareness. In this country, where most people couldn't afford cameras and video players the mobile has brought other kinds of mobility \u2014 a teen can now message her boyfriend, a migrant worker can stay in touch with her family, a non-literate person can learn from a video, a Hindi-speaking kid hums an American pop song.</p><p>But while social media has connected us, it has also fomented conspiracy theories, fake news, misinformation campaigns and bots, as well as phenomenally boosted the capacity to protest. Governments, including our own, now use internet blackouts to repress discontent. It has shaped the behaviour of governments and political parties, who have to constantly focus on spin and messaging.</p><p>As citizens, there is no border between private and public life \u2014 we are caught up in news and arguments through WhatsApp and news feeds. And because anger and fear drive more 'viral' content, ideological extremes resonate more than moderation or deliberation. Reality itself has cracked, as we are sealed in our bubbles of selective information rather than sharing a consensus narrative. Meanwhile, the economic disruption brought by the mobile internet is in our faces, and also hard to quantify. Like electricity, railroads and cars, technology has brought creative destruction and new arrangements in business. Traditional intermediary models are withering, from publishers to record companies, but hugely successful companies have emerged, and the platform economy has also hooked people to work opportunities.</p><p>There are some downsides to this model, as technology displaces human labour. Kodak, the photo company which also invented the digital camera, and shut down in 2012, once employed 140,000 people. Instagram, when it was sold to Facebook for a billion dollars, employed 13 people. In the platform economy, we, the users, supply content and make a few tech companies immensely valuable, but they only require a few people to be employed. Unlike the technological breakthroughs of the past, digital innovations are not creating mass prosperity, but they enormously profit a few. The old contracts between work, value and income will have to be rewritten in the near future. Everything our smartphones have touched, they have changed. It is not just the external and social world, but also our cognition, our interiority, for better and for worse. We can maintain a shallow connection with more people now. Social media also makes us feel like we are on stage, thinking of the impression we make. When we check our phones every few minutes, or skitter through disjointed feeds online, we struggle with concentration and deep thought. But we also think on the fly, learn collaboratively. We are making content, rather than passively taking it in. Our gifs and memes call up a free-form creativity. Our language has shifted to a casual, oral style.</p><p>Of course, the free stuff we got used to online imposes costs that we are only catching up with. It involves a surrender of our own data and control. Third parties and state agencies harvest our information. Big data and opaque algorithms combine to shape our experience in surreptitious ways, and machine intelligence is set to intensify these problems, as human bias is often baked into code. Regulating both Big Tech and state surveillance is a clear challenge the world now faces \u2014 to merely have a mobile phone is to constantly shed traces, revealing more to prying others than we know. \u201cDekh raftar-e-inquilab, Firaq, kitni ahista aur kitni tez\u201d \u2014 the smartphone has brought breakneck transformation, but has also subtly crept up on us. New marvels have been rapidly absorbed, new anxieties are being grappled with. To look back at the decade is to realise how much it has shaped our societies and our psyches. It is no longer about euphoria or backlash \u2014 it is time to accept that we have incorporated this technology into our lives, and we have to make it work for us rather than being led headfirst by it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TOIEP-0_65_29122019017001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TOIEP2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XVK-XMJ1-JB3N-T2C3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382891</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"933\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

But stay with me here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's true that this was a horrible year for many of the tech industry's biggest companies. Amazon held a nationwide beauty pageant for its new headquarters, raising hopes that the company would help transform a struggling city, then picked the two places that needed it the least. Executives from Facebook, Google and Twitter got hauled before Congress to apologize for *gestures wildly in all directions*. One of Uber's self-driving cars killed someone. And then there was Elon Musk. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  But the tech sector is more than its giants.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Last year, I handed out ''good tech'' awards to a handful of companies, nonprofit organizations and people who used technology to help others in real, tangible ways. The goal was to shine a spotlight on a few less-heralded projects that may not get front-page headlines or billions of dollars in funding, but are actually trying to fulfill the tech industry's stated goal of improving the world.</p><p>  I'm continuing that tradition this year, in the spirit of reminding us that although scandals and wrongdoing in tech rightly get a lot of attention, there's good happening elsewhere.</p><p>  To Zipline and Swoop Aero, for using drones to heal the sick.</p><p>  For years, consumer drones were hyped as a new technology that would soon fill the skies over America's cities, delivering packages and surveilling the populace. Luckily, that hasn't happened yet, but elsewhere, drone companies are doing real work.</p><p>  One of these efforts is Zipline, a start-up that uses drones to deliver blood and medicine to medical facilities in remote areas that can't be easily reached by traditional vehicles. The company began operating in Rwanda, where it says it has made more than 8,000 deliveries, and this year expanded to Ghana.</p><p>  Another is Swoop Aero, an Australian drone-delivery company that partnered with Unicef this year to deliver vaccines to the remote South Pacific nation of Vanuatu, where roughly 20 percent of children do not get properly vaccinated. One nurse in the country told The New York Times that the drone deliveries ''will change my life.''</p><p>  To Upsolve, for helping people go bankrupt.</p><p>  For many low-income Americans, declaring personal bankruptcy can be a painful but necessary way to get rid of exorbitant medical bills or predatory lenders. But it's often expensive to hire a bankruptcy lawyer, and hard to navigate the maze of paperwork.</p><p>  Upsolve, a nonprofit organization founded by a Harvard graduate and a lawyer, built a tool that has been referred to as the ''TurboTax of bankruptcy.'' The software collects financial information from users, automatically fills out their forms and passes them to a lawyer who reviews them before the user submits a bankruptcy claim. In 2018, it helped users in 47 states discharge a total of more than $13 million in debt, according to Rohan Pavuluri, the company's chief executive.</p><p>  To Joy Buolamwini, Timnit Gebru and Anima Anandkumar, for calling out A.I. bias.</p><p>  Artificial intelligence will be one of the most important areas of computer science in the coming years. It's also one of the least diverse. Just 12 percent of A.I. researchers are women, and the number of black and Latino executives in the field is vanishingly small. Three leading A.I. researchers are trying to change that.</p><p>  Ms. Buolamwini, a researcher at the M.I.T. Media Lab, is the founder of the Algorithmic Justice League, an organization trying to fight what it calls the ''coded gaze'' of biased algorithms. This year, she and Ms. Gebru -- a Google researcher and co-founder of a group called Black in A.I. -- released a study that showed that three leading facial recognition algorithms were substantially worse at classifying darker faces than lighter faces, and worse at classifying women's faces than men's faces. The study set off alarm bells at leading tech companies, and was widely cited as evidence of the need for more diversity in the field.</p><p>  Separately, Ms. Anandkumar, Nvidia's director of machine learning research and a professor at Caltech, saw that the name of the A.I. field's marquee annual event -- the Neural Information Processing Systems conference, or NIPS -- had been used as fodder for sexist jokes. So she started a #ProtestNIPS campaign to change the name, and drew up a petition that gathered more than 2,000 signatures. Eventually, the conference's board relented, and the event is now abbreviated as ''NeurIPS.'' It was a small gesture of inclusion that could go a long way toward making women feel more welcome in the field for years to come.</p><p>  To Promise, Uptrust and Clear My Record, for helping solve our prison problem.</p><p>  Ending mass incarceration has long been seen as a political challenge. But these three companies are trying to show that technology can help.</p><p>  Promise is an app built to keep people out of jail. Aimed at pretrial defendants who cannot afford to post cash bail, it creates customized care plans for each user, sends them reminders of court dates and other critical appointments and allows courts to monitor their progress. The company, which participated in the YCombinator start-up program, recently raised $3 million from investors including Jay-Z's Roc Nation fund and First Round Capital.</p><p>  Another start-up, Uptrust, offers a similar text message-based system that sends personalized appointment reminders to low-income clients, and can connect them to services that make getting to court easier, such as rides or child care. The service is already up and running in a handful of states, including Baltimore County, Md., and Palm Beach County, Fla.</p><p>  Code for America, a nonprofit organization modeled after Teach for America, built Clear My Record, a tool that helps people with old criminal convictions get them reduced or expunged, which makes it easier for them to find housing and get jobs. This year, the team formed a partnership with George Gasc\u00f3n, the San Francisco district attorney, to work on a new program that automates the process of expunging marijuana-related convictions under the state's legalization laws. The group aims to remove 250,000 convictions by the end of 2019.</p><p>  To workers at big tech companies, for holding their employers accountable.</p><p>  The most heartening trend to come out of large tech companies in 2018 was a surge in employee-led activism. Protests by regulators, shareholders and users have thus far failed to stop the worst excesses of the industry, leaving these companies' own employees -- who are expensive and hard to replace, and therefore have lots of leverage -- to agitate for change from within.</p><p>  At Google, a group of employees went public with concerns about Project Dragonfly, a secret Google project to create a censored version of its search engine for China. Their activism resulted in a petition, which was signed by hundreds of Google employees, to demand that the company cease work on the project.</p><p>  Another group of employees spoke up after The Times reported on the $90 million payout made to the former Google executive Andy Rubin, who was accused of sexual misconduct. Their efforts culminated in a 20,000-employee protest walkout.</p><p>  Workers at Amazon and Microsoft have also spoken up for change within their companies, on issues ranging from climate change to surveillance, A.I. ethics and the decision to work with federal immigration agencies.</p><p>  These workers didn't solve every problem in tech overnight, but they have created a playbook for other employee activists to follow. More important, they have finally given their executives a measure of accountability -- something they proved they will badly need in 2019.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-721620181222</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V19-9511-JBG3-64N8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1290\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The New York Times Company</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times</publicationName><edition>The New York Times on the Web</edition><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/technology/year-in-technology-2018.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/technology/year-in-technology-2018.html</url><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 22, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;
