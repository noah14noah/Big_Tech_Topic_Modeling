It's unclear whether the companies' stock prices will suffer in the long run as uncertainty surrounds the scope of the probes. But market strategists and legal experts are warning big-tech investors face major risks. Visit Market Insider's homepage for more stories[5].Federal regulators are knocking at Big Tech's door. </p><p>The US Federal Trade Commission will oversee any antitrust probe into whether Facebook[6]'s practices hurt competition into the digital market, the Wall Street Journal reported[7] earlier this month. The news sent the social network's shares plunging and dragged the entire technology sector lower. Alphabet[8] and Apple[9] saw their stocks fall on similar press reports the same day that the US Department of Justice was preparing antitrust probes into each company. Meanwhile, Sen. Elizabeth Warren \u2014 the Massachusetts Democrat and US presidential candidate \u2014 proposed earlier this year[10] a plan to break up big tech companies including Amazon, Google, and Facebook. While it remains to be seen whether reported probes and proposals into antitrust matters and privacy concerns will mark a death knell for the likes of Facebook[11] and Google parent Alphabet[12] \u2014 as the exact scopes of the probes remain unclear \u2014 experts are warning against investors shrugging off possible risks.

They added: \"But while the impact of regulation on today's stocks will be case-dependent, similarities among historical outcomes suggest that investors should reduce exposure to any stock that becomes subject to an antitrust lawsuit.\" The strategists pointed to past regulatory events, with shades of today's concerns, that ushered in material business losses. For example, Microsoft[14]'s 1998 antritrust lawsuit ultimately led to a reversed court-ordered breakup and a settlement with the Department of Justice. The corporation then saw \"substantially\" lower sales growth following its 2001 consent decree that expired a decade later, according to Goldman. Meanwhile, they found IBM[15]'s antitrust lawsuit in 1969 kicked off a \"steady decline\" in revenue growth and margins.Other investment firms are highlighting similar risks of which investors should be cognizant, even as the extent of various regulatory bodies' probes is a wildcard. As issues like data security and the overall health of technology platforms becomes increasingly prevalent, companies face a \"higher cost of doing business,\" Morgan Stanley strategists wrote in a late-May report. \"Outside of China, the risk of regulation limiting foreign investment in local companies may present a headwind to international growth and profitability for some of our companies,\" they wrote.

Court mandated break-ups have been infrequently implemented in US history and are unlikely to be seen here, according to Glenn Manishin, a managing partner at ParadigmShift Law and a former trial attorney for the DoJ's antitrust divison. He worked on the US vs. AT...nd Microsoft cases. Facebook runs the highest risk of a split relative to other big-tech companies given its Instagram acquisition, followed by Google, Apple, then Amazon, Manishin said on a conference call this week with Instinet analysts. Read more: The news industry is joining the attack against big tech companies like Google and Facebook[17] Specifically, the fact that Google's case started in the FTC and is now in the DoJ could have negative implications given the latter unit's focus on monopolization claims and the former's focus on unfair methods of competition. The risks hanging over big tech were underscored this week when Makan Delrahim, the assistant attorney general in the Department of Justice's antitrust division, addressed the matter at a conference[18] in Tel Aviv, Israel. \"The Antitrust Division does not take a myopic view of competition,\" Delrahim said[19]. \"Many recent calls for antitrust reform, or more radical change, are premised on the incorrect notion that antitrust policy is only concerned with keeping prices low. It is well-settled, however, that competition has price and non-price dimensions.\" Read more: A top DOJ official just outlined why the agency has everything it needs to go after Big Tech \u2014 and Facebook, Google, and Amazon should be nervous[20] The DoJ has \"the tools we need to enforce the antitrust laws in cases involving digital technologies,\" he added, and said US antitrust law is flexible enough to apply to \"markets old and new.\" This sent alarm bells off for Nicholas Colas, a veteran analyst and co-founder of DataTrek Research. Investors should get ready to hear Delrahim's name \"a lot more,\" he told clients in a note this week. \"It's hard to read this speech and not think the Justice Department is lining up its arguments for a showdown with Big Tech,\" Colas wrote. \"What comes from that is anyone's guess.\" Now read more markets coverage from Markets Insider and Business Insider: Heineken and other drink stocks just

Almost instantly, all was forgiven and forgotten.</p><p>Now the tech industry - which, among other impressive innovations, provides the world's knowledge on demand, lets people freely broadcast their diverse opinions and has made shopping as easy as pushing a button - has made some mistakes of its own. It has abused privacy, squeezed the competition and casually spread hate. And that's just the beginning of the list.</p><p>Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple might not get away as cleanly as Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, released proposals this month that would force tech breakups and impose severe restrictions on what remained. Another Democratic presidential candidate, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, covered more briefly some of the same ground, saying, \"We have a major monopoly problem.\"</p><p>At a moment when nearly everything in America seems wildly contentious, antitrust action against tech is getting a sober look. Antitrust is the nuclear bomb of regulatory policy, but the reaction to Warren's and Klobuchar's ideas was surprisingly receptive.</p><p>\"We've got to break these guys apart,\" Warren said in an interview on \"Face the Nation.\" The show could name only one critic of her proposal: Howard Schultz, the Starbucks mogul, who is flirting with an independent run for president to the deep disregard of voters.</p><p>\"A billionaire, right?\" Warren noted.</p><p>For decades, a politician who mentioned \"antitrust\" was essentially arguing for more government oversight, which has been dangerous territory at least since the Ronald Reagan administration. \"Antitrust\" was relegated to the shelf with \"socialism\" and \"wealth inequality\" and \"higher taxes for higher incomes.\"</p><p>It didn't help that what could be called \"maximum antitrust\" - when the Justice Department decides a company is abusing its monopoly power and should be broken up - has a mixed history. The government dropped such a case against IBM in 1982 after more than a decade. It settled its case against Microsoft in 2001. Only AT&amp;T, which agreed in 1982 to dissolve itself into a long-distance company and the seven Baby Bells, could be considered an unqualified success from the government's point of view.</p><p>The political landscape is shifting, however, at a speed that dumbfounds even antitrust experts. President Barack Obama thought of the tech companies in the way they think of themselves: as progressive, smart entrepreneurs who want what's best for America. His administration declined to pursue Google on antitrust charges and hired from the tech industry for top posts. Top staff members later went to work for the tech industry in top posts, too. It was a cozy relationship.</p><p>\"Something has definitely changed,\" said Geoffrey A. Manne, founder of the International Center for Law and Economics, a think tank in Portland, Ore. \"Most voters are very fond of Amazon, Apple, Google and even Facebook. But I think there's also a growing sense of skepticism about all these companies. The shine has come off.\"</p><p>Manne, who has been a critic of the antitrust arguments against Google and has received funding from the search giant as well as from some of its competitors, including Comcast and AT&amp;T, eviscerated Warren's proposal with his colleague Alec Stapp in a recent blog post. </p><p>They wrote that the senator's plan to turn the top companies into heavily regulated \"platform utilities\" would make them as resistant to improvement as sewer systems or Amtrak.</p><p>And yet, Manne conceded in an interview, increased regulation is an idea whose time may have come.</p><p>\"There is a long history in America - just not a recent one - of using the power of the state to counteract the economic power of private enterprise,\" he said. \"We may be at that moment again.\"</p><p>The financial firms were predatory last decade, exploiting weak spots in the mortgage markets in a way that undermined their viability. Google and Facebook, by contrast, offer their services for free, while Amazon built its reputation on selling as cheaply as possible. </p><p>That makes it hard to regulate them by the antitrust consensus, which for a couple of decades has held that there is no injury unless consumers suffer by paying higher prices.</p><p>Nothing is ever really free, of course, and there has been a dawning realization among some consumers that they are paying for these services with information about themselves. How most users feel about this seems up in the air, as evidenced by a SurveyMonkey poll done for the news site Axios.</p><p>The headline finding was that \"a growing majority now views our online privacy as a crisis.\" But deeper in the survey was the revelation that more than half the respondents said they were unwilling to pay to keep from being tracked by a service they were using. Twenty-one percent said they would pay less than $1 a month, and no more, for the right.</p><p>Users, it seems, want it both ways: privacy and free services. This is the contradiction at the heart of the internet.</p><p>Daniel Crane, an antitrust expert at the University of Michigan, said Warren's proposal might be a hard sell to voters. \"The median consumer probably feels that she gets lots of free goodies from Big Tech and will worry about what it would mean to go after them,\" he said.</p><p>But Crane noted that being broken up was the least of the companies' worries. \"A likelier consequence is that the next acquisition they want to make will be rejected,\" he said. </p><p>That is already happening. One of the anti-competitive complaints about Amazon is that it prohibited its merchants from selling more cheaply elsewhere. That prevented a new platform from underselling Amazon and gaining a competitive edge.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUFNEW-630490</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUFNEW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VNW-52S1-DY37-D29T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8391</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"978\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Buffalo News All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Buffalo News (New York)</publicationName><edition>Buffalo News Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 19, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

A smaller group of these state officials, representing the broader coalition, is expected to unveil the investigation at a Sept. 9 news conference in Washington, according to three people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to discuss a law enforcement proceeding on the record, cautioning the plans could change. </p><p>It is unclear whether some or all of the attorneys general also plan to open or announce additional probes into other tech giants, including Amazon and Facebook, which have faced similar U.S. antitrust scrutiny. Over the past year, regulators around the country have grown increasingly wary regarding the power wielded by Silicon Valley, questioning whether the industry's access to vast amounts of proprietary data - and deep pockets - allow companies to gobble up rivals and maintain their dominance to the detriment of consumers. Two federal antitrust agencies have opened probes targeting the industry broadly, while lawmakers in Congress have grilled executives from Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google about the business practices. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Post.) Outside of the nation's capital, however, state officials also have started questioning the growing influence of big tech. Attorneys general in multiple states have threatened that competition probes could be on the horizon, The Post first reported in March, and states such as Louisiana and Mississippi have sharply criticized Google for its handling of users' personal information and its algorithms for surfacing search results. Those states did not respond to requests for comment. Texas officials have raised similar concerns. They have also said that Google may be violating state consumer-protection laws if political bias at Google resulted in the censorship of conservative viewpoints. A spokesman for the attorney general there also did not respond to a request for comment. Over the summer, some state attorneys general met privately with officials from the Justice Department, which announced its own broad review into big tech, to discuss their antitrust concerns. The agency's antitrust leader, Makan Delrahim, later said at a conference in August that the federal government is coordinating with state leaders, which he numbered at more than a dozen, but declined to offer further details about the agency's plans. It is unclear whether the DOJ will join the states at the event, and a spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \"Google's services help people every day, create more choice for consumers, and support thousands of jobs and small businesses across the country,\" spokesman Jose Castaneda said in a statement. \"We continue to work constructively with regulators, including attorneys general, in answering questions about our business and the dynamic technology sector.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HCHRN-MERLIN70308208</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HCHRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X03-G861-DYRV-44KS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8380</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"517\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst Newspapers, a division of Hearst Communications, Inc.

The more data a company has, the more likely it is to succeed. Thus, data is the key to profit in today's economy.</p><p>\"However, the data collected is concentrated in a small number of dominant companies/platforms,\" the AGs wrote. \"Today around 90 percent of internet searches use one search engine, and over 90 percent of young people have a profile on one social media platform. Just 1 percent of smartphones use an operating system other than Apple's iOS or Google's Android.\"</p><p>Therefore, data concentration in the hands of a few tech companies may limit competition.</p><p>\"A firm's deeply entrenched knowledge of individual consumers' habits can make it nearly impossible for a rival or potential rival to target advertisements with comparable accuracy, or woo third-party online advertisers based on a dramatically thinner accumulation of historical data,\" the AGs argue in their letter. \"Studies show that the historical search improves search results up to 31 percent.\"</p><p>FTC commissioner Rohit Chopra recently corroborated the AGs' claims when he told the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety and Data Security last week that \"if you talk to investors, many will tell you that they're not going to fund a start up unless they can figure out how to sell that company to an existing large incumbent like Google or Facebook.\"</p><p>But there's the a rub: economists don't agree on how competition should be defined in a 21st century economy. The current approach to antitrust issues relies on the Chicago School of Economics definition of competition, which is, good competition leads to lower prices for goods and services and thus benefits the consumer.</p><p>In the current tech climate, that is exactly what's happening: Facebook and Google provide their services for free, and Amazon provides almost unbeatably cheap prices for the products sold on its website.</p><p>As Lina Kahn, a legal fellow at Yale Law specializing in competition law, puts it in her 2017 paper, \"the present approach fails even if one believes that antitrust should promote only consumer interests. Critically, consumer interests include not only cost but also product quality, variety, and innovation. Protecting these long-term interests requires a much thicker conception of \"consumer welfare\" than what guides the current approach.\"</p><p>Lawrence White, professor of economics at New York University's Leonard N. Stern School of Business, however, thinks the state AGs' argument rings hollow.</p><p>\"The first part of the proposition is correct -- historical data does provide an advantage to larger companies, but I would think of this as an economy of scale,\" he told InsideSources.</p><p>Basically, he said, having more data is just an advantage of being bigger and better at business, and regulators shouldn't punish companies simply for their size.</p><p>\"Is this worth doing anything in the antitrust arena? My instincts are not, partly because this is just another advantage of size, and if we start going after all the advantages of size, we're never going to stop,\" he said.</p><p>Instead of trying to break up the current tech companies, White said, the FTC should stop them from acquiring the competition. For example, allowing Facebook to acquire Instagram and WhatsApp was a \"mistake.\"</p><p>AGs and the FTC could bring antitrust cases against big tech companies, but first, they need to convince economists and the courts that the current antitrust framework needs to be updated to deal with 21st century tech issues.</p><p>\"Antitrust has often been described as a consumer welfare statute,\" the AGs wrote. \"At a minimum, it focuses on the price effects that challenged conduct may have on the consumer. But it does -- and should -- encompass more. For example, antitrust law also reaches conduct with harmful effects on innovation and quality, as well as effects that are likely to cause consumer harm, albeit indirectly. It seeks to protect the competitive process, for the ultimate benefit of consumers.\"</p><p>Follow Kate on Twitter</p><p>___ (c)2018 InsideSources.com, Washington, D.C.

This framing, though popular as it is, misunderstands who the agent is in AI and Big Tech.</p><p>It is not the algorithms themselves, but those who design them and define their goals.</p><p>It's not Big Tech and AI that are threatening democracy and sparking a new Cold War, it's the political vision of those that design their codes and the unchecked hold on power that allows them to make those visions a reality. AI and algorithms are merely tools that are ways to maintain and extend status quo political landscapes.</p><p>Authoritarian states may use these tools to centralize control, while democracies can use them to expand and modernize people-power.</p><p>It has been decided that AI as the way of the future, for better or for worse. And in this environment, deciphering between the actual impacts of AI in governance and prophetic polemics is becoming harder; the task more inaccessible even as the stakes for understanding it grow by the day.</p><p>Continuing to misattribute the power of algorithms to code itself, cybersecurity experts argue, guarantees the states and corporations behind them will continue to shape AI-driven governance with no transparency.</p><p>Part One: Understanding how AI works</p><p>//</p><p>AI and Algorithms Are Not Self-Generating a Data-Driven Technostate</p><p>(The Royal Society of Arts)</p><p>To understand the power of AI and the algorithms that define it, it's important to start by defining what these algorithms are and what they aren't.</p><p>Cathy O'Neil, a data scientist and author of the book \"Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy,\" recently spoke about a central misconception about algorithms: \"I went into data science and I was struck by what I thought was essentially a lie. Namely that algorithms were being presented and marketed as objective fact,\" she said.</p><p>\"A much more accurate description of an algorithm is that its an opinion embedded in math. An algorithm is a very general concept. It's something that we do in our heads every day. To build an algorithm, we need only two things essentially: a historical data and a definition of success.\"</p><p>An illustrative example of an algorithm is cooking dinner for her family. O'Neil's data set for her dinner is her ingredients, and she assess its success when her children are eating. If they're eating vegetables, the dinner was successful. On the flipside, if the children were the ones who defined the success of the dinner algorithm, it would be a failure if they encountered any vegetables, O'Neil quips.</p><p>Facial recognition algorithms that build predictive policing programs function in the same way, though their political consequences can be grave.</p><p>//</p><p>In 2016, a man named Willie Lynch was convicted of selling crack in Florida: his case was decided by a photo taken at the scene of a drug deal with undercover agents that was then put through a facial recognition software. That same software has come under fire for its racial biases, which many claim comes from the fact that it's written by members of one race that cannot be accurately used on another. Facial recognition software have had issues with confusing black people with guerrillas, since coders imprinted their own biases of others' physicality.</p><p>Combine that with policing laws that disproportionately target vulnerable community members of color, and you have an algorithm just as biased as its programmers, which is now embedding racial policing protocols in the language of scientific objectivity.</p><p>\"If you're black, you're more likely to be subjected to this technology and the technology is more likely to be wrong,\" U.S. politician and Chair of the House Oversight Committee, Elijah Cummings said in 2017.</p><p>\"That's a hell of a combination.\"</p><p>(Shutterstock)</p><p>Crime predicting algorithms are also reportedly targeting poorer neighborhoods with dominant minority populations as they are the ones already monitored more heavily by police.</p><p>These algorithms recommend a heavier police presence, which exacerbates the bias and drives arrest rates up. \"The utilitarian bean-counters will clock this up as a success. But the data will continue to feed back into the model, creating a self-perpetuating loop of growing inequality and algorithm-driven racial targeting,\" explains Jamie Bartlett, a senior fellow at Demos.</p><p>\"We embed our values into algorithms,\" data scientist O'Neil concluded. To put it simply, an algorithm mechanizes a way to accomplish a goal set by humans, whose values are also defined by humans and reliant on pre-existing social or political conditions. It is a tool, and its accomplishments function in service to those who make it.</p><p>Instead of this dynamic informing how the global community conceptualizes the power of AI, experimental physicist Dan McQuillan observes that \"AI has become a hyperobject so massive that its totality is not realised in any local manifestation, a higher dimensional entity that adheres to anything it touches, whatever the resistance, and which is perceived by us through its informational imprints.\"</p><p>AI is becoming an inaccessible, transcendent entity that is untouchable, unanalyzable, and ungovernable, sitting in a black box of fake objectivity as it slowly takes over governance, policing and surveillance.</p><p>\"It's vital we don't allow the AI-evangelists or product managers to dominate this conversation: it can't just be 'oh this is too confusing!' or 'oh the march of AI is inevitable,'  Alex Krasodomski-Jones, director of the Center for the Analysis of Social Media at the London-based Demos, told Al Bawaba.</p><p>\"Neither of those things are true.\"</p><p>\"Unchecked, AI is likely to augment existing powers, particularly in states with weak democratic safeguards. Increasingly invasive surveillance, for instance, or the use of machine-learning models in law enforcement, are worrying precedents for the use of AI under repressive regimes,\" Krasodomski-Jones added.</p><p>So What Does AI and Big Data Do Politically?</p><p>//</p><p>An emerging consensus among data scientists and tech analysts is that AI and its constituent algorithms reinforce pre-existing political orders with new, automated ways to govern people.</p><p>\"A society whose synapses have been replaced by neural networks will generally tend to a heightened version of the status quo. Machine learning by itself cannot learn a new system of social patterns, only pump up the existing ones as computationally eternal,\" Mcquillan writes.</p><p>This emerging type of society is particularly evident in places ruled by authoritarian states, where governments have the ability to totalize control over the development, goals and utilization of Big Data tech.</p><p>\"Authoritarian regimes can easily abuse such new powers and will be tempted to use them to control and suppress dissent,\" said Adrian Zenz, a social researcher with the European School of Culture &amp; Theology whose work has helped to expose a dystopian techno-police state in China.</p><p>\"It can certainly be said that the increase of surveillance technologies and predictive algorithms is likely to make daily life in connection with a securitized state both less transparent and could lead to a more frequent and more automated infringement on private rights, both by governments and companies,\" he added.</p><p>Some examples of this that can be exploited to enhance a state's power over its people are predictive policing programs that mass monitor millions of people and pick out those most likely to commit crimes, hate speech monitoring programs whose parameters for hate speech can be tweaked to jail dissidents and algorithms that block information and sites potentially critical of the state.</p><p>All of these types of programs are being developed by Chinese companies aligned with the governing party, the CCP.</p><p>China's Social Credit System</p><p>Beijing sunset (AFP/FILE)</p><p>The most standout example of precisely how this tech can enhance state power is China's social credit system, which is currently being perfected throughout the country.</p><p>The credit system aims to give every Chinese citizen a standardized score of trustworthiness, and every act recorded in public or in private may have an impact on that score. If you go under certain thresholds, you are slowly edged out of society: your rent may increase, you may be denied certain forms of public transportation, your passport may be invalidated and your face may be plastered in public as a way to shame you.</p><p>\"The impact of AI will be mostly felt on the domestic scene with the significant amount of data that is collected - for instance the social credit system that China is putting in place is possible because of the extensive data that the state is able to collect on its citizens and others living within the boundaries,\" Dr. Rajeswari Pillai Rajagopalan, a distinguished fellow and head of the Nuclear and Space Policy Initiative told Al Bawaba.</p><p>\"The facial recognition and social tracking that China has established to a large extent will aid in strengthening policing, law and order mechanisms and counter-terrorism but the very same technologies and capabilities can be put to use in a negative manner which can give way to what is known as digital authoritarianism,\" she added.</p><p>China's social credit system is still in its primitive stages, but the residents of one of the systems pilot towns have already felt its effects. Donghuo Tangzhai in China's Rongcheng region has a population of about 3,000 people. Zhou Aini, a retired resident, has been hired by China to be an 'Information Collector,\" for the town.</p><p>//</p><p>Aini is paid to walk around the town, talk to people on the street about what others are doing and record their lives in a notebook she carries with her everywhere. Aini writes down the information of people littering on the street or helping elders throughout the small town.</p><p>In this town, everyone starts off with 1,000 points. The deeds recorded in Aini's notebook are presented to a monitoring officer, who then assigns a positive or negative numerical value to each of those deeds and publicizes the actions on a community signpost, where everyone can see just how good or bad their neighbors have been.</p><p>\"Now in our community, neighbors get along very well. There are no fights. Not at all. Now life is good. There is no reason to fight,\" Wang Fengbo, the appointed director of the town's credit system, exclaimed to a reporter.</p><p>Fengbo shared the story of a resident with a penchant for alcohol who used to physically abuse his wife. \"Although this is a family issue, it's a bad influence,\" said Fengbo. \"We also deduct the points.\"</p><p>Zhang Yingjie, another resident, co-signed on a loan with someone who was unable to pay his share, and was subsequently docked social points. Because of his new low score, he was unable secure any more loans, take high-speed transit around the vast country or buy certain products.</p><p>Zhang Yingjie (Vice News)</p><p>In order to restore his score to the point where it no longer inhibited his quality of life, he had to go to a local government office, where he paid money the government insists goes to charity. The workers he gives the money to record his deed and slowly his score went back up. Yingjie explained that he also donated blood and did volunteer work in his spare time to help nurture his score.</p><p>The CCP's experiment with a unified social credit system has already impacted tens of millions of people, who find themselves paying more interest on loans or for utilities, or are unable to travel.</p><p>From the stories shared from Donghuo Tangzhai, residents are careful to watch their own behavior in private lest their actions are recorded and they are penalized.</p><p>As it is currently designed, the credit system is more or less a worst-case scenario for techno-dystopianism who fear people power is being ceded to impersonal Big Data algorithms that govern their lives.</p><p>But again, that mischaracterizes the system as the agent in the oppression rather than the tool, which may excuse the very human political responsibility the government bears for deploying the program while contributing to the neutralization of the social credit system itself to become an intangible 'hyperobject.'</p><p>The social credit system isn't the beginning of a technocracy but an indication that a central government has found a way for its citizens to acquiesce to its system of controls so thoroughly that they now police themselves. It's a proof-of-concept policy that reveals the use of Big Data and AI as tools that help a state wield power over its people.</p><p>The tools may be scary and unknown-seeming, but the perpetrators remain the same.</p><p>\"Artificial intelligence threatens to centralise political decision-making power, disempower citizens, alienate them from participating in democratic decision-making, reduce the power of workers in a workforce and so on,\" noted Alex Krasodomski-Jones of Demos.</p><p>AI isn't a new harbinger of doom, but another political tool in the age-old quest to consolidate power. Demanding transparency in the codemaking process may be the most effective means to understand its uses and abuses.</p><p>According to Krasodomski-Jones, \"for us to make the best of AI, we need two things: first, the political will, powers and scrutiny, and likely regulation, required to ensure that AI is being used in a way that is fair and democratic. Second, a commitment by AI developers to ensure that the products they are building are open to this level of scrutiny.\"</p><p>Part two: What are the political visions AI services?</p><p>//</p><p>//</p><p>The geopolitical giants of the 20th century, the U.S. and the Soviet Union, locked themselves into a space race that resembles the current quest for AI dominance between the U.S. and China.</p><p>Both states funnelled billions into their respective spaceflight programs in the hopes of being the first to develop advanced spaceflight technology. The U.S. eventually 'won' by landing the successful Apollo 11 module on the surface of the moon.</p><p>Now, policy analysts and commentators are comparing the technological developments in AI between the U.S. and China as the next 'tech race,' and following benchmarks of progress to determine who is winning. Beating the world's top chess player was considered a major benchmark for machine learning; another was winning in the ancient Chinese game of 'Go.'</p><p>China and the U.S.  are further attempting to design AI and machine learning algorithms at breakneck speeds while trying to slow the progress of the other; as the U.S. and USSR did to each other in the mid-20th century.</p><p>But this type of coverage and framing misses the more fundamental and pressing questions of the AI tech race, ones that were implicitly understood in determining the 'winner' of the earlier race to spaceflight.</p><p>The point for each state was never simply to 'win the race' but to demonstrate that they had the superior structure for organizing society around a state; one that was more efficient, prosperous and better at engineering progress that surpassed certain benchmarks. Getting into space first and landing on the moon were just ways of showing off one side's perceived societal superiority.</p><p>Current coverage of the race to AI dominance however, hides the more fundamental questions lurking beneath: namely, the political visions driving AI's development into the future.</p><p>What are the socio-political visions of those creating AI and algorithms? What types of societies do they help engender, and how do they affect a person's relationship to the state and to corporations? Do China and the U.S. have different ideas for how AI ought to be used?</p><p>'Winning' the AI race may be a vague goal, but the real trophy rests with the government that can successfully use AI to service its strategic priorities.</p><p>As AI becomes more advanced and is relied upon as a tool of governance, it is increasingly important to understand the political visions of its coders.</p><p>The Cold War between the U.S. and China includes a vitally under-reported difference in the way each government is attempting to utilize AI.</p><p>For China, AI is an instrument being used to centralize state power over citizens; to augment authoritarian governments' hold on power.</p><p>The U.S., so far, lacks a central organizing principle for the political use of AI, but is trying to develop one that advances its military edge.</p><p>The CCP's Big Data Dreams</p><p>(Megvii)</p><p>The biggest difference between China and the U.S.' AI ambitions is that China has one and is structuring its technology sector around it. Meanwhile the U.S., with its array of private Silicon Valley interests and Washington policymakers lacking a consensus, has still yet to develop a cohesive strategy for AI.</p><p>Zhuang Rongwen, the new leader of China's Cyberspace Administration of China, laid out the country's hopes for the new AI-powered digital age in a manifesto published Sep 2018.</p><p>\"In the current era, the Internet has already become the main channel for producing, disseminating, and obtaining information. Its ability to mobilize society is ever greater, increasingly becoming a transmitter and amplifier of all kinds of risks,\" he writes.</p><p>\"Whoever masters the Internet holds the initiative of the era,\" Rongwen pens, \"and whoever does not take the Internet seriously will be cast aside by the times.\"</p><p>The manifesto decries the lack of control the CCP has over the internet as the central organizing space, and portrays the digital realm's chaotic lack of governance as having \"created major difficulties for the Party ideological departments' uniform leadership over ideology and theory propagation\u2026\"</p><p>Totalizing control over cyberspace and the flow of information, Rongwen explains, \"has become a major and urgent task set in front of us.\"</p><p>China's leader, Xi Jinping, put it more bluntly: \"We need to enhance the combination of AI and social governance and develop AI systems for government services and decision-making,\" he explained at a Politburo \"group study session\" regarding AI. Chinese academics and tech workers call this state embrace of AI governance a \"military-civil fusion.\"</p><p>The new manifesto reflects the CCP's general desire to use AI as form of digital governance that compels, incentivizes and coerces acquiescence while punishing, surveilling and censoring dissidence.</p><p>It's a continuation of the CCP's general style of authoritarian governance, only it adds a flashy new tool to accomplish these tasks.</p><p>Xi Jinping (AFP/FILE)</p><p>To harness the technology under the auspices of the CCP, China has organized much of the technology sector around the ruling party's agenda.</p><p>Its biggest technology companies are led by CCP loyalists and party members; state-owned investment firms ensure any and all promising tech companies that presents strategically valuable AI are generously funded and incubated.</p><p>Tencent is one of the biggest companies in the world responsible for multi-billion dollar investments in other firms, social media apps, games and internet services among other products. Its founder, CEO and Chairman, Ma Huateng, is a delegate in China's National People's Congress. At a conference in Singapore, Huateng explained that free speech was potentially dangerous, saying \" We are a great supporter of the government in terms of the information security. We try to have a better management and control of the Internet.\"</p><p>Tencent's prized all-purpose app, WeChat, reflects this position. WeChat is a credit card, social media app, messaging service, appointment booker, logistical assistant, search engine and mobile calling device all in one application. Because of its ubiquitous functionality, the app helps further China's so-called Golden Shield of censorship by filtering out messages and images that may contain anti-regime sentiment.</p><p>Alibaba, the other major tech company in China, competes with Tencent for profits but services the CCP's AI goals with as much efficiency. Its founder and chairman, Jack Ma, was recently outed as a member of the CCP.</p><p>Alibaba is one of the country's biggest financiers of emergent tech that relies on AI to bolster predictive policing programs being utilized throughout the country.</p><p>In early 2018, Alibaba invested $327 million into Megvii, which helped to develop a face-scanning payment program for Alibaba. Megvii specializes in facial recognition technology and one of its most advanced products, Face ++, is being used developed and utilized as part of a multi-pronged police state in northwestern China.</p><p>//</p><p>Later, in April 2018, Alibaba led a $620 million fundraising effort for Megvii's competitor, SenseTime, which also produces state-of-the-art facial recognition tech to be used in monitoring and predictive policing.</p><p>State-owned venture capital and investment firms are also pouring billions into tech projects which promise to provide the CCP innovative ways to centralize control over its people and cyberspace.</p><p>To add to Megvii's value, Bank of China Group Investment, a state-owned private equity firm, pledged $200 million to the tech startup.</p><p>According to the Reuters report which broke news of the firm's investment intentions, \"Megvii's latest fundraising comes amid Beijing's plans to build a ubiquitous closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance network and become an international leader in AI, a technology that is increasingly becoming key to various sectors.\"</p><p>Another state-owned investment body was established in 2016 by the CCP and given a $30 billion budget to invest in tech startups and AI. A Global Risk Insights report on the new fund details that \"although referred to as 'venture capital' in name, the fund exists first and foremost to serve the needs of the government.\"</p><p>The overall level of coordination, cooperation and strategic alignment of China's ruling government and its private firms is striking. A real-time illustration of this joint public-private effort to develop AI towards centralizing control can be found in the province of Xinjiang.</p><p>Much has been reported on Xinjiang's multifaceted, layered police state, but the basics are this: the CCP is building a state-operated, privately supplied surveillance network aimed against the region's ethnic and religious minorities. Over a million Turkic Muslims have been reportedly sent to detention centers while millions of others have their every movement, conversation and purchase tracked by an exhaustive yet unitary monitoring system.</p><p>Maya Wang, a researcher for Human Rights Watch, explained the goal of China's AI-powered police state: \"The goal is to mass engineer the identity of the Muslims--which are too different from Hans [the main ethnicity in China], from the state's perspective-- so they become loyal, obedient subjects of the CCP. This is done through pervasive surveillance, political indoctrination and control--particularly over their movement--over the Muslims of that region.\"</p><p>Xinjiang is the realized dream of the CCP's AI ambitions. It's also serving as a human testing ground to further augment and perfect the tech that's being tested there.</p><p>The U.S.' Chaotic Assemblage of AI Interests</p><p>(AFP/FILE)</p><p>The U.S. on the other hand, has comparatively little coordination between its various public and private interests.</p><p>While China has the overarching CCP, party-aligned tech giant companies and investment firms acting in unison towards a single objective, the U.S. has independent Silicon Valley companies and a federal government desperately trying to entice companies with lucrative government contracts.</p><p>AI's application in the U.S.' public sphere is defined by local, conflicting interests rather than nationally developed strategies. For example, some local police departments use AI-driven programs to identify which neighborhoods to patrol or which suspects to charge. AI experts warned that these programs simply reinforce the racial prejudice of their coders and hurt efforts for police accountability. Start-ups are now designing AI to police the police by attempting to analyze their body camera footage. Other startups are developing AI-powered body cameras that enhance their ability to carry out surveillance.</p><p>Private U.S. companies have an outsized ability to gather mass amounts of data, like the ones in China, but often process the data internally to further their own agendas or sell the information to other private companies. When the U.S. federal government demands some elements of this information, private pushback is often fierce.</p><p>For example, in 2016 the FBI tried to force Apple to unlock the phone of a suspect in a terror attack, Apple refused and the issue went to court.</p><p>Further, to counteract the buildup of Big Data in the hands of powerful U.S. corporations and police, scientists and engineers from MIT are developing advanced cryptographic methods to improve transparency for when and what data is released and ensure accountability for those who improperly gather data.</p><p>All of this paints a chaotic picture of AI's socio-political developments, with its many players positioning themselves against one another and no central authority or blueprint regulating or guiding them.</p><p>In May 2018, former U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis wrote a memo to Trump pleading with him to create a unified framework for harnessing the strategic power of AI.</p><p>In the memo, Mattis said the U.S. was lagging behind the progress of Chinese AI development. Quoting a recent Atlantic piece penned by Henry Kissinger, Mattis urged Trump to create a presidential commision on AI that would \"ensure the U.S. is a leader not just in matters of defense but in the broader 'transformation of the human condition,'\" that will be caused by AI.</p><p>According to cybersecurity experts Al Bawaba spoke with, despite this plea, the U.S. federal government has yet to develop such a blueprint.</p><p>//</p><p>\"The U.S. still don't have a cohesive, national AI strategy, for instance, and policymakers who discuss AI focus too heavily on its military applications,\" said Justin Sherman, a Cybersecurity Policy Fellow at New America.</p><p>Those who hoped Trump would create one were disappointed by a recent executive order that failed to articulate any concrete steps the U.S. will do to develop a comprehensive AI framework.</p><p>While the federal government lags behind, the Department of Defense is attempting to create a military-backed tech incubator of its own. In June 2018, the Pentagon announced the creation of a the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC), nicknamed Jake, which will provide funding and oversight services to firms developing military tech.</p><p>The memo that announced JAIC describes the center as one that revolves around 'National Mission Initiatives,' the first of which is reportedly Project Maven.</p><p>Project Maven is an ongoing program to enhance the Pentagon's ability to target people in drone strikes. As such, it relies on developing an advanced AI program that can distinguish between people and objects.</p><p>Google signed on to build the AI, and reportedly outsourced the task to a crowd worker website, which pays people as little as $1 an hour for performing short, menial tasks such as identifying things in videos and pictures. The workers did not know the data they were sifting through and identify was going into building the military AI program to be used around the world.</p><p>U.S.' armed 'Grey Eagle' Drone (U.S. Military)</p><p>When Google's employees gained knowledge of their company's efforts to build an AI to be used in drone strikes, 3,100 of them signed a petition to demand the company end its dealings with the Pentagon; something that could never be done in China.</p><p>Google's executives relented and withdrew from the project, but internal emails acquired by Gizmodo show an executive team who \"saw a huge opportunity for growth in the possibility of lucrative business with the Pentagon and projects that could ultimately lead to a cutting-edge AI-powered system capable of surveilling entire cities.\"</p><p>Despite the controversy, Project Maven's AI program \"has already been deployed to half a dozen locations in the Middle East and Africa, where it is helping military analysts sort through the mountains of data their sensors and drones soak up.\"</p><p>The U.S. may have developed the most complicated and advanced AI systems capable of conquering increasingly complex problems, but China is using them for brutally efficient means of socio-political ends that end up being far more impactful.</p><p>To this, Al Bawaba spoke with Dan McQuillan, an experimental physicist and theorist on AI's applications at Goldsmiths, University of London, and asked him what it means that AI, arguably the most promising technology being developed in the world today, is being honed as a tool to police and surveil populations.</p><p>\"I think it says we're in serious trouble,\" he said bluntly.</p><p>Part three: To embrace or regulate AI's role in politics: the central dilemma</p><p>//</p><p>A growing number of artificial intelligence experts are warning that the technology may render democracy obsolete.</p><p>Data-driven policing are bringing more cops to poor neighborhoods; they are tracking over a billion Chinese citizens in their everyday movements, they are virtually monitoring borders between countries and determining access to welfare and living expenses.</p><p>They are managing information flows, creating penetrative surveillance states while turning phones into listening devices corporations can use to target consumers based on their conversations. They are radicalizing entire populations through source-filtering and are now determining who lives and dies in drone strikes. But advancements are also revolutionizing the practice of medicine, civil engineering and infrastructure development: AI systems are beginning to read medical images better than imperfect human eyes and are creating better-organized infrastructures for cities.</p><p>Politically, AI's development is blurring lines of governance, making some authoritarian regimes even less accountable while expanding the power of corporations over citizens, making the biggest ones more like quasi-governmental bodies without any typical standards of governmental transparency applied to them.</p><p>Applications of AI are, quietly and without deliberation, rewriting countries' social contracts.</p><p>As evidence of AI's power in shaping social and political life mounts, AI developers and governments are struggling to formulate a central strategy around which to define its uses and limits.</p><p>Two distinct schools of thoughts, however, are steadily forming: one that calls for AI to be tightly controlled and regulated and another that calls for the utter embrace of AI.</p><p>The former hopes the type of analogue democracy crafted in the Enlightenment era and idealized ever since can be preserved. The latter seeks the reinvention of democracy into a fully fledged 'nanocracy,' or advocates the automatization of authoritarianism.</p><p>While the E.U. is busy attempting to clarify AI's place in governance, China is weaponizing its use, signalling a full statist embrace of the technology.</p><p>With AI-driven governance tempting more countries throughout the world, time is running out to ensure the technology's ethical use.</p><p>Regulating AI to be \"Human-Centric\"</p><p>German Chancellor Angela Merkel speaking at a digital conference in Nuremberg (AFP/FILE)</p><p>The breakneck speed of AI's progress and use in governance has caused some to slow down and ask for its place in society to be clarified and carefully regulated.</p><p>The basic contention informing this approach is that the type of democracy and social contract idealized by current democracies in Europe and North America are worth preserving. States have obligations to their citizens to maintain basic levels of transparency, while corporations ought to have little, if any, role in governance. States further have obligations to protect the welfare of their citizens, while citizens give up a certain level of their freedom in order to be governed.</p><p>Because AI threatens to destabilize this fragile balance by giving states and corporations non-democratic, opaque governance tools that infringe upon certain agreed upon rights like freedom of speech, freedom to associate or organize and freedom from arbitrary detention or discrimination, its power should be limited.</p><p>The central force to control AI is by making sure its progress always meets ethical standards. Some are calling this the 'ethical algorithm,' or ethical A.I.</p><p>The E.U. recently assembled a commission comprised of academics and AI developers to draft a framework defining ethical AI and laying down a foundation for its use.</p><p>The assembly wrote, \"having the capability to generate tremendous benefits for individuals and society, AI also gives rise to certain risks that should be properly managed. Given that, on the whole, AI's benefits outweigh its risks, we must ensure to follow the road that maximises the benefits of AI while minimising its risks.\"</p><p>\"To ensure that we stay on the right track, a human-centric approach to AI is needed, forcing us to keep in mind that the development and use of AI should not be seen as a means in itself, but as having the goal to increase human well-being. Trustworthy AI will be our north star, since human beings will only be able to confidently and fully reap the benefits of AI if they can trust the technology,\" the report adds.</p><p>The phrase 'human-centric approach to AI' immediately stands out. It implicitly articulates the stakes involved in having a non-centric approach to AI: the subversion of human well-being, careless development of artificial intelligence with no thought to whether it constitutes actual social progress.</p><p>The report later defines human-centric approach to AI as one that \"strives to ensure that human values are always the primary consideration, and forces us to keep in mind that the development and use of AI should not be seen as a means in itself, but with the goal of increasing citizen's well-being.\"</p><p>//</p><p>Interestingly enough, the report does not lay out a rigorous definition of what 'human values' are, taking it as a given that human values and its supposed opposite, presumably AI-centric values, are antagonistic towards one another.</p><p>Data scientist and author of the book \"Weapons of Math Destruction,\" Cathy O'Neil, calls for AI developers to create and obey a digital Hippocratic Oath, pledging their programs will do no harm.</p><p>O'Neil explained in an interview that taking such an oath is made difficult by the fact that data scientists and other AI developers are assigned to produce the most accurate, optimized algorithm but have no decision-making power in the fairness or equity of the task to which they are assigned.</p><p>She cites a conversation she had with a statistician developing a recidivism risk algorithm for a state prison system. \"Do you ever use race as an attribute to determine recidivism risk?\" she asked him, to which he responded \"Oh, no. I would never do that.\" However, when she asked him if he used zip codes as a way to assess  the risk for recidivism, he admitted he does, exposing that the algorithm he uses is likely discriminatory against disproportionately poor, minority-dominated neighborhoods.</p><p>\"I think the biggest thrust of a Hippocratic oath would be to realise that we have the ability and the potential to have an enormous amount of influence on society but without the wisdom to understand the true impact of this influence,\" O'Neil explains.</p><p>To answer the lingering question of acquisition of massive amounts of data, often without the consumer knowing, some are proposing that consumers get paid for the data they share. In Feb 2019, California Governor Gavin Newsom argued the case for \"a new data dividend\" law, which would require corporations to pay users for the data they are willing to share.</p><p>\"California's consumers should also be able to share in the wealth that is created from their data,\" Newson said. In theory, this regulation would help to create a two-way street for data sharing, revealing exactly what data is or isn't being vacuumed up by data-seeking corporations like Facebook, Google and Amazon.</p><p>How do you Regulate Artificial Intelligence?</p><p>A Chinese police officer shows off sunglasses outfitted with facial recognition technology (AFP/FILE)</p><p>To have a world with 'ethical AI' sounds safe enough, but creating the regulations necessary to achieve that end is an incredibly complex task that may stifle the promises of data-driven technology entirely.</p><p>Stanford University convened a panel of AI experts as part of a \"One Hundred Year Study of Artificial Intelligence,\" who all concluded that regulation wasn't the answer. \"The Study Panel's consensus is that attempts to regulate 'AI' in general would be misguided, since there is no clear definition of AI (it isn't any one thing), and the risks and considerations are very different in different domains,\" they wrote collectively.</p><p>The panel further warned against regulations that stymie innovation, the cornerstone of AI's rapid development. Indeed, advanced AI systems promise revolutions in the fields of medicine and infrastructure. Justin Sherman, a Cybersecurity Policy Fellow at New America, a think tank focused on security, tells Al Bawaba that AI promises \"massive gains in economic power and the quality of public health by developing, say, better cancer-detecting neural nets.\"</p><p>Already, AI is being used to detect kidney disease among other diagnoses along with medical imaging. So-called 'Smart Cities' designed by AI-driven algorithms also promise more efficient means of civil administration that saves time and money.</p><p>The progress of these developments may be slowed down by legislative bodies that are designed to make sure no algorithms infringe upon people's rights.</p><p>//</p><p>More basically on the Stanford Panel's first point; there is no actionable definition of AI with which regulations could written. A broad definition of AI may encourage governments to over-impose and mandate unwieldy, unenforceable regulations on programming in general.</p><p>To this, the Stanford panel encourages a different approach to governing AI: \"regulators can strengthen a virtuous cycle of activity involving internal and external accountability, transparency, and professionalization, rather than narrow compliance,\" they argue.</p><p>\"Policies should be evaluated as to whether they democratically foster the development and equitable sharing of AI's benefits, or concentrate power and benefits in the hands of a fortunate few,\" they continue.</p><p>Put simply, Ethical AI is best served not by instituting hard-line rules and demanding compliance by AI developers, but by encouraging transparency.</p><p>While this may not stop the shift in a social contract away from a traditional democracy, it will at least explicate the new moving parts, and publically show the new relationship people have to states using AI to govern them and corporations creating mountains of user-generated data.</p><p>Embracing AI: The Nanocracy and the Digital Authoritarian</p><p>China is weaponizing AI as a tool of authoritarian governance (AFP/FILE)</p><p>Others welcome the socio-political revolution AI promises to bring.</p><p>They consider the technology's relegation as a mere instrument for current political systems to be squandering the transformative power of AI.</p><p>Within those emphasizing regulation less and the transformative power of AI more, there are two camps: some who claim AI's promotion can revolutionize democracy and others who use AI to centralize state power.</p><p>Jamie Susskind, author of the book \"Future Politics\" is among those who believe fully integrating data-driven AI into democracies can save them from obsolesce.</p><p>\"Increasingly, digital technology is eroding the assumptions and conditions that have underpinned democracy for centuries,\" he writes in his book.</p><p>\"But in the future, we'll have to grapple with the much more significant idea of AI Democracy, asking which decisions could and should be taken by powerful digital systems, and whether such systems might better represent the people than the politicians we send to Congress.\"</p><p>Susskind argues that democracy's core function is to \" to unleash the information and knowledge contained in people's minds and put it to political use,\" and claims current democracies' emphasis on periodic voting and elections actually don't achieve democracy's desired result very well.</p><p>U.S. voters cast their ballots in the 2018 midterms (AFP/FILE)</p><p>\"A vote on a small number of questions\u2013usually which party or candidate to support\u2013produces only a small number of data points. Put in the context of an increasingly quantified society, the amount of information generated by the democratic process\u2013even when private polling is taken into account\u2013is laughably small,\" he explains.</p><p>Rather than slow the collection of data, as the 'Ethical AI' crew might advocate for, Susskind says voters and consumers ought to feed more data to administrative bodies. These bodies would then be tasked with reading real-time political measurements of sentiment and have AI systems cast votes, or 'nano-ballots' thousands of times a day \"without having to disturb us at all.\"</p><p>To acquire the political imagination necessary to comprehend this profound shift, Susskind emphasizes that humans already give AI systems outsized power to determine what they are exposed to, what kind of news articles they read, what kind of information they give of themselves and receive about the world and the people around them. Is it really that much of a jump for AI systems to take an extra step and take information about us, and rework it as a ballot?</p><p>The idea is provocative and radical, but feels far away from being implemented or taken seriously as a counter-framework to the 'human-centric approach' the EU is advancing.</p><p>More pragmatically, some private AI companies are advertising systems that can augment  people-power using newly developing AI. For instance, Avantgard promises to \"supercharge social movements and political campaigns,\" by identifying key opportunities to grow a movement's size and sway.</p><p>The scope of this endeavour however, will be limited to those who can pay to gain access to the private tech in the first place: many grassroots movements would likely be left out of the digital revolution.</p><p>//</p><p>A much more immediate all-out embrace of AI in governance is happening right now: that of governments currently integrating AI as a tool to automate authoritarian policies.</p><p>China, as Al Bawaba has extensively documented, is the biggest advocate for this approach, and is currently looking to export the AI systems it has perfected to other aspiring authoritarian states. As a technology with aimed limited to its creator, China isn't embracing AI designed inside democratic countries: they've been active in periodically or permanently blocking out AI-driven apps like Twitter and Facebook and companies like Google.</p><p>\"While China itself has been in the process of making itself a police state with extensive snooping and surveillance carried out on its population, the dangers of China exporting such technologies and practices to other states are far greater,\" Rajeswari Pillai Rajagopalan, who heads the Nuclear and Space Policy Initiative told Al Bawaba.</p><p>\"Such export and the net result of creating insecure states and societies especially in regions and countries with poor rule of law, weak human rights track record, can be a slippery slope, slowly eroding democratic practices such as freedom of expression, free and open media and so on.\"</p><p>Already, Chinese companies are selling AI systems designed to surveil citizens en masse to countries like Zimbabwe, Venezuela, Malaysia and Germany.</p><p>In Venezuela, Chinese telecom giant ZTE is integrating surveillance technology into the company's 'fatherland card', which is part ID, part credit card. Infusing the card with a 'social credit score' similar to the one being piloted in China would tie Venezuelans access to vital social welfare, upon which many depend for their survival, to how high their score is.</p><p>Analysts immediately pointed out how this would be used to punish dissident protesters and allow loyalists disproportionate access to goods and services.</p><p>A Venezuelan woman holds up her so-called 'fatherland' card (AFP/FILE)</p><p>By tying together a nightmarish mix of AI-powered policing and access to social welfare, Venezuela is adopting a social contract that more or less goes like this: you are considered a full citizen if your habits, thinkings and behavior do not threaten the state. If your beliefs or actions run against the state's adoptive ideology, you are liable to be slowly removed from society and state protections.</p><p>Your personhood is then decided by the ideology of the coders working for the state.</p><p>The Zimbabwean government too, has been working to saturate the country with a network of Chinese-made CCTV cameras outfitted with state-of-the-art facial recognition technology from Chinese companies that would track the movements of all its inhabitants.</p><p>What these examples illustrate is that AI is a tool for states to accomplish the agendas they have already set out for themselves. The E.U. pledging to reign in the unfettered power of AI, in this light, is not so much a radical proposal but a continuation of the intergovernmental organizations dedication to ideals designed in the pre-AI age. Likewise, China's weaponized use of AI reflects its own desire to totalize control over its citizens.</p><p>As advances in AI remain steady, and the technology becomes an ever-more potent tool in governance, time is running out for countries to clarify its role in their respective societies.</p><p>States and corporations looking to reap the technology's benefits are quietly harnessing AI for non-democratic means.

And in the midst of all this, as America was transitioning into a digital economy, we neglected to ask: What is the role for government here? The image of technology companies springing forth from unfettered free markets was never quite accurate.</p><p> TODAY'S digital economy rests on three major technologies: the computer chip, the internet and GPS. All three owe their existence in large part to the federal government.</p><p> The latter two were, of course, developed from scratch, owned and run by the government until they were opened up to the private sector.</p><p> Most people don't realize that GPS - the global positioning system of satellites and control centers that is so crucial to the modern economy - is, even now, owned by the U.S. government and operated by the Air Force.</p><p> And yet, as these revolutionary technologies created new industries, destroyed others and reshaped communities and cities, we simply assumed that this was the way of the world and that nothing could be done to affect it. That would be socialist-style interference with the free market.</p><p> But the result does not seem one that a libertarian would celebrate. We now have a tech economy dominated by just a few mammoth companies that effectively create a barrier to entry for newcomers. In Silicon Valley today, new start-ups don't even pretend that they will ever grow to become independent companies.</p><p> Their business plan is to be acquired by Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft or Apple.</p><p> The situation looks more like an oligopoly than a free market. In fact, through the age of big tech, the number of new business start ups has been declining.</p><p> The other noticeable consequence has been the erosion of privacy, highlighted by the Cambridge Analytica/Facebook scandal. Because technology companies now deal with billions of consumers, any individual is a speck, a tiny data point. And since for most technology companies the individual consumer is also a product, whose information is sold to others for a profit, he or she is doubly disempowered.</p><p> The technology companies would surely respond that they have democratized information, created products of extraordinary power and potential, and transformed life for the better. All this is true. So did previous technologies like the telephone, the automobile, antibiotics and electricity. But precisely because of their power and transformational impact, it was necessary for the government to play some role in protecting individuals and restraining the huge new winners in the economy.</p><p> Change is likely to come from two directions. Regulatory action in the West will provide protections for the individual to better control his or her data.</p><p> The European Union has established rules, which will come into effect on May 25, that will make it much easier for individuals to know how their data is being used and to limit that use. It is likely that the U.S. will follow suit.</p><p> The second direction is even more intriguing and comes from the East. Until recently, as Indian entrepreneur Nandan Nilekani pointed out to me, there were just a handful of digital platforms with more than 1 billion users, all run by companies in the United States or China such as Google, Facebook and Tencent.</p><p> But now India has its own billion-person digital platform: the extraordinary \"Aadhaar\" biometric ID system, which now includes almost all of the nation's 1.3 billion citizens (and whose creation Nilekani oversaw). It is the only of these massive platforms that is publicly owned. That means it does not need to make money off user data. It's possible to imagine that in India, it will become normal to think of data as personal property that individuals can keep or rent or sell as they wish in a very open and democratic free market.</p><p> India might well become the global innovator for individuals' data rights.</p><p> Add innovations in block chain technology, and we are likely to see more challenges to the current gatekeepers of the internet in the near future.</p><p> Whether from East or West, top down or bottom up, change is coming to transform the world of technology.</p><p> Properly handled, it can produce freer markets and greater individual empowerment.</p><p> Fareed Zakaria's email address is <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:comments@fareedzakaria.com\">comments@fareedzakaria.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKIL-f0763a47fabb2c50ee0bda5487e28cf3</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289B5280F4DD92 NWBKIL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S13-02J1-DXVP-V4CT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399548</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"825\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The McDonough County Voice<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

The revelations about Cambridge Analytica's use of Facebook data \u2014 mining more than 50 million users' personal information \u2014 came at a time when people were already considering appropriate ways to curb the handful of powerful tech companies that dominate not just the American economy but, increasingly, American life. As the information revolution took off in the 1990s, we all got caught up in the excitement of the age, the novelty of the products, and their transformative power. We were dazzled by the wealth created by nebbishy 25-year-olds, who themselves became instant billionaires, the ultimate revenge of the nerds. </p><p>And in the midst of all this, as America was transitioning into a digital economy, we neglected to ask: What is the role for government here? The image of technology companies springing forth from unfettered free markets was never quite accurate. Today's digital economy rests on three major technologies: the computer chip, the internet and GPS. All three owe their existence in large part to the federal government. The latter two were, of course, developed from scratch, owned and run by the government until they were opened up to the private sector. Most people don't realize that GPS \u2014 the global positioning system of satellites and control centers that is so crucial to the modern economy \u2014 is, even now, owned by the U.S. government and operated by the Air Force. And yet, as these revolutionary technologies created new industries, destroyed others and reshaped communities and cities, we simply assumed that this was the way of the world and that nothing could be done to affect it. That would be socialist-style interference with the free market. But the result does not seem one that a libertarian would celebrate. We now have a tech economy dominated by just a few mammoth companies that effectively create a barrier to entry for newcomers. In Silicon Valley today, new startups don't even pretend that they will ever grow to become independent companies. Their business plan is to be acquired by Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft or Apple. The situation looks more like an oligopoly than a free market. In fact, through the age of big tech, the number of new business startups has been declining. The other noticeable consequence has been the erosion of privacy, highlighted by the Cambridge Analytica/Facebook scandal. Because technology companies now deal with billions of consumers, any individual is a speck, a tiny data point. And since for most technology companies the individual consumer is also a product, whose information is sold to others for a profit, he or she is doubly disempowered. The technology companies would surely respond that they have democratized information, created products of extraordinary power and potential, and transformed life for the better. All this is true. So did previous technologies like the telephone, the automobile, antibiotics and electricity. But precisely because of their power and transformational impact, it was necessary for the government to play some role in protecting individuals and restraining the huge new winners in the economy. Change is likely to come from two directions. Regulatory action in the West will provide protections for the individual to better control his or her data. The European Union has established rules, which will come into effect on May 25, that will make it much easier for individuals to know how their data is being used and to limit that use. It is likely that the U.S. will follow suit. The second direction is even more intriguing and comes from the East. Until recently, as Indian entrepreneur Nandan Nilekani pointed out to me, there were just a handful of digital platforms with more than 1 billion users, all run by companies in the United States or China such as Google, Facebook and Tencent. But now India has its own billion-person digital platform: the extraordinary \"Aadhaar\" biometric ID system, which now includes almost all of the nation's 1.3 billion citizens (and whose creation Nilekani oversaw). It is the only of these massive platforms that is publicly owned. That means it does not need to make money off user data. It's possible to imagine that in India, it will become normal to think of data as personal property that individuals can keep or rent or sell as they wish in a very open and democratic free market. India might well become the global innovator for individuals' data rights. Add innovations in blockchain technology, and we are likely to see more challenges to the current gatekeepers of the internet in the near future. Whether from East or West, top down or bottom up, change is coming to transform the world of technology. Properly handled, it can produce freer markets and greater individual empowerment.

Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) as she descended an escalator at a convention center to greet a throng of cheering supporters.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was the most memorable entrance of the nearly two dozen Democratic presidential candidates who spoke at a party pep rally here over the weekend - and a sign that Harris, who has struggled to establish a political philosophy to compete with her most prominent rivals', is still seeking to distinguish herself.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Throughout the weekend, she cast herself as a candidate of action, seeming to embrace the notion that the Harris brand is one built on practicality as much as any sort of sweeping vision.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I think it's important to have grand and broad ideas for how to fix this world,\" Harris told voters at a Friday night meet-and-greet. \"But it's also important, and I believe for me it's a priority, how can I address the things that wake people up in the middle of the night?\"</p><p>Harris's performance, which had the feel of a reboot, reflected the challenge confronting her as she seeks to capitalize on her prime spot this week in the first candidate debates in which she will share center stage Thursday with polling leaders former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). </p><p>In a crowded field in which Sanders's Democratic socialism and Sen. Elizabeth Warren's heavily regulated capitalism are elbowing for supremacy on the far left and Biden is positioning himself as a centrist best positioned to beat President Trump, Harris is known more for her prosecutorial performance in Senate hearings than she is for advocating any particular approach to policy.</p><p>\"Everybody has their little niche, and I don't think Kamala has a niche yet,\" said Leslie Stein, an engineer and California transplant to Las Vegas who attended a Harris speech this month in that city and has been following Harris's career from her district attorney days. \"She's saying a lot of what's out there, but she hasn't made anything her own.\"</p><p>Stein's reaction is one offered by many people who attend Harris's campaign events. While many say they see Harris as a trailblazer who represents change, few can articulate exactly what kind of change a Harris administration would yield - particularly in contrast to the well-defined agendas of other contenders.</p><p>\"I know about Elizabeth Warren because that's her thing: plans and ideas. Bernie Sanders I know because he's run before,\" said Shirley Sandoval, a 76-year-old Las Vegas resident. \"And I know Joe Biden because he's been around so long - you just kind of know him, even though he's changed his mind on things. Even big things, like abortion.\"</p><p>\"[Harris] hasn't spoken as much on policy as I would like to hear her speak on it,\" Sandoval said. \"She's got some good ideas, but I haven't heard as much as I would like.\"</p><p>Those who have counseled Harris, 54, a former prosecutor and California attorney general elected to the Senate in 2016, say she hews to a sense of pragmatism rather than a strict ideology.</p><p>\"She's pretty much a fundamentally pragmatic person . . . always asking about: What is the real impact this is going to have on people's lives?\" said Jill Habig, who served as an adviser to Harris when she served as attorney general and in her Senate campaign. \"But in terms of the methodology of how you get to that goal, she's not very ideological.\"</p><p>The result, so far, is a policy portfolio that often seems made up of one-off announcements that put her largely in line with long-held, mainstream Democratic positions.</p><p>The thread that has connected her proposals is an emphasis on what she has presented as practical actions that can be put in place while long-term solutions are hammered out. Harris's proposals for tightened controls on guns and a path to citizenship for young undocumented immigrants and their parents rely on executive action, an approach used by Trump and President Barack Obama in the face of opposition from Capitol Hill. Her proposals for rent assistance and a middle-class tax credit of up to $6,000 per year, her campaign staff argues, provide more short-term tangible benefits than, say, more dramatic moves like Warren's pledge to break up big tech companies.</p><p>She and her campaign aides argue her policy to raise teacher salaries by an average of $13,500 to match those of \"similarly educated professionals\" would improve student outcomes and school environments, achieving broad benefits by addressing the problem directly. But outside of a broader education policy, it was possible to see such a policy as an appeal to the highly influential teachers' unions and suburban women Harris is courting, rather than a piece in a broader policy puzzle.</p><p>When it comes to her broader policy drive, Harris doesn't spare much time for labels. Of all the words she has used since declaring her presidential candidacy, she has allocated few to positioning herself left of center, right of the far left or anywhere in between.</p><p>When a voter in Ankeny, Iowa, said she heard the media labeling Harris as a moderate, the candidate raised her eyebrows and stifled a smile. When a reporter asked her if she would call herself \"an Obama Democrat,\" Harris said simply, \"I call myself Kamala.\" </p><p>Her approach to date has fostered support. She has raised millions of dollars, begun growing her ground operations in the four early voting states and even has a devoted fan club called \"the K-Hive,\" a takeoff on Beyonce's fan group.</p><p>Harris is also making a hiring push in Iowa that she says will give her more staffers there than any other candidate. In South Carolina, local organizer Brenda Price and her \"Reckoning Crew\" of 100 organizers just threw themselves behind Harris.</p><p>Early state polls show Harris's limitations and her potential. When California voters' first and second choices were tabulated by the Berkeley IGS poll, Harris was tied in her home state with Biden and Warren (Mass.). But when voters were asked their first choice, Harris trailed those two candidates as well as Sanders. The results, which had Harris trailing even in her home turf of the Bay Area, echoed the results of a Des Moines Register poll of Iowa voters, far more of whom were considering Harris than firmly committed to her.</p><p>In South Carolina over the weekend, a must-win state for Harris, she maintained one of the largest and most vocal groups of supporters that was as big as Biden's, Sanders's and Warren's, and thanks in part to that drum line, just as loud. The Rev. Jesse Jackson sneaked into her pre-convention rally. She sparked visible interest. </p><p>One of her prominent backers, former state legislator Bakari Sellers, who has publicly wondered whether the senator was too cautious, tweeted that she had \"set the stage on fire.\" But this week in Miami, Harris will be trying to convert undecided voters, not inspire the ones she's already convinced - and she won't have much time to do it.  </p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:chelsea.janes@washpost.com\">chelsea.janes@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-f351d8e48b8111e9b08ecfd89bd36d4e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDH-HJS1-JCDY-T55N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1165\"/><timeReceived>10:09 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 24, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001342</classCode><className>POLITICAL CANDIDATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001343</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTY CONVENTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009TCX</classCode><className>US DEMOCRATIC PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DNV7</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DF5U</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001344</classCode><className>POLITICAL DEBATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp;

Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) as she descended an escalator at a convention center to greet a throng of cheering supporters.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was the most memorable entrance of the nearly two dozen Democratic presidential candidates who spoke at a party pep rally here over the weekend - and a sign that Harris, who has struggled to establish a political philosophy to compete with her most prominent rivals', is still seeking to distinguish herself.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Throughout the weekend, she cast herself as a candidate of action, seeming to embrace the notion that the Harris brand is one built on practicality as much as any sort of sweeping vision.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I think it's important to have grand and broad ideas for how to fix this world,\" Harris told voters at a Friday night meet-and-greet. \"But it's also important, and I believe for me it's a priority, how can I address the things that wake people up in the middle of the night?\"</p><p>Harris's performance, which had the feel of a reboot, reflected the challenge confronting her as she seeks to capitalize on her prime spot this week in the first candidate debates in which she will share center stage Thursday with polling leaders former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). </p><p>In a crowded field in which Sanders's Democratic socialism and Sen. Elizabeth Warren's heavily regulated capitalism are elbowing for supremacy on the far left and Biden is positioning himself as a centrist best positioned to beat President Trump, Harris is known more for her prosecutorial performance in Senate hearings than she is for advocating any particular approach to policy.</p><p>\"Everybody has their little niche, and I don't think Kamala has a niche yet,\" said Leslie Stein, an engineer and California transplant to Las Vegas who attended a Harris speech this month in that city and has been following Harris's career from her district attorney days. \"She's saying a lot of what's out there, but she hasn't made anything her own.\"</p><p>Stein's reaction is one offered by many people who attend Harris's campaign events. While many say they see Harris as a trailblazer who represents change, few can articulate exactly what kind of change a Harris administration would yield - particularly in contrast to the well-defined agendas of other contenders.</p><p>\"I know about Elizabeth Warren because that's her thing: plans and ideas. Bernie Sanders I know because he's run before,\" said Shirley Sandoval, a 76-year-old Las Vegas resident. \"And I know Joe Biden because he's been around so long - you just kind of know him, even though he's changed his mind on things. Even big things, like abortion.\"</p><p>\"[Harris] hasn't spoken as much on policy as I would like to hear her speak on it,\" Sandoval said. \"She's got some good ideas, but I haven't heard as much as I would like.\"</p><p>Those who have counseled Harris, 54, a former prosecutor and California attorney general elected to the Senate in 2016, say she hews to a sense of pragmatism rather than a strict ideology.</p><p>\"She's pretty much a fundamentally pragmatic person . . . always asking about: What is the real impact this is going to have on people's lives?\" said Jill Habig, who served as an adviser to Harris when she served as attorney general and in her Senate campaign. \"But in terms of the methodology of how you get to that goal, she's not very ideological.\"</p><p>The result, so far, is a policy portfolio that often seems made up of one-off announcements that put her largely in line with long-held, mainstream Democratic positions.</p><p>The thread that has connected her proposals is an emphasis on what she has presented as practical actions that can be put in place while long-term solutions are hammered out. Harris's proposals for tightened controls on guns and a path to citizenship for young undocumented immigrants and their parents rely on executive action, an approach used by Trump and President Barack Obama in the face of opposition from Capitol Hill. Her proposals for rent assistance and a middle-class tax credit of up to $6,000 per year, her campaign staff argues, provide more short-term tangible benefits than, say, more dramatic moves like Warren's pledge to break up big tech companies.</p><p>She and her campaign aides argue her policy to raise teacher salaries by an average of $13,500 to match those of \"similarly educated professionals\" would improve student outcomes and school environments, achieving broad benefits by addressing the problem directly. But outside of a broader education policy, it was possible to see such a policy as an appeal to the highly influential teachers' unions and suburban women Harris is courting, rather than a piece in a broader policy puzzle.</p><p>When it comes to her broader policy drive, Harris doesn't spare much time for labels. Of all the words she has used since declaring her presidential candidacy, she has allocated few to positioning herself left of center, right of the far left or anywhere in between.</p><p>When a voter in Ankeny, Iowa, said she heard the media labeling Harris as a moderate, the candidate raised her eyebrows and stifled a smile. When a reporter asked her if she would call herself \"an Obama Democrat,\" Harris said simply, \"I call myself Kamala.\" </p><p>Her approach to date has fostered support. She has raised millions of dollars, begun growing her ground operations in the four early voting states and even has a devoted fan club called \"the K-Hive,\" a takeoff on Beyonce's fan group.</p><p>Harris is also making a hiring push in Iowa that she says will give her more staffers there than any other candidate. In South Carolina, local organizer Brenda Price and her \"Reckoning Crew\" of 100 organizers just threw themselves behind Harris.</p><p>Early state polls show Harris's limitations and her potential. When California voters' first and second choices were tabulated by the Berkeley IGS poll, Harris was tied in her home state with Biden and Warren (Mass.). But when voters were asked their first choice, Harris trailed those two candidates as well as Sanders. The results, which had Harris trailing even in her home turf of the Bay Area, echoed the results of a Des Moines Register poll of Iowa voters, far more of whom were considering Harris than firmly committed to her.</p><p>In South Carolina over the weekend, a must-win state for Harris, she maintained one of the largest and most vocal groups of supporters that was as big as Biden's, Sanders's and Warren's, and thanks in part to that drum line, just as loud. The Rev. Jesse Jackson sneaked into her pre-convention rally. She sparked visible interest. </p><p>One of her prominent backers, former state legislator Bakari Sellers, who has publicly wondered whether the senator was too cautious, tweeted that she had \"set the stage on fire.\" But this week in Miami, Harris will be trying to convert undecided voters, not inspire the ones she's already convinced - and she won't have much time to do it.  </p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:chelsea.janes@washpost.com\">chelsea.janes@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-f351d8e4-8b81-11e9-b08e-cfd89bd36d4e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDH-NNM1-DXXY-34HT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1163\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Regional Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 24, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001342</classCode><className>POLITICAL CANDIDATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001343</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTY CONVENTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009TCX</classCode><className>US DEMOCRATIC PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DNV7</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DF5U</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001344</classCode><className>POLITICAL DEBATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp;

Management of GrubHub Seamless, as the combined company is known, has had discussions about how, and when, it will go public, something that could happen in the latter part of 2014 or early 2015, according to several people familiar with the situation. In 2012, Seamless independently generated about $85 million in revenue, which was an increase of about 60%. One source familiar with the financials pegged the combined entity's 2013 revenue at more than $200 million, with 40% annual growth. At a 20-times revenue multiple, the company's post-IPO market cap could be between $3 billion and $5 billion. In an e-mail statement, a Seamless press officer said the company would not comment on speculation. \"We are focused on company integration and have many options as we move forward as a combined organization,\" the official wrote. Full report </p><p>FCC tries to spark foreign capital infusion into stations</p><p>Tom Wheeler will kick off his tenure as Federal Communications Commission chairman by relaxing restrictions on foreign ownership of TV and radio stations when he presides over his first FCC meeting Nov. 14. The move is intended to draw much-needed new capital to the broadcasting business. Since passage of the Communications Act of 1934 the FCC has capped foreign investment in broadcast licensees at 25% and only once has the commission waived the rule, in 1994 when it retroactively approved Australia-based News Corp.'s purchase of U.S. television stations 10 years earlier. The rule has its roots in the Radio Act of 1912, which limited radio licenses to U.S. citizens or corporations amid the international tensions leading up to the First World War. Today, no other telecom sector  -  cable and satellite TV, wireless, telephone or Internet  -  is so restricted. The change has broad support across a variety of interests. Broadcasters want the cap lifted to boost the value of their stations. Minority business owners in the U.S. like the idea because they expect it will increase their access to capital  -  historically difficult for minorities seeking to get into the broadcasting industry. And activists opposed to media consolidation support the change as a way of bringing new buyers and more diversity to broadcast ownership. Full report </p><p>Hospitals opt for augmentation surgery</p><p>Hospitals have been trying to define themselves as businesses in the healthcare marketplace for decades, ever since Medicare began putting pressure on payments in the late 1970s. In the 1980s, hospitals toyed with consumer branding and celebrity advertising. In the 1990s, they came to realize that doctors control where patients go, and bought up physician practices by the hundreds. Those early attempts at vertical integration didn't work too well. All the while, hospitals bigger were buying hospitals smaller. In the past 15 years, many have become healthcare systems. It's hard to find a standalone hospital anymore. But have hospitals integrated their services to the point where they can show true value by using the efficiencies of a larger organization to reduce unnecessary back-end systems and infrastructure, especially through information technology? The answer is actually also a question: Do they have incentives to do so? The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, recognizes that integrating services is key to motivating hospitals and doctors, indeed all providers, to work together toward the ACA's goal, providing \"the right care at the right time while avoiding unnecessary duplication of services and preventing medical errors,\" according to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid. Many experts say the federal healthcare reform law is what finally will make a difference in these efforts. Full report </p><p>Caesars could face a fight over debt guarantee</p><p>Debt-laden casino operator Caesars Entertainment Corp. may be looking to remove the guarantee of its operating subsidiary's debt, but this could stir up a fight and put second-lien lenders in a precarious position. A hedge fund investor in the Las Vegas-based company's debt previously told The Deal Pipeline that he has heard Caesars' private equity owner, Apollo Global Management LLC, is interested in removing the parent company's guarantee of the operating subsidiary's debt next year. According to one restructuring lawyer, who asked not to be named, this would make sense. \"If you have a good faith argument, why wouldn't you try it?\" the lawyer said. The subsidiary, Caesars Operating Co., or OpCo, holds about $12.3 billion of Caesars' $23.8 billion in debt, along with many of its casinos and brands. However, two descriptions of the parent guarantee are in the bond indentures and don't quite add up. The legal interpretation of those statements is likely to determine the winners, and the losers, in a contentious restructuring. Full report </p><p>New Telecom Italia CEO announces fundraising plan</p><p>Just a month after taking the helm, Telecom Italia SpA's top executive late Thursday announced plans to sell assets and a convertible bond to raise Euro4 billion ($5.4 billion) and wrest the wavering company back onto the right track. CEO Marco Patuano said Italy's former monopoly phone company would sell its 22.7% stake in Telecom Argentina SA  -  reportedly to Fintech Advisory LLC  -  and look for a buyer for its Italian and Brazilian cellular tower networks as well as its TI Media broadcaster. The towers and the broadcaster are expected to bring in over Euro2 billion, Patuano said on a conference call. The company will also raise as much as Euro1.3 billion by issuing a mandatory bond convertible into common shares. The bond will mature in November 2016 and have a coupon of between 5.75% and 6.5%. \"We are firmly convinced that this is the best strategic and industrial choice to pursue a path of growth and development,\" Patuano said in a statement. Analysts said the announcement shows the company's new brass is serious about getting Telecom Italia back on track. However, the announcement didn't include the most significant step seen as necessary to turn the company around  -  a sale of its second-largest unit, TIM Participa\u00c3\u00a7\u00c3\u00b5es SA. Full report </p><p>Doubling down, even on Dell</p><p>Before Michael Dell and private equity firm Silver Lake completed their leveraged buyout of Dell Inc., they were forced by Carl Icahn's rabble-rousing into investing another $350 million into the deal, putting the final transaction value at close to $25 billion. Industry sources have suggested that the founder and his private equity partner didn't have to go the extra distance alone  -  multiple parties were apparently interested in co-investing in the big tech deal. And this, for a company whose special committee practically pilloried its very existence as a public entity in order to entice stockholders into voting for the take-private offer. It isn't just Dell: Andrea Auerbach, managing director with advisory firm Cambridge Associates LLC said that for most large transactions, co-investments have become commonplace  -  even if they're not disclosed publicly. It's a testament to the growing favor co-investment vehicles hold for private equity, as limited partners look to get in on more of the upside at the same time as they trim fees. Full report </p><p>Highlights from Friday's First Take</p><p>BATTLE OVER DODD-FRANK SHIFTS TO THE SENATE FLOOR: Ronald Orol writes from Washington that the battle over the future of Dodd-Frank will take center stage on the Senate floor Tuesday afternoon as the chamber considers yet another Obama administration nominee for a key federal court considered to be the top court for challenges to the statute. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, (D.-Nev.) late Thursday filed a motion to have the Senate consider the nomination of Nina Pillard, one of the White House's three nominees to fill up one of three empty slots at the U.S. court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. The scheduled vote comes after Obama's latest nominee for the court  -  Patricia Millett  -  last week couldn't obtain the filibuster-proof 60 votes needed to be confirmed by the Senate due to Republican opposition. The court is of utmost importance to securities regulators because the vast majority of challenges to rules promulgated by the sweeping bank-reform law Dodd-Frank end up there, with results mixed so far. Nevertheless, a few Obama appointments could alter the balance of power at the court.</p><p>ARBY'S CUTS PRICING ON $370M DISTRIBUTION LOAN PACKAGE: Jonathan Schwarzberg writes that Roark Capital-backed Arby's Restaurant Group Inc. dropped pricing on a $335 million seven-year term loan to L+400 from L+425 and increased the OID to 99.75 from 99, according to Bloomberg data. The loan will be used to back a distribution to the fast food chain's owners. The company is also looking to arrange a $35 million five-year revolver. The company moved up the commitment date to Friday after the loan was oversubscribed several times. The debt is rated B3/B.

But the market is poised for more activity, and Qlik Technologies Inc.(QLIK) stands out as a potential takeout target for slow-growing tech giants that are looking at big data for M&amp;A, according to industry observers. The big data landscape, which comprises data analytics providers that build software that crunches raw data and draws conclusions about it, has created a $20 billion market opportunity, according to FBR Capital Markets &amp; Co. analyst Dan Ives. Radnor, Pa.-based software maker Qlik has been building a strong platform and is beginning to see a \"groovy return\" for such efforts, Ives said, adding that the company is a top M&amp;A candidate for tech companies such as International Business Machines Corp.(IBM), Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) and Oracle Corp.(ORCL), which are eyeing faster-growing data analytics companies for M&amp;A to make up for lagging revenues. One reason Qlik is attractive is its product cycle, according to Morningstar Inc. analyst Norman Young, who cited Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) as another potential acquirer. The Deal reported last year that SAP AG could also be interested in Qlik Technologies.

The authority, run by the Mohegan Tribe of Connecticut, said Monday, July 20, that it intends \"to pursue an opportunistic refinancing for a majority of its outstanding 11% senior subordinated notes due [Sept. 15,] 2018.\" According to credit research firm KDP Investment Advisors Inc., Mohegan is in the market seeking a $90 million term loan that it could use to repay some of the notes. KDP said in a report released Tuesday that it expects Mohegan will refinance the rest of the notes with new unsecured debt. The firm said the preliminary results Mohegan released late Monday beat its estimates. Mohegan said it brought in somewhere between $318.5 million and $331.5 million in revenue and $79.4 million to $82.5 million in consolidated Ebitda during the third quarter ended June 30. KDP had expected Mohegan would earn $310.4 million in revenue and $76.5 million in Ebitda; based on the latest results, the firm improved its forecast for 2015 and 2016.          \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://pipeline.thedeal.com/tdd/ViewArticle.dl?id=13227773|Democrats\">http://pipeline.thedeal.com/tdd/ViewArticle.dl?id=13227773|Democrats</url>, Republicans say firms need time to avoid SIFI label    A bipartisan group of senators on Wednesday put pressure on a top Obama administration official to give large firms more of an opportunity to divest risky financial units or make changes to their business model so they can avoid being designated \"systemically important. \"It is a very frustrating thing,\" Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, told The Deal after holding a hearing to put a spotlight on congressional concerns. At issue is a relatively new process set up by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a group of regulators established by the Dodd-Frank financial reform law, to designate some big companies as systemically important financial institutions, or SIFIs, as part of an effort to protect the economy from a financial crisis like the 2008 meltdown. Designation subjects firms to new capital and liquidity restrictions, as well as stress tests and obligations to write so-called living wills explaining, if the firms fail, how they would dismantle themselves in a way that doesn't wreak havoc on the markets. First, in order to prevent discrimination against online video competition, AT&amp;T must apply data caps on its fixed broadband connections to its own online video services and content. This condition is meant to discourage AT&amp;T from hampering unaffiliated services such as Netflix. Second, in order to bring greater transparency to interconnection practices, the company will be required to submit all completed interconnection agreements to the commission, along with regular reports on network performance          \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://pipeline.thedeal.com/tdd/ViewArticle.dl?id=13227328|Washington\">http://pipeline.thedeal.com/tdd/ViewArticle.dl?id=13227328|Washington</url> tees up approval of DirecTV acquisition     AT&amp;T Inc. (T) and DirecTV Group (DTV) are set to win federal approval for their $49 billion merger, a telecom mega-deal that has been under review by the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Justice for more than a year. The deal was announced in May 2014. In a statement late Tuesday FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler confirmed that he has circulated a draft order recommending that his fellow commissioners approve the merger with conditions. The terms Wheeler laid out include requiring AT&amp;T to build out its high-speed fiber connections to an additional 12.5 million customers and would require AT&amp;T to go beyond compliance with the FCC's new Internet neutrality rules by addressing two issues raised specifically by the merger.          \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://pipeline.thedeal.com/tdd/ViewArticle.dl?id=13227854|Drugmaker\">http://pipeline.thedeal.com/tdd/ViewArticle.dl?id=13227854|Drugmaker</url> Synthetic Biologics raising $46M for clinical trials, looking for complementary IP    Synthetic Biologics Inc. (SYN) is raising $46 million in a confidentially marketed public offering for further trials of two of its drugs, to fund intellectual property acquisitions, expand internationally and acquire complementary businesses. The company decided to raise the money after closing the quarter ending March 31 with $12 million on the books, said Keith Markey, analyst and science director with Griffin Securities Inc. He said Synthetic Biologics plans to spend between $5 million and $6 million a quarter. \"They have money to last about two years at that rate,\" he said. The two drugs that Synthetic Biologics is developing are in Phase 2 clinical trials. One is for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and associated constipation. The other is for the prevention of C. difficile infection and associated diarrhea. CEO Jeff Riley said the company is looking for potential drugs that are complementary to the current drugs it is developing. He said 85% of the money raised in the CMPO will go toward clinical trials.          \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://pipeline.thedeal.com/tdd/ViewArticle.dl?id=13227328|From\">http://pipeline.thedeal.com/tdd/ViewArticle.dl?id=13227328|From</url> Wednesday's First Take: Caesars Entertainment Corp. (CZR)    CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT DIPS ON RUMOR OF POSSIBLE BANKRUPTCY [CZR]: From Kelsey Butler - Caesars Entertainment Corp. (CZR) shares were down 34% following a ruling in the Chapter 11 case of its largest unit that could push the parent company into bankruptcy as well. Judge A. Benjamin Goldgar on Wednesday, July 22, declined to halt lawsuits against the parent of Caesars Entertainment Operating Co. Inc. The parent company placed CEOC, its largest unit, into bankruptcy on Jan. 15, but by keeping itself out of Chapter 11, has protected investments of its shareholders, including Apollo Global Management LLC and TPG Capital LP. UMB Bank NA, indenture trustee for $6.35 billion in 11.25% notes due 2017, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in Manhattan on June 15 against Caesars Entertainment. UMB maintained Caesars Entertainment violated the terms of the notes and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 by voiding a guarantee of the operating unit's obligations before CEOC's bankruptcy filing. In August, Caesars Entertainment had attempted to rescind its guarantee on some of the prepetition debt without consulting the debtholders. A group of these creditors, including holders of 5.75% unsecured notes, sued Caesars Entertainment and CEOC in the Manhattan district court, alleging the action violated the Trust Indenture Act. Judge Shira A. Scheindlin on Jan. 15 ruled the parent's stripping of its guarantee \"an impermissible out-of-court debt restructuring achieved through collective action.\"</p><h>DEAL SIZE</h><p>$ 1-10 Billion</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DADEAL-13228271</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DADEAL2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5GJ1-BJT1-DY7P-R3RH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244689</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1470\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 The Deal, L.L.C.

When we dug into ten of these sites and inputted intimate data such as medical symptoms, fertility and period information, and searched for advice regarding mental health conditions or abortion, we found that data were\u00a0transmitted to third parties including Google, Amazon and Facebook as well as a host of lesser-known companies from BlueKai to Lotame and OpenX.\u00a0</p><p>In the UK, our personal data \u2014\u00a0including this type of sensitive health information \u2014 is protected by the General Data Protection Regulation. If it is being used for commercial purposes, site owners require our explicit consent \u2014\u00a0an unambiguous and specific expression of our agreement to use this\u00a0information along with knowledge of whom it will be shared with and why.</p><p>All the companies that responded to our queries claimed to take user privacy very seriously; some, including Google, claimed they didn\u2019t use these data for personalised ad targeting, but instead for measuring as engagement or to prevent fraud. In cases such as Facebook\u2019s, the blame was placed squarely on the website owners, and no detail was given on how the data were\u00a0used.\u00a0</p><p>None of the privacy policies of the websites explicitly stated what type of data would be shared and with whom. We were also left in the dark about what happened next \u2014 who was the data re-sold to? How would this impact the ads we see? Would we be exploited for being sick?</p><p>The consequences are dire \u2014- researcher Tim Libert outlined how marketers could use discriminatory and predatory techniques to sell us (or withhold) a range of products and services, on the basis of ill health.</p><p>The Internet of (Five) Things</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1. Banking on Big Tech</emphasis><br/>Google is talking to US banks about offering current accounts to its customers, accelerating Silicon Valley\u2019s incursion into financial services after Apple\u2019s credit card launch and Facebook\u2019s proposed digital currency Libra.\u00a0Facebook has also unveiled a\u00a0 payments system \u00a0that will allow users to shop, make donations or send money as the social media group integrates WhatsApp and Instagram more closely with its core platform.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2. Space's emerging arms race</emphasis><br/>Half a century after the first moon landing, there is a surprising entry into the\u00a0 geopolitical tussle \u00a0in space: Norway, which plans to launch two satellites equipped with defensive mechanisms in 2022. Satellites were once able to roam freely without fear of interference, but an evolving arms race for space supremacy has made them vulnerable to attack or disruption. Meanwhile, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.salon.com/2019/11/12/why-spacexs-plans-to-put-25000-satellites-in-orbit-could-ruin-astronomy/\"> astronomers are concerned </url>about Elon Musk's plans for his SpaceX to put 30,000 satellites into orbit (there are just 1,950 working satellites up there currently).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3.\u00a0Tesla's European Gigafactory</emphasis><br/>As the electric carmaker's boss,\u00a0Elon Musk announced on Tuesday that its first European production site will be\u00a0 in Berlin.

Big Tech and brick bait, pathways to prosperity</emphasis>If a modern tech company constructed the equivalent of Bournville, a village built by the chocolate company Cadbury for its workers in 19th-century Britain, it would probably be stuffed with branded gadgets, scooters and the kind of wearables that monitor vital signs to check that workers are healthy and going to sleep at a reasonable hour. But the housing situation in California is so dire that many would probably accept that kind of creeping surveillance in exchange for the sort of affordable nice house with a garden that Cadbury offered, writes\u00a0 Elaine Moore. In developing countries,\u00a0technology can open many\u00a0new\u00a0pathways to prosperity, writes Melinda Gates for the FT.</p><p>Forwarded from our Tech Scroll Asia newsletter</p><p>Asia\u2019s most valuable company, Alibaba, has finally made it official with its long-awaited secondary listing in Hong Kong.

Mr. Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died after being handcuffed while a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly 10 minutes. Captured on video, Mr. Floyd is heard repeatedly saying, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d </p><p>Business leaders, like many others, are speaking out about this and other cases of deadly violence and discrimination. (More on that below.) Robert Smith, the billionaire founder of Vista Equity Partners, is one of the country\u2019s most prominent black businessmen. He sent a poignant memo to his firm\u2019s staff over the weekend, which we are publishing in full here.</p><p>Dear Vista Family,</p><p>This has been a heartbreaking and painful week for America and a reminder that in our endless pursuit of a \u201cmore perfect union,\u201d a great deal of work remains.</p><p>When I see the face of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, or Christian Cooper, I see myself as a young man; I see the faces of my children; and I am reminded of the many times in my life when I have been judged not by my character, but by my skin color. I am not alone. I have heard from many of you that you have been deeply moved by these events, and I did not want them to pass without sharing a few thoughts with you.</p><p>I can still vividly recall the pain I felt as a youth when I found my mother and father comforting each other as they just learned that my uncle was shot dead, by a white gas station attendant. I was quite confused by this as my uncle, who had just received his masters degree and was recently married, was quite excited about having landed a job with the State of Colorado inspecting various facilities across the state. Apparently this gas station attendant couldn\u2019t imagine why an African American would have a state gas card and felt the appropriate action was to shoot and kill him. This was almost 50 years ago, and the pain still lingers.</p><p>In so many ways, this is a better, stronger, more inclusive country than it has ever been. In other ways, progress still feels so elusive. There is still so much hate, bigotry, anger, violence, and misunderstanding in our society that\u2019s a lot harder to overlook after the events of this week.</p><p>It\u2019s natural to feel helpless in light of the events we\u2019re seeing in the news. Each of us has to choose to overcome. Each of us can embrace the words that Dr. King spoke in a sermon in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1957. He said, \u201cWe must discover the redemptive power of love. And when we discover that, we will be able to make of this old world a new world.\u201d</p><p>We may not be able to mend all the broken parts of our society immediately, but we can each contribute the love and understanding in our hearts and in our souls to our families and our communities.

For lots of start-up founders, \"getting acquired\" is something they've worked towards since day one. It's the \"exit\" - the holy grail where their years of sleepless nights, subsistence salary, and unsustainable stress pays off. Founders, investors, and - usually - most of the company's employees finally get to see a financial return for their equity and hard work.</p><p>It's also great for the country, as high-growth young firms account for a huge chunk of the new jobs created in our economy. Those jobs are well-paid, high-value technology and business roles - invariably, these are the jobs our kids want to get. Entrepreneurs building second or third companies with capital from a previous exit typically expand their businesses much faster, fuelled by this virtuous cycle of \"exit and reinvest\". It's a tremendous generator of employment and value for the economy.Acquisitions are good for the acquiring company, too. When developing new technologies, features, and markets (which we can loosely describe as research and development for these purposes), tech companies use a mix of \"build\" and \"buy\" - either dedicating internal resources to create the product, or buying a company that has already built it and developed a user base. \"Buy\" has been very popular over the past 20 years, particularly in Silicon Valley.</p><p>So why is this a thorny topic? What are the downsides?</p><p>Sometimes the \"buy\" philosophy has the effect of enhancing the market share of firms that already have substantial market power. Occasionally, big firms buy little firms not to integrate their new technology into existing products or develop new product lines, but instead to kill them off so they don't turn into genuine competitors down the track. And even when the acquisition is a genuine R&amp;D strategy, it often merges two similar companies into one monolith. Think: Facebook buying Instagram and Whatsapp - acquisitions that have added billions of users to Facebook's already enormous global social media presence.</p><p>This can be troubling for those responsible for keeping markets fair - in particular, competition regulators.</p><p>In Australia, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/technology/accc-set-to-launch-landmark-facebook-google-cases-20190813-p52gow\">Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has been concerned about this for some time</url>. Recently, it recommended that the Federal Government make it harder for tech acquisitions to go ahead in Australia. The ACCC would like to see tech companies singled out by requiring them to give it prior notice of proposed acquisitions (giving notice is optional). It would also like the governing legislation to be amended so the ACCC is required to consider whether the company being acquired was a \"potential\" competitor of the acquirer's.</p><p>While neither of these recommendations would be catastrophic, the direction is wrong.These acquisitions aren't hostile takeovers - each sale is approved (and often actively solicited) by founders and investors in the acquired businesses. When start-ups are acquired, the capital that pours into the pockets of founders, employees, and investors is often redeployed into new ventures. These new companies are all the more successful thanks to all that extra available capital and the experience of the previous company's success and ultimate sale. As a result, almost uniquely in tech, acquisitions have strong positive effects on the competitive landscape.</p><p>The clearest practical example of this was when PayPal was acquired in 2002 by eBay for $US1.5 billion. That acquisition put hundreds of millions of dollars in the pockets of founders and early employees such as Elon Musk, Reid Hoffman, Peter Thiel, Chad Hurley and Jawed Karim. They used that money to go on to create some of the world's leading tech companies: Tesla, SpaceX, LinkedIn, Palantir, and YouTube - companies that injected huge competitive forces into established industries across the planet. We've also seen this in Australia. Among others, the founders of successful tech companies Seek and Atlassian have gone on to start investment firms (Square Peg, Grok Ventures, and Skip Capital) and have reinvested hundreds of millions of dollars into the emerging domestic tech sector.</p><p>If we make tech acquisitions harder in Australia, we make it harder for founders and investors to realise a return. That will hurt local tech across the board, making it less likely we will produce a PayPal of our own, let alone the companies it, in turn, spawned.The ACCC's view is based on an understandable concern that US firms with substantial market power are using acquisitions to increase and extend that power. But the solution it favours - tightening acquisition laws - is out of date and won't work in the world of modern tech. It's an awkward approach that seeks to apply a local solution to a global problem, at the cost of domestic firms.</p><p>Australia's best shot at combating the market power of global digital platforms is to develop a thriving tech industry and back our best entrepreneurs to build well-funded global companies. That's the only way we will produce genuine \"potential competitors\" of the big digital platforms. An essential part of that is developing a thriving acquisition environment that encourages investment and rewards success.</p><p>If, down the line, an Australian digital platform has an uncomfortable share of the global market, we should turn our minds to whether we need to further restrict its ability to buy its \"potential competitors\". In the meantime, let's do everything we can to encourage the growth of some home-grown global champions.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1520181367</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X28-KKB1-DY19-C3K3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"935\"/><timeReceived>00:00 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

For lots of start-up founders, \"getting acquired\" is something they've worked towards since day one. It's the \"exit\" - the holy grail where their years of sleepless nights, subsistence salary, and unsustainable stress pays off. Founders, investors, and - usually - most of the company's employees finally get to see a financial return for their equity and hard work.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's also great for the country, as high-growth young firms account for a huge chunk of the new jobs created in our economy. Those jobs are well-paid, high-value technology and business roles - invariably, these are the jobs our kids want to get. Entrepreneurs building second or third companies with capital from a previous exit typically expand their businesses much faster, fuelled by this virtuous cycle of \"exit and reinvest\". It's a tremendous generator of employment and value for the economy.</p><p>Acquisitions are good for the acquiring company, too. When developing new technologies, features, and markets (which we can loosely describe as research and development for these purposes), tech companies use a mix of \"build\" and \"buy\" - either dedicating internal resources to create the product, or buying a company that has already built it and developed a user base. \"Buy\" has been very popular over the past 20 years, particularly in Silicon Valley.</p><p>So why is this a thorny topic? What are the downsides?</p><p>Sometimes the \"buy\" philosophy has the effect of enhancing the market share of firms that already have substantial market power. Occasionally, big firms buy little firms not to integrate their new technology into existing products or develop new product lines, but instead to kill them off so they don't turn into genuine competitors down the track. And even when the acquisition is a genuine R&amp;D strategy, it often merges two similar companies into one monolith. Think: Facebook buying Instagram and Whatsapp - acquisitions that have added billions of users to Facebook's already enormous global social media presence.</p><p>This can be troubling for those responsible for keeping markets fair - in particular, competition regulators.</p><p>In Australia, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has been concerned about this for some time. Recently, it recommended that the federal government make it harder for tech acquisitions to go ahead in Australia. The ACCC would like to see tech companies singled out by requiring them to give it prior notice of proposed acquisitions (giving notice is optional). It would also like the governing legislation to be amended so the ACCC is required to consider whether the company being acquired was a \"potential\" competitor of the acquirer's. While neither of these recommendations would be catastrophic, the direction is wrong.</p><p>These acquisitions aren't hostile takeovers - each sale is approved (and often actively solicited) by founders and investors in the acquired businesses. When start-ups are acquired, the capital that pours into the pockets of founders, employees, and investors is often redeployed into new ventures. These new companies are all the more successful thanks to all that extra available capital and the experience of the previous company's success and ultimate sale. As a result, almost uniquely in tech, acquisitions have strong positive effects on the competitive landscape.</p><p>The clearest practical example of this was when PayPal was acquired in 2002 by eBay for $US1.5 billion. That acquisition put hundreds of millions of dollars in the pockets of founders and early employees such as Elon Musk, Reid Hoffman, Peter Thiel, Chad Hurley and Jawed Karim. They used that money to go on to create some of the world's leading tech companies: Tesla, SpaceX, LinkedIn, Palantir, and YouTube - companies that injected huge competitive forces into established industries across the planet.</p><p>We've also seen this in Australia. Among others, the founders of successful tech companies Seek and Atlassian have gone on to start investment firms (Square Peg, Grok Ventures, and Skip Capital) and have reinvested hundreds of millions of dollars into the emerging domestic tech sector. If we make tech acquisitions harder in Australia, we make it harder for founders and investors to realise a return. That will hurt local tech across the board, making it less likely we will produce a PayPal of our own, let alone the companies it, in turn, spawned.</p><p>The ACCC's view is based on an understandable concern that US firms with substantial market power are using acquisitions to increase and extend that power. But the solution it favours - tightening acquisition laws - is out of date and won't work in the world of modern tech. It's an awkward approach that seeks to apply a local solution to a global problem, at the cost of domestic firms.</p><p>Australia's best shot at combating the market power of global digital platforms is to develop a thriving tech industry and back our best entrepreneurs to build well-funded global companies. That's the only way we will produce genuine \"potential competitors\" of the big digital platforms. An essential part of that is developing a thriving acquisition environment that encourages investment and rewards success.</p><p>If, down the line, an Australian digital platform has an uncomfortable share of the global market, we should turn our minds to whether we need to further restrict its ability to buy its \"potential competitors\". In the meantime, let's do everything we can to encourage the growth of some home-grown global champions.</p><p>Alex McCauley is chief executive of StartUp AUS.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc7742m7d8k9291h8n895</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X28-KFB1-F0J6-J0W6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"955\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

He warned for years that the big tech companies were arrogant and clueless and less good for mankind than they believed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Comeuppance, the billionaire investor warned, was coming. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Trouble has now arrived. Unfortunately for Mr. Thiel, the storm is centered on Facebook, whose board he has been a member of practically since its founding. The social network, which billed itself as bringing democracy and enlightenment to the world, was used by the Russians to subvert democracy and sow confusion in the United States.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Even people paid to see the future didn't see that one coming.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  ''The board's role is to help think about some of the medium- and longer-term problems coming around the corner,'' Mr. Thiel said. ''We were far from perfect in doing that.''</p><p>  Mr. Thiel, 50, is at the center of nearly every issue that roils Silicon Valley, ranging from the tech elite's fascination with New Zealand hideaways (Mr. Thiel obtained New Zealand citizenship) to Bitcoin (he is a major investor) to the problems of herd thinking (he is moving from San Francisco to Los Angeles to escape it) to the evolving role of content on the internet (he has been exploring the creation of a media company that would outflank Breitbart and Fox for a younger audience).</p><p>  Two subjects are currently overwhelming everything else: <person><nameText>President Trump, </nameText></person>whom Mr. Thiel aggressively backed for president, and Facebook, whose core mission is being called into question in the wake of the Russian revelations. In a typical Thiel move -- he tends to run toward controversy even as his Silicon Valley peers try to make themselves inconspicuous -- he agreed, in a rare interview, to talk about both.</p><p>  ''It's been a crazier two years than I would have thought,'' Mr. Thiel said in his new Midtown Manhattan apartment, which is so far up in the clouds that it literally looks down on Trump Tower.</p><p>  Despite the proximity, the mutual enthusiasm between Mr. Thiel and Mr. Trump seems to have cooled. After Mr. Thiel spoke at the Republican National Convention in 2016, there were unsourced media reports that said Mr. Trump wanted to put him on the Supreme Court. But now even photo ops are rare.</p><p>  The investor said he had last spoken to the president ''a few months ago.''</p><p>  ''We don't talk that often,'' he said, but added, ''I can get access anytime I want.''</p><p>  The Trump whom Mr. Thiel touted at the Republican convention was a candidate who would ''end the era of stupid wars and rebuild our country,'' move us past ''fake culture wars'' and start projects the equivalent of the Apollo space program. That does not seem to be the president he got.</p><p>  ''There are all these ways that things have fallen short,'' Mr. Thiel said. But he said he had no regrets about his endorsement. ''It's still better than Hillary Clinton or the Republican zombies,'' he said, referring to the other candidates.</p><p>  The White House did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>  Mr. Thiel is routinely labeled a libertarian. On a bookshelf in the apartment, as if in confirmation, is a hardback copy of Ayn Rand's ''Atlas Shrugged,'' the bible of the movement. A gift, he said.</p><p>  A lesser-known but possibly deeper influence was the French philosopher Ren\u00e9 Girard, who taught at Stanford University when Mr. Thiel was an undergraduate there. For 15 years, on and off, Mr. Thiel sat in on a study group about Mr. Girard's ideas. Mr. Girard believed human beings were deeply mimetic, which is to say they copy one another.</p><p>  ''It's very anti-Ayn Rand: There are no self-contained autonomous figures,'' Mr. Thiel said. ''Our desires are not our own. They get shaped powerfully by the society around us.''</p><p>  It was this illumination that helped him see the potential of Facebook -- where people could find out in intimate and addictive detail what their friends were up to -- when it was barely a year old. He was the first outside investor, buying 10 percent of the company for $500,000.</p><p>  He sold most of his holdings in 2012 as Facebook went public. A few months ago, with Facebook's market capitalization at about $500 billion, he sold most of what he had left.</p><p>  Last summer, there was a flap when a memo by a fellow board member, Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix, appeared in The New York Times. In the memo, Mr. Hastings wrote to Mr. Thiel that he displayed ''catastrophically bad judgment'' in supporting Mr. Trump.</p><p>  Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, did not ask him to step down from the board, and reports that he wants to leave the board are incorrect, Mr. Thiel said, noting that among other things that he brings ''ideological diversity.'' He declined to say exactly how much or what kind of advice the Facebook board was offering Mr. Zuckerberg, but defended the company from criticism that it was slow to wake up to what the Russians did.</p><p>  ''Remember when Trump said the election was going to be rigged? People said that was crazy -- 'How dare you question the integrity of the electoral process?' That was the view of most of the people working at Facebook, too,'' he said. ''They did not think things were so hackable. It was a mistake, but an understandable mistake.'' Facebook declined to comment.</p><p>  The anger now being turned on Facebook, Mr. Thiel argued, is less about Russia specifically and more about tech arrogance -- its failure to do so much for so many. It is a sentiment that helped put Mr. Trump in the White House.</p><p>  ''The Trump campaign slogan, 'Make America Great Again,' was perhaps the single most offensive thing you could say to Silicon Valley,'' he said. ''Silicon Valley says the future is going to be better than the past. That is the propaganda, if you will.''</p><p>  A friend of his in Silicon Valley had the idea of running for governor of California this year. Mr. Thiel's advice was that he had better have a good answer to this question: Why is tech good for the average person in California? The answer, he cautioned, couldn't be a banality, such as ''it's making us more connected,'' and it couldn't be utopian, such as ''it's going to cure all diseases.''</p><p>  ''He wasn't able to come up with an answer, and I couldn't come up with one, either,'' Mr. Thiel said. He declined to identify the friend, but it is well known in tech circles that Sam Altman, the president of Y Combinator, the prominent start-up accelerator, was thinking about running. Mr. Altman confirmed it was him and said he had decided not to run ''for many reasons.''</p><p>  There is a big painting of a cresting wave in Mr. Thiel's living room, and it might as well be a visual metaphor for what is going on in big tech now.</p><p>  ''Having some ambition that transcends just making money is a critical thing for a company,'' he said. ''But there is some point where it gets crazy and self-delusional.'' He added that the companies ''are probably in some trouble -- maybe it's a little, maybe it's a lot.'' The prospect of government regulation looms.</p><p>  In 2015 and 2016, Mr. Thiel gave $300,000 to Josh Hawley, who was campaigning to become Missouri's attorney general. Mr. Hawley won, and in November he opened an antitrust investigation of Google. A spokeswoman for Mr. Hawley, a Republican who is now challenging the state's Democratic senator, Claire McCaskill, said there was ''no connection'' between Mr. Thiel's donation and the investigation. Google declined to comment.</p><p>  The news last month that Mr. Thiel is moving from San Francisco to Los Angeles reflects a shift that is as much mental as literal. Getting out of the tech bubble, he figures, will give him more clarity about his investments.</p><p>  ''Network effects are very positive things, but there's a tipping point where they fall over into the madness of crowds,'' he said.</p><p>  Another of Mr. Thiel's contentious ideas was destroying Gawker, the online publisher. He secretly financed the privacy lawsuit that Hulk Hogan, the former pro wrestler, filed against the media company, which Mr. Hogan won. That led to Gawker's bankruptcy in 2016.</p><p>  A news operation that specialized in deflating the arrogance of Silicon Valley should have been to Mr. Thiel's liking. But he argues that his philosophy is consistent here.</p><p>  ''Gawker was trying to cut people down to size for not conforming,'' he said. ''The ability to speak and not have every word you say get distorted, to have wrong ideas and then be able to correct them -- these notions were powerfully undercut by Gawker.''</p><p>  Mr. Thiel is still pursuing the remnants of Gawker in court, which has prompted accusations that he wants to remove all of its content from the internet as a final victory.</p><p>  He denied this. ''Terry Bollea, a.k.a. Hulk Hogan, is still owed some money from the Gawker sale, and that is what I am trying to get,'' he said. ''I don't want the archives. I don't think it makes sense to destroy them. Preserve them, study them instead.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTOS: The <person><nameText>investor Peter Thiel </nameText></person>at his Manhattan apartment.

There, they were called to testify at the US House of Representatives antitrust subcommittee. It was a historic hearing that marks a significant milestone in the battle to rein in Silicon Valley.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The winners and losers of the big tech congressional hearings | Tim Bray</p><p>The overarching purpose of the hearings was to determine whether the companies had too much market power. Unlike their counterparts at past congressional hearings with tech executives, the subcommittee members arrived well prepared. They presented evidence. Some of the evidence revealed apparent violations of antitrust law, as with internal emails among executives at Facebook and Amazon related to each companys acquisition of startups.</p><p>The subcommittee chair, David Cicilline, and his colleagues demonstrated a nuanced understanding of the business models of internet platforms and the novel forms of anticompetitive behavior they employ. One did not need a detailed understanding of the topic to appreciate the subcommittees upper hand, but it helped.</p><p>The format of congressional hearings does not lend itself to thoughtful inquiry. The five-minute rule for inquiry prevents a smooth flow, aggravated in this case by the inclusion of four companies, each with different issues. Even so, the hearing shed light on the subcommittees investigation. They appear to have enough evidence to justify formal antitrust cases against some of the companies. The subcommittee members questions suggest they may be prepared to push for other forms of regulation. Neither of these things was known before the hearing.</p><p>American antitrust laws emerged as a response to concentrated economic power throughout the industrial economy more than a century ago. The Sherman (1890), Clayton (1914) and Federal Trade Commission (1914) Acts reflected a belief that monopoly is antidemocratic and should be eliminated even when it creates value in other ways. That framework endured until the Reagan administration, which encouraged concentration of economic power so long as it did not lead to higher consumer prices. The new model, known as the Chicago School, unleashed economic growth and a sustained bull market in stocks, with benefits that were initially widespread, but narrowed to an ever smaller percentage of the population. For the past 20 years, the top 10% enjoyed most of the benefits, especially the top 1%. The country tolerated income inequality while the economy expanded.</p><p>Anticompetitive behavior has been the norm in American business for at least a decade. A laser focus on maximizing shareholder value something which came in with the Chicago School justified disregard for the interests of employees, the communities where employees live, suppliers and customers. It justified ever greater tax cuts and reductions in government services.</p><p>People are discovering that it is possible to love the services of Facebook and Google and question whether the benefits justify the harm</p><p>The Covid-19 pandemic triggered an economic contraction, leaving nearly half the population without a job . Supply chains optimized for shareholder value have not been able to produce enough personal protective equipment, cotton swabs or testing infrastructure. A healthcare industry built for elective surgery has struggled to adapt to a public health mission. Internet platforms designed to connect us have undermined the nations pandemic response by amplifying disinformation, while also empowering white supremacists.</p><p>Questioning the values that left worlds richest economy unable to address a pandemic is no longer the exception. Economic power in nearly every US industry is more concentrated than it has been in a century, but tech has performed best and has more impact on our democracy, public health, privacy and economy. Too much of that impact has been negative. No one doubts the good that comes from internet platforms or smartphones. The doubt comes with respect to the business practices and culture that benefit the few at the expense of the many. People are discovering that it is possible to love the services of Facebook and Google and question whether the benefits justify the harm. They wonder why they cannot have the good without the bad. The antitrust subcommittee hearing reflected all of these issues.</p><p>It is possible that the four CEOs anticipated a different kind of hearing. Amazons Jeff Bezos and Alphabets Sundar Pichai shared their own rags-to-riches stories. Facebooks Mark Zuckerberg tried to position his companys size as a benefit. Apples Tim Cook made a case that his company is different from the others, which is true, though Apple exhibits anticompetitive behavior in its App Store. The CEOs appeared not to understand that the countrys values are changing, that their users are less willing to accept all-or-nothing terms, apologies and promises to do better. Business practices that are acceptable in a startup may not be not so for a market-dominant company.</p><p>The House antitrust subcommittee must find a way to restore traditional antitrust regulation, while also addressing the new challenges posed by tech giants. When a company operates an ecosystem, what should be the limits on behavior? What rules should govern corporations that build a business around personal data? What responsibility should tech companies and their executives bear for the harms they cause? The answers remain to be determined, but the House antitrust subcommittee has submitted them for the consideration of the nation. That is progress.</p><p>Roger McNamee is Managing Director at Elevation Partners and an early stage investor in Google and Facebook</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECONNW-en3107117</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECONNW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P51-RRV1-JD88-34GC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">173751</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"963\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 RIA OREANDA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Economic News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"51811\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 31, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>US HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

There, they were called to testify at the US House of Representatives' antitrust subcommittee. It was a historic hearing that marks a significant milestone in the battle to rein in Silicon Valley.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The overarching purpose of the hearings was to determine whether the companies had too much market power. Unlike their counterparts at past congressional hearings with tech executives, the subcommittee members arrived well prepared. They presented evidence. Some of the evidence revealed apparent violations of antitrust law, as with internal emails among executives at Facebook and Amazon related to each company's acquisition of startups.</p><p>The subcommittee chair, David Cicilline, and his colleagues demonstrated a nuanced understanding of the business models of internet platforms and the novel forms of anticompetitive behavior they employ. One did not need a detailed understanding of the topic to appreciate the subcommittee's upper hand, but it helped.</p><p>The format of congressional hearings does not lend itself to thoughtful inquiry. The five-minute rule for inquiry prevents a smooth flow, aggravated in this case by the inclusion of four companies, each with different issues. Even so, the hearing shed light on the subcommittee's investigation. They appear to have enough evidence to justify formal antitrust cases against some of the companies. The subcommittee members' questions suggest they may be prepared to push for other forms of regulation. Neither of these things was known before the hearing.</p><p>American antitrust laws emerged as a response to concentrated economic power throughout the industrial economy more than a century ago. The Sherman (1890), Clayton (1914) and Federal Trade Commission (1914) Acts reflected a belief that monopoly is antidemocratic and should be eliminated even when it creates value in other ways. That framework endured until the Reagan administration, which encouraged concentration of economic power so long as it did not lead to higher consumer prices. The new model, known as the Chicago School, unleashed economic growth and a sustained bull market in stocks, with benefits that were initially widespread, but narrowed to an ever smaller percentage of the population. For the past 20 years, the top 10% enjoyed most of the benefits, especially the top 1%. The country tolerated income inequality while the economy expanded.</p><p>Anticompetitive behavior has been the norm in American business for at least a decade. A laser focus on maximizing shareholder value - something which came in with the Chicago School - justified disregard for the interests of employees, the communities where employees live, suppliers and customers. It justified ever greater tax cuts and reductions in government services.</p><p>People are discovering that it is possible to love the services of Facebook and Google and question whether the benefits justify the harm</p><p>The Covid-19 pandemic triggered an economic contraction, leaving <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/29/nearly-half-the-us-population-is-without-a-job-showing-how-far-the-labor-recovery-has-to-go.html\">nearly half the population without a job</url>. Supply chains optimized for shareholder value have not been able to produce enough personal protective equipment, cotton swabs or testing infrastructure. A healthcare industry built for elective surgery has struggled to adapt to a public health mission. Internet platforms designed to connect us have undermined the nation's pandemic response by amplifying disinformation, while also empowering white supremacists.</p><p>Questioning the values that left world's richest economy unable to address a pandemic is no longer the exception. Economic power in nearly every US industry is more concentrated than it has been in a century, but tech has performed best and has more impact on our democracy, public health, privacy and economy. Too much of that impact has been negative. No one doubts the good that comes from internet platforms or smartphones. The doubt comes with respect to the business practices and culture that benefit the few at the expense of the many. People are discovering that it is possible to love the services of Facebook and Google and question whether the benefits justify the harm. They wonder why they cannot have the good without the bad. The antitrust subcommittee hearing reflected all of these issues.</p><p>It is possible that the four CEOs anticipated a different kind of hearing. Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Alphabet's Sundar Pichai shared their own rags-to-riches stories. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg tried to position his company's size as a benefit. Apple's Tim Cook made a case that his company is different from the others, which is true, though Apple exhibits anticompetitive behavior in its App Store. The CEOs appeared not to understand that the country's values are changing, that their \"users\" are less willing to accept all-or-nothing terms, apologies and promises to do better. Business practices that are acceptable in a startup may not be not so for a market-dominant company.</p><p>The House antitrust subcommittee must find a way to restore traditional antitrust regulation, while also addressing the new challenges posed by tech giants. When a company operates an ecosystem, what should be the limits on behavior? What rules should govern corporations that build a business around personal data? What responsibility should tech companies and their executives bear for the harms they cause? The answers remain to be determined, but the House antitrust subcommittee has submitted them for the consideration of the nation. That is progress.</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Roger McNamee is Managing Director at Elevation Partners and an early stage investor in Google and Facebook</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-64936261</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60H5-XN61-F021-63JG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"955\"/><timeReceived>12:42 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

Property development is clearly not the favourite child of the government at the moment.\"</p><p/><p>Developers had a bumper year in 2018, with sales rising 14.7 per cent to a record US$1.8 trillion, or seven times the property transactions in the United States.</p><p/><p>Property remains a major component of the mainland economy, but the party is coming to an end as the slowest economic growth pace in almost three \u00addecades forces owner-occupiers and investors to postpone their purchases.</p><p/><p>Order books are full of semi-built homes, with 1.45 billion square metres of housing waiting to come on line in the next two years, according to JPMorgan Chase.</p><p/><p>Sales are likely to drop 3.4 per cent this year, with a further 1.5 percentage point decline forecast for 2020.</p><p/><p>The warning signs are already visible, with 20 out of 24 developers tracked by JPMorgan Chase missing their 2018 sales targets, including the five biggest by \u00admarket capitalisation - Country Garden Holdings, China Evergrande Group, China Vanke, \u00adSunac China Holdings and Poly Real Estate Group.</p><p/><p>In addition, government \u00adrestrictions, such as price caps and resale restrictions, as well as mounting debt, which is hard to manage because private firms are not favoured for bank loans in the current climate, are taking a toll.</p><p/><p>\"The industry has seen its ceiling,\" said Danielle Wang, a China property analyst at DBS Vickers.</p><p/><p>\"The era of its growth spurt is over and there must be a slowdown in every developer's expansion. They need new drivers for further growth.\"</p><p/><p>The embrace of hi-tech by property developers also comes as the government promotes its ambitious \"Made in China 2025\" industrial development plan that is aimed at transforming the world's second-largest economy into a technology powerhouse.</p><p/><p>In a sign of the shift under way, one of the largest property developers has changed its name from Longfor Properties to Longfor Group, saying the new brand is \"more aligned with the long-term business strategies\", which include \"continuous innovation\".</p><p/><p>\"It is not easy to negotiate with the government if you are purely a property developer currently,\" Longfor chief executive Shao Mingxiao said recently.</p><p/><p>Country Garden, the mainland's top residential developer by sales, meanwhile, has said it would become a hi-tech conglomerate, pouring 80 billion yuan (HK$93.1 billion) into the \u00adrobotics sector.</p><p/><p>Founder and chairman Yeung Kwok-keung set the scene at the company's annual gathering on January 22.</p><p/><p>\"We are paving the way to \u00adbecoming a hi-tech company,\" Yeung said.</p><p/><p>\"We will embrace an era of \u00adrobots building homes. It is just a matter of time. We must get it done and this will be our com\u00adpetitive advantage in the future,\" he said, identifying property, smart agriculture and robotics as the company's three core \u00adbusinesses.</p><p/><p>The developer's first robotic restaurant in Shunde, Guangdong province, will open after the Lunar New Year while its first robotic construction worker will help build a house in the second half of this year.</p><p/><p>In another example, Ever\u00adgrande, the country's third- \u00adlargest developer by sales, is \u00admoving into electric cars and has a US$16 billion plan to enter such fields as life sciences, aviation, quantum \u00adscience, new energy, AI, robotics and smart agriculture.</p><p/><p>Greenland Holdings, the sixth-largest developer by sales last year, meanwhile, has invested 300 million yuan in AI and into smart retail company DeepBlue \u00adTechnology.</p><p/><p>Vanke has entered into \u00adventures with some big tech \u00adinnovators, including Microsoft, AI start-up SenseTime and electric-vehicle maker Nio. With Microsoft, it is looking at smart home projects, among others.</p><p/><p>AI, big data, the internet of things and cloud computing could help Vanke build up the basic platform of its core business, chief executive Yu Liang said at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference 2018 in Shanghai.</p><p/><p>Technology would become the new driver of Vanke by 2024, he said.</p><p/><p>\"In the future, hi-tech will \u00adempower Vanke's full-service \u00adsystem to create a more future-oriented China,\" Yu said.</p><p/><p>There are likely to be rough patches along the road to a hi-tech future, however, given some past experiences.</p><p/><p>Sun Hongbin, the chairman of Tianjin-based Sunac, ranked fourth by home sales on the \u00admainland, has said the company's 18.6 billionyuan investment in video-streaming platform Leshi in 2017 was a failure and repre\u00adsented its biggest loss since listing in Hong Kong in 2010.</p><p/><p>However, he later said he would continue looking for ways to \u00adexpand. \"Without the experience of pain and suffering from a loss, even the smartest person cannot grow,\" he said at a news conference last year.</p><p/><p>The push into new businesses does not mean developers are abandoning property, however, as many see some of the new \u00adtechnologies as complementary to real estate and construction.</p><p/><p>\"The investment in robotic business is not a diversification, but an enhancement of the \u00adcompetitiveness of the property products,\" said Mo Bin, the chief financial officer at Country \u00adGarden.</p><p/><p>\"We will not give up property development. That's our main business. If we are no longer a \u00addeveloper, all our AI or robotic \u00adinvestments would become meaningless.\"</p><p/><p>Mo said cost control was the main reason the company was turning to robotic construction.</p><p/><p>\"We are now talking about construction work worth 600 \u00adbillion yuan. If we assigned 200 billion yuan to robotics, we would save 5 per cent of the cost. That is huge,\" Mo said.</p><p/><p>Cheng Guangyu, Country \u00adGarden's vice-president, added that robots were more efficient than humans at repetitive tasks.</p><p/><p>The company has been testing out robots that cook and perform building tasks.</p><p/><p>\"Building homes in the future will be like making a car - most of the processes can be done by automation,\" Cheng said. \"Every developer builds similar spaces. Value-added services distinguish a company from others.\"</p><p/><p>Shen Jianguang, chief economist at JD Finance, said developers also understood very well that diversification into pet projects of Beijing would be helpful to their property businesses.</p><p/><p>\"It's better to play down, make a gesture of goodwill to the \u00adauthorities. After all, a good \u00adrelationship with regulators is vital to every developer,\" Shen said.</p><p/><p>\"If you stick to the government's preferred agenda, you can expect the regulators to have \u00admercy on you. For example, it might be easier to get pre-sale \u00adpermission [to sell flats before they are completed] and lower financing costs.\"</p><p/><p>Alan Jin, a property analyst at Mizuho Securities Asia, described the period of experimenting that developers were going through as one of lots of anxiety but also lots of new hope.</p><p/><p>\"You will see more developers doing this, following their peers even though no one knows whether any of the new businesses can be profitable,\" Jin said.</p><p/><p>\"Yet, in the short term, property is still the major money-making machine.\"</p><p/><p>Even Dalian Wanda Group, which unloaded US$9.3 billion in hotel and tourism assets after drawing the ire of Beijing over its huge overseas acquisition spree, is learning how to safely expand in line with the government's vision for the \u00adcountry.</p><p/><p>Only a few years ago, chairman Wang Jianlin said he would overwhelm Shanghai Disney with a \u00adseries of extravagant theme parks.</p><p/><p>Now, after selling down assets and getting through a period of regulatory scrutiny, he is building a US$1.74 billion theme park in Yanan that will recreate the city's role as the seat of communist power in the 1930s and birthplace of the revolution, where so-called red tourism enthusiasts will be able to dress in liberation army uniforms.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SCHINA-16802bd0-22b0-11e9-9177-bd3ae24bba4f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SCHINA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VCM-0X71-JC8V-12D3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11314</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1366\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 South China Morning Post Ltd.

In 2018, for example, children under 18 represented more than 40 percent of all new internet users globally, per PricewaterhouseCoopers, and some experts estimate that soon they will make up half of all people on the web. But with regulators cracking down on sites like YouTube over ads targeting underage users, the need to create protected environments for kids inside the vast (and often seedy) digital world has never been greater.</p><p>That's put companies focused on the kid-safe media space in high demand. Now, London-based SuperAwesome is fielding interest from companies like Microsoft, which made a $17 million strategic investment in January. Meanwhile, Encantos, the media company behind animated bilingual preschool brand Canticos, has raised $2 million in seed funding to expand its focus on multicultural storytelling.</p><p>\"We hadn't been planning to raise any capital,\" says Collins, revealing that SuperAwesome is on track to hit $100 million in revenue this year. But, he continues, \"Having one of the world's biggest technology companies investing in the kid-tech category, it really does send a signal.\"</p><p>Entrepreneurs recognized the opportunity to invest in digital kids programming years ago as parents began to eschew basic cable stalwarts like Nickelodeon and Disney Channel for on-demand platforms like Netflix and YouTube. \"There's a huge demand on any platform right now for kids and family content,\" says Rene Rechtman, co-founder and CEO of Moonbug, which acquires and distributes children's programming to platforms including YouTube, Netflix, Amazon and Hulu. He describes it as \"retention content,\" explaining, \"Sports will drive subscribers, and kids and family content will make sure the subscribers stay on board.\" Just look at Disney+, which amassed 28.6 million subscribers in three months largely because of its family-friendly library.</p><p>Attention to kids' content providers has grown in recent months, since the Federal Trade Commission's $170 million settlement with Google-owned YouTube over allegations that it collected the personal information of children under 13 without their parents' consent, a violation of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).</p><p>As a result, on Jan. 6, YouTube began restricting targeted ads and turned off comments on kid-centric videos. Though some individual creators have said they've seen a decline in viewership as a result of the change, it has largely had the reverse affect for established brands. Encantos, for example, has seen viewership to its Canticos YouTube channel triple in the past month, says CEO Steven Wolfe Pereira. And Pocket, watch--which has begun selling YouTube advertising inventory alongside brands like Ryan's World in a COPPA-compliant way --expects ad sales to increase as much as fivefold this year.</p><p>YouTube, which made $15.1 billion in revenue in 2019, will counterbalance the negative impact on some creators' businesses by investing $100 million into original children's programming for the YouTube Kids apps. In a brief sent to partners, which a source shared with THR, YouTube said the funding will roll out over the next three years and will be given to \"differentiated, high-quality kids programming that aims to enrich and delight our young audience\" between the ages of 3 and 8.</p><p>YouTube's settlement with the FTC is likely to place increased scrutiny on the entire kids programming space, but many executives say they ultimately see it as a positive because it will help boost content providers and platforms that are focused on creating safe spaces for children and that comply with COPPA.</p><p>\"The broad interest in the space is growing and will continue to grow,\" says Pocket, watch CEO Chris Williams. Adds Collins, whose SuperAwesome launched ad-supported video streaming platform Rukkaz in July, \"I think you're going to see a huge wave of development and activity in free ad-funded online video for kids in the next two to four years.\"</p><p>NATALIE JARVEY is digital editor at The Hollywood Reporter.</p><p>By the Numbers</p><p>$15.1B YouTube's 2019 revenue</p><p>$100M YouTube's three-year investment in content for kids ages 3-8</p><p>$100M Kid-safe tech startup SuperAwesome's projected 2020 revenue</p><p>$17M Microsoft's January 2020 investment in SuperAwesome</p><p>Caption: Collins</p><p>Please Note: Illustration(s) are not available due to copyright restrictions.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASAPII-615493688</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP 615493688</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YFX-RVG1-DYTM-9067-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">140610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"818\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 Prometheus Global Media LLC</copyright><publicationName>Hollywood Reporter</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 0018-3660</issn><volume>Vol. 426</volume><issueNumber>No. 7\"</issueNumber><aggregationName>ASAP</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 12, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Other, Magazine/Journal</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Arts and entertainment industries</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business, international</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Children's mass media</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Children's media</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Industry sales and revenue</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Mass media industry</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Safety and security measures</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.general-terms\"><classificationItem><className>General services</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Sales &amp;

This case is important because about 80 percent of smartphones sold in Europe and globally run on Android, and Googleis by far the largest player in internet search. The company is also the biggest player in online advertising, with a nearly 40 percent market share last year, and it has a commanding presence in a number of other internet businesses, like video, email and maps. </p><p>  The European Union had three main complaints: Googlerequired cellphone companies that wanted to offer its Play app store or search to preinstall 11 of its apps as a bundle, whether they wanted all of them or not. The company gave the largest manufacturers money if the only search they installed was Google's. And the company prohibited manufacturers from developing phones on altered versions of Android not approved by Googleif they wanted to use any of its other services. The company strongly disputed the allegation that its practices are anticompetitive, arguing that they are designed to help recoup Google's investment in Android, which it licenses free to device manufacturers. Google, which plans to appeal the decision, asserts that Android is a much more open and competitive platform than its main rival, which is used by the iPhone, in which Apple controls both the device and the software. Indeed, Android devices tend to be cheaper than iPhones because manufacturers like Samsung, Motorola and LG make competing phones.</p><p>  The European case is strongest when it argues against Google's exclusionary requirements -- that cellphone makers not produce devices with other versions of Android and that they install only the Googlesearch app. Such contractual terms serve to limit consumer choices and squelch innovation by making it harder for people to discover alternatives to Googleproducts. But the regulator is on much weaker ground when it asserts that by making its apps and services available only as a bundle, Googleis hurting consumers. Smartphone companies like Samsung also preinstall apps that compete with Google's and users can easily download software by other developers -- something many people do.</p><p>  But the larger problem with the union's case is that it's unlikely to shake Google's dominance. For starters, while a $5.1 billion fine is large in absolute terms, it's a relative bargain for Googleand its parent company, Alphabet, which had $103 billion in cash and securities warming its accounts at the end of March and had nearly $13 billion in profits last year. Even more important, billions of people around the world are already accustomed to using the company's apps and services on their Android phones and are likely to stick to them. Even new users will most likely gravitate toward Googleeven if the company's apps are not preinstalled because of the superiority of many of its products and because so many other people use them -- the so-called network effect.</p><p>  This case highlights the importance of more proactive and thoughtful antitrust enforcement and regulation. For example, officials in Europe and the United States need to be more vigilant about blocking mergers and acquisitions that have allowed tech platforms like Google's to become so dominant in the first place. They could also seek to impose rules to limit the use of exclusionary contracts in oligopolistic industries like technology and telecommunications to encourage more competition.</p><p>  Regrettably, that does not seem to be a top priority for the Trump administration. The head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, Makan Delrahim, recently told The Financial Times that big tech companies' buying smaller businesses could bring ''great efficiencies.'' He cited the example of Googleacquiring YouTube in 2006. In fact, a compelling argument could be made that the online video business would be much more competitive and innovative had officials blocked that acquisition.</p><p>  For his part, President Trump absurdly sought to turn the European Union's case into another example of how European officials are taking ''advantage'' of the United States.</p><p>  Antitrust officials have a difficult job: By the time they bring enforcement cases it can be hard to reverse the harm that has already been done. It is also difficult to foresee and prevent bad outcomes. That's why it is important that lawmakers and regulators use all the tools they have to encourage competition and fair play.</p><p>  Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter. </p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-155446180721</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SVF-MB61-DXY4-X351-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"847\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The New York Times Company</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times</publicationName><edition>Late Edition - Final</edition><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/opinion/google-eu-antitrust-competition.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/opinion/google-eu-antitrust-competition.html</url><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 21, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Editorial</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0002Q7P</classCode><className>LG CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

She also begins the book with a quote from Stephen Hawking that 'AI is likely to be the best or worst thing to happen to humanity.' So while it may be true that fear is not likely to lead to the best result, there is clearly something more to fear than fear itself. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.porchlightbooks.com/product/360-corporation-from-stakeholder-trade-offs-to-transformation--sarah-kaplan\">https://www.porchlightbooks.com/product/360-corporation-from-stakeholder-trade-offs-to-transformation--sarah-kaplan</url> Just 20 pages into Flynn Coleman's first book, A Human Algorithm, we have been given a succinct, yet sweeping history of human technology from written language and agriculture, through the renaissance and the industrial revolution, to the atomic bomb and personal computer. She explains how each step not only increased productivity and economic output and growth, but fundamentally rewrote the social contract, moral codes, and societal norms of the day. Scholars, advocates, idealists, revolutionaries, and a broad engagement in the politics of such social change have always had just as much to do with rewriting the rules and remaking the world around new technology as technologists did, and it must be the same as we build what is likely to be the most momentous and impactful technology in our history, artificial intelligence. As Coleman writes:If we make humanitarian ideals central to how we develop and deploy intelligent technologies now, we have a chance at preserving and advancing humankind and, just maybe, making a leap forward instead of a dystopian step backward.Not only have we not come up with any ways to regulate, govern, or guide AI development\u2014no 'AI rules and treaties'\u2014we don't even have a clear definition of what it is, or how it works. Even those working on it don't fully know how the algorithms they feed into a machine (or increasingly, that the machines themselves are able to come up with) arrive at the answers they ultimately reach. The way that synthetic intelligence reaches its conclusions is unknown and may be unknowable. Coleman likens it to understanding how Einstein's brain came up with the theory of relativity. Neuroscience has come a long way, but how our brains function is still a mystery in many\u2014if not most\u2014ways. So, while the book contains an explanation and examination of machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, natural language processing, and the next leap needed in our quest for AI, quantum computing, it is more about the search for what it means to be human, and what intelligence is. If we are attempting to model artificial intelligence on human intelligence, we have to grapple with the fact that we're modeling it on something we don't fully understand\u2014something Coleman suggests may be a strength:I contend our current incapacity to definitively model our intelligent technology on our own brains may ultimately prove not to be a failure but rather a unique opportunity to embrace our limitations and expand our viewpoint. If we see intelligence as the ability to solve new problems, this opens the door to honoring the vast variety of intelligence in the world, not just human.Throughout, she asks the reader to consider what they think, what their definition would be, how they see the world. That is especially important to bring to the fore, and into the discussion, because the group of individuals working within the field today are predominantly white males from two elite universities, working for a handful of tech giants who are building the technology on a proprietary model.If the homogeneity in the field of AI development continues, we risk infusing and programming a predictable set of prejudices into our intelligent digital dopplegangers.If we don't believe that can happen, or that the results can't be all that bad, look at one of the most idealistic developments in social engineering in human history, American democracy. Founded upon the idea that we're all created equal, our country's wealthy, white male founders still excluded women and non-property owners from the franchise to vote and denied most black folks their very freedom. The number of enslaved human beings reached four million before liberation. It was a system built on an economic imperative that devalued human life and freedom, specifically black bodies, families, and lives. While we've made some progress, that economic imperative hasn't changed all that much, and we live in a system that still puts economic growth and profits over the health of the planet we rely on for our very existence. So, suggests Coleman: Given the economic trends toward tech monopolies and against government intervention in corporate power consolidation, we have to counter not only by investing in creative AI start-ups, but also by educating the public on how important it is to infuse transparency, teamwork, and inclusive thinking into the development of AI.She stresses the importance of cross discipline, combinational creativity. In order to teach machines to connect the dots in holistic ways that support us all, we must be able to connect the dots ourselves, and together not alone. The humanities, a consideration of human rights, and a greater dialogue with and understanding of our fellow human beings are a critical piece of the development.Even when we do not agree on the specifics, if we can agree that the dialogue is still worth having, that we want to be better tomorrow than we are today, that our actions and decisions have an impact on ourselves and others, then at least we are moving toward an ideal, even if we never fully reach it. This could be as close as we get, and it might just be enough.The power of mass media and entertainment has largely made us 'observational players in our own reality.' The promise of social media and Web 2.0 was supposed to change that, but that seems to have gone sideways as big tech found the easiest way to profitability was consolidation, data mining, and a business model predicated on surveillance capitalism. We became the product big tech sold to others. But we must not be passive observers as AI takes shape. We need as many voices and as much empathy as possible built into the algorithms and intelligent machines that are already beginning to impact our own behavior in profound ways as we interact with the world through our devices. We must give AI an ethical and moral underpinning that takes into consideration the varied interests of living beings on this planet.It is incumbent upon us to attempt to design and implement an ethical framework compatible with synthetic intelligence, ever mindful that we may hold competing views as to what constitutes morals, principles, and values. The schematic for an algorithmic charter that can guide both human and machine cannot be conceived\u2014nor will it approach universality\u2014without acknowledging human biases and without respecting all forms of life with whom we share our home.But even if we can agree on an ethical framework as a society, it is not likely the entire world will abide by it. Will China end its 'social ranking' program? Will Russia end its hacking of democracy around the world? What happens as AI is increasingly embedded into weapons systems? Cyberwarfare is already a reality, and an AI arms race is upon us. And even if governments agree in the open, there will undoubtedly be intelligence operations and unlawful individuals that don't abide by the rules.As computers and intelligent algorithms are increasingly able to hack into the deepest reaches of our identities, both online and off, we are seeing that our information can be bought, sold, and stolen on an enormous scale. []Information is the new currency of power, and there is a bustling black market for it.As these technologies monitor us more closely, the very notion of a right to privacy is shifting, and Coleman believes 'we are also going to need to secure our mental privacy and cognitive liberty, which is the right to have sovereignty over one's own consciousness and freedom of thought.' What if we mandated that those working in AI only use synthetic data rather than real-world data collected from us? Do robots deserve rights of their own? Coleman points out that:Companies have been granted legal personhood; in this sense, corporations could be considered some of the first AIs. Precedent has been established.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.porchlightbooks.com/product/360-corporation-from-stakeholder-trade-offs-to-transformation--sarah-kaplanShe\">https://www.porchlightbooks.com/product/360-corporation-from-stakeholder-trade-offs-to-transformation--sarah-kaplanShe</url> quotes Weapons of Math Destruction[2] author Cathy O'Neil, who stated that 'this is not a math test. This is a political fight.' I am not scared of intelligent technology. I am scared that it is arriving at a time when the prevailing system of shareholder capitalism will enlist it to benefit the bottom line of an elite few, rather than the diverse interests of all of us. I am scared that 'Even such elite universities as Oxford and Cambridge are complaining that tech giants are stealing all of their talent.' I am scared that it is being developed by silos of a homogenous group of individuals and that it will automate the existing and rising inequality within our society. But Flynn Coleman offers hope. Her book is focused far more on the upside of getting it right than worrying about what could possibly go wrong (though she doesn't shy away from it).       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.porchlightbooks.com/product/360-corporation-from-stakeholder-trade-offs-to-transformation--sarah-kaplan\">https://www.porchlightbooks.com/product/360-corporation-from-stakeholder-trade-offs-to-transformation--sarah-kaplan</url> The quest for AI is one that contemplates the oldest questions of consciousness and the soul, explores the nature of existence and existence of nature. A Human Algorithm is ultimately a book about what it is to be human, about how we need not be passive observers of reality but can interject and help shape it. It is about the importance of empathy and the power of storytelling. She cites Kate Raworth's Doughnut Economics as a model that can free us from a narrow focus on growth and turn us toward the goal of human flourishing on a living planet. She suggests feeding the best of our literary fiction into AI can make it more empathetic, as it has been proven to do so for ourselves. She has a lot of great suggestions, but the book is, above all, a call for inclusion and curiosity:Today, a human algorithm can only be described in metaphysical terms, not scientific ones. It isn't a map for how to get out of the forest. It's a map for going in.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.porchlightbooks.com/product/360-corporation-from-stakeholder-trade-offs-to-transformation--sarah-kaplanI\">https://www.porchlightbooks.com/product/360-corporation-from-stakeholder-trade-offs-to-transformation--sarah-kaplanI</url> am not a scientist and don't know the odds of us actually developing a general AI, but I know that there isn't much we can do to stop the attempt. And I agree wholeheartedly with Coleman's call to incorporate the humanities and other disciplines into the effort. I agree that our economics and politics are going to change as it evolves, and that we should all engage in that conversation and construction. I don't know if 'Smart tech can help unburden our mental lives, giving our imaginations room to roam and giving us more time to connect with people in our material reality.' But I do agree that:Beyond profit we find purpose. Beyond our individual selves, we find each other.And if we can focus on purpose, and engage with each other, I agree we have a chance at building something beneficial and equitable to all. But we don't have a moment to spare.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.porchlightbooks.com/product/360-corporation-from-stakeholder-trade-offs-to-transformation--sarah-kaplan\">https://www.porchlightbooks.com/product/360-corporation-from-stakeholder-trade-offs-to-transformation--sarah-kaplan</url> [ 1]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.porchlightbooks.com/product/human-algorithm-how-artificial-intelligence-is-redefining-who-we-are--flynn-coleman\">https://www.porchlightbooks.com/product/human-algorithm-how-artificial-intelligence-is-redefining-who-we-are--flynn-coleman</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.porchlightbooks.com/product/weapons-of-math-destruction-how-big-data-increases-inequality-and-threatens-democracy--cathy-oneil?variationCode=9780553418835\">https://www.porchlightbooks.com/product/weapons-of-math-destruction-how-big-data-increases-inequality-and-threatens-democracy--cathy-oneil?variationCode=9780553418835</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-CEOR1282051570216551994251765300153</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CEOR-128205</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X6G-G0S1-F03R-N1J6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2028\"/><timeReceived>7:15 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Porchlight</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 4, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000116</classCode><className>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001965</classCode><className>SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE &amp; LIFESTYLE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DMWD</classCode><className>MACHINE LEARNING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DM8Y</classCode><className>BUSINESS NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DL51</classCode><className>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0008XKG</classCode><className>OUTPUT &amp; DEMAND</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST000DDFG</classCode><className>QUANTUM COMPUTING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX001405</classCode><className>PRODUCTIVITY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST000D8KZ</classCode><className>NEUROSCIENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>STX000195</classCode><className>BOMBS &amp; EXPLOSIVE DEVICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000116</classCode><className>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DMWD</classCode><className>MACHINE LEARNING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX001311</classCode><className>PERSONAL COMPUTERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST000DDFG</classCode><className>QUANTUM COMPUTING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>PE000DI0V</classCode><className>STEPHEN HAWKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Over the years they have forged an unlikely public/private partnership, making it their mission to collaborate and discuss cyber risks and solutions in the context of both national security and corporate security. The pair have appeared at conferences together[2], penned an op-ed for The New York Times[3], and now sat down for an interview with Business Insider. Speaking over the phone from New York, the pair focused on how AI and 5G will create an explosion in cybersecurity risks over the coming years, which law enforcement and companies will need to grapple with.

The technology could also make deepfakes a threat at a corporate level, with attackers able to impersonate CEOs and get employees to wire funds. \"We're engaged in a race without a finish line,\" Beshar says of the threat. \"Cyber is a unique threat that poses a threat to both government and industry both sectors have been breached repeatedly. Neither one of us is immune.\" The pair also discussed protecting 5G networks, in the context of concerns over Chinese tech giant Huawei contributing to infrastructure, and the growing demand for privacy regulation in Silicon Valley.Scroll on to read the Q...ith Ari Mahairas and Peter Beshar in full. The transcript has been edited for length and clarity. Jake Kanter: Let's start with the risks of AI and 5G. Peter Beshar: You can think about these two new technologies as essentially two accelerants that are being poured on the cyber fire. Ari Mahairas: So I think we all know, based on what we're seeing, that 5G is not coming it's already here. It already started its rollout and it will continue to roll out globally. And I think 5G is a very interesting technology because we know exactly what it does. When we think about it in terms of the industrial control systems, in SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition systems), obviously it creates another vulnerability. What do I mean? We know that IoT (internet of things) and operational technology devices are critical components of industrial control systems and SCADA systems. In fact, any research that I've looked at or graph that I've looked at shows an upward trajectory of these types of devices being connected. In other words, the proliferation of these devices has and will continue to grow. In 2014 we had about 12.5 billion devices. In 2018, they estimated 20 billion. And by 2022 they're saying 30 billion devices will be connected. I came across a report that said 50 billion \u2014 I think it's a matter of not if but when we'll eventually get there. When we reach that number they're saying that's equivalent to about five connected devices per person. So obviously what that does in the concept of the threat landscape \u2014 each one of these devices creates a new threat vector but it's also big business right. Because again, there's another estimate that shows it's going to be a $14-plus trillion business by 2020. They're estimating about five hundred million devices connected via 5G. But I think that's going to grow as well. And this is the reason why we've seen historically dumb devices being converted to smart devices.Let's take a plant or some kind of warehouse as an example. You have a forklift. You have products from a shelf. You have a container and a trailer. If you attach sensors to these devices these items you can see where the forklift is moving around in the warehouse and what it's picking up, when the product is picked up, when it's loaded into that container, when the container is closed, then when it's put on the trailer, and then you can track the trailer as it moves. So if we think of that just for a moment what a tremendous business enabler these are IOT devices have. Historically they were very expensive. It has been the plummeting cost of these transistors and sensors that is allowing this to happen. And so as we move more towards cellular networks we're looking that those devices that have wide area applications, so cars, machines, manufacturing supply chain process meters, all those types of things I think will increase as the 5G rolls out. 5G increases speed. It also increases the bandwidth. And so when that bandwidth increases you can push through a lot more data. Now with all that information and the data going through these data pipes, there's a lot of information there are privacy issues associated with that security issues associated with that. So that's always our concern from a security perspective. But we also recognize that it's going to provide a lot of opportunities to sort of monetize that information efficiently. And I think that's where AI comes in. PB: Most people think sword, shield. There is a defensive component that obviously infosec officials are excited about, including the enhanced capacity to detect anomalous behavior. But in this field, offense is a lot easier than defense. Obviously, the attack landscape is much broader than it used to be. And so in the past, you had DDOS attacks that would leverage a bunch of different devices. And for example, disable Business Insider's website. Now they have swarm bots and hive nets. It's kind of the beehive concept of just swarming around and leveraging instead of hundreds or thousands of IoT devices, now you're talking about really leveraging hundreds of millions of devices and then targeting those IoT devices at a particular target really at scale. And so our view is that while there's obviously promise in AI and machine learning for defensive purposes, the hackers are working just as assiduously to utilize these tools for their purposes as something like the process for writing malware. It's a reasonably labour-intensive process, or it has been. If you start really using AI enabled tools to write the malware and then to deploy it at a much broader scale, that's the obvious downside. Jake Kanter: Have there been any examples that you can point to? AM: I'm not going to speak specifically to whether or not we've seen AI being used maliciously but it's easy to sort of put that in perspective. So when we consider AI, what it actually does right is a platform that has predetermined values input values and output values. It's a decision-making tool again that provides for efficiency and speed of transactions. One of the concerns is when we're looking at the information especially the possibility of manipulation of integrity, the whole concept of garbage in garbage out. Then we can see how the platforms, the AI platforms, could potentially yield bad decisions based on bad information coming in. So although the AI itself might be compromised, though that is a possibility, the easiest example is compromising the information on which the AI relies so that the output is bad. PB: Another example might be so-called deepfakes. Really trying to use sophisticated new technologies to create a disinformation campaign. So if you think of the two most common forms of threat: spearfishing [and] social engineering. Obviously, AI can leverage spearfishing at a much greater scale, with brute force password testing and the like.On the social engineering side, if you just take a simple example you can mimic people's voices. Now in such a way that you can track the language specifically that they're using. So the CEO is deemed to leave a voicemail for example that literally uses the CEO's language, taken from public statements for example and it's left on the CFOs voicemail to wire a certain volume of funds or something along those lines. They're just that kind of basic disinformation campaign can get extended more broadly. JK: So you're talking about deepfakes being used on a smaller scale, to potentially disrupt a business. PB: The other place we wanted to go was briefly on the CIA triad. The C is confidentiality. I is integrity. A is availability. And so confidentiality we have clearly seen myriad examples of the breaches in which confidential data then becomes public. Availability. We've seen myriad examples of that now where malware like Petya is essentially a form of a ransomware attack and the availability of your systems is just shut down. The place that we are seeing increasing and potentially potent examples is in this integrity area. Take the operation of a nuclear facility, for example, there obviously temperature controls on that nuclear facility and if you can start using AI and machine learning to penetrate the defenses and simply manipulate the temperature gauge on the cooling systems, all of a sudden you can set into course a series of events that could be quite destructive. The hackers are quite astute at the second step of this, which is their obviously override systems and safety shut off systems and they use software, again the software the names are instructive, Crash Override for example, where they basically figured out how to disable the safety or shut off valve system \u2014 and those are examples in the Middle East. There have been concrete examples where hackers have penetrated the electrical operations of a large energy company and done precisely \u2014 that manipulated the controls and then manipulated the shut off systems. JK: Are those live threats? AM: What Peter has described is absolutely possible. In the example of the nuclear attack facility, depending on the network configuration and how it's designed, you may have that risk of an attack from the outside. But that is absolutely certainly possible from an insider threat perspective as well. PB: Do you think the insider threat is greater or the outsider threat? What do you see at the Bureau? AM: We're obviously more engaged on attacks that are being perpetrated by outsiders from any one of the typical bad cyber actors, from the nation states all the way down to the hacktivists. But we are very concerned about the insider threat as well, especially when we pause to consider some of the things that the insider can be responsible for. From a business perspective, the insider whether that insider is acting intentionally or unintentionally, can be responsible for the theft of intellectual property or trade secrets, can be responsible for economic espionage or even just internal fraud, which creates a slew of issues for the company. DB: If you think of something like the NSA, you know the big breaches of data at the NSA. How many had been caused by insiders and how many have been caused by outsiders? And so there really is a divergence of views in the space about where the greatest threat is. One of the things that we're intrigued by is using external data feeds to try to assess the company's vulnerability. So for example if your Glassdoor rating is quite poor, the workforce views the management in quite a negative light. That is an indicator that the insider threat at that institution is greater than it a place where the institution happens to be well-regarded by the workforce. So there are a lot of these data inputs that can essentially drive the strategies that you try to develop.AM: I mean with the NSA it was good to point out to the very thing you mentioned that some of the most significant data breaches that we've seen at least from the government perspective is a lot of these insider threats whether it's the Edward Snowden types of the world that have taken really highly sensitive information and you know from the inside and it published it out. So that's why it's considered from the government perspective and the national security perspective. A very significant threat but also from the corporate perspective a significant threat as well. JK: If we could jump back to the data harvested by internet connected devices and how that will be further enhanced by 5G. I wonder if you could just talk to that a little bit more. AM: There are estimates out there that say by the end of 2019, we'll have 500 zettabytes [thanks to the Internet of Things] per year. So that is a ton of information. We can see how the increase in the information is going to be exponential as opposed to linear. So 500 zettabytes this year is going to be who knows what in three years from now. And that becomes an extremely difficult problem to solve when we're discussing huge amounts of information. The warehouse example that we used in terms of efficient movement of the various components in your supply chain, that's going to add value if we can eliminate wasted time or loss of product. But we need to sort of use the AI and conduct a deep technical analysis that I mentioned to extract those bits of information. So then the next question becomes how is AI going to help us analyze that information. So AI going to be very valuable in that respect. PB: One other way to think about it is where are the areas that public and private partnership is working most effectively. I'd say big picture its financial services, defense, industrial base, and really the telecom providers, and as 5G becomes more pervasive, and really the new standard, the role of the telecom providers and other infrastructure, their role and the importance of a collaborative and effective working relationship with the Bureau with the Department of Homeland Security with various government agencies obviously is going to increase markedly. JK: There are very serious conversations going on America and across the world indeed about how Huawei contributes to 5G networks. The technical infrastructure that goes into creating 5G networks, how careful do governments have to be about who is contributing to that infrastructure? AM: So I'm not going to touch on it as it relates to Huawei, so there's no comment with regard to what they're doing with regard to establishing the infrastructure in many countries across the globe some on which the 5G will ride on. I think though the question about how careful governments need to be with regards to their technical infrastructure is a fair question and my answer to that would be they absolutely need to be very critical about what that technical infrastructure is going to look like because not only do their citizens rely on it to communicate, their corporations to conduct business, but also for the government to function. So when we look at it from that perspective and when we acknowledge the risks associated with that type of technology, I think it's incumbent upon all governments or peoples or corporations to be really cognizant of what the technical infrastructure looks like, what the security mechanisms are associated with, and whether or not reasonable considerations and decisions are being made with regard to who is going to provide that. JK: It's very much on the record that the US does not want Chinese involvement in the 5G infrastructure because of concerns over spying. The US government is being very bullish about this at the moment. AM: I would refer you to the comments made by the director [Christopher Wray]. So I don't know that I can say anything different. I agree with what the director has said but for a specific response, I'd refer you to director Wray's comments.PB: And then just going in a slightly different direction. You know we're talking about the infrastructure of the internet. There obviously are infrastructures to a whole array of critical services that are vulnerable. The article that we wrote on the water supply system[5] for example obviously the electric grid and the like. And what's quite fascinating is really how the public and private intersect in those roles. What's the percentage of that infrastructure that is really owned or managed by the private sector and in the US it's quite high in other countries around the world, that percentage is really markedly different. And so part of I think what Ari and the Bureau are doing so effectively is being this engaging actor, as opposed to the traditional law enforcement role. Of really having a significant part of their mandate be reaching out into the business community. JK: When you're doing press events and you're speaking at conferences is that something you have in mind, Ari? AM: Absolutely. And I don't know that I could have found a better partner in that Peter Beshar because Peter is a big advocate a proponent of not only helping the FBI but really trying to change behavior in corporate America and understanding the value that engaging with law enforcement brings to the table and particularly engaging with law enforcement prior to an actual bad event. PB: Just one other quick thought on the US versus Europe on this point. So 85% of critical infrastructure is owned and operated by the private sector in the US. Ari and others have I think made really significant strides in trying to lessen the chasm that can exist between government and industry. If you go to your side of the Atlantic [in Europe], there's obviously a much more profound sense of the importance of privacy, that privacy is a fundamental human right. I don't know the percentage of critical infrastructure in Europe, for example, is owned and operated by the private sector. But if there is this more uneasy relationship between government and industry in Europe, it will potentially complicate the process of figuring out how to share threat intelligence in a credible way and really learn from the latest forms of attack so that the collective security of the continent is stronger. JK: Does Brexit worry you in that regard that the UK might be a bit more cut off in terms of sharing intelligence? PB: Brexit worries us on multiple fronts. Cyber is perhaps not the highest of them JK: There's been a lot of talk about encryption recently and many companies are looking at increasing encryption and making sure that messages remain private between different users. Is that something you consider a good thing? AM: My position with regard to encryption hasn't changed over the years. Personally and professionally, we in the FBI are in favor of encryption. We have never said we are not in favor of encryption. It is good. It becomes an issue when we now think of privacy and security related issues and whether or not law enforcement can do its job in terms of conducting a thorough investigation. So for every device where access is limited due to encryption, though despite a lawful order to gain access to that device as evidence in a crime, that potentially represents a victim who may not see justice. And so there is a conversation to be had by legislators and by corporate America to figure out what the right balance is between privacy and security. So in short, encryption is good. But there is a conversation that needs to take place between the two competing interests to find that proper balance. JK: That conversation is ongoing I presume? It's a big issue, isn't it? It's a topic that is only going get more complicated as technology advances. AM: Absolutely. That conversation has been and continues to be ongoing at the very most senior levels of the FBI. Engaging with their counterparts in private industry. PB: One way to think about it is that there are three strategies that a lot of experts believe companies and others should be pursuing. Encryption is one, within that there's encryption at rest and encryption in transit. The second one is multi-factor authentication, not just a single password but something else. The third is the patching of known software vulnerabilities. So the authority the New York Department of Financial Services in New York State, for example, really put out a landmark piece of legislation essentially directing people to either embrace encryption or to be able to articulate very clearly an annual certification \u2014 why you're not able to meet encryption by particular timetables. And so the notion that we are clearly moving towards a world where encryption will become more pervasive, governments will be more emphatic about requiring it of industry for example and perhaps of themselves. JK: Where do you come down on the debate that encryption means it's harder for the security services and law enforcement to get access to evidence which can help bring people to justice? PB: And I just don't have a view on it, it's really a law enforcement issue. There is a balance between privacy and security. What I'm struck by is that the balance in Europe clearly has been towards privacy when the GDPR went into effect in May of 2018. There was a lot of criticism in the United States about Europe's over-emphasis, alleged overemphasis on privacy, and what I think you've seen really in the 10 or 12 months since the GDPR became effective is that the sky didn't fall in Europe and that the focus on privacy in the US has become markedly stronger. The new California law that will take effect in 2020 is a manifestation or a mini GDPR. JK: The big tech companies announcing that they would welcome federal privacy regulation - is that something you have a view on? PB: As the general counsel of a large company, I would say that right now I think there are over 50 different breach notification regulatory regimes in the United States, there are 47 states that have their own rules, there are counties and municipalities that then layer on their own systems on top of that. That's obviously a very complex patchwork of rules and regulations that companies and others are trying to honor. Were there to be some sort of a more consistent federal system that everybody could agree, that would probably bring greater consistency and order to the process.JK: Do you think that the advent of 5G is going to make the US and other countries more vulnerable to cyber attack? AM: Yeah. I mean if we look at it very simply with regard to the attack surface. If we go from 20 billion to 30 billion devices that attack surface increases by 10 billion devices. Each one of those devices that are not properly secured because manufacturers are concerned with trying to market as opposed to security then that creates a broader landscape. One of the things to keep an eye out for is not only IoT devices in the classic sense but the operational technology devices that are going to be tied into you know more significant manufacturing processes or system processes building management systems, things like that. PB: We're engaged in a race without a finish line. And every year that you've been covering this space, that Ari and I have been working in this space, 12 months later has been worse. With the advent of these significant new technologies, 5G and AI, clearly malicious actors are going to be weaponizing those tools, just as benevolent actors are trying to utilize them to enhance our collective defenses. And so whatever has been the range or the ambit of potential damage that people think is credible it just seems year on year that that grows in significance. It is not at all fanciful to say that significant disruption in society, damages in the tens of billions of dollars are all credible outcomes of the next several years as the threat intensifies. Cyber is a unique threat that poses a threat to both government and industry. Both sectors have been breached repeatedly. Neither one of us is immune. And so just uniquely in our recent history this is a threat that to be confronted credibly requires a greater degree of collaboration between government and industry than we've seen before.NOW WATCH: We unboxed the $1,980 Samsung Galaxy Fold \u2014 here's what comes inside[6]See Also: This tech CEO has sold 6 startups for a combined $500 million.

Jit Ray Chowdhury noticed purple spots on all his photographs after taking a photo of a lidar laser scanning system displayed by San Francisco firm AEye. </p><p>He says the $1,198 (930) Sony camera was one month old and the firm has offered to buy him a replacement. AEye said its system is not harmful to human eyes. [] AEye did not respond to the BBC's request for comment butin a statement to Ars Technica[2], chief executive Luis Dussan said: 'Cameras are up to 1,000 times more sensitive to lasers than eyeballs Occasionally, this can cause thermal damage to a camera's focal-plane array.' Mr. Chowdhury said he was happy with the firm's response but he thought a warning should have been issued at the stand. 'I have personally tested many lidar systems and taken pictures up close and [they] did not harm my camera,' he said. 'Lidar companies should test how camera-safe they are.' Lidar works in a similar way to radar and sonar, using lasers rather than radio or soundwaves, explained Zeina Nazer, a postgraduate researcher at the University of Southampton specialising in driverless car technology. 'Powerful lasers can damage cameras,' she said. 'Camera sensors are, in general, more susceptible to damage than the human eye from lasers. Consumers are usually warned never to point a camera directly at laser emitters during a laser show.' SOURCE: BBC[3]BOING BOING also covered the story, stating[4]:CES-goer says his camera was killed by a self-driving car's LIDAR [] LIDAR systems need to comply with rigorous safety rules to ensure that they don't blind human eyes, but camera eyes are much more sensitive (this is the basis forIR-reflective materials that confuse CCTVs[5]). Self-driving cars use both conventional cameras and LIDAR to guide themselves so any camera-blinding potential in LIDAR systems on autonomous vehicles could wreak havoc with other nearby cars. AEye uses 1550nm lasers. And unfortunately for Chowdhury, cameras are not filled with fluid like human eyes are. That means that high-power 1550nm lasers can easily cause damage to camera sensors even if they don't pose a threat to human eyes. AEye is known for claiming that its lidar units have much longer range than those of competitors. While most lidar makers say their high-end lidars can see 200 or 300 meters, AEye says that its lidar has a range of 1,000 meters. When I talked to AEye CEO Luis Dussan about this claim last month, he said that one factor in AEye's long range is the use of a powerful fiber laser. 'One of the most important things about fiber lasers is that they can be amplified,' Dassan said. 'Very short pulse, huge amount of signal.'<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-shot-2019-01-21-at-12.47.28-PM.png\">https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-shot-2019-01-21-at-12.47.28-PM.png</url> There are a few takeaways that are concerning about all of this.Cameras are replaceableeyes, on the other hand, should hopefully last a lifetime. Cameras get damaged; only people get killed. We are using the wrong kind of math.The kind of math that puts all cameras and all LIDAR into a claim that cameras are 1,000 more sensitive that eyesight makes for good ad copy, but there are many cameras and there are many variables in eyes. There are bumblebee eyes, eyes of one-month old infants, eyes in individuals with cataracts, eyes in people with metal or plastic glasses in close proximity to their eyes. The National Academies of Sciences reported in 2008 that exposure to wireless radio frequencies has not been adequately researched in 20 different categories ranging from effects on children to effects on pregnant women. The claim that all eyes are protected by current safety assumptions as new radar technologies are deployed is questionable.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-shot-2019-01-21-at-12.48.07-PM.png\">https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-shot-2019-01-21-at-12.48.07-PM.png</url> SOURCE: National Academies Press[6]Like the debate concerning wireless smart utility meters, unsubstantiated mathematical claims were made comparing cellphones and smart meters by industry.Put another way, you would have to be exposed to the RF from a smart meter for 375 years to get a dose equivalent to that of one year of 15- minutes-per-day cell phone use. Source: SmartEnergyCC.org[7] The source of the widely promoted smart meter-cellphone comparison quote is a mercenary tobacco scientist playing for both sides. He testifies on behalf of the utilities denying harm from coal dust exposure, and yet he convinces environmentalists seeking to reduce fossil fuel consumption that wireless utility meters are safe, based on his expert opinion, and the prevailing 30-year-old outdated guidelines that cater to industry. 3 - We Are Using the Wrong Adverse Health Indicator Boing Boing's report said, '[U]nfortunately for Chowdhury, cameras are not filled with fluid like human eyes are. That means that high-power 1550nm lasers can easily cause damage to camera sensors even if they don't pose a threat to human eyes.' This claim contradicts the recognition that both the testes and the eyes are more susceptible to heating damage from radiation than other tissue because they are closed systems and cannot thermo-regulate. Hence nature's ingenious design of male anatomy and the widely accepted recommendation that men with reproductive concerns pay attention to heat exposures, as shown here:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-shot-2019-01-21-at-12.48.37-PM.png\">https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-shot-2019-01-21-at-12.48.37-PM.png</url> Hot tubs, laptops, and fevers are among the risks identified for 'the boys,' but this is still based on the idea that it is the temperature that is the critical issue, while ignoring other mechanisms of harmWill We Apply Wisdom to A Smart Future That Has Lost its Coordinates?As a layperson, I don't claim expertise in how the safety guidelines have been established, nor do I know much about cameras.

Many high-intensity LED lights continue to be installed in the name of energy efficiency while ignoring the issues raised by the American Medical Society:The American Medical Association issued awarning[8]in June that high-intensity LED streetlights \u2014 such as those in Seattle, Los Angeles, New York, Houston and elsewhere \u2014 emit unseen blue light that can disturb sleep rhythms and possibly increase the risk of serious health conditions, including cancer and cardiovascular disease. The AMA also cautioned that those light-emitting-diode lights can impair nighttime driving vision. Similar concerns have been raised over the past few years, but theAMA report[9]adds credence to the issue and is likely to prompt cities and states to reevaluate the intensity of LED lights they install. SOURCE: Washington Post[10]      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-shot-2019-01-21-at-12.49.02-PM.pngThe\">https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-shot-2019-01-21-at-12.49.02-PM.pngThe</url> rapid deployment of new technologies is being justified by an outdated theory that only temperature matters. The disruption of melatonin levels and circadian clocks do not cause the person to develop a temperature (thermal effect) when exposed to high intensity LED lights, yet they cause harm. As society examines the potential of altering the technologies underlying transportation, we should look closely at where we are headed and why. As reported by Smart Cities Dive, transportation experts are also raising the alarm on autonomous vehicles for other reasons.A report, 'Critical Issues in Transportation 2019[11],' by the Transportation Research Board (TRB), a program within the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM), said while the growth of autonomous vehicles (AVs), electrification and connectivity presents great economic opportunities, growth must be managed effectively. If not, congestion and vehicle miles traveled (VMT) could increase tremendously. 'There's a very good likelihood that as these vehicles get automated they will continue to be individually owned and not part of a pooling service or a mobility service,' Dan Sperling, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of California at Davis, told reporters at a press conference. 'If that happens, we really have a transportation disaster, because you will have automated vehicles and people will be in those vehicles a lot more. Our VMT will double.' [] 'Cities have been involved in AV tests and have been adding infrastructure to enhance connectivity, but much of the advancement is in the hands of automakers and startups who are pioneering the technology.' SOURCE: Smart Cities Dive[12]2 - There is Nothing Perfect About a Perfect Storm That is Ignored Sometimes, while driving, I am momentarily blinded by the sunset bouncing off of my rear view mirror, or when driving east into a sunrise. This is akin to an issue where concave EnergyStar windows caused another homeowner's aluminum siding to melt, described as a perfect storm. If we keep testing technologies like the new 5G telecommunications infrastructure or wireless utility meters in an artificial environment devoid of tree cover, bees, and babies, and base our studies on limited variables and only one exposure at a time, we can't apply what we observe to real world situations. This error is compounded when we ignore reports of harm. This is where we are now in history, as portrayed in the many examples of Late Lessons from Early Warnings. 3 - Elaine Hertzberg Died Because We are Experimenting For me, one of the most compelling reasons to rein in the unbridled experimentation with LIDAR-driven cars is the case of Elaine Herzberg. She is the pedestrian who was killed by a self-driving car[13] in Arizona in 2018.The report says that the Uber vehicle, a modified Volvo XC90 SUV, had been in autonomous mode for 19 minutes and was driving at about 40 mph when ithit 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg[14]as she was walking her bike across the street. The car's radar and lidar sensors detected Herzberg about six seconds before the crash\u2014first identifying her as an unknown object, then as a vehicle, and then as a bicycle, each time adjusting its expectations for her path of travel. About a second before impact, the report says 'the self-driving system determined that an emergency braking maneuver was needed to mitigate a collision.' Uber, however, does not allow its system to make emergency braking maneuvers on its own. Rather than risk 'erratic vehicle behavior'\u2014like slamming on the brakes or swerving to avoid a plastic bag\u2014Uber relies on its human operator to watch the road and take control when trouble arises. [] These details of the fatal crash point to at least two serious flaws in Uber's self-driving system: software that's not yet ready to replace humans, and humans that are ill-equipped to keep their would-be replacements from doing harm. SOURCE: Wired[15]We can't ask Elaine if the car's LIDAR interfered with her vision before the accident, because she died in the accident. But we have citizens reporting harm to their eyes and skin from encounters with the invisible rays invading their neighborhoods. If the last thing that Elaine saw was a vehicle barreling towards her that was not smart or intelligent enough to stop, created by a humanity that is not intelligent enough to stop and heed the early warnings, then we are all the Elaine Herzbergs.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-shot-2019-01-21-at-12.53.11-PM.pngArtwork\">https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-shot-2019-01-21-at-12.53.11-PM.pngArtwork</url> courtesy Floris Fleshman After WWII, human experimentation without knowledge or consent was prohibited by international law, for good reason. It is time to rein in the ambition fueling big tech's involuntary testbeds, including smart meters, 5G telecommunications, and autonomous vehicles, in favor of precaution and informed consent. As the late Carl Sagan noted,We've arranged a society on science and technology in which nobody understands anything about science and technology, andthis combustible mixture of ignorance and power sooner or later is going to blow up in our faces.I mean, who is running the science and technology in a democracy if the people don't know anything about it.Resources:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.americansforresponsibletech.org\">https://www.americansforresponsibletech.org</url>/[16]       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://mdsafetech.org\">https://mdsafetech.org</url>/[17] Patricia Burke works with activists across the country and internationally calling for new biologically-based microwave radio frequency exposure limits.

Here's a sci-fi scenario for 2030, courtesy of the McKinsey consultancy: You're using your mapping app when your digital personal assistant warns you that your planned route entails a high likelihood of accidents and auto damage. The assistant then offers a small reduction on your motor vehicle and life insurance premiums if you take its suggested route instead.</p><p>AI has already begun making its way into every aspect of the insurance business, including claims processing, fraud detection, risk management, marketing, underwriting, rate setting, and pricing. The potential for creating business efficiencies is enormous: Juniper Research predicts that cost savings to the insurance industry from AI will reach $2.3 billion by 2024.</p><p>AI leverages big data to find correlations, inferences, and predictions, and to make recommendations on that basis. But this cutting-edge technology may prove to be a double-edged sword. \"These systems are built through the harvesting of personal information from millions of people and are used to make decisions affecting millions more,\" says Laura Foggan, a Crowell &amp; Moring partner and chair of the firm's Insurance/ Reinsurance Group. \"They're exciting new business tools, but they also pose liability issues under existing laws and regulations. In addition, state and federal officials are considering new laws and regulations that are specific to AI systems.\"</p><p>DATA, DATA EVERYWHERE</p><p>More insurers today are mulling the use of \"nontraditional\" sources when assessing premium rates--sources that go beyond public or official filings. These include social media postings and data from sensors that can increasingly be found</p><p>in our smartphones, vehicles, wearables, and elsewhere. Real-time collection of individualized data from these sensors opens the door for behavior-based policy pricing. The data mining and predictive modeling capacities of AI systems provide a way to turn the billions of data points provided from nontraditional sources into more detailed and objective risk assessments. Some customers will gladly provide personal information in exchange for savings on their premiums.</p><p>AI systems can also vastly improve insurers' ability to detect fraud. Advanced predictive modeling can generate red flags during the claims intake process, routing suspect claims to investigation while proper claims are paid more expeditiously. But these new capabilities also come with new risks, Foggan warns:</p><p>* Privacy and security. Big Tech platforms have been plagued by high-profile controversies over the improper or disquieting use of data about their members, sometimes by unknown third parties. Insurers need to ensure they are complying with all laws respecting privacy and data security and maintaining trust with their customers.</p><p>* Proxy discrimination. Even if they do not recognize protected classes such as race or religion, AI algorithms could seize on \"proxy\" criteria (such as ZIP codes or even social media habits) that are historically or commonly associated with people in these classes. If the resulting decisions have a disparate impact on protected classes, they could pose a liability risk. Some scholarly research suggests that AI algorithms are especially susceptible to proxy discrimination. \"Going forward, almost any use of predictive algorithms that harms a definable group of consumers could, in theory, spark a class action lawsuit,\" Foggan says.</p><p>* Transparency. When an AI-based system makes a decision to deny a claim or hike a premium, customers will want an explanation. But algorithmic reasoning can be hard to fathom; third-party suppliers of algorithms may claim their inner workings are proprietary.

When an AI-based system makes a decision to deny a claim or hike a premium, customers will want an explanation. But algorithmic reasoning can be hard to fathom; third-party suppliers of algorithms may claim their inner workings are proprietary. When an algorithm manifests as a \"black box,\" many may feel skeptical about the results. For example, an AI system could find a powerful correlation between a given characteristic and a risk of fraud, but unless an insurer can demonstrate a causal relationship, the resulting decision may be challenged as discriminatory.</p><p>REGULATIONS AHEAD</p><p>\"Insurers should prepare for increased legislation and regulation in the use of data fueling AI in decision making,\" says Kelly Tsai, senior counsel at Crowell &amp; Moring and a member of the firms Insurance/Reinsurance Group. Today, the European Union is at the cutting edge of AI regulation due to a (nonbinding) provision of the General Data Protection Regulation, Recital 71. This says that individuals should have the right not to be subject to AI evaluations of personal characteristics that automatically result in a determination with legal impact, unless expressly authorized by law. It also mandates safeguards on such evaluations aimed at preserving due process and reducing discrimination.</p><p>Meanwhile, many voices are expressing support for individuals to have a \"right to an explanation\" of how algorithms are used in decisions. A British regulator, the Information Commissioner's Office, has released draff guidance aiming to help organizations explain AI decisions about individuals. With the right to an explanation becoming a regulatory battleground in Europe and elsewhere, \"insurers and others using AI should be thinking about whether and how Al-based decisions can be explained to those who are affected,\" Foggan says. They should also begin thinking about how to respond to proposals for regulatory requirements of an explanation, she adds.</p><p>In the U.S., various industry-specific consumer protection laws such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Fair Housing Act already apply to the collection and use of personal information. Other federal and state laws and regulations address the use of personal information in specific contexts, such as cybersecurity and medical information. Meanwhile, regulators and legislatures are starting to venture into more AI-specific domains.</p><p>For example, last year, New York became the first state to issue guidance on the use of external consumer data in underwriting for life insurance. Insurance Circular Letter No. 1 (2019) warns that some algorithms and models \"may either lack a sufficient rationale or actuarial basis and may also have a strong potential to have a disparate impact\" on protected classes. It warns insurers that they \"may not use an external data source [or vendor or algorithm] to collect or use information that ... they would be prohibited from collecting directly.\" Nor could they rely on \"the proprietary nature of a third-party vendor's algorithmic processes to justify the lack of specificity related to an adverse underwriting action.\"</p><p>Last July, New York formed a commission to investigate and study regulations on AI, robotics, and automation. The commission will investigate privacy, safety, and other legal issues in the use of these emerging technologies in the business, nonprofit, academic, and governmental sectors. Other states could soon follow New York's lead. In addition, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners has formed an AI Working Group that is charged with developing regulatory guidance for presentation to its Innovation and Technology Task Force by NAIC's 2020 Summer Meeting. Model laws or regulations proposed by NAIC are often widely adopted by states.</p><p>At the federal level, two Democratic senators introduced the Algorithmic Accountability Act last April, which would require entities to ensure that their algorithmic decision systems don't expose consumers to unfair bias, inaccuracies, or privacy and security risk. Some entities would be required to produce studies of how their systems' design and training could pose risks. If the Federal Trade Commission deemed a company's decision systems as high-risk, that company would be required to provide a cost-benefit analysis and a risk minimization plan.</p><p>The bill would encompass AI tools that are used in many industries, such as facial recognition, chatbots, recruiting tools, ad targeting, and credit calculations. While this bill--and a parallel House bill--has not yet advanced beyond committee, it offers an early indication of the kind of scrutiny that algorithmic modeling may come under in 2020 and beyond. Indeed, insurers need to start thinking about AI's impact not only on them but also on their policyholders, notes Foggan. Many policyholders are already using AI in their daily operations, thereby incurring risks such as discrimination suits that could result in losses.</p><p>As promising as AI and cognitive systems may be for their industry, insurers must take care when determining what kind of information could be used in underwriting algorithms, and be willing and able to look under the hood of new technologies. When deciding when or how to adopt new technologies, they must factor in potential liabilities related to privacy, security, discrimination, or transparency.</p><p>Excerpted from the Cromwell Moring Regulatory Forecast 2020: What Corporate Counsel Need to Know for the Coming Year, Co-edited by Dan Wolff and David Stepp</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASAPII-622556048</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP 622556048</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YTY-CDT1-JCBJ-K0YX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">140610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1844\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 CINN Group, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Insurance Advocate</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 0020-4587</issn><volume>Vol. 131</volume><issueNumber>No. 4\"</issueNumber><aggregationName>ASAP</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 20, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Other, Magazine/Journal</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.product\"><classificationItem><className>Artificial Intelligence Systems</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Life Insurance</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Claims Adjusters</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Insurance</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Artificial intelligence</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Claims adjustment (Insurance)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Insurance claims adjustment</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Insurance fraud</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Life insurance</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>State laws</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

AI's 'trendiness' is not difficult to understand either. One decade ago, most scientists were just working in their labs, improving the technology in such a way that it could be applied to some practical outputs. </p><p>As we enter 2019, we have now a technology in our hands and pockets, capable of voice recognition, synthesised voices, fake imagery using augmented reality[1], driverless trains and cars AI is now part of our daily lives, even if we don't recognise it as such. Just think about google assisted email-writing Smart Compose, that anticipates your sentences. That is AI, facilitated by machine learning! AI's quick evolution, has now brought to the table a whole array of new issues, that were not considered in detail previously, particularly in terms of ethics. It has awakened as well the proverbial anxiety of man versus the machine. Is the machine helping women and men, or is it a rival ? Inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil, wrote precisely about that in his book from 2005 'The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology'. The book tackled the relationship between artificial intelligence and the future of humanity, and according to Ray, in 2029 AI will have reached the intelligence of an adult human. The Singularity is Near (2005) Ray Kurzweil We only learn by doing, so its when AI goes 'practical' that we see what problems it brings. Last year, in the aftermath of scandals like Cambridge Analytica and others, important issues concerning ethics and AI came to the forefront. People became more aware of the dangers of AI if not clearly regulated, and big tech companies were pressured to take a stand in terms of its ethics, in a number of projects. In a recent article from Wired[2], some of those projects are outlined. One example is Project Maven[3], that led thousands of Google employees protesting the renewal of the contract with this Pentagon AI Project. The project enables algorithms that help war fighters identify potential ISIS targets in video from drones. Google stated its technology had 'nonoffensive' uses, but after the protest of more than 4,500 employees, the company decided not only to withdraw the renewal of the contract (which finishes in 2019, so lets see if that happens) but also to write a clear set of principles about its use of AI[4]. Play Video[5]Supposedly Google's guidelines clearly state how the company is not creating systems that reinforce societal biases on gender, race, or sexual orientation, or AI systems for use in weapons or 'other technologies whose principal purpose or implementation is to cause or directly facilitate injury to people:. If these will be followed or not, that is what is yet to be seen. Plus, it is important to realise that Google is able to venture into machine learning and complex AI because of the billions of data they are constantly gathering from all of us its users. That data is privately owned by the company, which is questionable, and in itself another ethical question. Not only Google but also Facebook is becoming more aware of the ethical implications of their work with AI. Joaquin Candela, Facebook's director of applied machine learning, said earlier this year, speaking about some AI applications: 'I started to become very conscious about our potential blind spots.' Facebook has created recently a group to work on making AI technology ethical and fair. One of its projects is a tool called Fairness Flow[6] that helps engineers check how their code performs for different demographic groups, say men and women. Facial recognition is also another AI area where lots of concerns have been raised, and all kinds of biases discovered, particularly with how it operates with darker faces. So this has been an area of AI where tech companies have really focused on setting up boundaries. To better deal with the huge problems AI brings the world, tech companies made an industry consortium entitled Partnership on AI[7], that aims to work on the ethics and societal impact of the technology. The consortium joins together companies, academics, scholars and researchers. Partnership on AI. Screenshot of website. Even if this is a good and important step, unfortunately, we have to be aware that in bog companies, the wish to secure contracts, surpasses ethical concerns lots of times. Recently, Microsoft, announced a contract with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, that had the goal of helping the agency deploy AI and facial recognition[8]. Microsoft's employees protested but the project moved forward. As AI evolves at rapid space it is expected that in 2019 even more ethics questions will arise. It is up to all of us, to be aware of what is going on and take conscious action, so we make it work in a way that is ethical and fair.

The areas might surprise you, particularly if you were predicting swarms of killer robots fighting a war in the early 2020s. What might also surprise you is the number of uses, and the speed at which they're likely to occur. Artificial intelligence is less and more than the public debate says. Put simply, it refers to computer systems performing tasks that normally require human intelligence[1], such as decision-making, translation, pattern recognition and speech recognition.Early applications of AI are likely to involve things like optimising supply chains, helping digest data in jobs like visa processing, doing cyber defence against AI-enabled attackers\u2014and helping strategic leaders and operational commanders make sense of confused but data-rich operational environments. </p><p>Closer to those killer robots are applications that might provide the edge to advanced missiles in the last stages of an attack, as well as countermeasures to systems like hypersonic weapons. So, why are these particular areas likely first adopters of AI? One simple answer is because Australian agencies are already using AI to some extent\u2014with a human decision-maker in the loop at one or more stages. A bigger reason is that the 'business processes' in national security agencies are similar to processes in companies that are already big users of AI. Two other drivers for adopting AI are the availability of large datasets for analysis and a need to make quick decisions. If one of those drivers applies to an activity, it can make AI a sensible solution. If both apply, it's a likely AI sweet spot, where the gains or capability advantages could be large. The big tech companies already use AI across their businesses; Google is an obvious example[2]. Big resource companies are also early adopters\u2014with driverless mining trucks and trains. Logistics and supply-chain optimisation may sound mundane, but they're valuable areas to apply AI. That's because modern systems are prolific generators of data that can increase efficiency and reliability. Simple examples are condition monitoring of systems on board navy ships, and predictive ordering of spares, weapons, fuel and food. AI tools can be trained on the data that the Department of Defence and its major contractors produce, with human decision-makers validating AI judgements and improving the algorithms. Cybersecurity is another no-brainer for AI\u2014because cyber is the land of large data and there's already a problem with relying on people to process it. Moves towards widespread connection to the internet of devices and machinery other than computers and smartphones\u2014as is happening with new 5G networks\u2014make it essential for cybersecurity systems to be able to scale up to handle massive datasets and do so at machine speed. AI will empower human cyber-defenders (and cyber-attackers) to manage the enormous expansion of the attack surface brought about by 5G and the internet of things. But let's get closer to the battlefront. Why won't AI give us killer robots now? Well, the good news is that, outside the hothouse innovation-driver of war, even adversaries who might have few reservations about gaining the operational advantage have similar practical concerns to those who\u2014like our military and broader national security community\u2014pay close attention to their obligations under domestic and international humanitarian law. The key concerns are about trust. Fully autonomous systems using machine learning can be fast but dumb, or, more politely, smart but flawed. During the Cold War, the computer said launch, but it was overridden by humans who suspected something wasn't right\u2014and we're here because of those human judgements. Recent examples of self-driving cars crashing and killing people are further demonstrations of the fragility of and flaws in current fully autonomous systems. National-security and military decision-makers are unlikely to send off the first AI-driven autonomous lethal robot, mainly because they fear loss of control and the potential blowback from doing something risky\u2014with that 'thing' maybe killing their own forces or civilians who are in the way. So, human-in-the-loop or human-on-the-loop approaches are likely to be core to AI in national security: both mean that critical decisions are made by people, not machines. Secretary of Home Affairs Mike Pezzullo calls this the 'golden rule'[3] for AI in national security. History tells us that deciding and acting faster on better information than your adversary are key to success. AI can help commanders make sense of confused and rich data feeds from networked sensors on ships, in aircraft, on land vehicles, and now on individual soldiers and unmanned systems. AI can also help advanced missiles hit their targets. A number of anti-ship, anti-aircraft and air-to-ground missiles already have active seekers and pre-programmed countermeasures that work against defensive systems. AI-enabled missiles, though, will be able to make decisions on data gathered in flight about the actual countermeasures and defences on the target ship, aircraft, ground formation or base. The rapid data processing of AI could increase the hit rate and damage. Use against specific military targets avoids the autonomous killer robot problem. Just as in cybersecurity, AI on the battlefield will be part of the classic tango of measure and countermeasure, with the balance constantly shifting between aggressor and defender. This sketch about AI in national security shows one clear thing: it's real and it's already happening faster than most realise. Many applications won't elicit hyped-up commentary about the next war, but they are nonetheless powerful and likely to be widespread. That brings us to Australia's chief scientist, Alan Finkel[4], and some of the people at the ASPI event. Given the speed of development of AI, urgent work is required to establish the ethical and legal frameworks that AI developers must use for applications involving decisions about humans. That work is for policymakers, legal advisers and ethicists, in consultation with the technologists. I'd argue that our chief scientist should get on with leading AI development, with ethicists doing the ethics. Both types of work must be done now if they're to guide our future uses of machine-enabled or even machine-made decisions. Let's not leave it to others to develop AI. And let's not leave it to AI to decide how we use AI\u2014that is a job for us humans.

Since then, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have advanced even further, and their transformative impact is increasingly evident across industries. AI-powered machines are tailoring recommendations of digital content to individual tastes and preferences, designing clothing lines for fashion retailers, and even beginning to surpass experienced doctors in detecting signs of cancer. For global banking, McKinsey estimates that AI technologies could potentially deliver up to $1 trillion of additional value each year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Many banks, however, have struggled to move from experimentation around select use cases to scaling AI technologies across the organization. Reasons include the lack of a clear strategy for AI, an inflexible and investment-starved technology core, fragmented data assets, and outmoded operating models that hamper collaboration between business and technology teams. What is more, several trends in digital engagement have accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic, and big-tech companies are looking to enter financial services as the next adjacency. To compete successfully and thrive, incumbent banks must become \"AI-first\" institutions, adopting AI technologies as the foundation for new value propositions and distinctive customer experiences.</p><p>In this article, we propose answers to four questions that can help leaders articulate a clear vision and develop a road map for becoming an AI-first bank:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Why must banks become AI-first?</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>What might the AI-bank of the future look like?</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>What obstacles prevent banks from deploying AI capabilities at scale?</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>How can banks transform to become AI-first?</p></bodyText></listItem></list><h>1. Why must banks become AI-first?</h><p>Over several decades, banks have continually adapted the latest technology innovations to redefine how customers interact with them. Banks introduced ATMs in the 1960s and electronic, card-based payments in the '70s. The 2000s saw broad adoption of 24/7 online banking, followed by the spread of mobile-based \"banking on the go\" in the 2010s.</p><p>Few would disagree that we're now in the AI-powered digital age, facilitated by falling costs for data storage and processing, increasing access and connectivity for all, and rapid advances in AI technologies. These technologies can lead to higher automation and, when deployed after controlling for risks, can often improve upon human decision making in terms of both speed and accuracy. The potential for value creation is one of the largest across industries, as AI can potentially unlock $1 trillion of incremental value for banks, annually (Exhibit 1).</p><h>Exhibit</h><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Financial Services/Our Insights/AI bank of the future Can banks meet the AI challenge/png-ai-bank-of-the-future-exhibit-1-v3.png\"> Link to Image </url></p><p>Across more than 25 use cases, AI technologies can help <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">boost revenues</emphasis> through increased personalization of services to customers (and employees); <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">lower costs</emphasis> through efficiencies generated by higher automation, reduced errors rates, and better resource utilization; and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">uncover new and previously unrealized opportunities</emphasis> based on an improved ability to process and generate insights from vast troves of data.</p><p>More broadly, disruptive AI technologies can dramatically improve banks' ability to achieve four key outcomes: higher profits, at-scale personalization, distinctive omnichannel experiences, and rapid innovation cycles. Banks that fail to make AI central to their core strategy and operations-what we refer to as becoming \"AI-first\"-will risk being overtaken by competition and deserted by their customers. This risk is further accentuated by four current trends:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Rising customer expectations as adoption of digital banking increases.</emphasis> In the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic, use of online and mobile banking channels across countries has increased by an estimated 20 to 50 percent and is expected to continue at this higher level once the pandemic subsides. Across diverse global markets, between 15 and 45 percent of consumers expect to cut back on branch visits following the end of the crisis. As consumers increase their use of digital banking services, they grow to expect more, particularly when compared to the standards they are accustomed to from leading consumer-internet companies. Meanwhile, these digital experience leaders continuously raise the bar on personalization, to the point where they sometimes anticipate customer needs before the customer is aware of them, and offer highly-tailored services at the right time, through the right channel.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Leading financial institutions' use of advanced AI technologies is steadily increasing.</emphasis> Nearly 60 percent of financial-services sector respondents in McKinsey's Global AI Survey report that their companies have embedded at least one AI capability. The most commonly used AI technologies are: <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">robotic process automation</emphasis> (36 percent) for structured operational tasks; <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">virtual assistants or conversational interfaces</emphasis> (32 percent ) for customer service divisions; and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">machine learning techniques</emphasis> (25 percent) to detect fraud and support underwriting and risk management. While for many financial services firms, the use of AI is episodic and focused on specific use cases, an increasing number of banking leaders are taking a comprehensive approach to deploying advanced AI, and embedding it across the full lifecycle, from the front- to the back-office (Exhibit 2).</p></bodyText></listItem></list><h>Exhibit</h><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Financial Services/Our Insights/AI bank of the future Can banks meet the AI challenge/PNG-AI-Bank-of-the-future-Exhibit-2.png\"> Link to Image </url></p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Digital ecosystems are disintermediating traditional financial services.</emphasis> By enabling access to a diverse set of services through a common access point, digital ecosystems have transformed the way consumers discover, evaluate, and purchase goods and services. For example, WeChat users in China can use the same app not only to exchange messages, but also to book a cab, order food, schedule a massage, play games, send money to a contact, and access a personal line of credit. Similarly, across countries, nonbanking businesses and \"super apps\" are embedding financial services and products in their journeys, delivering compelling experiences for customers, and disrupting traditional methods for discovering banking products and services. As a result, banks will need to rethink how they participate in digital ecosystems, and use AI to harness the full power of data available from these new sources.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Technology giants are entering financial services as the next adjacency to their core business models.</emphasis> Globally, leading technology giants have built extraordinary market advantages: a large and engaged customer network; troves of data, enabling a robust and increasingly precise understanding of individual customers; natural strengths in developing and scaling innovative technologies (including AI); and access to low-cost capital. In the past, tech giants have aggressively entered into adjacent businesses in search of new revenue streams and to keep customers engaged with a fresh stream of offerings. Big-tech players have already gained a foothold in financial services in select domains (especially in payments and, in some cases, lending and insurance), and they may soon look to press their advantages to deepen their presence and build greater scale.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><h>2. What might the AI-bank of the future look like?</h><p>To meet customers' rising expectations and beat competitive threats in the AI-powered digital era, the AI-first bank will offer propositions and experiences that are <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">intelligent</emphasis> (that is, recommending actions, anticipating and automating key decisions or tasks), <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">personalized</emphasis> (that is, relevant and timely, and based on a detailed understanding of customers' past behavior and context), and truly <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">omnichannel</emphasis> (seamlessly spanning the physical and online contexts across multiple devices, and delivering a consistent experience) and that blend banking capabilities with relevant products and services beyond banking. Exhibit 3 illustrates how such a bank could engage a retail customer throughout the day. Exhibit 4 shows an example of the banking experience of a small-business owner or the treasurer of a medium-size enterprise.</p><h>Exhibit</h><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Financial Services/Our Insights/AI bank of the future Can banks meet the AI challenge/png-ai-bank-of-the-future-exhibit-3-v2.png\"> Link to Image </url></p><h>Exhibit</h><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Financial Services/Our Insights/AI bank of the future Can banks meet the AI challenge/png-ai-bank-of-the-future-exhibit-4-v2.png\"> Link to Image </url></p><p>Internally, the AI-first institution will be optimized for operational efficiency through extreme automation of manual tasks (a \"zero-ops\" mindset) and the replacement or augmentation of human decisions by advanced diagnostic engines in diverse areas of bank operations. These gains in operational performance will flow from broad application of traditional and leading-edge AI technologies, such as machine learning and facial recognition, to analyze large and complex reserves of customer data in (near) real time.</p><p>The AI-first bank of the future will also enjoy the speed and agility that today characterize digital-native companies. It will innovate rapidly, launching new features in days or weeks instead of months. It will collaborate extensively with partners to deliver new value propositions integrated seamlessly across journeys, technology platforms, and data sets.</p><h>3. What obstacles prevent banks from deploying AI capabilities at scale?</h><p>Incumbent banks face two sets of objectives, which on first glance appear to be at odds. On the one hand, banks need to achieve the speed, agility, and flexibility innate to a fintech. On the other, they must continue managing the scale, security standards, and regulatory requirements of a traditional financial-services enterprise.</p><p>Despite billions of dollars spent on change-the-bank technology initiatives each year, few banks have succeeded in diffusing and scaling AI technologies throughout the organization. Among the obstacles hampering banks' efforts, the most common is the lack of a clear strategy for AI. Two additional challenges for many banks are, first, a weak core technology and data backbone and, second, an outmoded operating model and talent strategy.</p><p>Built for stability, banks' core technology systems have performed well, particularly in supporting traditional payments and lending operations. However, banks must resolve several weaknesses inherent to legacy systems before they can deploy AI technologies at scale (Exhibit 5). First and foremost, these systems often lack the capacity and flexibility required to support the variable computing requirements, data-processing needs, and real-time analysis that closed-loop AI applications require. Core systems are also difficult to change, and their maintenance requires significant resources. What is more, many banks' data reserves are fragmented across multiple silos (separate business and technology teams), and analytics efforts are focused narrowly on stand-alone use cases. Without a centralized data backbone, it is practically impossible to analyze the relevant data and generate an intelligent recommendation or offer at the right moment. If data constitute the bank's fundamental raw material, the data must be governed and made available securely in a manner that enables analysis of data from internal and external sources at scale for millions of customers, in (near) real time, at the \"point of decision\" across the organization. Lastly, for various analytics and advanced-AI models to scale, organizations need a robust set of tools and standardized processes to build, test, deploy, and monitor models, in a repeatable and \"industrial\" way.</p><h>Exhibit</h><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Financial Services/Our Insights/AI bank of the future Can banks meet the AI challenge/png-ai-bank-of-the-future-exhibit-5-v2.png\"> Link to Image </url></p><p>Banks' traditional operating models further impede their efforts to meet the need for continuous innovation. Most traditional banks are organized around distinct business lines, with centralized technology and analytics teams structured as cost centers. Business owners define goals unilaterally, and alignment with the enterprise's technology and analytics strategy (where it exists) is often weak or inadequate. Siloed working teams and \"waterfall\" implementation processes invariably lead to delays, cost overruns, and suboptimal performance. Additionally, organizations lack a test-and-learn mindset and robust feedback loops that promote rapid experimentation and iterative improvement. Often unsatisfied with the performance of past projects and experiments, business executives tend to rely on third-party technology providers for critical functionalities, starving capabilities and talent that should ideally be developed in-house to ensure competitive differentiation.</p><h>4. How can banks transform to become AI-first?</h><p>To overcome the challenges that limit organization-wide deployment of AI technologies, banks must take a holistic approach. To become AI-first, banks must invest in transforming capabilities across all four layers of the integrated capability stack (Exhibit 6): the engagement layer, the AI-powered decisioning layer, the core technology and data layer, and the operating model.</p><h>Exhibit</h><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Financial Services/Our Insights/AI bank of the future Can banks meet the AI challenge/png-ai-bank-of-the-future-exhibit-6-v2.png\"> Link to Image </url></p><p>As we will explain, when these interdependent layers work in unison, they enable a bank to provide customers with distinctive omnichannel experiences, support at-scale personalization, and drive the rapid innovation cycles critical to remaining competitive in today's world. Each layer has a unique role to play-under-investment in a single layer creates a weak link that can cripple the entire enterprise.</p><p>The following paragraphs explore some of the changes banks will need to undertake in each layer of this capability stack.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Layer 1: Reimagining the customer engagement layer</emphasis></h><p>Increasingly, customers expect their bank to be present in their end-use journeys, know their context and needs no matter where they interact with the bank, and to enable a frictionless experience. Numerous banking activities (e.g., payments, certain types of lending) are becoming invisible, as journeys often begin and end on interfaces beyond the bank's proprietary platforms. For the bank to be ubiquitous in customers' lives, solving latent and emerging needs while delivering intuitive omnichannel experiences, banks will need to reimagine how they engage with customers and undertake several key shifts.</p><p>First, banks will need to move beyond highly standardized products to create integrated propositions that target \"jobs to be done.\" This requires embedding personalization decisions (what to offer, when to offer, which channel to offer) in the core customer journeys and designing value propositions that go beyond the core banking product and include intelligence that automates decisions and activities on behalf of the customer. Further, banks should strive to integrate relevant non-banking products and services that, together with the core banking product, comprehensively address the customer end need. An illustration of the \"jobs-to-be-done\" approach can be seen in the way fintech Tally helps customers grapple with the challenge of managing multiple credit cards. The fintech's customers can solve several pain points-including decisions about which card to pay first (tailored to the forecast of their monthly income and expenses), when to pay, and how much to pay (minimum balance versus retiring principal)-a complex set of tasks that are often not done well by customers themselves.</p><p>The second necessary shift is to embed customer journeys seamlessly in partner ecosystems and platforms, so that banks engage customers at the point of end use and in the process take advantage of partners' data and channel platform to increase higher engagement and usage. ICICI Bank in India embedded basic banking services on WhatsApp (a popular messaging platform in India) and scaled up to one million users within three months of launch. In a world where consumers and businesses rely increasingly on digital ecosystems, banks should decide on the posture they would like to adopt across multiple ecosystems-that is, to build, orchestrate, or partner-and adapt the capabilities of their engagement layer accordingly.</p><p>Third, banks will need to redesign overall customer experiences and specific journeys for omnichannel interaction. This involves allowing customers to move across multiple modes (e.g., web, mobile app, branch, call center, smart devices) seamlessly within a single journey and retaining and continuously updating the latest context of interaction. Leading consumer internet companies with offline-to-online business models have reshaped customer expectations on this dimension. Some banks are pushing ahead in the design of omnichannel journeys, but most will need to catch up.</p><p>Reimagining the engagement layer of the AI bank will require a clear strategy on how to engage customers through channels owned by non-bank partners. Banks will need to adopt a design-thinking lens as they build experiences within and beyond the bank's platform, engineering engagement interfaces for flexibility to enable tailoring and personalization for customers, reengineering back-end processes, and ensuring that data-capture funnels (e.g., clickstream) are granularly embedded in the bank's engagement layer. All of this aims to provide a granular understanding of journeys and enable continuous improvement.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Layer 2: Building the AI-powered decision-making layer</emphasis></h><p>Delivering personalized messages and decisions to millions of users and thousands of employees, in (near) real time across the full spectrum of engagement channels, will require the bank to develop an at-scale AI-powered decision-making layer. Across domains within the bank, AI techniques can either fully replace or augment human judgment to produce significantly better outcomes (e.g., higher accuracy and speed), enhanced experience for customers (e.g., more personalized interaction and offerings), actionable insights for employees (e.g., which customer to contact first with next-best-action recommendations), and stronger risk management (e.g., earlier detection of likelihood of default and fraudulent activities).</p><p>To establish a robust AI-powered decision layer, banks will need to shift from attempting to develop specific use cases and point solutions to an enterprise-wide road map for deploying advanced-analytics (AA)/machine-learning (ML) models across entire business domains. As an illustration, in the domain of unsecured consumer lending alone, more than 20 decisions across the life cycle can be automated. To enable at-scale development of decision models, banks need to make the development process repeatable and thus capable of delivering solutions effectively and on-time. In addition to strong collaboration between business teams and analytics talent, this requires robust tools for model development, efficient processes (e.g., for re-using code across projects), and diffusion of knowledge (e.g., repositories) across teams. Beyond the at-scale development of decision models across domains, the road map should also include plans to embed AI in business-as-usual process. Often underestimated, this effort requires rewiring the business processes in which these AA/AI models will be embedded; making AI decisioning \"explainable\" to end-users; and a change-management plan that addresses employee mindset shifts and skills gaps. To foster continuous improvement beyond the first deployment, banks also need to establish infrastructure (e.g., data measurement) and processes (e.g., periodic reviews of performance, risk management of AI models) for feedback loops to flourish.</p><p>Additionally, banks will need to augment homegrown AI models, with fast-evolving capabilities (e.g., natural-language processing, computer-vision techniques, AI agents and bots, augmented or virtual reality) in their core business processes. Many of these leading-edge capabilities have the potential to bring a paradigm shift in customer experience and/or operational efficiency. While many banks may lack both the talent and the requisite investment appetite to develop these technologies themselves, they need at minimum to be able to procure and integrate these emerging capabilities from specialist providers at rapid speed through an architecture enabled by an application programming interface (API), promote continuous experimentation with these technologies in sandbox environments to test and refine applications and evaluate potential risks, and subsequently decide which technologies to deploy at scale.</p><p>To deliver these decisions and capabilities and to engage customers across the full life cycle, from acquisition to upsell and cross-sell to retention and win-back, banks will need to establish enterprise-wide digital marketing machinery. This machinery is critical for translating decisions and insights generated in the decision-making layer into a set of coordinated interventions delivered through the bank's engagement layer. This machinery has several critical elements, which include:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Data-ingestion pipelines that capture a range of data from multiple sources both within the bank (e.g., clickstream data from apps) and beyond (e.g., third-party partnerships with telco providers)</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Data platforms that aggregate, develop, and maintain a 360-degree view of customers and enable AA/ML models to run and execute in near real time</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Campaign platforms that track past actions and coordinate forward-looking interventions across the range of channels in the engagement layer</p></bodyText></listItem></list><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Layer 3: Strengthening the core technology and data infrastructure</emphasis></h><p>Deploying AI capabilities across the organization requires a scalable, resilient, and adaptable set of core-technology components. A weak core-technology backbone, starved of the investments needed for modernization, can dramatically reduce the effectiveness of the decision-making and engagement layers. The core-technology-and-data layer has six key elements (Exhibit 7):</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Tech-forward strategy.</emphasis> Banks should have a unified technology strategy that is tightly aligned to business strategy and outlines strategic choices on which elements, skill sets, and talent the bank will keep in-house and those it will source through partnerships or vendor relationships. In addition, the tech strategy needs to articulate how each component of the target architecture will both support the bank's vision to be an AI-first institution and interact with each layer of the capability stack.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Data management for the AI-enabled world.</emphasis> The bank's data management must ensure data liquidity-that is, the ability to access, ingest, and manipulate the data that serve as the foundation for all insights and decisions generated in the decision-making layer. Data liquidity increases with the removal of functional silos and allows multiple divisions to operate off the same data, with increased coordination. The data value chain begins with seamless sourcing of data from all relevant internal systems and external platforms. This includes ingesting data into a lake, cleaning and labeling the data required for diverse use cases (e.g., regulatory reporting, business intelligence at scale, AA/ML diagnostics), segregating incoming data (from both existing and prospective customers) to be made available for immediate analysis from data to be cleaned and labeled for future analysis. Furthermore, as banks design and build their centralized data-management infrastructure, they should develop additional controls and monitoring tools to ensure data security, privacy, and regulatory compliance-for example, timely and role-appropriate access across the organization for various use cases.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Modern API architecture.</emphasis> APIs are the connective tissue enabling controlled access to services, products, and data, both within the bank and beyond. Within the bank, APIs reduce the need for silos, increase reusability of technology assets, and promote flexibility in the technology architecture. Beyond the bank, APIs accelerate the ability to partner externally, unlock new business opportunities, and enhance customer experiences. While APIs can unlock significant value, it is critical to start by defining where they are to be used and establish centralized governance to support their development and curation.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Intelligent infrastructure.</emphasis> As companies in diverse industries increase the share of workload handled on public and private cloud infrastructure, there is ample evidence that cloud-based platforms allow for the higher scalability and resilience crucial to an AI-first strategy. Additionally, cloud-based infrastructure reduces costs for IT maintenance and enables self-serve models for development teams, which enable rapid innovation cycles by providing managed services (e.g., setting up new environments in minutes instead of days).</p></bodyText></listItem></list><h>Exhibit</h><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Financial Services/Our Insights/AI bank of the future Can banks meet the AI challenge/png-ai-bank-of-the-future-exhibit-7-v2.png\"> Link to Image </url></p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Layer 4: Transitioning to the platform operating model</emphasis></h><p>The AI-first bank of the future will need a new operating model for the organization, so it can achieve the requisite agility and speed and unleash value across the other layers. While most banks are transitioning their technology platforms and assets to become more modular and flexible, working teams within the bank continue to operate in functional silos under suboptimal collaboration models and often lack alignment of goals and priorities.</p><p>The platform operating model envisions cross-functional business-and-technology teams organized as a series of platforms within the bank. Each platform team controls their own assets (e.g., technology solutions, data, infrastructure), budgets, key performance indicators, and talent. In return, the team delivers a family of products or services either to end customers of the bank or to other platforms within the bank. In the target state, the bank could end up with three archetypes of platform teams. Business platforms are customer- or partner-facing teams dedicated to achieving business outcomes in areas such as consumer lending, corporate lending, and transaction banking. Enterprise platforms deliver specialized capabilities and/or shared services to establish standardization throughout the organization in areas such as collections, payment utilities, human resources, and finance. And enabling platforms enable the enterprise and business platforms to deliver cross-cutting technical functionalities such as cybersecurity and cloud architecture.</p><p>By integrating business and technology in jointly owned platforms run by cross-functional teams, banks can break up organizational silos, increasing agility and speed and improving the alignment of goals and priorities across the enterprise.</p><p>The journey to becoming an AI-first bank entails transforming capabilities across all four layers of the capability stack. Ignoring challenges or underinvesting in any layer will ripple through all, resulting in a sub-optimal stack that is incapable of delivering enterprise goals.</p><p>A practical way to get started is to evaluate how the bank's strategic goals (e.g., growth, profitability, customer engagement, innovation) can be materially enabled by the range of AI technologies-and dovetailing AI goals with the strategic goals of the bank. Once this alignment is in place, bank leaders should conduct a comprehensive diagnostic of the bank's starting position across the four layers, to identify areas that need key shifts, additional investments and new talent. They can then translate these insights into a transformation roadmap that spans business, technology, and analytics teams.</p><p>Equally important is the design of an execution approach that is tailored to the organization. To ensure sustainability of change, we recommend a two-track approach that balances short-term projects that deliver business value every quarter with an iterative build of long-term institutional capabilities. Furthermore, depending on their market position, size, and aspirations, banks need not build all capabilities themselves. They might elect to keep differentiating core capabilities in-house and acquire non-differentiating capabilities from technology vendors and partners, including AI specialists.</p><p>For many banks, ensuring adoption of AI technologies across the enterprise is no longer a choice, but a strategic imperative. Envisioning and building the bank's capabilities holistically across the four layers will be critical to success.</p><h>About the authors</h><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/link.aspx?_id=0922A76AAF134754B219F2642A365509&amp;_z=z\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Suparna Biswas</emphasis></url> is a partner, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shwaitang Singh</emphasis> is an associate partner, and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/link.aspx?_id=62408CEEB37847FC8037FCECDE03611A&amp;_z=z\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Renny Thomas</emphasis></url> is a senior partner, all in McKinsey's Mumbai office. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/link.aspx?_id=F434B4B95B1E4D37BBAADDADB676C99F&amp;_z=z\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brant Carson</emphasis></url> is a partner in the Sydney office, and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/link.aspx?_id=52F896812A5D41C6B87AF9021B470551&amp;_z=z\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Violet Chung</emphasis></url> is a partner in the Hong Kong office.<br/><br/> The authors would like to thank Milan Mitra, Anushi Shah, Arihant Kothari, and Yihong Wu for their contributions to this article.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MCKNSY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MCKNSY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60W9-YP41-DXH6-F2HD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470364</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4727\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 McKinsey &amp;

More than half of all women are given a false positive every 10 years, causing anxiety and leading to unnecessary treatment, which was estimated in a 2015 study in the journal Health Affairs to cost the US more than $US4 billion ($5.7 billion) a year.</p><p>Dominic King, the British lead for Google Health, said the results were \"really exciting\" and showed how AI could be used to help screen for cancers in earlier stages, when the disease is harder to detect accurately. The algorithm was trained and tested on de-identified images from almost 120,000 mammograms in the US and Britain.</p><p>DeepMind recently transferred control of its health division to parent company Google. Mustafa Suleyman, who oversaw the health team, is leaving DeepMind for a new job examining the opportunities and impacts of applied artificial intelligence at Google.</p><p>Dr King, who was previously a breast cancer surgeon, said Google embarked on the study partly because senior radiologists did not think Britain's cancer-screening services were sustainable. In 2018, the Royal College of Radiologists estimated that the country would need more than 1000 additional full-time diagnostic radiologists to meet demand.</p><p>He hopes the AI could one day obtain regulatory approval to be a support tool to clinicians - but not replace them. \"It could be a second opinion, giving a nudge or a recommendation here and there to spend more time looking at this scan, or to flag examples where cases get missed,\" he said.</p><p>Large technology companies are becoming increasingly interested in using their artificial intelligence expertise in healthcare, in particular deploying computer vision algorithms to spot patterns in images that require examining visual signs, in fields such as pathology, ophthalmology and dermatology.</p><p>Google has already created the Lymph Node Assistant, which is 99 per cent accurate at detecting late-stage breast cancer cells that have spread around the body. DeepMind is preparing for the commercial launch of a device that can diagnose complex eye diseases as accurately as specialists.</p><p>Big Tech also faces competition from start-ups such as Kheiron Medical, which is training a similar algorithm to identify signs of breast cancer. Based on training data from hospitals in Hungary, it beat the average performance of a radiologist.</p><p>The Google Health paper was authored in collaboration with the Cancer Research UK Imperial Centre, Northwestern University in Illinois, and the Royal Surrey County Hospital. It found that the AI model reduced the number of false positives by 5.7 per cent in the US and 1.2 per cent in Britain, where each scan is checked by two radiologists. It reduced false negatives by 9.4 per cent in the US, and 2.7 per cent in Britain.</p><p>Professor Ara Darzi, an author on the paper and director of the cancer centre at Imperial, said it was \"very encouraging\".</p><p>\"There will of course be a number of challenges to address before AI could be implemented in mammography screening programmes around the world, but the potential for improving healthcare and helping patients is enormous,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc78o2fbjh29s143u0v81t</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XWH-7V61-JD34-V464-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"626\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Alongside widespread quarantine measures and testing, the country's innovative use of technology is credited as a critical factor in combating the spread of the disease. As Europe and the United States struggle to cope, many governments are turning to AI tools to both advance the medical research and manage public health, now and in the long term: technical solutions for contact tracing, symptom tracking, immunity certificates and other applications are underway. These technologies are certainly promising, but they must be implemented in ways that do not undermine human rights.</p><p><br/>Seoul has collected extensively and intrusively the personal data of its citizens, analyzing millions of data points from credit card transactions, CCTV footage and cellphone geolocation data. South Korea's Ministry of the Interior and Safety even developed a smartphone app that shares with officials GPS data of self-quarantined individuals. If those in quarantine cross the \"electronic fence\" of their assigned area, the app alerts officials. The implications for privacy and security of such widespread surveillance are deeply concerning.<br/>South Korea is not alone in leveraging personal data in containment efforts. China, Iran, Israel, Italy, Poland, Singapore, Taiwan and others have used location data from cellphones for various applications tasked with combating coronavirus. Supercharged with artificial intelligence and machine learning, this data cannot only be used for social control and monitoring, but also to predict travel patterns, pinpoint future outbreak hot spots, model chains of infection or project immunity.<br/>Implications for human rights and data privacy reach far beyond the containment of COVID-19. Introduced as short-term fixes to the immediate threat of coronavirus, widespread data-sharing, monitoring and surveillance could become fixtures of modern public life. Under the guise of shielding citizens from future public health emergencies, temporary applications may become normalized. At the very least, government decisions to hastily introduce immature technologies - and in some cases to oblige citizens by law to use them - set a dangerous precedent.<br/>Nevertheless, such data\u00a0 and AI-driven applications could be useful advances in the fight against coronavirus, and personal data - anonymized and unidentifiable - offers valuable insights for governments navigating this unprecedented public health emergency. The White House is reportedly in active talks with a wide array of tech companies about how they can use anonymized aggregate-level location data from cellphones. The U.K. government is in discussion with cellphone operators about using location and usage data. And even Germany, which usually champions data rights, introduced a controversial app that uses data donations from fitness trackers and smartwatches to determine the geographical spread of the virus.<br/>Big tech too is rushing to the rescue. Google makes available \"Community Mobility Reports\" for more than 140 countries, which offer insights into mobility trends in places such as retail and recreation, workplaces and residential areas. Apple and Google collaborate on a contact-tracing app and have just launched a developer toolkit including an API. Facebook is rolling out \"local alerts\" features that allow municipal governments, emergency response organizations and law enforcement agencies to communicate with citizens based on their location.<br/>It is evident that data revealing the health and geolocation of citizens is as personal as it gets. The potential benefits weigh heavy, but so do concerns about the abuse and misuse of these applications. There are safeguards for data protection - perhaps, the most advanced one being the European GDPR - but during times of national emergency, governments hold rights to grant exceptions. And the frameworks for the lawful and ethical use of AI in democracy are much less developed - if at all.<br/>There are many applications that could help governments enforce social controls, predict outbreaks and trace infections - some of them more promising than others. Contact-tracing apps are at the center of government interest in Europe and the U.S. at the moment. Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing, or \"DP3T,\" approaches that use Bluetooth may offer a secure and decentralized protocol for consenting users to share data with public health authorities. Already, the European Commission released a guidance for contact-tracing applications that favors such decentralized approaches. Whether centralized or not, evidently, EU member states will need to comply with the GDPR when implementing such tools.<br/>Austria, Italy and Switzerland have announced they plan to use the decentralized frameworks developed by Apple and Google. Germany, after ongoing public debate, and stern warnings from privacy experts, recently ditched plans for a centralized app opting for a decentralized solution instead. But France and Norway are using centralized systems where sensitive personal data is stored on a central server.<br/>The U.K. government, too, has been experimenting with an app that uses a centralized approach and that is currently being tested in the Isle of Wight: The NHSX of the National Health Service will allow health officials to reach out directly and personally to potentially infected people. To this point, it remains unclear how the data collected will be used and if it will be combined with other sources of data. Under current provisions, the U.K. is still bound to comply with the GDPR until the end of the Brexit transition period in December 2020.<br/>Aside from government-led efforts, worryingly, a plethora of apps and websites for contact tracing and other forms of outbreak control are mushrooming, asking citizens to volunteer their personal data yet offering little - if any - privacy and security features, let alone functionality. Certainly well-intentioned, these tools often come from hobby developers and often originate from amateur hackathons.<br/>Sorting the wheat from the chaff is not an easy task, and our governments are most likely not equipped to accomplish it. At this point, artificial intelligence, and especially its use in governance, is still new to public agencies. Put on the spot, regulators struggle to evaluate the legitimacy and wider-reaching implications of different AI systems for democratic values. In the absence of sufficient procurement guidelines and legal frameworks, governments are ill-prepared to make these decisions now, when they are most needed.<br/>And worse yet, once AI-driven applications are let out of the box, it will be difficult to roll them back, not unlike increased safety measures at airports after 9/11. Governments may argue that they require data access to avoid a second wave of coronavirus or another looming pandemic.<br/>Regulators are unlikely to generate special new terms for AI during the coronavirus crisis, so at the very least we need to proceed with a pact: all AI applications developed to tackle the public health crisis must end up as public applications, with the data, algorithms, inputs and outputs held for the public good by public health researchers and public science agencies. Invoking the coronavirus pandemic as a sop for breaking privacy norms and reason to fleece the public of valuable data can't be allowed.<br/>We all want sophisticated AI to assist in delivering a medical cure and managing the public health emergency. Arguably, the short-term risks to personal privacy and human rights of AI wane in light of the loss of human lives. But when coronavirus is under control, we'll want our personal privacy back and our rights reinstated. If governments and firms in democracies are going to tackle this problem and keep institutions strong, we all need to see how the apps work, the public health data needs to end up with medical researchers and we must be able to audit and disable tracking systems. AI must, over the long term, support good governance.<br/>The coronavirus pandemic is a public health emergency of most pressing concern that will deeply impact governance for decades to come. And it also sheds a powerful spotlight on gaping shortcomings in our current systems. AI is arriving now with some powerful applications in stock, but our governments are ill-prepared to ensure its democratic use. Faced with the exceptional impacts of a global pandemic, quick and dirty policymaking is insufficient to ensure good governance, but may be the best solution we have.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GREENT-M-1029349</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GREENT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6024-X7C1-JBYT-H1VN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">422724</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1430\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greentechlead.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 3, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Continue reading AI can battle corona virus, but privacy shouldn t be a casualty</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">South Korea has successfully slowed down the spread of coronavirus. Alongside widespread quarantine measures and testing, the country's innovative use of technology is credited as a critical factor in combating the spread of the disease. As Europe and the United States struggle to cope, many governments are turning to AI tools to both advance the medical research and manage public health, now and in the long term: technical solutions for<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/our-work/covid-19/covid-19-exit-through-the-app-store/\">contact tracing, symptom tracking, immunity certificates and other applications</url>are underway. These technologies are certainly promising, but they must be implemented in ways that do not undermine human rights.</p><p>Seoul has collected extensively and intrusively the personal data of its citizens,<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/countries-tracking-citizens-phones-coronavirus-2020-3?r=DE&amp;IR=T#south-korea-gives-out-detailed-information-about-patients-whereabouts-2\">analyzing millions of data points</url>from credit card transactions, CCTV footage and cellphone geolocation data. South Korea's      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/03/06/905459/coronavirus-south-korea-smartphone-app-quarantine/\">Ministry of the Interior and Safety even developed a smartphone app</url>that shares with officials GPS data of self-quarantined individuals. If those in quarantine cross the  electronic fence  of their assigned area, the app alerts officials. The implications for privacy and security of such widespread surveillance are deeply concerning.</p><p>South Korea is not alone in leveraging personal data in containment efforts.<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/location-data-could-help-fight-covid-19--but-privacy-must-be-protected/2020/03\">China, Iran, Israel, Italy, Poland, Singapore, Taiwan and others</url>have used location data from cellphones for various applications tasked with combating coronavirus. Supercharged with artificial intelligence and machine learning, this data cannot only be used for social control and monitoring, but also to predict travel patterns, pinpoint future outbreak hot spots, model chains of infection or project immunity.</p><p>Implications for human rights and data privacy reach far beyond the containment of COVID-19. Introduced as short-term fixes to the immediate threat of coronavirus, widespread data-sharing, monitoring and surveillance could become fixtures of modern public life. Under the guise of shielding citizens from future public health emergencies, temporary applications may become normalized. At the very least, government decisions to hastily introduce immature technologies   and in some cases to oblige citizens by law to use them   set a dangerous precedent.</p><p>Nevertheless, such data  and AI-driven applications could be useful advances in the fight against coronavirus, and personal data   anonymized and unidentifiable   offers valuable insights for governments navigating this unprecedented public health emergency. The White House is<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/03/17/white-house-location-data-coronavirus/\">reportedly in active talks</url>with a wide array of tech companies about how they can use anonymized aggregate-level location data from cellphones. The U.K. government is      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/mobile-phone-industry-explores-worldwide-tracking-of-users-coronavirus\">in discussion with cellphone operators</url>about using location and usage data. And even Germany, which usually champions data rights,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://netzpolitik.org/2020/ein-fieberthermometer-fuer-deutschland/?utm_source=D64+Ticker&amp;utm_campaign=cc7e721012-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_4_22_2018_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_aa5ef144ff-cc7e721012-64702033\">introduced a controversial app</url>that uses data donations from fitness trackers and smartwatches to determine the geographical spread of the virus.</p><p>Big tech too is rushing to the rescue. Google makes available  Community Mobility Reports  for more than 140 countries, which offer insights into mobility trends in places such as retail and recreation, workplaces and residential areas.<url normalizedValue=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple\">Apple</url>and Google collaborate on a contact-tracing app and have just launched a developer toolkit including an API. Facebook is rolling out  local alerts  features that allow municipal governments, emergency response organizations and law enforcement agencies to communicate with citizens based on their location.</p><p>It is evident that data revealing the health and geolocation of citizens is as personal as it gets. The potential benefits weigh heavy, but so do concerns about the abuse and misuse of these applications. There are safeguards for data protection   perhaps, the most advanced one being the European GDPR   but during times of national emergency, governments hold rights to grant exceptions. And the frameworks for the lawful and ethical use of AI in democracy are much less developed   if at all.</p><p>There are many applications that could help governments enforce social controls, predict outbreaks and trace infections   some of them more promising than others. Contact-tracing apps are at the center of government interest in Europe and the U.S. at the moment. Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing, or  DP3T,  approaches that use Bluetooth may offer a secure and decentralized protocol for consenting users to share data with public health authorities. Already, the European Commission released<url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_670\">a guidance for contact-tracing applications</url>that favors such decentralized approaches. Whether centralized or not, evidently, EU member states will need to comply with the GDPR when implementing such tools.</p><p>Austria, Italy and Switzerland have announced they plan to use the decentralized frameworks developed by Apple and Google. Germany, after ongoing public debate, and stern warnings from privacy experts,<url normalizedValue=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/germany-ditches-centralized-approach-to-app-for-covid-19-contacts-tracing/\">recently ditched plans</url>for a centralized app opting for a decentralized solution instead. But France and Norway are using centralized systems where sensitive personal data is stored on a central server.</p><p>The U.K. government, too, has been experimenting with<url normalizedValue=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/05/nhs-covid-19-the-uks-coronavirus-contacts-tracing-app-explained/\">an app that uses a centralized approach</url>and that is currently being tested in the Isle of Wight: The NHSX of the National Health Service will allow health officials to reach out directly and personally to potentially infected people. To this point, it remains unclear how the data collected will be used and if it will be combined with other sources of data. Under current provisions, the U.K. is still bound to comply with the GDPR until the end of the Brexit transition period in December 2020.</p><p>Aside from government-led efforts, worryingly, a plethora of apps and websites for contact tracing and other forms of outbreak control are mushrooming, asking citizens to volunteer their personal data yet offering little   if any   privacy and security features, let alone functionality. Certainly well-intentioned, these tools often come from hobby developers and often originate from amateur hackathons.</p><p>Sorting the wheat from the chaff is not an easy task, and our governments are most likely not equipped to accomplish it. At this point, artificial intelligence, and especially its use in governance, is still new to public agencies. Put on the spot, regulators struggle to evaluate the legitimacy and wider-reaching implications of different AI systems for democratic values. In the absence of sufficient procurement guidelines and legal frameworks, governments are ill-prepared to make these decisions now, when they are most needed.</p><p>And worse yet, once AI-driven applications are let out of the box, it will be difficult to roll them back, not unlike increased safety measures at airports after 9/11. Governments may argue that they require data access<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/19d90308-6858-11ea-a3c9-1fe6fedcca75\">to avoid a second wave of coronavirus or another looming pandemic.</url></p><p>Regulators are unlikely to generate special new terms for AI during the coronavirus crisis, so at the very least we need to proceed with a pact: all AI applications developed to tackle the public health crisis must end up as public applications, with the data, algorithms, inputs and outputs held for the public good by public health researchers and public science agencies. Invoking the coronavirus pandemic as a sop for breaking privacy norms and reason to fleece the public of valuable data can't be allowed.</p><p>We all want sophisticated AI to assist in delivering a medical cure and managing the public health emergency. Arguably, the short-term risks to personal privacy and human rights of AI wane in light of the loss of human lives. But when coronavirus is under control, we'll want our personal privacy back and our rights reinstated. If governments and firms in democracies are going to tackle this problem and keep institutions strong, we all need to see how the apps work, the public health data needs to end up with medical researchers and we must be able to audit and disable tracking systems. AI must, over the long term, support good governance.</p><p>The coronavirus pandemic is a public health emergency of most pressing concern that will deeply impact governance for decades to come. And it also sheds a powerful spotlight on gaping shortcomings in our current systems. AI is arriving now with some powerful applications in stock, but our governments are ill-prepared to ensure its democratic use. Faced with the exceptional impacts of a global pandemic, quick and dirty policymaking is insufficient to ensure good governance, but may be the best solution we have.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">See Campaign:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/our-work/covid-19/covid-19-exit-through-the-app-store/\">https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/our-work/covid-19/covid-19-exit-through-the-app-store/</url><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Contact Information:</emphasis><br/>Philip Howard, Lisa-Maria Neudert<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tags:</emphasis><br/>,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://icrowdnewswire.com/category/news-category/wire/\">Wire</url>,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://icrowdnewswire.com/category/global-regions/united-states/\">United States</url>,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://icrowdnewswire.com/category/language/english/\">English</url><br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ICRWDE-httpsicrowdnewswirecomp2571234</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ICRWDE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:601W-03W1-JCTB-F0CG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433665</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1539\"/><timeReceived>7:35 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>iCrowdNewswire (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30185\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 27, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Continue reading AI can battle coronavirus, but privacy shouldn t be a casualty</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">South Korea has successfully slowed down the spread of coronavirus. Alongside widespread quarantine measures and testing, the country's innovative use of technology is credited as a critical factor in combating the spread of the disease. As Europe and the United States struggle to cope, many governments are turning to AI tools to both advance the medical research and manage public health, now and in the long term: technical solutions for<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/our-work/covid-19/covid-19-exit-through-the-app-store/\">contact tracing, symptom tracking, immunity certificates and other applications</url>are underway. These technologies are certainly promising, but they must be implemented in ways that do not undermine human rights.</p><p>Seoul has collected extensively and intrusively the personal data of its citizens,<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/countries-tracking-citizens-phones-coronavirus-2020-3?r=DE&amp;IR=T#south-korea-gives-out-detailed-information-about-patients-whereabouts-2\">analyzing millions of data points</url>from credit card transactions, CCTV footage and cellphone geolocation data. South Korea's      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/03/06/905459/coronavirus-south-korea-smartphone-app-quarantine/\">Ministry of the Interior and Safety even developed a smartphone app</url>that shares with officials GPS data of self-quarantined individuals. If those in quarantine cross the  electronic fence  of their assigned area, the app alerts officials. The implications for privacy and security of such widespread surveillance are deeply concerning.</p><p>South Korea is not alone in leveraging personal data in containment efforts.<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/location-data-could-help-fight-covid-19--but-privacy-must-be-protected/2020/03\">China, Iran, Israel, Italy, Poland, Singapore, Taiwan and others</url>have used location data from cellphones for various applications tasked with combating coronavirus. Supercharged with artificial intelligence and machine learning, this data cannot only be used for social control and monitoring, but also to predict travel patterns, pinpoint future outbreak hot spots, model chains of infection or project immunity.</p><p>Implications for human rights and data privacy reach far beyond the containment of COVID-19. Introduced as short-term fixes to the immediate threat of coronavirus, widespread data-sharing, monitoring and surveillance could become fixtures of modern public life. Under the guise of shielding citizens from future public health emergencies, temporary applications may become normalized. At the very least, government decisions to hastily introduce immature technologies   and in some cases to oblige citizens by law to use them   set a dangerous precedent.</p><p>Nevertheless, such data  and AI-driven applications could be useful advances in the fight against coronavirus, and personal data   anonymized and unidentifiable   offers valuable insights for governments navigating this unprecedented public health emergency. The White House is<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/03/17/white-house-location-data-coronavirus/\">reportedly in active talks</url>with a wide array of tech companies about how they can use anonymized aggregate-level location data from cellphones. The U.K. government is      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/mobile-phone-industry-explores-worldwide-tracking-of-users-coronavirus\">in discussion with cellphone operators</url>about using location and usage data. And even Germany, which usually champions data rights,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://netzpolitik.org/2020/ein-fieberthermometer-fuer-deutschland/?utm_source=D64+Ticker&amp;utm_campaign=cc7e721012-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_4_22_2018_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_aa5ef144ff-cc7e721012-64702033\">introduced a controversial app</url>that uses data donations from fitness trackers and smartwatches to determine the geographical spread of the virus.</p><p>Big tech too is rushing to the rescue. Google makes available  Community Mobility Reports  for more than 140 countries, which offer insights into mobility trends in places such as retail and recreation, workplaces and residential areas.<url normalizedValue=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple\">Apple</url>and Google collaborate on a contact-tracing app and have just launched a developer toolkit including an API. Facebook is rolling out  local alerts  features that allow municipal governments, emergency response organizations and law enforcement agencies to communicate with citizens based on their location.</p><p>It is evident that data revealing the health and geolocation of citizens is as personal as it gets. The potential benefits weigh heavy, but so do concerns about the abuse and misuse of these applications. There are safeguards for data protection   perhaps, the most advanced one being the European GDPR   but during times of national emergency, governments hold rights to grant exceptions. And the frameworks for the lawful and ethical use of AI in democracy are much less developed   if at all.</p><p>There are many applications that could help governments enforce social controls, predict outbreaks and trace infections   some of them more promising than others. Contact-tracing apps are at the center of government interest in Europe and the U.S. at the moment. Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing, or  DP3T,  approaches that use Bluetooth may offer a secure and decentralized protocol for consenting users to share data with public health authorities. Already, the European Commission released<url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_670\">a guidance for contact-tracing applications</url>that favors such decentralized approaches. Whether centralized or not, evidently, EU member states will need to comply with the GDPR when implementing such tools.</p><p>Austria, Italy and Switzerland have announced they plan to use the decentralized frameworks developed by Apple and Google. Germany, after ongoing public debate, and stern warnings from privacy experts,<url normalizedValue=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/germany-ditches-centralized-approach-to-app-for-covid-19-contacts-tracing/\">recently ditched plans</url>for a centralized app opting for a decentralized solution instead. But France and Norway are using centralized systems where sensitive personal data is stored on a central server.</p><p>The U.K. government, too, has been experimenting with<url normalizedValue=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/05/nhs-covid-19-the-uks-coronavirus-contacts-tracing-app-explained/\">an app that uses a centralized approach</url>and that is currently being tested in the Isle of Wight: The NHSX of the National Health Service will allow health officials to reach out directly and personally to potentially infected people. To this point, it remains unclear how the data collected will be used and if it will be combined with other sources of data. Under current provisions, the U.K. is still bound to comply with the GDPR until the end of the Brexit transition period in December 2020.</p><p>Aside from government-led efforts, worryingly, a plethora of apps and websites for contact tracing and other forms of outbreak control are mushrooming, asking citizens to volunteer their personal data yet offering little   if any   privacy and security features, let alone functionality. Certainly well-intentioned, these tools often come from hobby developers and often originate from amateur hackathons.</p><p>Sorting the wheat from the chaff is not an easy task, and our governments are most likely not equipped to accomplish it. At this point, artificial intelligence, and especially its use in governance, is still new to public agencies. Put on the spot, regulators struggle to evaluate the legitimacy and wider-reaching implications of different AI systems for democratic values. In the absence of sufficient procurement guidelines and legal frameworks, governments are ill-prepared to make these decisions now, when they are most needed.</p><p>And worse yet, once AI-driven applications are let out of the box, it will be difficult to roll them back, not unlike increased safety measures at airports after 9/11. Governments may argue that they require data access<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/19d90308-6858-11ea-a3c9-1fe6fedcca75\">to avoid a second wave of coronavirus or another looming pandemic.</url></p><p>Regulators are unlikely to generate special new terms for AI during the coronavirus crisis, so at the very least we need to proceed with a pact: all AI applications developed to tackle the public health crisis must end up as public applications, with the data, algorithms, inputs and outputs held for the public good by public health researchers and public science agencies. Invoking the coronavirus pandemic as a sop for breaking privacy norms and reason to fleece the public of valuable data can't be allowed.</p><p>We all want sophisticated AI to assist in delivering a medical cure and managing the public health emergency. Arguably, the short-term risks to personal privacy and human rights of AI wane in light of the loss of human lives. But when coronavirus is under control, we'll want our personal privacy back and our rights reinstated. If governments and firms in democracies are going to tackle this problem and keep institutions strong, we all need to see how the apps work, the public health data needs to end up with medical researchers and we must be able to audit and disable tracking systems. AI must, over the long term, support good governance.</p><p>The coronavirus pandemic is a public health emergency of most pressing concern that will deeply impact governance for decades to come. And it also sheds a powerful spotlight on gaping shortcomings in our current systems. AI is arriving now with some powerful applications in stock, but our governments are ill-prepared to ensure its democratic use. Faced with the exceptional impacts of a global pandemic, quick and dirty policymaking is insufficient to ensure good governance, but may be the best solution we have.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">See Campaign:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/03/17/white-house-location-data-coronavirus/\">https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/03/17/white-house-location-data-coronavirus/</url><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Contact Information:</emphasis><br/>Philip Howard and Lisa-Maria Neudert<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tags:</emphasis><br/>,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://icrowdnewswire.com/category/news-category/wire/\">Wire</url>,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://icrowdnewswire.com/category/global-regions/united-states/\">United States</url>,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://icrowdnewswire.com/category/language/english/\">English</url><br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ICRWDE-httpsicrowdnewswirecom20200527aicanbattlecoronavirusbutprivacyshouldntbeacasualty</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ICRWDE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:601W-03W1-JCTB-F0KV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433665</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1539\"/><timeReceived>2:26 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>iCrowdNewswire (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30185\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 27, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Continue reading AI can battle coronavirus, but privacy shouldn t be a casualty</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">South Korea has successfully slowed down the spread of coronavirus. Alongside widespread quarantine measures and testing, the country's innovative use of technology is credited as a critical factor in combating the spread of the disease. As Europe and the United States struggle to cope, many governments are turning to AI tools to both advance the medical research and manage public health, now and in the long term: technical solutions for<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/our-work/covid-19/covid-19-exit-through-the-app-store/\">contact tracing, symptom tracking, immunity certificates and other applications</url>are underway. These technologies are certainly promising, but they must be implemented in ways that do not undermine human rights.</p><p>Seoul has collected extensively and intrusively the personal data of its citizens,<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/countries-tracking-citizens-phones-coronavirus-2020-3?r=DE&amp;IR=T#south-korea-gives-out-detailed-information-about-patients-whereabouts-2\">analyzing millions of data points</url>from credit card transactions, CCTV footage and cellphone geolocation data. South Korea's      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/03/06/905459/coronavirus-south-korea-smartphone-app-quarantine/\">Ministry of the Interior and Safety even developed a smartphone app</url>that shares with officials GPS data of self-quarantined individuals. If those in quarantine cross the  electronic fence  of their assigned area, the app alerts officials. The implications for privacy and security of such widespread surveillance are deeply concerning.</p><p>South Korea is not alone in leveraging personal data in containment efforts.<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/location-data-could-help-fight-covid-19--but-privacy-must-be-protected/2020/03\">China, Iran, Israel, Italy, Poland, Singapore, Taiwan and others</url>have used location data from cellphones for various applications tasked with combating coronavirus. Supercharged with artificial intelligence and machine learning, this data cannot only be used for social control and monitoring, but also to predict travel patterns, pinpoint future outbreak hot spots, model chains of infection or project immunity.</p><p>Implications for human rights and data privacy reach far beyond the containment of COVID-19. Introduced as short-term fixes to the immediate threat of coronavirus, widespread data-sharing, monitoring and surveillance could become fixtures of modern public life. Under the guise of shielding citizens from future public health emergencies, temporary applications may become normalized. At the very least, government decisions to hastily introduce immature technologies   and in some cases to oblige citizens by law to use them   set a dangerous precedent.</p><p>Nevertheless, such data  and AI-driven applications could be useful advances in the fight against coronavirus, and personal data   anonymized and unidentifiable   offers valuable insights for governments navigating this unprecedented public health emergency. The White House is<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/03/17/white-house-location-data-coronavirus/\">reportedly in active talks</url>with a wide array of tech companies about how they can use anonymized aggregate-level location data from cellphones. The U.K. government is      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/mobile-phone-industry-explores-worldwide-tracking-of-users-coronavirus\">in discussion with cellphone operators</url>about using location and usage data. And even Germany, which usually champions data rights,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://netzpolitik.org/2020/ein-fieberthermometer-fuer-deutschland/?utm_source=D64+Ticker&amp;utm_campaign=cc7e721012-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_4_22_2018_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_aa5ef144ff-cc7e721012-64702033\">introduced a controversial app</url>that uses data donations from fitness trackers and smartwatches to determine the geographical spread of the virus.</p><p>Big tech too is rushing to the rescue. Google makes available  Community Mobility Reports  for more than 140 countries, which offer insights into mobility trends in places such as retail and recreation, workplaces and residential areas.<url normalizedValue=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple\">Apple</url>and Google collaborate on a contact-tracing app and have just launched a developer toolkit including an API. Facebook is rolling out  local alerts  features that allow municipal governments, emergency response organizations and law enforcement agencies to communicate with citizens based on their location.</p><p>It is evident that data revealing the health and geolocation of citizens is as personal as it gets. The potential benefits weigh heavy, but so do concerns about the abuse and misuse of these applications. There are safeguards for data protection   perhaps, the most advanced one being the European GDPR   but during times of national emergency, governments hold rights to grant exceptions. And the frameworks for the lawful and ethical use of AI in democracy are much less developed   if at all.</p><p>There are many applications that could help governments enforce social controls, predict outbreaks and trace infections   some of them more promising than others. Contact-tracing apps are at the center of government interest in Europe and the U.S. at the moment. Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing, or  DP3T,  approaches that use Bluetooth may offer a secure and decentralized protocol for consenting users to share data with public health authorities. Already, the European Commission released<url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_670\">a guidance for contact-tracing applications</url>that favors such decentralized approaches. Whether centralized or not, evidently, EU member states will need to comply with the GDPR when implementing such tools.</p><p>Austria, Italy and Switzerland have announced they plan to use the decentralized frameworks developed by Apple and Google. Germany, after ongoing public debate, and stern warnings from privacy experts,<url normalizedValue=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/germany-ditches-centralized-approach-to-app-for-covid-19-contacts-tracing/\">recently ditched plans</url>for a centralized app opting for a decentralized solution instead. But France and Norway are using centralized systems where sensitive personal data is stored on a central server.</p><p>The U.K. government, too, has been experimenting with<url normalizedValue=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/05/nhs-covid-19-the-uks-coronavirus-contacts-tracing-app-explained/\">an app that uses a centralized approach</url>and that is currently being tested in the Isle of Wight: The NHSX of the National Health Service will allow health officials to reach out directly and personally to potentially infected people. To this point, it remains unclear how the data collected will be used and if it will be combined with other sources of data. Under current provisions, the U.K. is still bound to comply with the GDPR until the end of the Brexit transition period in December 2020.</p><p>Aside from government-led efforts, worryingly, a plethora of apps and websites for contact tracing and other forms of outbreak control are mushrooming, asking citizens to volunteer their personal data yet offering little   if any   privacy and security features, let alone functionality. Certainly well-intentioned, these tools often come from hobby developers and often originate from amateur hackathons.</p><p>Sorting the wheat from the chaff is not an easy task, and our governments are most likely not equipped to accomplish it. At this point, artificial intelligence, and especially its use in governance, is still new to public agencies. Put on the spot, regulators struggle to evaluate the legitimacy and wider-reaching implications of different AI systems for democratic values. In the absence of sufficient procurement guidelines and legal frameworks, governments are ill-prepared to make these decisions now, when they are most needed.</p><p>And worse yet, once AI-driven applications are let out of the box, it will be difficult to roll them back, not unlike increased safety measures at airports after 9/11. Governments may argue that they require data access<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/19d90308-6858-11ea-a3c9-1fe6fedcca75\">to avoid a second wave of coronavirus or another looming pandemic.</url></p><p>Regulators are unlikely to generate special new terms for AI during the coronavirus crisis, so at the very least we need to proceed with a pact: all AI applications developed to tackle the public health crisis must end up as public applications, with the data, algorithms, inputs and outputs held for the public good by public health researchers and public science agencies. Invoking the coronavirus pandemic as a sop for breaking privacy norms and reason to fleece the public of valuable data can't be allowed.</p><p>We all want sophisticated AI to assist in delivering a medical cure and managing the public health emergency. Arguably, the short-term risks to personal privacy and human rights of AI wane in light of the loss of human lives. But when coronavirus is under control, we'll want our personal privacy back and our rights reinstated. If governments and firms in democracies are going to tackle this problem and keep institutions strong, we all need to see how the apps work, the public health data needs to end up with medical researchers and we must be able to audit and disable tracking systems. AI must, over the long term, support good governance.</p><p>The coronavirus pandemic is a public health emergency of most pressing concern that will deeply impact governance for decades to come. And it also sheds a powerful spotlight on gaping shortcomings in our current systems. AI is arriving now with some powerful applications in stock, but our governments are ill-prepared to ensure its democratic use. Faced with the exceptional impacts of a global pandemic, quick and dirty policymaking is insufficient to ensure good governance, but may be the best solution we have.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">See Campaign:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/03/17/white-house-location-data-coronavirus/\">https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/03/17/white-house-location-data-coronavirus/</url><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Contact Information:</emphasis><br/>Philip Howard and Lisa-Maria Neudert<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tags:</emphasis><br/>,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://icrowdnewswire.com/category/news-category/wire/\">Wire</url>,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://icrowdnewswire.com/category/global-regions/united-states/\">United States</url>,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://icrowdnewswire.com/category/language/english/\">English</url><br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ICRWDE-httpsicrowdnewswirecomp2570991</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ICRWDE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:601W-03W1-JCTB-F09V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433665</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1539\"/><timeReceived>8:26 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>iCrowdNewswire (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30185\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 27, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

That's still important to them today, but 'that's been kind of stabilized,' he says.'They're realizing [electronic health records software] doesn't solve all their problems, so they're looking to augment that' with additional technologies, Bakken (pictured) says. 'In general, I would say the customer is more open to taking meetings or exploring digital health solutions.'Another sign that the digital health market is maturing? Many hospital networks, insurers, and self-insured employers have created a digital innovation officer role in their organizations, Bakken says. </p><p>That person has 'basically become the champion' of digital health tools in many healthcare-related businesses and organizations, he says, whether they're looking for products that can streamline or automate a process, improve patient care, or help them better understand the health data they're working with 'so they can make better and smarter business decisions.'The maturation of the digital health industry comes as Bakken's Madison, WI-based venture firm has made progress as well. He says HealthX has invested in 13 companies from its first fund, which totaled $20 million[2]. None of those companies have shut down, and one has achieved an 'exit,' he says. That was Pacifica, which developed a mobile app for managing stress and anxiety. Sanvello Health acquired[3] the startup this year for an undisclosed price.As of this writing, HealthX is out raising capital for its second fund, which could reach $75 million, according to a document[4] the firm filed with securities regulators in April. Bakken, HealthX's managing partner, says he can't talk about the fundraising effort. But he says HealthX has made one investment so far from the second pot of money. In September, the firm led a $10 million Series A investment[5] in InsightRX, a San Francisco-based startup that uses machine learning-enabled software to help caregivers improve medication dosing regimens.Xconomy recently caught up with Bakken to get an update on HealthX and hear his thoughts on the digital health sector, which picked up momentum in recent months[6], thanks to a series of IPOs[7], increasing venture investments[8], federal policy changes[9] that could spell opportunity for the industry, and other factors.Bakken's perspective is informed not only by leading a healthtech-focused venture firm, but also from the serial entrepreneur's prior experience running Nordic, a Madison-based healthcare consulting firm best-known for its expertise in electronic health records software from vendors such as Epic Systems, based near Madison[10]. Bakken helped grow Nordic, founded in 2010, to more than 400 employees before he left at the end of 2014.Looking ahead to next year, Bakken predicts that the overarching theme in digital health will be the next evolution of the electronic health record. 'It's leveraging that data to make better recommendations of how to cure somebody faster, whether you call it AI or machine learning,' Bakken says.He says the biggest barrier to achieving that vision remains access to quality data, which is necessary for successfully training and operating AI software.'It's still not as easy as some people think it should be for getting access to [health] data, but it's getting better,' Bakken says.There are efforts by companies[11], industry groups[12], and the federal government[13] to improve how doctors and patients can get access to data, and move the information from one system to another. 'It's still going to take some time,' Bakken says. 'But at least there's a light at the end of the tunnel,' he adds.Despite healthcare organizations' growing interest in AI, mobile apps, telemedicine, and other advanced technologies, Bakken still finds promising investment opportunities in simpler products from companies that he says are doing a lot of 'blocking and tackling' in healthcare. Take Medable, a HealthX portfolio company in Palo Alto, CA, that is helping companies that conduct clinical trials digitize and automate processes that are still mostly paper-based, he says.Or consider ImageMoverMD, another HealthX investment[14]. That Madison-based company developed software to make it easier to capture and manage medical images, which to this day are often shared among doctors and caregivers using thumb drives or burning images to a CD, Bakken says.'You would think that would've been solved a while ago, but unfortunately that's still there,' he says. Moreover, 'there's still a lot of faxing happening today in healthcare, which is just ludicrous.'

Physicist\u00c2 <person><nameText>Stephen Hawking </nameText></person>says,\u00c2 \"the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.\" Tesla Motors and SpaceX founder <person><nameText>Elon Musk </nameText></person>suggests that AI is probably \"our biggest existential threat.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Artificial intelligence experts say there are good reasons to pay attention to the fears expressed by big minds like Hawking and Musk \u00e2\u20ac\u201d\u00c2 and to do something about it while there is still time.</p><p>- <person><nameText>Stephen Hawking's </nameText></person>warning on artificial intelligence a long way off</p><p>Hawking made his most recent comments at the beginning of December, in response to a question about an upgrade to the technology he uses to communicate, He relies on the device because he has\u00c2 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a degenerative disease that affects his ability to move and speak.</p><p>Musk raised the\u00c2 alarm about artificial intelligence\u00c2 during the MIT Aeronautics and Astronautics department's Centennial Symposium in October, likening AI to \"summoning the demon.\"</p><p>He\u00c2 had previously tweeted that AI was \"potentially more dangerous than nukes.\"</p><p>The event that Hawking and Musk fear is \"singularity\" \u00e2\u20ac\u201c when machines surpass humans in general intelligence, not just in beating us at\u00c2 tasks like playing chess or Jeopardy, as they have already.</p><p>Popular works of science fiction -\u00c2 from the latest Terminator trailer, to the Matrix trilogy,\u00c2 to Star Trek's borg\u00c2 - envision that beyond that irreversible historic event, machines will destroy, enslave or assimilate us, says Canadian science fiction writer Robert J. Sawyer.</p><p>Sawyer has written about a different vision of life beyond singularity \u00e2\u20ac\u201d\u00c2 one in which machines and humans work together for their mutual benefit. But he also sits on a couple of committees at the Lifeboat Foundation, a non-profit group that looks at future threats to the existence of humanity, including those posed by the \"possible misuse of powerful technologies\" such as AI. He said Hawking and Musk have good reason to be concerned.</p><p>\"Once we no longer have the intellectual upper hand, then we quite literally, by definition, cannot outwit our successors. So unless we are absolutely sure that the machines we are building right now are not going to eventually become our new robot overlords, prudence is called for.\"</p><p>Alan Mackworth, who holds a Canada Research Chair in Artificial Intelligence at the University of British Columbia, thinks Hawking and Musk are being \"a bit overdramatic,\" but are right to sound the alarm\u00c2 and spur public discussion.</p><p>He says\u00c2 AI is just coming out of science fiction and into the real world,\u00c2 in the form of technologies such as Google's self-driving cars, IBM's Jeopardy-winning robot Watson, and the increasing number of computers successfully posing as humans in the Turing test (which examines a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour that can't be distinguished from that of a human, such as having a random\u00c2 conversation with a person).</p><p>Mackworth invented the first soccer-playing robots. He is now developing AI technology for motorized wheelchairs to help people with dementia get around. He says machines are still far from being able to take off on\u00c2 their own: \"If you look at what you can currently do in robot and computer learning, it's classifying Youtube videos to see which one has a cat in it and which one doesn't have a cat in it.\"</p><p>Military at forefront of AI development</p><p>But he is worried about the current use of AI to develop military technology, such as autonomous weapons and semi-autonomous drones.</p><p>\"This technology is very, very powerful, and we have to build safeguards into it,\" he said.</p><p>Mackworth suggests that regulation of artificial intelligence may require international treaties and codes of ethics for robot designers, similar to those engineers must abide by.</p><p>Enforcement, however, may not be that easy. It requires technology to verify what a robot can and cannot do, when compared to its specifications \u00e2\u20ac\u201c something that is under development but doesn't yet exist.</p><p>Sawyer thinks that in order to keep humans safe from the potential threats posed by AI, the technology's development needs to be out in the open\u00c2 in places like publicly funded universities, rather than inside military agencies.</p><p>\"There should be nothing classified about this research,\" he said. \"By the point when you sit down in front of your computer and your computer says, 'Good morning, I'm in charge now,' it's too late.\"</p><p>While that moment may be decades or even centuries away, Sandra Zilles, who holds a Canada Research Chair in Computational Learning Theory at the University of Regina, says machines are already able to learn some things much faster than humans, and can reprogram themselves to perform certain tasks more efficiently.</p><p>She notes that besides the military, big tech companies like Google and Apple are also at the forefront of AI research, and that too has implications.</p><p>\"They can steer the development of technology in a direction that is most useful to them,\" she said, \"but maybe not the most useful to mankind.\"</p><p>Collaborative machines?</p><p>Despite the dark future envisioned by science fiction, both Mackworth and Sawyer see brighter possibilities.</p><p>Mackworth says he's not really worried about machines turning on us, because humans typically design machines to be tools and extensions of our own minds and brains.</p><p>\"We should make sure that these machines are built to collaborate with us and not be totally autonomous.\"</p><p>Sawyer envisions newly conscious, superintelligent machines cooperating\u00c2 with humans in his fictional\u00c2 Wake, Watch and Wonder trilogy. He argues that machines are developing in an environment that is very different than the scarcity and natural selection that led to the evolution of humans.</p><p>\"All the things that made us basically nasty, rapacious, competitive as a species are not necessarily hard-coded into whatever passes for the DNA of artificial intelligence,\" Sawyer says. \"There's every reason to think that they would be fundamentally different psychologically from us, and that psychology may very much predispose them to being altruistic rather than being competitive and violent the way we are.\"</p><p>That said, he's not ready to put all his money on his own vision.</p><p>\"I don't want to say, 'Don't worry,' because one of us is right \u00e2\u20ac\u201c me or <person><nameText>Stephen Hawking. </nameText></person>\u00c2 Even I \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even I would probably bet on Hawking.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBC-cbcstory1.2864576</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBC2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5F1S-VJJ1-JCSH-313B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">305992</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1080\"/><timeReceived>3:26 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

They replicate the worst human biases. This should be checked In his seminal book Selfish Gene, evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins discusses, among many important things, why humans have to be altruistic. </p><p>If there is a human moral to be drawn, Dawkins writes, it is that we must teach our children altruism, for we cannot expect it to be part of their biological nature. Why? Because evolutionary biology tells us that we are programmed genetically to survive by 'cheating' or, in other words, by finding the smartest way to replicate. And, hence, it is important to teach ourselves to be kind towards each other, have empathy, follow rules and not discriminate against the poor and vulnerable. Only humans have this ability to go against the tide.Artificial intelligence faces a similar scenario today. Does machine intelligence, which bears all the biases and prejudices of the humans that code and create it, have to be programmed to be altruistic? Amnesty International, the global human rights watchdog which among many agencies is worried about the ethical glitches in artificial intelligence, thinks machine learning systems have to be trained to be rational and humane, and should respect human rights. The NGO's recent Toronto Declaration poses some interesting and important questions on this.Inherent biasesAmnesty International says there is a 'substantive and growing body' of proof showing AI systems, which can be 'opaque and include unexplainable processes', and can easily contribute to discrimination if unchecked.To pick an early example, in May 2016, a investigative journal ProPublica found out that a software that the US administration was using across the country to predict future criminals was biased against blacks. As Virginia Eubanks has discussed in her recent book, Automating Inequality new-age technologies such as Big Data and AI are used to tamper with justice.To give a fresh example, just this week the BBC reported the story of a man, Ibrahim Diallo, who was fired by a machine thanks to an error of judgment which could be justified in the world of automation and AI but is an easily resolved problem in a human universe \u2014 his entry pass had failed to work and he relied on the security guard to enter office, which the artificial intelligence failed to figure out.Such incidents are the reason why agencies like Amnesty says machines have to be taught to respect issues such as privacy, freedom of expression, participation in cultural life, equality before the law, and meaningful access to remedy.This is important for many reasons. For one, big tech companies, despite the occasional rhetoric about ethical AI, are in no mood to regulate their AI experiments. The argument is such controls will backtrack innovations in the sector. But that doesn't hold the test of logic considering the direct damage AI can cause. Consider the development of AI weapons (killer robots in other words). So many companies, including Google, are undertaking or being part of AI experiments in military domains. Just recently, Google drew flak for its involvement in the so-called Project Maven, which reports suggest is a drone programme commissioned by the US military.The programme is a tight-lipped affair but reports say it uses image recognition algorithms that help drones scan people in real time and place their identity. Human rights organisations have time and again criticised US drone programme for their rights violations and, under pressure, Google said it would not renew its contract for Project Maven when it expires next year. Google also released a set of principles on its AI plans and hinted it would stay away from AI in weaponry.India, which is keenly watching this space and has recently dished out a set of official reports (NITI Aayog and the AI Task Force) on the potential of AI in the country, has a lot to learn from the AI mishappenings abroad and apply the lessons here to ensure India's AI sector respects human rights, ethics, privacy and freedom of speech.India is looking forward to harnessing AI and Big Data in areas such as smart cities, healthcare, education, governance, labour, banking and many allied and emerging areas. Considering the size and breadth of these sectors, it is advisable we formulate meaningful guidelines to make sure AI doesn't have the biases of its creators and acknowledge its fallibility and create alternative plans in case of failure. AI, to be sure, should be one of the solutions.Of course, it is too early to worry about the kind of AI catastrophe that the likes of Stephen Hawking or Elon Musk have been paranoid about, but the earlier we make AI egalitarian and humane, the better. Being the most important element in the current wave of technologies, AI should be allowed to experiment and expand its horizons. But it is equally important to make it learn altruism and not go the social Darwinist way, which would be the wrong kind of evolution of machines. The way humans have evolved indeed have some lessons for the machines. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-HIN1042561529881563889251764100118</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HIN-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SMW-VB71-JCMN-Y1N8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"865\"/><timeReceived>11:06 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Hindu Business Line</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 24, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00080KU</classCode><className>AI SYSTEMS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>OPINION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000654</classCode><className>ETHICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N813311MM</classCode><className>HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000116</classCode><className>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000CYDJ</classCode><className>DISCRIMINATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>ST0009J49</classCode><className>HUMAN RIGHTS &amp;

How can the general public best be prepared for more widespread use of artificial intelligence?     Who in society is gaining the most from the development and use of artificial intelligence? Who is gaining the least?     Should the public's understanding of, and engagement with, artificial intelligence be improved?     What are the key industry sectors that stand to benefit from the development and use of artificial intelligence?     How can the data-based monopolies of some large corporations, and the 'winner-takes-all' economics associated with them, be addressed?     What are the ethical implications of the development and use of artificial intelligence?     In what situations is a relative lack of transparency in artificial intelligence systems (so-called 'black boxing') acceptable?     What role should the government take in the development and use of artificial intelligence in the UK?     Should artificial intelligence be regulated?<br/> The committee says it is looking for \"pragmatic solutions to the issues presented, and questions raised by the development and use of artificial intelligence in the present and the future\".<br/> Commenting in a statement, Lord Clement-Jones, chairman of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence, said: \"This inquiry comes at a time when artificial intelligence is increasingly seizing the attention of industry, policymakers and the general public. The Committee wants to use this inquiry to understand what opportunities exist for society in the development and use of artificial intelligence, as well as what risks there might be.<br/> \"We are looking to be pragmatic in our approach, and want to make sure our recommendations to government and others will be practical and sensible. There are significant questions to address relevant to both the present and the future, and we want to help inform the answers to them. To do this, we need the help of the widest range of people and organisations.\"<br/> \"If you are interested in artificial intelligence and any of its aspects, we want to hear from you. If you are interested in public policy, we want to hear from you. If you are interested in any of the issues raised by our call for evidence, we want to hear from you,\" he added.<br/> The committee's call for evidence can be found here. Written submissions can be submitted via this webform on the committee's webpage.<br/> The deadline for submissions to the enquiry is September 6, 2017.<br/> Algorithmic irresponsibility<br/> Concern over the societal impacts of AI has been rising up the political agenda in recent times, with another committee of UK MPs warning last fall the government needs to take proactive steps to minimise bias being accidentally built into AI systems and ensure transparency so that autonomous decisions can be audited and systems vetted to ensure AI tech is operating as intended - and that unwanted, or unpredictable, behaviours are not produced.<br/> Another issue that we've flagged here on TechCrunch is the risk of valuable publicly funded data-sets effectively being asset-stripped by tech giants hungry for data to feed and foster commercial AI models.<br/> Since 2015, for example, Google-owned DeepMind has been forging a series of data-sharing partnerships with National Health Service Trusts in the UK which has provided it with access to millions of citizens' medical information. Some of these partnerships explicitly involve AI; in other cases it has started by building clinical task management apps yet applying AI to the same health data-sets is a stated, near-term ambition.<br/> It also recently emerged that DeepMind is not charging NHS Trusts for the app development and research work it's doing with them - rather its 'price' appears to be access to what are clearly highly sensitive (and publicly funded) data-sets.<br/> This is concerning as there are clearly only a handful of companies with deep enough pockets to effectively 'buy' access to highly sensitive publicly-funded data-sets - i.e. by offering five years of 'free' work in exchange for access - using that data to develop a new generation of AI-powered products. A small startup cannot hope to compete on the same terms as the Alphabet-Google behemoth.<br/> The risk of data-based monopolies and 'winner-takes-all' economics from big tech's big data push to garner AI advantage should be loud and clear. As should the pressing need for public debate on how best to regulate this emerging sector so that future wealth and any benefits derived from the power of AI technologies can be widely distributed, rather than simply locking in platform power.<br/> In another twist pertaining to DeepMind Health's activity in the UK, the country's data protection watchdog ruled earlier this month that the company's first data-sharing arrangement with an NHS Trust broke UK privacy law. Patients' consent had not been sought nor obtained for the sharing of some 1.6 million medical records for the purpose of co-developing a clinical task management app to provide alerts of the risk of a patient developing a kidney condition.<br/> The Royal Free NHS Trust now has three months to change how it works with DeepMind to bring the arrangement into compliance with UK data protection law.<br/> In that instance the app in question does not involve DeepMind applying any AI. However, in January 2016, the company and the same Trust agreed on wider ambitions to apply AI to medical data sets within five years. So the NHS app development freebies that DeepMind Health is engaged with now are clearly paving the way for a broad AI push down the line.<br/> Commenting on the Lords enquiry, Sam Smith, coordinator of health data privacy group, medConfidential - an early critic of how DeepMind was being handed NHS patient data - told us: \"This inquiry is important, especially given the unlawful behaviour we've seen from DeepMind's misuse of NHS data. AI is slightly different, but the rules still apply, and this expert scrutiny in the public domain will move the debate forward.\"<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-n10092186</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P3S-RFJ1-DYDW-7286-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1054\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 FFC Information Solution All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"07\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>July 20, 2017 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Nature, he argued, always \"knows when and where to stop\", whereas \"technology recognises no selflimiting principle - in terms... of size, speed and violence\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The warning predated the invention of the internet by 16 years, but defines the challenge faced by big tech today: on all three of Schumacher's counts, internet technology is defying its natural limits.</p><p>In terms of size, the four most powerful US firms - Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon - now have a market capitalisation of $2.8trn (\u00a32.3trn), greater than the GDP of the United Kingdom.</p><p>In terms of speed, technological disruption is now so rapid that jobs being lost to robots is the least of our worries. The founders of Skype, SpaceX, Microsoft and Google Deepmind all now warn of the risk of uncontrollable and potentially civilisation-destroying artificial intelligence within a matter of years.</p><p>In terms of violence, digital companies have been seemingly powerless to prevent everything from hate speech and fake news to sexual exploitation and terrorism, from blemishing their platforms.</p><p>These glitches should matter as much to entrepreneurs in Old Street or Silicon Valley as they should to lawmakers in Westminster or Washington. Increasingly the biggest firms are not just ubiquitous in the markets they operate in, but guard access to the system entirely, through devices, marketplaces and integrated logins. Their scale is such that, without action, it is hard to see how competition and innovation will not be stifled.</p><p>The question is therefore not whether to regulate, but how? Of the legislative capitals, Brussels has been most gung-ho to date, leveraging exorbitant fines on Google. Amongst commentators, a common rallying cry is for big tech to be broken up - in the manner that American meat and cigarette monopolies were disbanded at the end of the 19th century.</p><p>These responses are tempting for regulators - they get headlines and look tough. But people don't want companies to be punished for bringing them amazing products, they just want those products to be better controlled and to not feel powerless in the face of these giant firms' strength. For consumers, too, such approaches offer false promise: digital products will cost more and offer less if network effects and economies of scale are lost.</p><p>Instead of breaking up online platforms, regulators should make it much easier to cross-pollinate between them. This means making sure that people leaving one platform can easily take their posts, contacts and photos with them, into storage or to a rival. It might even mean forcing social media to become truly interoperable, just as email, phones and websites have always been, so that everyone has an identifiable marker, and anyone can read and respond to their posts, irrespective of what service they use.</p><p>Next, governments should support data exchanges to help people understand the uses and value of their data, and to sell or donate it securely. Platforms such as Citizen Me and Qntfy are already enabling people to earn money or do good with their data, but data ownership has yet to go mainstream. Only when we have commercial control of our data, in full knowledge of its uses and with ability to trade different aspects of our digital lives, will we take seriously our rights to own it.</p><p>Finally, governments should demand greater transparency for how companies use complex algorithms to manipulate information. Artificial intelligence holds enormous promise, but without proper testing can cause great harm. In the US, algorithms already stand accused of racial bias in the courts, driving gender pay gaps in the gig economy and misdiagnosing patients in hospitals. Companies should be required to test systems in a safe environment, meet legal safety standards, or even publish algorithms for peer review, to reduce unforeseen effects without damaging enterprise.</p><p>Over the past few decades, digital markets have transformed the world immeasurably, and mostly for enormous good. But for a set of technologies founded on principles of plurality and open access, they have also proved remarkably prone to market concentration and abusive power. It is time to fix the error code and return to the commons of the internet.</p><p>Will Tanner was an adviser to Theresa May from 2014-17 and deputy head of the Policy Unit during her first year in 10 Downing Street <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:i@inews.co.uk\">i@inews.co.uk</email></p><p>People don't want companies to be punished for bringing them amazing products</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IINDUK-INMLMMGLSTRY000030228887-ARTICLE-TEXT-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IINDUK2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RTW-49Y1-F072-43RH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">379735</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"758\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Independent Print Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>i-Independent Print Ltd</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"17013\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 9, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>STX000100</classCode><className>ANTITRUST &amp;

'If mankind's so-called technological progress were to become an enemy of the common good, this would lead to an unfortunate regression to a form of barbarism dictated by the law of the strongest,' he said. In a related but contextually different conversation, this summer Joy Buolamwini testified before Congress in questioning with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) that multiple audits found facial recognition technology generally works best on white men and worst on women of color[2]. What these two very different events have in common is their relationship to power dynamics in the AI ethics debate. </p><p>Arguments about AI ethics can wage without mention of the word 'power,' but it's often there just under the surface. It's rarely the direct focus, but it needs to be; power in AI is like gravity, an invisible force that influences every consideration of ethics in artificial intelligence. Power provides the means to influence which use cases are relevant; which problems are priorities; and who the tools, products, and services are made to serve. It underlies debates about how corporations and countries create policy governing use of the technology. It's there in AI conversations about democratization, fairness, and responsible AI. It's there when Google CEO Sundar Pichai moves AI researchers into his office[3] and top machine learning practitioners are treated like modern day philosopher kings. It's there when people like Elon Musk expound on the horrors that future AI technologies may wreak on humanity in decades to come, even though facial recognition technology is being used today to track and detain China's Uighur Muslim population[4]on a massive scale. And it's there when a consumer feels data protection is hopeless or an engineer knows something is ethically questionable but sees no avenue for recourse. Broadly speaking, startups may regard ethics as a nice addition but not a must-have. Engineers working to be first to market and to meet product release deadlines can scoff at the notion that precious time be put aside to consider ethics. CEOs and politicians may pay ethics lip service but end up only sending sympathetic signals or engaging in ethics washing[5]. But AI ethics isn't just a feel-good add-on \u2014 a want but not a need. In fact, AI has been called the greatest human rights challenge of the 21st century. And it's not just about doing the right thing or making the best AI systems possible, it's about who wields power and how AI affects the balance of power in everything it touches. These power dynamics are set to define business, society, government, the lives of individuals around the world, the future of privacy, and even the right to a future. As virtually every AI product manager likes to say, things are just getting started, but failure to address uneven power dynamics in the age of AI can lead to a perilous future.The labor market and the new Gilded AgeA confluence of trends led to the present-day reemergence of AI at a precarious time in history. Deep learning, cloud computing, processors like GPUs, and compute power[6] required to train neural networks faster \u2014 technology that's become a cornerstone of major tech companies \u2014 fuel today's revival. The fourth industrial revolution sits alongside historic income inequality and the new Gilded Age. Like the railroad barons who took advantage of farmers anxious to get their crop to market in the 1800s, tech companies with proprietary data sets use AI to further entrench their market position and monopolies. When data is more valuable than oil, the companies with valuable data have the advantage and are most likely to consolidate wealth or the position of industry leaders. This applies of course to big-name companies like Apple, Facebook, Google, IBM, and Microsoft, but it's also true of large legacy businesses. At the same time, mergers and acquisitions by large businesses continue to accelerate and further consolidate power, a trend that cements other trends, as research and development belongs almost entirely to large businesses. A 2018 SSTI analysis[7] found that companies with 250 employees or more account for 88.5% of R...pending, while companies with 5,000 employees or more account for nearly two-thirds of R...pending. The growing proliferation of AI could lead to great imbalance in society, according to a recent report from the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI (HAI).[8] 'The potential financial advantages of AI are so great, and the chasm between AI haves and have-nots so deep, that the global economic balance as we know it could be rocked by a series of catastrophic tectonic shifts,' reads a proposal from HAI that calls for the U.S. government to invest $120 billion in education, research, and entrepreneurship investments over the next decade. The proposal's co-author is former Google Cloud chief AI scientist Dr. Fei-Fei Li. 'If guided properly, the age of AI could usher in an era of productivity and prosperity for all,' she said. 'PwC estimates[9] AI will deliver $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. However, if we don't harness it responsibly and share the gains equitably, it will lead to greater concentrations of wealth and power for the elite few who usher in this new age \u2014 and poverty, powerlessness, and a lost sense of purpose for the global majority.' Erik Brynjolfsson, director of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy, studies the impact of AI on the future of work. Regarding the number of jobs suitable for machine learning that are likely to be replaced in the years ahead, Brynjolfsson said, 'If you look at the economy overall, there's a tidal wave coming. It's barely hit yet.' Machine intelligence can be used to redesign and augment workplace tasks, but it is most often used to replace jobs, Brynjolfsson said. Automation's impact on job loss is predicted to differ city to city and state to state[10], according to both Brookings Institution analysis and research by Brynjolfsson[11] and Tom Mitchell of Carnegie Mellon University. Fresno, California is expected to get hit harder than Minneapolis, for example, but job instability or loss is expected to disproportionately impact low income households and people of color. A recent McKinsey report[12] says that African-American men are expected to see the greatest job loss as a result of automation. This follows a trend of median income in the United States remaining stagnant since 2000. The end of the rise of median income tied to a rise in productivity is what Brynjolfsson calls 'the great decoupling.' 'For most of the 20th century, those roles in tandem \u2014 more production, more wealth, more productivity \u2014 went hand in hand with the typical person being better off, but recently those lines have diverged,' he said. 'Well, the pie is getting bigger, we're creating more wealth, but it's going to a smaller and smaller subset of people.' Brynjolfsson believes AI community challenges have led to great leaps forward in state-of-the-art AI like the DARPA autonomous vehicle challenge and ImageNet for computer vision, but businesses and the AI community should begin to turn their attention toward shared prosperity[13]. 'It's possible for many people to be left behind and indeed, many people have. And that's why I think the challenge that is most urgent now is not simply more better technology, though I'm all for that, but creating shared prosperity,' he said.Tech giants and access to powerAnother major trend underway as AI spreads is that for the first time in U.S. history, the majority of the workforce are people of color[14]. Most cities in the U.S. \u2014 and in time, the nation as a whole \u2014 will no longer have a racial majority by 2030, according to U.S. Census projections[15]. These demographic shifts make lack of diversity within AI companies all the more glaring. Critically, there's a lack of race and gender diversity in the creation of decision-making systems \u2014 what AI Now Institute director Kate Crawford calls AI's 'white guy problem[16].' Above: Google 2019 gender and race stats for technical workforce representation[17] Image Credit: Google 2019 Diversity Report[18]Only 18% of research published at major AI conferences is done by women[19], while at Facebook and Google, only 15% and 10% of research staff, respectively, are women, according to a 2018 analysis by Wired and Element AI[20]. Google and Facebook do not supply AI research diversity numbers, spokespeople from both companies said. Above: Facebook technical workforce by gender[21] A report released in April[22] by the AI Now Institute details a 'stark cultural divide between the engineering cohort responsible for technical research and the vastly diverse populations where AI systems are deployed.' The group refers to this as 'the AI accountability gap.' The report also recognizes the human labor hidden within AI systems, like the tens of thousands of moderators necessary for Facebook or YouTube content, or the telepresence drivers in Colombia who are remotely driving Kiwibot delivery robots[23] near UC Berkeley in the San Francisco Bay Area. Above: Facebook technical workforce by ethnicity[24] Image Credit: Facebook 2019 Diversity data [25]'The gap between those who develop and profit from AI \u2014 and those most likely to suffer the consequences of its negative effects \u2014 is growing larger, not smaller,' the report reads, citing a lack of government regulation in an AI industry, where power is concentrated among a few companies. Dr. Safiya Noble and Sarah Roberts chronicled the impact of the tech industry's lack of diversity in a paper UCLA published in August[26]. The coauthors argue that we're now witnessing the 'rise of a digital technocracy' that masks itself as post-racial and merit-driven but is actually a power system that hoards resources and is likely to judge a person's value based on racial identity, gender, or class. 'American corporations were not able to 'self-regulate' and 'innovate' an end to racial discrimination \u2014 even under federal law. Among modern digital technology elites, myths of meritocracy and intellectual superiority are used as racial and gender signifiers that disproportionately consolidate resources away from people of color, particularly African Americans, Latinx, and Native Americans,' reads the report. 'Investments in meritocratic myths suppress interrogations of racism and discrimination even as the products of digital elites are infused with racial, class, and gender markers.' Despite much talk about how to solve tech's diversity problem, much of the tech industry has only made incremental progress, and funding for startups with Latinx or black founders still lag behind those for white founders. To address the tech industry's general lack of progress on diversity and inclusion initiatives, a pair of Data ...ciety fellows suggested that tech and AI companies embrace racial literacy. One of those fellows, Mutale Nkonde, is coauthor of the Algorithmic Accountability Act[27], legislation introduced in both houses of Congress earlier this year that charges the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) with assessment of algorithmic bias and allows the agency to issue fines based on company size. She's also executive director of AI for the People and a Berkman Klein Center of Internet and Society fellow at Harvard University. She's now working to assess how artificial intelligence and misinformation may be used to target African-Americans during the 2020 election. A Senate Intelligence committee investigation[28] released in October found that steps to interfere in the 2016 election singled out African-Americans on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Before that, she and a small team worked on advancing the idea of racial literacy[29]. Nkonde and coauthors posit that things like implicit bias training and diversity initiatives \u2014 championed by tech giants that release annual diversity reports \u2014 have failed to move the needle[30] on creating a tech workforce that looks like its users. In order to make meaningful progress going forward, businesses should get rid of such aspirations and begin taking practical steps toward educating people in racial literacy. 'The real goal of building capacity for racial literacy in tech is to imagine a different world, one where we can break free from old patterns,' reads a paper explaining the racial literacy framework[31]. 'Without a deliberate effort to address race in technology, it's inevitable that new tech will recreate old divisions. But it doesn't have to be that way.' Coauthors want racial literacy to become part of the curriculum for computer science students and training for employees at tech companies. Their approach draws on Howard Stevenson's racial literacy training for schools and includes implicit association tests to determine the stereotypes people hold. Racial literacy aims to equip people with training and the emotional intelligence to resolve racially stressful situations in the workplace for computer scientists and designers, as well as machine learning engineers, so people can speak openly about how a product or service can perpetuate structural racism or lead to adverse effects for a diverse group of users. The objective is to allow people to speak in an open and non-confrontational way about what can go wrong[32] and how a product can lead to adverse effects for a diverse group of users. In interviews with employees from mid-sized to large tech companies to prepare the document, the researchers found that in many tech firms, confronting issues associated with race was taboo. 'Many of the barriers that came up in the interviews, and even anecdotally in our lives, is that people don't want to acknowledge race. They want to pretend that it doesn't matter and that everybody is the same, and what that actually does is reinforce racist patterns and behavior,' Nkonde said. 'It would mean companies have to be clear about their values, instead of trying to be all things to all people by avoiding an articulation of their values.' Racial literacy will be increasingly important, Nkonde believes, as companies like Alphabet create services that are of critical importance to people's lives, such as healthcare services or facial recognition software sold to governments. The other intended result of racial literacy training is to create a culture within companies that sees value in a diverse workforce. A Boston Consulting Group study[33] released last year found higher rates of revenue and innovation in organizations that had more diversity. But if hiring and retention numbers are any indication, that message doesn't seem to have reached Silicon Valley tech giants. LinkedIn senior software engineer Guillaume Saint-Jacques thinks AI ethics isn't just the right thing to do; it makes sound business sense if you want to run a profitable company. One of the people behind the Fairness Project[34] launched this summer, Saint-Jacques says bias can get in the way of profit[35]. 'If you're very biased, you might only cater to one population, and eventually that limits the growth of your user base, so from a business perspective you actually want to have everyone come on board, so it's actually a good business decision in the long run,' he said.Individual autonomy and automationPowerful companies may yield their might in different ways to achieve bottom-line goals today, but their business plans have consequences for individuals. Perhaps the best summary of this new power dynamic for the individual comes from The Age of Surveillance Capitalism[36] by retired Harvard Business School professor Shoshana Zuboff. The book details the creation of a new form of capitalism that combines sensors like cameras, smart home devices, and smartphones to gather data that feeds AI systems to make predictions about people's lives \u2014 like how you will behave as a consumer \u2014 in order to 'know and shape our behavior at scale.' 'Surveillance capitalism unilaterally claims human experience as a free raw resource material for translation into behavioral data. Although some of these data [points] are applied to product or service improvement, the rest are declared as a proprietary behavioral surplus, fed into advanced manufacturing proves known as 'machine intelligence' and fabricated into prediction products that anticipate what you do now, soon, and later,' wrote Zuboff. Zuboff argues this economic order was created in Silicon Valley by Google but has since been adopted by Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft, as well as counterparts in China like Baidu and Tencent. Zuboff describes surveillance capitalism as an unprecedented form of power that few even fully understand yet, and there's no effective means of collective or political action that exists to confront it. She questions the havoc that surveillance capitalism might wreak on human nature, when the market 'transforms into a project of total certainty.' Left unchecked, she believes this relatively new market force can overthrow people's sovereignty and become a threat to both Western liberal democracies and to the very notion of being able to 'imagine, intend, promise, and construct a future.' These large companies 'accumulate vast domains of new knowledge from us, but not for us,' she wrote. 'They predict our futures for the sake of others' gain, not ours. As long as surveillance capitalism and its behavioral futures markets are allowed to thrive, ownership of the new means of behavioral modification eclipses ownership of the means of production as the fountainhead of capitalist wealth and power in the 21st century.' A key byproduct of surveillance capitalism, Zuboff argues, is an overwhelming sense of helplessness. That's what you see when people shrug their shoulders and say there's no stopping big tech companies with their massive resources and wealth. Whistleblower Edward Snowden seems to agree with Zuboff's assessment. Metadata collection is increasingly being used by businesses and governments for decision making that impacts human lives, from tracking your movement with a mobile device to China's 'social credit scores.' The purpose of that data, in aggregate, is to take away personal agency, Snowden said in a recent NBC News interview[37] when he was asked why people who do not commit crimes should care about surveillance technology. 'These activity records are being created and shared and collected and intercepted constantly by companies and governments. And ultimately, it means as they sell these, as they trade these, as they make their businesses on the backs of these records, what they are selling is not information. What they're selling is us. They're selling our future. They're selling our past. They're selling our history, our identity, and ultimately, they are stealing our power and making our stories work for them,' he said. Ruha Benjamin, author of the book Race After Technology, is also concerned about the issue of agency, because whether people espouse visions of AI bringing about Armageddon or utopia, both are talking about ceding power to machines. 'Whether it's this idea that technology will save us or slay us, these are both giving up power,' Benjamin said[38] at Deep Learning Indaba, held at Kenyatta University in Nairobi, Kenya. 'They are both giving up our agency in terms of our own role in the design of these technical systems \u2014 that we don't just submit to the default settings the things that others have created, but we have actually tried to embed our own values and imagination into these structures, so we want to move beyond a techno-determinism.' A very different embodiment of the power of the individual has emerged inside major companies. For example, roughly a year ago, more than 20,000 Google employees around the world walked out in protest of multiple ethical issues. These include Android founder Andy Rubin's $90 million payout[39] following alleged sexual harassment, the end of forced arbitration, and Google's participation in the Pentagon's Project Maven, according to organizers[40]. Months after thousands of Google employees signed a letter protesting Google's participation in the AI project for drone object detection, the company pledged to end its Maven contract in 2019[41] and released a set of AI principles, which includes a pledge to not create autonomous weapons[42]. Similarly, Facebook workers have called on CEO Mark Zuckerberg[43] to fact-check or ban political advertising, while employees at Microsoft and GitHub called for the end of a contract with ICE[44], a Department of Homeland Security agency that carries out Trump deportation and detention policies. It takes courage and organization to challenge big tech companies \u2014 especially for those employed by them \u2014 but what these protests are demonstrating is that individuals can regain some agency, even against behemoths.Government and societyIn the present day resurgence of AI, Elon Musk has become like a modern-day Paul Revere, sounding the alarm about killer robots and artificial general intelligence (AGI). When Vladamir Putin famously said that whichever nation controls AI will control the world, Musk responded by saying he thinks the AI arms race will lead to World War III[45]. More than 4,500 AI and robotics researchers[46] and Musk signed a Fight for the Future open letter in opposition to autonomous weapons that act without human intervention. If or when nations introduce killer robots with the power to choose whether people live or die, that may indeed become the ultimate expression of power. But while figures like Musk lavish attention on hypotheticals, facial recognition is already being used in Hong Kong \u2014 likely the main reason the government enacted a ban on masks \u2014 and the Detroit Police Department is already testing real-time facial recognition[47]. And algorithms are returning results thought to negatively impact the lives of millions of African-Americans, with poor performance on people with non-binary gender and people of color. AGI scenarios like The Terminator's Skynet aren't possible yet, but militaries are considering the ethical application of AI. Proliferation of AI among national militaries is a real thing to be worried about as China and Russia charge forward with investments and the Pentagon considers its future steps. The National Security Council on Artificial Intelligence was created by Congress a year ago and last week delivered a draft report about the impact of AI on warfare.[48] What's at stake is nothing less than how 'development of AI will shape the future of power' and how the U.S. can maintain economic and military supremacy. A week earlier, another board made up of tech executives and AI experts introduced AI ethics principles recommendations for the Department of Defense[49]. In evaluating AI's impact on geopolitics and power, the Department of Defense is currently considering a set of AI ethics principles[50] created by some of the nation's chief technologists, like former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, MIT CSAIL director Daniela Rus, and LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman[51]. Deepfakes are a particular source of concern in 2020[52], a U.S. presidential election year, researchers and lawmakers say[53]. Bot networks are being used on Twitter to amplify national agendas, like bots championing the Saudi Arabian government after the murder of former Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi or Russian bots that worked to get Donald Trump elected president in 2016. Bots were also found to be part of a Russian influence campaign carried out in South Africa[54].AI, power, and civil societyAside from the issue of AI being used to control political speech online, power dynamics can also be found when intermediary or advocacy organizations interact with tech giants to advocate for things like a ban on algorithms replacing judges for pretrial bail assessment[55]. Created by AI researchers at companies including Apple, Facebook, and Google, the Partnership on AI brings together groups like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch with the biggest AI companies in the world. In an interview with VentureBeat this summer[56], executive director Terah Lyons said that power is central to the AI ethics debate between the nongovernmental organizations and tech giants that are considering how AI will impact society. 'I think it's central and crucial, and we think in terms of power a lot in our work, because it's an impoverished conversation unless you're talking about it,' she said. 'Power is one of, if not the, central question.' She sees power at play in the lack of diversity in the AI industry and corresponding lack of influence over the way systems and tools are built and deployed, as well as the power and influence of individuals within tech companies and institutions. It's also important to keep those dynamics in mind when civil society and nonprofit agencies with modest resources work with resource-rich tech giants. Groups like the Partnership on AI and Stanford's Institute for Human-Centered AI champion this multi-stakeholder approach to creating representative processes, but staff from nonprofits often can't afford to hop on a plane for a Partnership on AI stakeholders meeting, for example, like the employee of a tech giant could. 'By comparison to these large and especially well-resourced tech companies, there's just a difference in power and resourcing there in many ways, and so empowering them more effectively I think is a big piece of how you start to level the playing field for effective collaboration,' she said. The same travel limitations can impact AI researchers interested in attending international conferences. Roughly half of applicants to a Black in AI workshop at NeurIPS in Montreal, Canada were rejected by immigration officials last year, and applicants report the same situation again this year[57]. Incidents like these have led Partnership on AI to call on nations to create special visas for AI research[58] conference travel, like the kinds made for medical professionals, athletes, and entrepreneurs in some parts of the world.Power relations between nations and tech giantsCasper Klynge is Denmark's ambassador to Silicon Valley. Some countries maintain business and innovation centers in the Bay Area, but Klynge is the first ambassador dispatched to Silicon Valley to specifically represent the diplomatic interests of a nation. The Danish government has sent him to deal with companies like Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook \u2014 which have amassed much of the world's AI talent, as global superpowers. Klynge thinks more small countries should do the same so they can work together on common goals. In his two years in the position, Klynge said he's learned that multilateral coalition building \u2014 banding together with other small nations \u2014 is part of his job. Monopolistic businesses aren't unfamiliar to governments, but Klynge says AI like autonomous driving and search have made tech giants ubiquitous and have changed the game, making tech companies more important to the interests of nations than many other countries. In an interview with VentureBeat last month[59], Klynge argued that tech giants are skewing the nature of international relations and creating a new reality in which countries must treat tech giants like global superpower nations. 'We cannot look at them anymore as being neutral platforms that are just neutral purveyors of whatever people want to do. I think we have to treat them in a more mature and responsible way, which also means that we are less naive, we are more balanced, and also making demands holding them accountable,' he said. 'My job is just a symptom of something more systematic that we are trying to do to get a more balanced, realistic view on technology companies and technology per se.'What next?Power is everywhere in the AI ethics debate, but that doesn't mean we must remain powerless. As the racial literacy project illustrates, there's another way. It's something Ruha Benjamin calls for when she says tech needs 'socially just imaginaries,' and something Cathy O'Neil references in her book Weapons of Math Destruction. 'Big data processes codify the past. They do not invent the future. Doing that requires moral imagination, and that's something only humans can provide,' she writes. A skewed power dynamic has rendered words like 'democratization[60]' virtually meaningless, but putting AI in the hands of more people solving big problems could significantly change perceptions of AI and grow positive influence in human lives. There are already many examples of AI being used to improve human lives, of course. Earlier this year, MIT researchers created an algorithm to get kids to school more quickly and saved the school district $5 million a year in transportation costs. The FDNY and NYU[61] are using AI to improve emergency response times by understanding the most efficient route to a scene \u2014 one of dozens of Google.org projects taking a data-driven approach to the creation of AI for the benefit of humanity[62]. Humans are using AI to build more efficient greenhouses[63] and increase crop yields[64], advances that could help avoid starvation in the decades ahead and feed the world as the global population swells to 10 billion. On and on and on the examples go. But technology that can predict the future, upend the economic and social order, keep people in prison, or make decisions about your health will always mean that right underneath the surface of an impressive technological advance is a power struggle. The power dynamic is there in AI systems that return poorer performance for people of color in bail assessments, healthcare for millions[65], homeless services, and facial recognition. It's also there when EU AI experts[66] urge nations to avoid mass surveillance and instead use AI to empower and augment people. It's there in initiatives from Samsung and the United Nations to use AI to achieve sustainable development goals. It's there in open education projects like fast.ai and a Finnish initiative to educate a portion of the country's population about the basics of AI[67]. It's there in the vision that aggressive climate change goals can help recruit AI talent as Digital Hub Denmark CEO Camilla Rygaard-Hjalsted recently suggested[68] in an interview, or the vision that machine learning applied to climate change could be AI's great moonshot. It's there in fledgling conversational AI projects to protect the children of military service members[69], detect when a gang shooting may take place[70], or field sexual health questions[71] for teenage girls in Pakistan. And it's there in open source projects like Masakhane[72], which is working to create machine translation for more than 2,000 African languages. The project now counts 60 contributors from all corners of the continent to make AI that can preserve and translate these languages. Africa has the youngest population of any continent on Earth and will account for more than half of global population growth between now and 2050, according to United Nations estimates[73]. Machine translation in Africa could be important to powering conversational AI, communication, and commerce online and in the real world. For the past three years, Kathleen Siminyu has led the Women in Machine Learning and Data Science chapter in Nairobi, Kenya. 'I see language as a barrier which, if eliminated, allows a lot of Africans to just be able to engage in the digital economy and eventually in the AI economy. So yeah, as people who are sitting here building for local languages, I feel like it's our responsibility to just bring the people who are not in a digital age into the age of AI,' she told VentureBeat in a phone interview. If you're following only part of the AI ethics debate, it could be easy to draw the conclusion that making AI ethics part of engineering and design processes is some sort of politically correct, corporate social responsibility demand that can get in the way of genuine progress. It's not. AI ethics means making models the best way possible, with humans in mind and in the loop, and it's indispensable to the future of the technology and the systems people choose to run the world. These power dynamics seem most daunting when there's no other vision of the future, no alternative possibility than a jobless planet in a global surveillance state marching toward World War III. Part of the answer to charting a path to a better world is recognition of the role power plays in deciding what's right or wrong, because just as AI can be a tool or a weapon, AI can empower or disadvantage individuals. It's also incumbent on startups, tech giants, and communities who want a better world to dream of what's possible and share those aspirations. AI is transforming society, and it can't just be the privileged few who decide how that will happen or frame what that world looks like. If you want a better world, start building it.

February's long-awaited 'White Paper on Artificial Intelligence' saw Commission Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager commit to balance the risks and benefits of AI through a regulatory framework of \"Excellence\" (innovation) and \"Trust\" (risk mitigation).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Throughout 2019, in the absence of clear rules, businesses jumped on the \"ethics-washing\" bandwagon. The current coronavirus pandemic throws the absence of regulation into even sharper relief: Big Tech companies are using the crisis to encourage the Commission to relax plans to regulate AI, arguing that failing to do so could threaten public health.</p><p>New European rules must not allow powerful actors to co-opt the narrative of trust, ethics - and now, public health - to avoid legally-binding standards. Instead, the protection of fundamental rights must remain the driving force behind the EU's digital plans.</p><p>NO SILVER BULLET</p><p>From developing the Hippocratic oath, to the early internet, ethics has helped to foster democratic societies and push back against harmful applications of new technology. But ethics, trust and excellence are not a comprehensive solution to all of the risks posed by AI. When it comes to justice, healthcare, or other essential areas, it is vital that fundamental rights do not lose out to a desire to be the most innovative, profitable or technologically advanced.</p><p>WHERE IT STARTS TO GO WRONG</p><p>Corporate AI guidelines often make vague ethical commitments in ways that are hard to enforce. This doesn't mean that explainability of systems, accountability for decisions or accurate data are not good things, but rather that a buzzword-driven approach often fails to help the people that are affected, and ignores the fact that technology is not the right solution for every problem.</p><p>Without due care for fundamental rights such as dignity and privacy, the Commission's trust and excellence framework is at risk of falling into the same trap. The White Paper acknowledges that the catch-all term \"Artificial Intelligence\" includes many different systems, and not all present the same risks. But an approach that relies on the goodwill and discretion of Big Tech will be a superficial fix in the context of wider structures of abuse of power and dominance that are rampant across the technology industry. What we need is systemic change to tackle business models that profit from exploiting people and their data.</p><p>A FATAL COLLISION</p><p>Self-driving cars demonstrate the difficulties of translating ethical rules and human judgement into automated decision-making systems. Researchers have struggled with how to answer questions about who or what should be sacrificed in a crash - the \"driver\"?An elderly passerby? And what about the systematic problems many algorithms have identifying black people? The Commission is working on questions like these, but clear rules have proved elusive. What is clear, however, is that simply training algorithms with European data, or applying labels of trustworthiness, will not be enough.</p><p>The White Paper's proposed AI regulation includes online compliance checklists to \"limit the burden\" on tech companies, and exemptions for \"trade secrets\". Tech companies have long exploited ethics to manipulate and have power over governments, control the AI narrative, and ultimately avoid legal controls. The EU's failure to propose mandatory measures for all but the most high-risk applications shows that this industry pressure could be working.</p><p>DON'T THROW THE BABY OUT WITH THE BATHWATER</p><p>EU laws provide tangible protections for the digital rights of people across Europe. Law goes through rigorous, democratic processes, allowing it to put checks and balances on power, demand standards and safeguards, and ensure due process - all of which codify human rights. In contrast, guidelines on ethics, excellence and trust can all be (ab)used to deflect from concrete rights.</p><p>There is an important place for ethics and trust in society. Genuine attempts to make technology fairer, more ecological, transparent or less biased should be applauded. But if we want to tackle harmful business models, algorithmic discrimination and environmental threats, voluntary regulation within an already unequal playing field is simply not enough. Now more than ever, we need the European Commission to cement its global data protection and human rights leadership by ensuring that the regulatory ecosystem for AI is comprehensive, sustainable and accountable to humans (and their rights).</p><p>Any views expressed in this opinion piece are those of the author and not of Thomson Reuters Foundation.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRWEB-202004130666</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRWEB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YN9-23C1-DY15-S2MN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">361904</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"809\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Thomson Reuters Foundation Distributed by AllAfrica Global Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thomson Reuters Foundation</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 06, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Africa</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>ICT and Telecom</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Human Rights</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Legal and Judicial Affairs</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000654</classCode><className>ETHICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921100GM</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION INSTITUTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009PXO</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION LAW</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DF3C</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION REGULATION &amp;

According to the press release, the service \"combines a suite of AI-powered health features that provide actionable insights into overall wellness via the new Amazon Halo app with the Amazon Halo Band, which uses multiple advanced sensors to provide the highly accurate information necessary to power Halo insights.\" Maulik Majmudar, Principal Medical Officer, Amazon Halo, explained: \"Despite the rise in digital health services and devices over the last decade, we have not seen a corresponding improvement in population health in the U.S. We are using Amazon's deep expertise in artificial intelligence and machine learning to offer customers a new way to discover, adopt, and maintain personalized wellness habits. Health is much more than just the number of steps you take in a day or how many hours you sleep. Amazon Halo combines the latest medical science, highly accurate data via the Halo Band sensors, and cutting-edge artificial intelligence to offer a more comprehensive approach to improving your health and wellness.\" Cybersecurity and IoT firm WISeKey International Holding AG (NasdaqGS:WKEY[7]) and AI company arago have reached[8] a final agreement to incorporate WISeAI AG, a joint venture (JV) in Switzerland. Described as \"the first ever end-to-end AIoT platform,\" WISeAI brings together \"arago's AI based Knowledge Automation and Data platform HIRO and WISeKey's Cybersecurity, European Root of Trust and IoT/semiconductors technologies.\" An excerpt from the press release reads: WISeKey's strategy to leverage its technology platform via long-lasting relationships with a strategic partner, is designed to bring a stream of high-profile clients that are in high demand for cybersecurity solutions, such as AI, digital identity and privacy, secure mobile communication, secure cloud computing, IoT, secure semiconductors, Blockchain and other innovative technologies offered by WISeKey.Global Healthcare AI to Reach $51.3 Billion by 2027A report published by Meticulous Research[9] finds that the global Healthcare AI market is expected to reach $51.3 billion by 2027 with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 41.4 percent in the forecast period 2020-2027. An excerpt from the report's description looks at the increased funding for the AI in Healthcare market: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are playing a very important role in the healthcare industry. AI is predominantly used in clinical research, robotic personal assistant, and big data analytics. Classic venture capitalists and corporate strategic investors are both investing generously in this space. According to the report from CB Insights, artificial intelligence-focused health care companies raised nearly $1 billion in funding in the first quarter of 2020. Also, healthcare analytics firm, Tricog Health India Pvt. (India), has raised $10.5 million in a series B round of funding. The start-up helps in the wellness, screening, and diagnosis of acute as well as chronic heart diseases using AI &amp;#38; Machine Learning. The start-up has helped 3 million patients. As of 2020, the private sector continues to play a significant role, with venture capital (VC) funding for the top 50 firms in healthcare-related AI reaching $8.5 billion, and big tech firms, startups, pharmaceutical and medical-devices firms and health insurers, all engaging with the nascent AI healthcare ecosystem. Thus, the rising fund in the healthcare artificial intelligence is expected to fuel the growth in the AI market for healthcare during the forecast period.

Over the past 100 years or so, the unfolding of each new breakthrough technology -- from electricity to the automobile to the internet -- has brought trepidation, then ultimately acceptance. Despite these past experiences, our society seems to have a peculiarly strong resistance to the latest technologies that are radically transforming our lives: artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Perhaps that is not so unreasonable, as the AI/ML revolution is quite different from the revolutions that came before it: It involves giving up, rather than increasing, our control over machines. The internet may be a disruptive force, even an anarchic one, but at the end of the day, it is under human power. A web page will always do what a human web designer or programmer coded it to do, bugs and glitches notwithstanding. ML models are a different thing altogether. Yes, we humans set up the parameters within which they run, but ultimately, they make decisions according to logic our minds can't always interpret.</p><p>Even the way we interact with computers has changed. In the last 15 years alone, we have gone from controlling them via a keyboard/mouse input to swiping their screens with our fingertips to simply using our voices to talk to them as we would with another person, thanks to advances in natural language processing. Not only can computers do more complex work than they could in 1998 or 2008, we also interact with them in a way that puts them on almost an equal footing with us. No wonder many find the AI/ML revolution a bit unnerving.</p><p>Then there is the lightning-fast pace of change. The field of AI/ML is constantly evolving, so that 2018 models are significantly faster and more accurate than ones from 2017. New innovations further accelerate the pace. For example, the past year or so has seen wider application of transfer learning, a time-saving technique that lets data scientists adapt an existing pre-trained model to a new task. Transfer learning lets those with fewer resources piggyback off the work of major research institutions and big tech companies, vastly decreasing the time and resources required to build a highly sophisticated and accurate model.</p><p>It's an understandable impulse to cling to the familiar by keeping humans in total control of computing processes. However, it would be incredibly wrongheaded. Society stands to gain immensely from the automation of rote work and the greater accuracy of ML-driven insight. So how can we move forward when the ultimate hurdle for technology is not the pace of possible advancement, but rather the mindset of its masters?</p><p>The answer may be that those of us who wish to advance AI/ML solutions must take care to address stakeholders' concerns while also emphasizing the technology's potential benefits. It is vital to offer a positive vision for the future, not just assurances against harm.</p><p>The healthcare industry is dealing with this challenge as it gradually adopts ML-driven tools that supplement human judgment. Researchers at Google recently trained deep learning algorithms to gauge a patient's cardiovascular health based on photos of their eyes. In the future, doctors may not have to rely on blood tests to measure a patient's cholesterol levels or their risk of heart disease.</p><p>In our experience, medical personnel often have credible concerns that hospital management implementing an AI/ML solution should take care to address. Will the technology add a step in their already hectic workflow? If a ML model makes a mistake that impacts a patient's well-being, could a nurse's license be on the line? Healthcare providers may be more willing to try out AI/ML solutions once these issues are discussed, along with the potential time- and labor-savings of automation.</p><p>The stakes are different, but no less critical for CEOs tasked with managing financial, legal, and reputational risk for an entire organization. Here, transparency becomes a key concern, in two directions.</p><p>Current regulatory frameworks depend on transparency of outcome, meaning that firms need to be able to explain to regulators why a certain decision was made or how a certain result came about. Most AI/ML solutions, however, are \"black boxes\" that can offer no such rationale. This can make conversations with regulators uneasy, which is an understandable concern for any business leaders, but especially those in the pharmaceutical, finance, and healthcare industries. For an AI/ML evangelist in these sectors, crafting a plan that addresses how a solution will interact with regulations will be key. However, so will painting a picture of the higher profit margins and increased efficiencies that will become possible with AI/ML integration.</p><p>Greater transparency of outcomes with AI/ML might be possible with improvements in transparency of data. Today firms keep a tight grip on proprietary data, as well as sensitive medical, insurance, and financial information. That can make it difficult to see what data has been fed into a given AI/ML system, which exacerbates the \"black box\" problem. It's a bit of a Catch-22: Firms want to know how a given model works before they feed it their precious data. But until they loosen their grips on their data, it will be hard to understand how any model works. As AI/ML becomes more trusted, a second step will be for regulators, business leaders, and other stakeholders to open access to protected data and increase transparency.</p><p>Technology makes things faster, easier, and more cost effective. As a result, it is likely that machines will be making more decisions for us, and in some cases outpacing us in how quickly they can grow and develop. Companies, despite profit opportunities, may not fully adapt to this reality until society does as well. To liberate the full potential of machine learning as fast as possible, we'll need a broader shift in our way of thinking as the technology progresses. Transparency about how an algorithm predicts an outcome and what data it uses is a first step towards the change.</p><p>Manuel Amunategui is vice president of data science at SpringML, where his team specializes in building predictive analytics solutions across multiple industries.

We've understood that AI will create more opportunities for businesses to be digital leaders in their respective fields. Creating opportunities is especially true for sales organizations. But, AI is not the holy grail of sales, at least not yet.Sales reps live, eat and breathe customer relationships.Striving for excellence in customer relationships is why AI is so appealing to the sales industry[1]. AI can help reps unlock their customers' needs, see gaps in coverage territories by alerting sales to the regions and customers who need more attention. </p><p>From a performance standpoint, AI can enable sales operations to uncover which reps are underperforming and what compensation tactics are needed to boost that performance. But AI's potential is not all that it may seem. In fact, sales data is falling short[2], specifically with buyer data and intelligence - a key metric that has a big influence over sales strategies.If AI is not living up to the hype, then it's a wonder why we still hear this narrative year after year.The reality is, AI is only as powerful as the data organizations are putting into their systems in the first place. The data may, unfortunately, not be very good. If the promise of AI can be achieved, it's just going to take a little longer than most people think. In order for AI to indeed be a transformative force in business,sales organizations[3] should focus efforts on the basics to establish processes that more accurately collect, store, and analyze only the data. With correct methods, AI can have the potential to make a real impact on their business operations. For many organizations, that data already lives[4] in their sales performance compensation systems \u2014 they just haven't realized it yet.Look at the steps sales should take first to get their data under control. Out with the OldThe first step is for organizations to replace legacy systems[5] with automated processes that consolidate and harmonize data. One way to achieve this is by using no-code extract, transform, and load (ETL) tools. These tools enable sales to quickly validate and pre-process data by giving reps the power to make changes or additions to the data management process themselves without needing to involve expert developers or the IT team.No-code tools.No-code tools[6] also arm sales with integrated data that can be quickly analyzed to uncover actionable insights, which are imperative for leaders to make more informed and impactful decisions that help sales reps focus on the right opportunities.Replacing legacy infrastructure.Replacing the legacy infrastructure may be easier said than done since updating these systems takes time and manpower resources. The long-term rewards are worth that initial headache. Automated systems free up resources so that sales can focus on executing their strategy to meet company goals[7] instead of wasting time updating manual datasheets.Single Source of Truth.Sales create a lot of data, no question. The data comes in a variety of formats that are stored in siloed, disparate repositories. Sales needs to connect those sources together into one 'single source of truth.' The real story is not all that hard to find since it already lives in every organization within their sales performance management[8] (SPM) systems. To get to the single source of truth, sales should implement an automated[9] data management framework that ensures the data gathering process is being consistently updated and cleansed. The data management system makes it easier for sales reps to report their data, leading to a more complete and accurate data set. It only makes sense that data that is linked to money would be the most accurate because it is the most scrutinized and the most regulated. With insights gleaned from their SPM platforms, sales can make timely, actionable insights to meet their goals.Clean Your Data.Once data has been gathered into a centralized location, the sales team needs easy access to glean actionable insights from it. Unclean, disorganized and decentralized data is useless to a sales organization. Lousy data, and can negatively impact compensations and sales operations processes, not to mention other vital business decisions. Cleaning and centralizing data can be a highly technical and very intensive task.Store clean data.The key to storing relevant data is not through the storage methodology, but instead through the way the data is processed. Technology[10] that can automate centralization and other relevant data sets can improve the speed of data processing to ensure that sales always has access to the most relevant, accurate, and comprehensive set of data.Clean, untangled data uncovers insights into past and present performance.With clean data will allow sales to model predictive scenarios for all aspects of their strategy. It also gives salespeople in the field the information they need to seize high-potential opportunities and close deals more successfully.Set Clear Goals.After sales have automated, organized, and cleaned all its data, they must focus on setting company goals with clockwork precision for AI to truly work for their organization. Sales should clearly define these goals[11] and make them easy to understand by narrowing them down into a single question: what type of event or behavior from the past should be replicated or avoided in the future? For example, sales can crunch large amounts of historical data about the deals the company has both won and lost. The large historical data helps sales to understand which current deals are most likely to close. Using the extensive information, sales reps can uncover insights[12] into their highest earning opportunities. Focusing on the deals, they can win and enabling them to deliver the highest ROI.Access Accurate Macrodata and Microdata.Before organizations can reap any rewards promised by AI, they must first learn to access accurate, up-to-the-minute macro and micro-level data. Following the steps above is the key to unlocking critical business indicators[13] that lead to informed, strategic decisions that maximize sales opportunities. With the correct, cleaned data, only then will AI go on its way to become the 'Holy Grail' it has long promised it would be.

Oversight of any harms will be voluntary self-regulation by my business.</p><p>Would people stand for this? Doubtful, but that's exactly what's happening with artificial intelligence.</p><p>Society is one big AI experiment right now: we're the testing ground for a massive techno-economic transformation we've not consented to and that most of us don't even understand properly. AI is being deployed across society with little input into what we actually want from it.</p><p>Our experimental status is evidenced, for example, in the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal: our very personal political decisions, choices, and discussions have been distorted and trashed with little comeuppance for the Big Tech companies intent on making a buck at the expense of spreading misinformation, disinformation, and outright lies. And it looks like this will be the new normal until we can rein in the algorithms developed by Facebook, YouTube, Google, and others.</p><p>A key policy approach for addressing this AI roll-out is something called \"agile governance,\" promoted especially by international institutions like the World Economic Forum. In this framework, we, as individuals and a society, are supposed to adapt to the emerging AI technologies that we don't understand, and aren't even expected to bother understanding. It entails shifting oversight of new technologies from the government to the private sector, and comes across as another term for \"leave it to the market\" - which today really means leave it to a Big Tech monopoly.</p><p>Instead of this state of affairs, we need a more nuanced approach to emerging AI technologies in order to understand how they're going to reconfigure our societies, yes, but also how our societies configure these technologies in our own image.</p><p>AI, in particular, is often premised on taking our personal data - usually with our (un)informed consent - and using it to train algorithms, claiming any resulting inferences (data on our data) derived from that training as proprietary.</p><p>At its core, it's about turning our personal data into a private asset. Importantly, though, our personal data often consists of an array of problematic biases, narrow-minded stereotypes, and egregious prejudices. Our social, political, and economic assumptions and expectations are built into AI, including the assumption that it's just too complex and quick-moving for slow government and regulators to keep up with.</p><p>To properly get at these issues, we have to go beyond the simplistic notion that all we need to do is analyze the implications of AI for society: instead we need to study how these social, political, and economic assumptions configure AI in certain ways and not others. A clear example of this is the critique by Safiya Noble, Professor at UCLA, of the racist assumptions underpinning the search algorithms deployed by Google.</p><p>Instead of succumbing to the simplistic view, then, it makes more sense to take a pro-active approach to AI and to set out explicitly what we want to achieve with it - socially, politically, economically. Do we want it to be used to destabilize democratic debate and elections? Probably not, so let's regulate against that outcome now and not after it happens.</p><p>My suggestion would be to establish an equivalent of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for AI whose regulatory purpose is to evaluate and judge the potential effects of AI projects before they are unleashed on the world. Rather than a regulatory free-for-all, we need to decide what we want from AI and we need to regulate what we don't want.</p><p>If we want to stop the spread of lies, then we should make it illegal; if we want to stop algorithmic prejudice, then we should test for it; if we want to stop algorithmic tacit collusion in automated price-setting, then we should ban it. And we should do so now.</p><p>Kean Birch is an associate professor in and graduate program director of the science and technology studies graduate program at York University.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2020011356853695</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XYV-CW01-DY91-K51G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"729\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 13, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

AI Now 2019 report AI Now's 2019 report is out, and it's exactly as dismaying as we thought it would be. The good news is that the threat of biased AI and Orwellian surveillance systems no longer hangs over our collective heads like an artificial Sword of Damocles. The bad news: the threat's gone because it's become our reality. </p><p>Welcome to 1984. The annual report from AI Now is a deep-dive into the industry conducted by the AI Now Institute[1] at New York University. Its focused on the social impact that AI use has on humans, communities, and the population at large. It sources information and analysis from experts in myriad disciplines around the world and works closely with partners throughout the IT, legal, and civil rights communities. This year's report begins with twelve recommendations based on the institute's conclusions: Regulators should ban the use of affect recognition in important decisions that impact people's lives and access to opportunities. Government and business should halt all use of facial recognition in sensitive social and political contexts until the risks are fully studied and adequate regulations are in place. The AI industry needs to make significant structural changes to address systemic racism, misogyny, and lack of diversity. AI bias research should move beyond technical fixes to address the broader politics and consequences of AI's use. Governments should mandate public disclosure of the AI industry's climate impact. Workers should have the right to contest exploitative and invasive AI\u2014and unions can help. Tech workers should have the right to know what they are building and to contest unethical or harmful uses of their work. States should craft expanded biometric privacy laws that regulate both public and private actors. Lawmakers need to regulate the integration of public and private surveillance infrastructures. Algorithmic Impact Assessments must account for AI's impact on climate, health, and geographical displacement. Machine learning researchers should account for potential risks and harms and better document the origins of their models and data. Lawmakers should require informed consent for use of any personal data in health-related AI. The permeating theme here seems to be that corporations and governments need to stop passing the buck when it comes to social and ethical accountability. A lack of regulation and ethical oversight has lead to a near total surveillance state in the US. And the use of black box systems throughout the judiciary and financial systems has proliferated even though such AI has been proven to be inherently biased. AI Now notes that these entities saw a significant amount of push-back from activist groups and pundits, but also points out that this has done relatively little to stem the flow of harmful AI:Despite growing public concern and regulatory action, the roll-out of facial recognition and other risky AI technologies has barely slowed down. So-called 'smart city' projects around the world are consolidating power over civic life in the hands of for-profit technology companies, putting them in charge of managing critical resources and information. For example, Google's Sidewalk Labs project even promoted the creation of a Google-managed citizen credit score as part of its plan for public-private partnerships like Sidewalk Toronto. And Amazon heavily marketed its Ring, an AI-enabled home-surveillance video camera. The company partnered with over 700 police departments, using police as salespeople to convince residents to buy the system. In exchange, law enforcement was granted easier access to Ring surveillance footage. Meanwhile, companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google are fighting to be first in line for massive government contracts to grow the use of AI for tracking and surveillance of refugees and residents, along with the proliferation of biometric identity systems, contributing to the overall surveillance infrastructure run by private tech companies and made available to governments.The report also gets into 'affect recognition' AI, a subset of facial recognition that's made its way into schools and businesses around the world. Companies use it during job interviews to, supposedly, tell if an applicant is being truthful and on production floors to determine who is being productive and attentive. It's a bunch of crap though, as a recent comprehensive review[2] of research from multiple teams concluded. Per the AI Now 2019 report: Critics also noted the similarities between the logic of affect recognition, in which personal worth and character are supposedly discernible from physical characteristics, and discredited race science and physiognomy, which was used to claim that biological differences justified social inequality. Yet in spite of this, AI-enabled affect recognition continues to be deployed at scale across environments from classrooms to job interviews, informing sensitive determinations about who is 'productive' or who is a 'good worker,' often without people's knowledge. At this point, it seems any company that develops or deploys AI technology that can be used to discriminate - especially black box technology that claims to understand what a person is thinking or feeling - is willfully investing in discrimination. We're long past the time that corporations and governments can feign ignorance on the matter. This is especially true when it comes to surveillance. In the US, like China, we're now under constant public and private surveillance. Cameras record our every move in public at work, in our schools, and in our own neighborhoods. And, worst of all, not only did the government use our tax dollars to pay for all of it,millions of us unwittingly purchased, mounted, and maintained the surveillance gear ourselves. AI Now wrote:Amazon exemplified this new wave of commercial surveillance tech with Ring, a smart-security-device company acquired by Amazon in 2018. The central product is its video doorbell, which allows Ring users to see, talk to, and record those who come to their doorsteps. This is paired with a neighborhood watch app called 'Neighbors,' which allows users to post instances of crime or safety issues in their community and comment with additional information, including photos and videos A series of reports reveals that Amazon had negotiated Ring video-sharing partnerships with more than 700 police departments across the US. Partnerships give police a direct portal through which to request videos from Ring users in the event of a nearby crime investigation. Not only is Amazon encouraging police departments to use and market Ring products by providing discounts, but it also coaches police on how to successfully request surveillance footage from Neighbors through their special portal. As Chris Gilliard, a professor who studies digital redlining and discriminatory practices, comments: 'Amazon is essentially coaching police on . . . how to do their jobs, and . . . how to promote Ring products.The big concern here is that the entrenchment of these surveillance systems could become so deep that the law enforcement community would treat their extrication the same as if we were trying to disarm them. Here's why: In the US, cops are supposed to get a warrant to invade our privacy if they suspect criminal activity. But they don't need one to use Amazon's Neighbors app or Palantir's horrifying LEO app[3]. With these,Police can essentiallyperform digital stop-and-frisks on any person they come into contact with using AI-powered tools. AI Now warns that these problems \u2014 biased AI, discriminatory facial recognition systems, and AI-powered surveillance \u2014 cannot be solved by patching systems or tweaking algorithms. We can't 'version 2.0' our way out of this mess. In the US, we'll continue our descent into this Orwellian nightmare as long as we continue to vote for politicians that support the surveillance state, discriminatory black-box AI systems, and the Wild West atmosphere that big tech exists in today. Amazon and Palantir shouldn't have the ultimate decision over how much privacy we're entitled to. If you'd like to read the full 60-page report, it's available online here[4].
