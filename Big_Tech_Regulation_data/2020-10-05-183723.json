When it comes to freedom of speech, everyone has a right to their opinion as long as it is not inaccurate, hateful, defamatory or malicious. If that line is crossed, the perpetrators are legally liable for damages. But in America, the world's most irresponsible media empires - Twitter, Facebook and Google (now Alphabet) - have become giants that allow anyone to spew anything without legal consequences.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They have gotten away with it by claiming that they are platforms, not publishers, and are therefore exempt from having to edit or curate what people post. They've also spent billions of dollars lobbying and supporting political campaigns, in order to retain this corrosive privilege. By contrast, traditional media is hobbled with the costs of curating responsible advertising and editorial content.</p><p>This free pass to social media is the loophole through which that reckless, self-promoter named Donald Trump tweeted his way into the White House. It's how he and other trolls intimidate, bully and slander their foes.</p><p>Europe has begun reining in social media, but elsewhere, these companies operate with impunity and claim that they are entitled to self-regulate. But monkeys cannot guard bananas, and Trump's recent, and most vile, gaming of Twitter illustrates why the same rules should apply to social media as they apply to everyone else.</p><p>Last week, Trump smeared a critic, MSNBC's Joe Scarborough, blaming him for the death of his assistant, Lori Klausutis, when Scarborough was serving in Congress in 2001, even though there is no evidence of any wrongdoing. The president tweeted on the subject six times, calling the woman's death a \"cold case\" that should be investigated, then essentially accusing Scarborough of murder. Twitter refused to remove the tweets, even after the woman's widower, T.J. Klausutis, wrote to Twitter's president and pointed out the injustice and the social network's hypocrisy.</p><p>\"Nearly 19 years ago, my wife, who had an undiagnosed heart condition, fell and hit her head on her desk at work. She was found dead the next morning,\" he wrote. \"The president's tweet that suggests that Lori was murdered - without evidence (and contrary to the official autopsy) - is a violation of Twitter's community rules and terms of service. An ordinary user like me would be banished from the platform for such a tweet but I am only asking that these tweets be removed.\"</p><p>Twitter refused to comment on the issue. Meanwhile, Facebook, to which Trump's unsupported allegation and libel was cross-posted, responded arrogantly: \"We do not remove political speech solely because people may find it offensive, as this content understandably is to the family of Lori Klausutis and others. Speech from candidates and heads of state is among the most scrutinized content on our platform, which helps ensure people are held accountable for their words.\"</p><p>This week, Twitter finally did something to bridle this presidential misbehaviour when it labelled a pair of Trump's tweets, which claimed that mail-in balloting in this fall's election would result in widespread voter fraud, as misleading. (No labels have been applied to the Scarborough tweets.)</p><p>Trump erupted and has threatened to take action against Twitter and social media in general. Then he conflated this into a fight for freedom and tweeted: \"Big Tech is doing everything in their considerable power to CENSOR in advance of the 2020 election. If that happens, we no longer have our freedom. I will never let that happen! They tried hard in 2016, and lost. Now they are going absolutely crazy. Stay tuned!!!\" This from a president who labels all critical media as \"fake news\" and has driven his tank through social media's anything-goes loophole to damage people, organizations, groups and democracy.</p><p>What's next is that Trump will character assassinate all his opponents and, if he loses the election, he will simply tweet that it was stolen and he's not leaving.

Eric Schmidt said that technology companies operated at three times the pace of ordinary business. Watchdogs, meanwhile, run three times more slowly than normal enterprises.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Google, therefore, moved at nine times the velocity of its overseers, Mr Schmidt claimed. To stay ahead, the company needed to ensure that the government \"does not get in the way and slow things down\".</p><p>As a commercial strategy, staying one step ahead of regulators has been an unqualified success for Google. Since 2011, its market value has quadrupled to $800 billion. Wall Street has amply rewarded the company for using its near-monopoly in internet search to break into a multitude of adjacent arenas, even as it left a trail of wreckage in its wake.</p><p>This week an official report was published into one of the sectors most affected by the rise of Google and Facebook - the local news industry. The exercise feels like a validation of Mr Schmidt's musings on the glacial pace of regulation.</p><p>The Cairncross review contains many worthy ideas to resuscitate the business of providing regional news. It's an activity that's fundamental to the proper functioning of democracy, but whose economic model has been hollowed out over the past decade. However, Dame Frances Cairncross admitted that she was powerless to address the root cause of the regional news industry's woes - the iron grip exerted by Facebook and Google over Britain's \u00a310 billion online advertising industry. She has recommended an investigation and Jeremy Wright, the culture secretary, has asked the Competition and Markets Authority to look into potential abuses. He stopped short, however, of ordering an official inquiry.</p><p>Ministers have grown fond of issuing glib threats to hit big tech with unspecified new regulations. If they could tear themselves away from the Brexit imbroglio and read Dame Frances' study, ministers would soon understand the need for an urgent investigation.</p><p>The duopoly have a strong influence on the local news industry in three ways, according to the Cairncross review. First, Google and Facebook are the primary source of news for many Britons. Publishers may not like handing the technology giants a slice of ad revenues when readers click on an article, but, given Google's and Facebook's role as distributors, they have little choice.</p><p>Second, Google and Facebook have an unparalleled trove of personal information on the 90 per cent of British adults who regularly use the internet. Through sophisticated analysis of their online behaviour, they can accurately predict which adverts would be most effective to place on our smartphone screen at any given time. This gives Facebook and Google a huge advantage over publishers in the fight for advertising revenues.</p><p>Third, the pair control much of the infrastructure underpinning the online advertising market. Google, for instance, is an extensive publisher its own right, with advertising slots to sell. However, it also owns the technology platforms that connect advertisers with publishers and many of the tools marketing chiefs use to measure the efficacy of their digital campaigns. According to Cairncross, publishers receive on average only 62p from every pound spent by advertisers; the rest is siphoned off by the tech middlemen. The process is \"not easily visible\" to buyers or sellers of online adverts, so it is ripe for profit gouging by unscrupulous actors.</p><p>Germany and Australia have made credible moves to curb the power of Facebook over their digital economies and democratic processes. If this government was truly interested in reclaiming control, it would be following their lead instead of bickering over the Irish border.</p><p>                   Simon Duke is Technology Business Editor of The Times                 </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-51725034</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VDN-MF01-JCJY-G339-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"641\"/><timeReceived>5:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 13, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Eric Schmidt said that technology companies operated at three times the pace of ordinary business. Watchdogs, meanwhile, run three times more slowly than normal enterprises.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Google, therefore, moved at nine times the velocity of its overseers, Mr Schmidt claimed. To stay ahead, the company needed to ensure that the government \"does not get in the way and slow things down\".</p><p>As a commercial strategy, staying one step ahead of regulators has been an unqualified success for Google. Since 2011, its market value has quadrupled to $800billion. Wall Street has amply rewarded the company for using its nearmonopoly in internet search to break into a multitude of adjacent arenas, even as it left a trail of wreckage in its wake.</p><p>This week an official report was published into one of the sectors most affected by the rise of Google and Facebook - the local news industry. The exercise feels like a validation of Mr Schmidt's musings on the glacial pace of regulation.</p><p>The Cairncross review contains many worthy ideas to resuscitate the business of providing regional news. It's an activity that's fundamental to the proper functioning of democracy, but whose economic model has been hollowed out over the past decade. However, Dame Frances Cairncross admitted that she was powerless to address the root cause of the regional news industry's woes - the iron grip exerted by Facebook and Google over Britain's \u00a310billion online advertising industry. She has recommended an investigation and Jeremy Wright, the culture secretary, has asked the Competition and Markets Authority to look into potential abuses. He stopped short, however, of ordering an official inquir y.</p><p>Ministers have grown fond of issuing glib threats to hit big tech with unspecified new regulations. If they could tear themselves away from the Brexit imbroglio and read Dame Frances' study, ministers would soon understand the need for an urgent investigation.</p><p>The duopoly have a strong influence on the local news industry in three ways, according to the Cairncross review. First, Google and Facebook are the primary source of news for many Britons. Publishers may not like handing the technology giants a slice of ad revenues when readers click on an article, but, given Google's and Facebook's role as distributors, they have little choice.</p><p>Second, Google and Facebook have an unparalleled trove of personal information on the 90 per cent of British adults who regularly use the internet. Through sophisticated analysis of their online behaviour, they can accurately predict which adverts would be most effective to place on our smartphone screen at any given time. This gives Facebook and Google a huge advantage over publishers in the fight for advertising revenues.</p><p>Third, the pair control much of the infrastructure underpinning the online advertising market. Google, for instance, is an extensive publisher its own right, with advertising slots to sell. However, it also owns the technology platforms that connect advertisers with publishers and many of the tools marketing chiefs use to measure the efficacy of their digital campaigns.</p><p>According to Cairncross, publishers receive on average only 62p from every pound spent by advertisers; the rest is siphoned off by the tech middlemen. The process is \"not easily visible\" to buyers or sellers of online adverts, so it is ripe for profit gouging by unscrupulous actors.</p><p>Germany and Australia have made credible moves to curb the power of Facebook over their digital economies and democratic processes. If this government was truly interested in reclaiming control, it would be following their lead instead of bickering over the Irish border.</p><p>Simon Duke is Technology Business Editor of The Times</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-146445761</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VDT-F1H1-JCBW-N301-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"635\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 14, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The pandemic has brought into sharp focus the fact that old, weathered binaries like developed versus developing (or \"emerging\") countries no longer hold relevance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Rugged and unbridled capitalism has been encoded deep within the United States of America's political DNA almost since its inception as a nation-state. This has exposed the inability of America's fragmented health-care sector to respond to the pandemic. The for-profit motive has meant, for example, that hospitals did not maintain stocks of personal protective equipment or ventilators.</p><p>For decades, there has been a carefree osmosis between American big business and its political class.</p><p>This has prevented successive US administrations from inserting themselves too strongly into areas of economic activity dominated by the private sector (such as health care) or levying more stringent regulations.</p><p>Even the mainstream left in the US shies away from a full-throated endorsement of universal health care. At the same time, American politicians continue to debate whether to regulate big tech even as social-media platforms are used to derail America's democracy.</p><p>Arab Gulf monarchies, by contrast, have chosen to follow a Singapore-style corporatist model where the state, in effect, runs for-profit conglomerates. This perhaps explains why countries in the Gulf region such as the United Arab Emirates have been able to marshal significant private-sector resources and expertise toward combating the pandemic.</p><p>Nevertheless, low oil prices and an exodus of white-collar expatriates mean that these countries too will need to reinvent their economic models very soon.</p><p>Contrast the American type of political economy with France or Scandinavian countries. In these countries, sector-by-sector collective bargaining by labor has meant decent wages and better working conditions. Unlike Americans, Scandinavians do not need to work two jobs just to put food on the table while a small slice of the population controls vast swaths of the economy.</p><p>In several European countries, health care is regarded as a public good whose provision is seen as the state's fundamental duty.</p><p>This is not to suggest that these models are perfect. Unlike in the US, France's official data on income inequality do not capture racial disparity. French nationalism and the institutions that flow out of it simply do not see race. This does not augur well for racial harmony or economic equality - both closely intertwined in France and the US.</p><p>The pandemic has also revealed whether countries' governing models are fit for purpose. It is no longer sufficient to classify countries simply as liberal democracies or illiberal autocracies. Indeed, demagogues like Rodrigo Duterte, Narendra Modi and Viktor Orban, who have all taken a sledgehammer to their countries' democratic institutions in the recent past, all emerged via the ballot box.</p><p>Another way of classifying countries politically could be via their governance models. American federalism, with its strong local and state governments, ought to have been a more competent model to combat the pandemic. However, its designers probably did not anticipate the dysfunctions of a two-party system.</p><p>American federalism, coupled with its two-party system, and with a megalomaniacal president at the helm, is the key reason the country is marked by such a dismal record when it comes to combating the pandemic. On the other hand, strong top-down actions by centralized states in Vietnam and South Korea have seen these countries combat the pandemic rather successfully.</p><p>Only a single-party dictatorship like China could have subjected its population to mass surveillance and stringent lockdowns. In Vietnam, entire districts were sealed by the government, with no one allowed to enter or leave. Actions taken by the Chinese and Vietnamese states would have been politically unpalatable in democracies. Yet they worked.</p><p>But this is not to rubbish the virtues of liberal, open democracies. For the flip side to this argument is that precisely because China is not an open society, the virus spun out of control in its initial days. Were the virus to have broken out in more open societies, the press and civil society would have been the first to raise the alarm.</p><p>Countries' individual histories also have to be taken into account. High levels of trust between citizens and the state have been the reason South Koreans have en masse downloaded contact-tracing apps and agreed to temporary restrictions on their liberties. Contrast this with the anti-mask movement in the US, where suspicion of government has deep historical roots.</p><p>There are also wide disparities within \"developing\" countries such as India. While the number of infections continues to skyrocket throughout India, the southern state of Kerala has won international plaudits for its successful management of the pandemic.</p><p>It did this through decades-long and bipartisan public investment in primary health care closely linked with empowered local governance.</p><p>As a consequence, there is strong public trust in government institutions in Kerala; the state has human development indicators parallel to those in the West.</p><p>The pandemic has been a stringent stress-test for countries' political and economic models. \"Developed\" democracies like the US have failed miserably in combating the virus, whereas \"developing\" non-democracies have managed well.</p><p>Should this outcome-based approach be the basis on which to develop a new classification for countries? It is a question worth considering.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Statesman.

The pandemic has brought into sharp focus the fact that old, weathered binaries like developed versus developing (or \u201cemerging\u201d) countries no longer hold relevance.     Rugged and unbridled capitalism has been encoded deep within the United States of America\u2019s political DNA almost since its inception as a nation-state. This has exposed the inability of America\u2019s fragmented health-care sector to respond to the pandemic. The for-profit motive has meant, for example, that hospitals did not maintain stocks of personal protective equipment or ventilators.    For decades, there has been a carefree osmosis between American big business and its political class. This has prevented successive US administrations from inserting themselves too strongly into areas of economic activity dominated by the private sector (such as health care) or levying more stringent regulations.    Even the mainstream left in the US shies away from a full-throated endorsement of universal health care. At the same time, American politicians continue to debate whether to regulate big tech even as social-media platforms are used to derail America\u2019s democracy.     Arab Gulf monarchies, by contrast, have chosen to follow a Singapore-style corporatist model where the state, in effect, runs for-profit conglomerates. This perhaps explains why countries in the Gulf region such as the United Arab Emirates have been able to marshal significant private-sector resources and expertise toward combating the pandemic.    Nevertheless, low oil prices and an exodus of white-collar expatriates mean that these countries too will need to reinvent their economic models very soon.    Contrast the American type of political economy with France or Scandinavian countries. In these countries, sector-by-sector collective bargaining by labor has meant decent wages and better working conditions. Unlike Americans, Scandinavians do not need to work two jobs just to put food on the table while a small slice of the population controls vast swaths of the economy.    In several European countries, health care is regarded as a public good whose provision is seen as the state\u2019s fundamental duty.    This is not to suggest that these models are perfect. Unlike in the US, France\u2019s official data on income inequality do not capture racial disparity. French nationalism and the institutions that flow out of it simply do not see race. This does not augur well for racial harmony or economic equality \u2013 both closely intertwined in France and the US.    The pandemic has also revealed whether countries\u2019 governing models are fit for purpose. It is no longer sufficient to classify countries simply as liberal democracies or illiberal autocracies. Indeed, demagogues like Rodrigo Duterte, Narendra Modi and Viktor Orban, who have all taken a sledgehammer to their countries\u2019 democratic institutions in the recent past, all emerged via the ballot box.    Another way of classifying countries politically could be via their governance models.  American federalism, with its strong local and state governments, ought to have been a more competent model to combat the pandemic. However, its designers probably did not anticipate the dysfunctions of a two-party system.    American federalism, coupled with its two-party system, and with a megalomaniacal president at the helm, is the key reason the country is marked by such a dismal record when it comes to combating the pandemic. On the other hand, strong top-down actions by centralized states in Vietnam and South Korea have seen these countries combat the pandemic rather successfully.    Only a single-party dictatorship like China could have subjected its population to mass surveillance and stringent lockdowns. In Vietnam, entire districts were sealed by the government, with no one allowed to enter or leave. Actions taken by the Chinese and Vietnamese states would have been politically unpalatable in democracies. Yet they worked.    But this is not to rubbish the virtues of liberal, open democracies. For the flip side to this argument is that precisely because China is not an open society, the virus spun out of control in its initial days. Were the virus to have broken out in more open societies, the press and civil society would have been the first to raise the alarm.    Countries\u2019 individual histories also have to be taken into account. High levels of trust between citizens and the state have been the reason South Koreans have en masse downloaded contact-tracing apps and agreed to temporary restrictions on their liberties. Contrast this with the anti-mask movement in the US, where suspicion of government has deep historical roots.     There are also wide disparities within \u201cdeveloping\u201d countries such as India. While the number of infections continues to skyrocket throughout India, the southern state of Kerala has won international plaudits for its successful management of the pandemic. It did this through decades-long and bipartisan public investment in primary health care closely linked with empowered local governance.    As a consequence, there is strong public trust in government institutions in Kerala; the state has human development indicators parallel to those in the West.    The pandemic has been a stringent stress-test for countries\u2019 political and economic models. \u201cDeveloped\u201d democracies like the US have failed miserably in combating the virus, whereas \u201cdeveloping\u201d non-democracies have managed well.    Should this outcome-based approach be the basis on which to develop a new classification for countries? It is a question worth considering.

The \u00a3130 million Googlehas agreed to pay HMRC supposedly covers its UK tax affairs for 10 years back to 2005, which equates to just \u00a313m a year. During the same period, it has raked in a staggering \u00a317 billion in UK revenues. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When allowing for a reasonable estimate of overheads this means Googlecould be paying as little as three per cent  corporation tax.

No, in the Byzantine realm of tax regulation, this is all within the rules. All firms need to do is register their intellectual property, such as the Googlebrand and technical know-how, in a low tax regime - in this case Ireland. </p><p>As conventional tax law states that the burden of taxation follows 'value added' rather than profits or sales directly, this means that all UK sales can be routed back through Ireland because the intellectual property - based there - is what adds the value. </p><p>In truth legal tax avoidance is often far more complicated even than that, involving all manner of complicated subsidiaries, transfer pricing and offshore deals. </p><p>Fighting multinational tax avoidance is tricky when, unlike the companies, tax law does not stretch overseas. Moreover, in the case of huge corporations, consumer power has little punch too. </p><p>Starbucks and Amazon saw their profits take a hit when details emerged of their own tax practices, but it is far more difficult to boycott a company that dominates the search engine, email, smartphone software and satellite mapping markets in the way Googledoes.</p><p>However, what is certainly not complicated is the morality of such aggressive tax avoidance. It is plain wrong. Every pound of tax dodged by a multinational company is a pound that  cannot be spent  on vital Government services or on reducing taxes for ordinary working people.</p><p>To put it simply, taxes are higher and public services are poorer because of Google's greed.</p><p>Furthermore, anger at the Googledeal is no doubt heightened by the fact that small businesses and self-employed workers across the country have just submitted their tax returns. </p><p>As Labour leader <person><nameText>Jeremy Corbyn </nameText></person>put it in the House of Commons last week, \"they do not get the option of 25 meetings with 17 ministers to decide what their rate of tax is\". It is one rule for the corporate elite, another for everyone else. </p><p>Fresh from a week's skiing with the super-rich in Davos, Chancellor George Osborne hailed this sweetheart deal with Googlea \"major success\". He was keen to attribute this so-called victory to his diverted profits tax,  dubbed the 'Googletax' when it was announced last year. </p><p>This is utter nonsense - Google's settlement didn't cover future taxes, just historical ones. In fact, the terms of the deal actually help Googleto dodge its dedicated tax. </p><p>The darker truth, as Rupert Murdoch of all people pointed out, is that there is a revolving door between the Conservative Party and big tech firms, especially Google. To all intents and purposes, this appears to be a straightforward case of the Tories cutting a cosy, lobbyist-pleasing back-room deal.</p><p>Meanwhile, the European Union is investigating Google's activities and pushing co-operation on tax avoidance between member states - something the Government is actively resisting. But in undermining the EU, they also undermine our best long-term hope for tackling multinational tax avoidance. </p><p>However, sadly even strong, co-ordinated European action is no guarantee of success. As the Googledeal shows, somebody, somewhere is always looking to undercut.</p><p> At the weekend former Tory Chancellor Nigel Lawson raised the possibility of a domestic sales tax to replace corporation tax, which is certainly a suggestion worth exploring.</p><p> But why not use this scandal as an opportunity to look at our system of taxation in its entirety? </p><p>With the UK tax code now standing at a bewildering 17,000 pages long, we need a simpler system that moves from taxing earned income to unearned wealth, and that eliminates the myriad of legal loopholes that we've seen company after company exploit.</p><p>It is time for a rethink. A 21st century economy needs a 21st century tax system. And it should start by bringing Googleand the tax-avoiding global elite to heel.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SENTST-SK3714212</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SENTST2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5J08-S6P1-DYY4-301Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">166723</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"759\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Localworld All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Stoke The Sentinel</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"31942\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"02\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>February 1, 2016 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Sure he's the richest man in the world, at a pre-divorce net worth of $154 billion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But when you're public enemy number-one in the eyes of both Donald Trump and Alexandria Occasio-Cortez, you need all the prayers you can muster.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Bezos and the company he founded, Amazon, along with fellow tech industry giants Facebook, Apple and Google, find themselves the current favorite whipping boys of Washington politicians for a variety of sins, from privacy violations to anti-competitive practices to subverting the free press.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Indeed, as the Presidential campaign season rolls into high gear, Big Tech has become the Dominican Republic of industries. And Congress is taking dead aim at breaking up the \"Big Four\" tech companies that comprise the dreaded FAANGs, with only Netflix spared from current scrutiny.</p><p>Here are the combatants.</p><p>In one corner are the \"bad guys,\" the four tech giants who together employ 750,000 Americans, earn $700 billion annually and enjoy an aggregate stock market value of $3 trillion benefitting millions of American shareholders (Full disclosure, including me!).</p><p>They also supply an irreplaceable daily service on which hundreds of millions of Americans have come to depend, in most cases charging users $0 for the privilege.</p><p>In the other corner are the \"good guys,\" a motley collection of publicity-seeking politicians, egghead academics and crusading anti-business journalists, hell bent on destroying these four tech titans, primarily because they've been too dominant and successful.</p><p>Their role model is Congresswoman Occasio-Cortez, who singlehandedly kept nasty Amazon out of Queens, costing her district thousands of jobs, millions in tax payments and the prospect of better lives for tens of thousands of her constituents.</p><p>With anti-business, antitrust zealot Elizabeth Warren leading the Democrat candidate charge and weak-kneed Republicans at the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission joining the opposition chorus, the pressure to break up Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google will only intensify over the next year-and-a half. As the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">New York Times</emphasis> succinctly put it, \"When Americans fear the future, they turn to antitrust law.\"</p><p>Accordingly, with the ominous specter of driverless cars, delivery drones and artificial intelligence around the corner, the Big Tech Four stand squarely in the antitrust crosshairs. So what kind of public relations strategy, in the face of politically- fueled righteous wrath, should these four notoriously closed-mouthed companies adopt?</p><p>Here's the three-part plan I'd recommend:</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Be seen</emphasis></h><p>Ever since its Cambridge Analytica data mining debacle, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his more loquacious COO Sheryl Sandberg have become gun-shy to go public. The same has generally been true about executives at the other three firms.</p><p>This is a losing strategy, especially in a more threatening election climate. What Big Tech needs now is for its highest executives to become more willing to go on television, give speeches and appear before an admittedly hostile and showboating Congress.</p><p>One CEO who recognizes this is Apple's Tim Cook, whose recent commencement speech at Stanford provides a perfect example of what all his fellow CEOs should be doing. After citing the many innovations to advance society for which Silicon Valley should be given credit, Cook acknowledged that companies like his should take \"responsibility\" for fixing problems in areas like privacy.</p><p>The Apple CEO, rather than staying on the defensive, demonstrated that standing up to critics by going on offense is a much better strategy. One tech CEO who would be wise to emulate his compatriot is Bezos. The Amazon CEO abhors the spotlight. But in this environment, there's no better spokesman for the public benefits of Big Tech than Bezos. A \"60 Minutes\" interview with the reclusive Amazon founder would be both gutsy and potentially golden to increase the understanding of the true value that these four companies represent in terms of America's might, reputation and standing in the world.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Be heard</emphasis></h><p>For many years, the standard for antitrust in this country, developed principally by Judge Robert Bork, has been one based on the welfare of the consumer. If companies got too large and anti-competitive, this thinking went, they could charge oppressive prices that consumers would be forced to pay.</p><p>But for consumers, Google, Facebook and Amazon are essentially free, and Apple charges a competitive price for its hardware and nominally for its apps. The fact is, consumers adore the services provided by the Big Four, and this argument should be broadcast loudly and frequently by every Big Tech executive.</p><p>Another antitrust argument critics proffer is that of \"unhealthy concentration;\" particularly from Google in search, Facebook in social media and Amazon in e-commerce. Here too, Big Tech needs to fight back, as some of its leaders have begun to do.</p><p>Google CEO Sundar Pichai, for example, went on CNN to warn that should America's tech giants be diminished through legislation or regulation, other countries are ready to step in to help their own companies \"become the next Silicon Valley.\"</p><p>Facebook's Zuckerberg was more specific, arguing that breaking up his social-media company would simply clear the way for Chinese tech companies, which don't share American values, to step in and dominate.</p><p>Such statements are exactly what Big Tech needs to beat back the half-baked, often irresponsible, \"see what sticks\" arguments that politicians are wont to throw up.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Be strong</emphasis></h><p>Finally, the Big Tech Four must remain strong in the face of supercilious critics who would dismantle them.</p><p>That means continuing to innovate and announce new products. By contrast, last week's New York City Code Conference, usually a showplace for Big Tech innovation, instead became a piling-on exercise for criticism, led by conference organizer Kara Swisher, who ironically owes her journalistic success to access to tech executives but has become the industry's biggest turn-coat.</p><p>The tech companies' best PR response to the Swishers of the world is to keep on keepin' on.</p><p>That's what Facebook did last week in introducing its new crypto currency, Libra. The immediate response from Maxine Waters, Chair of the House Financial Services Committee, was typically \"upbeat and optimistic.\" Said the gentle congresswoman from California, \"It's very important for them to stop right now what they're doing so that we can get a handle on this. This will be an alternative to the dollar so this is serious, and we must ask them for a moratorium.\"</p><p>Notwithstanding the fact that there are already 2,500 crypto currencies in circulation and that Maxine Waters isn't exactly the second coming of Milton Friedman, her response is typical of the \"risk averse/stop them in their tracks\" negativism that pervades Washington.</p><p>Facebook and the others must stand strong against such naysayers, introducing new products but also contributing to the public good and letting people know. Last week, for instance, Google pledged $1 billion in land and money to work with local governments to build affordable housing. Exactly the right course!</p><p>Such public displays of goodwill will help remind people that Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Google are the best businesses our nation has and the envy of the world. Does that mean they should be free of scrutiny? No. Should they be subject to increased regulation in certain areas? Sure.</p><p>But the last thing we should do is kill America's four high-flying golden geese by dismantling them. And the worst thing these companies can do is sit back and take the abuse of self-serving politicians and regulators.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Photo, Fraser P.

The more governments support each other, the more effective they will be.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So good on Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault for denouncing the threats directed at the Australian government as it pushes ahead with plans to make Facebook and Google compensate news outlets for news items they post on their platforms.</p><p>Facebook has taken the lead in attacking Australia's move on this front, threatening to pull Australian news off its platform and from Instagram, which it also owns. The company is behaving like a global bully that simply doesn't care what petty local authorities do. No government should bow to that kind of pressure.</p><p>All this makes it even more important for Ottawa to follow through with its promise to bring in legislation this fall to deal with the challenge of the foreign-owned digital giants that up to now have been taking a lot more from Canada than they contribute.</p><p>It's not clear exactly what Guilbeault has in mind when he talks about bringing in a \"made in Canada solution.\" But he does say he has been closely following the examples of Australia and France, where regulators are pressing the social-media companies to pay for the news they post.</p><p>And Guilbeault's words are promising. \"It is about levelling the playing field,\" he says. \"Those who benefit from the Canadian ecosystem must also contribute to it, through the Canadian broadcasting sector or the fair remuneration for the use of news content ... That includes making sure that Canadian news organizations continue to inform and empower our communities.\"</p><p>That's a very welcome change from the way the Trudeau government approached the issue until a year or so ago - essentially standing on the sidelines while other countries pushed back against Big Tech.</p><p>Guilbeault has sounded a new note, one more in line with the approach set out in January by a blue-ribbon panel appointed by the government itself. It proposed a series of recommendations designed to make sure the digital giants contribute a lot more to the system they profit from so generously.</p><p>They included ways the government could help foster a \"strong, financially stable\" news sector by, among other things, ensuring news creators \"are compensated for the use of their original content by online platform providers.\"</p><p>That's the basic direction Australia is going. The government there at first proposed a voluntary code to govern the relationship between the news industry and digital companies. But when that didn't work out it asked its competition regulator to develop a mandatory code. Google and Facebook will have to negotiate deals with news companies to pay for content, or face penalties.</p><p>The digital giants, no surprise, argue that all this is unfair and say they benefit the news industry as much as it benefits them. And with the threat of government action in the background, they've introduced various programs to help struggling news organizations keep producing local journalism.</p><p>But the amount and quality of information available to citizens shouldn't depend on the largesse of Google, Facebook and the like. The digital platforms have been \"making billions of dollars off the back of original content producers,\" in the words of an open letter to the Trudeau government issued in May by Canada's major newspaper publishers (including, full disclosure, the company that owns the Toronto Star).</p><p>The government, through Guilbeault, has promised action this fall to tame the power of the digital giants. The threats issued by Facebook &amp; Co. against its counterpart in Australia should not deter it. On the contrary, they should stiffen the government's resolve to act.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2020090358767784</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RR-D3W1-DY91-K2HF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"657\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 3, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Real governments struggle to tame the beast in areas ranging from privacy and democracy to taxation and corporate clout. Facebook even has plans to launch its own cryptocurrency, called Libra.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Finally, though, there are signs governments are stirring themselves to meet the challenge - and not a moment too soon.</p><p>In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission slapped Facebook with a record fine of $5 billion this week for misleading its users about the privacy of their personal information. In addition, the FTC ordered the company to set up a new board-level committee on privacy and make its data practices more transparent.</p><p>That's a lot of money. But for Facebook, even a fine of that size is just the cost of doing business. It earned more than that in the last quarter alone and its stocked jumped 56 per cent last year while it weathered a storm of criticism.</p><p>The bigger potential challenge to Facebook and the rest comes from another direction. After years of leaving the big tech firms to pretty much regulate themselves, the U.S. government has launched investigations into how they have amassed so much market power and whether they've violated antitrust laws.</p><p>This is a big change. So far, the tech companies have faced their biggest push-back in Europe while Washington tended to defend them as champions of innovation. But now the U.S. Justice Department and federal regulators are lining up Facebook et al in their sights.</p><p>And it isn't just about privacy, \"fake news\" and similar well-publicized concerns about social media and the health of democracy. Those are important, but the real stakes for the dominant tech companies lie in a challenge to the enormous market power they have accumulated in just a few years.</p><p>An antitrust review could put into question that power, the near-monopoly grip on key markets that lets them dominate billions of dollars in advertising revenue, squeeze out potential competitors, dictate terms of business, and avoid paying tax in many of the places they operate. Even breaking up some of the biggest companies would be a real possibility - especially if a Democrat wins the White House next year.</p><p>With all that, you might expect a lively debate among Canada's political parties on how to meet the tech challenge. For the most part, though, you'd be disappointed.</p><p>The Trudeau government brought in new rules governing election advertising online and foreign meddling in campaigns. But it had no effective response when Google simply said it won't carry any election ads rather than meet the Canadian requirements.</p><p>And Canada's privacy commissioner was left to sputter impotently when he rebuked the company for violating the privacy of 620,000 Canadian users and it brushed him off. It turns out he has no power to tell Facebook to do anything. Even if he takes the company to court and wins, the maximum fine would be a risible $100,000.</p><p>On the key issue of taxation, Canada's position is to wait to see what the big boys do. Finance Minister Bill Morneau told the Star's Heather Scoffield recently that Canada wants to see what G7 leaders decide at their summit in France next month, so there can be common rules for all.</p><p>As for the future, the best the Liberals can offer is the tepid \"digital charter\" that Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains unveiled in May. It points in the right direction on privacy and other issues, but there's no reason the government could not have moved faster in those areas.</p><p>Canadians deserve better. The trend across the developed world clearly favours reining in Big Tech, and Canada should be more than a bystander as these parallel governments are brought under control.</p><p>The coming election campaign will be an ideal time for the federal parties to spell out how they would meet that challenge.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2019072655172776</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WNC-6SK1-JBTY-W2J2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"670\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 26, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

This Christmas, the firm has hired a theatre for its festive bash. The Coronet in southeast London holds almost 3,000 people. <person><nameText>Alicia Keys, </nameText></person><person><nameText>Justin Timberlake, </nameText></person>Blur, Oasis, Primal Scream and Macy Gray have played there. And now, for one night only, it will be a geek show.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is even more decadent in Silicon Valley, ground zero of America's new gilded age and Google's home. This year the most popular party entertainment is a monkey that poses for Instagram photos. Oh yes, it's good to be young, pointyheaded and rich.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Or, at least, it was: this is a winter of discontent for techies. They have gone from being the cool kids who handed over the keys to a magical, free kingdom of information, communication and entertainment that we all now take for granted, to, well, just listen to what Time magazine says: \"Technology is replacing banking as the industry most likely to worry government and the public.\"</p><p>Even Silicon Valley's heavy hitters agree the big beasts of the web have lost their way. Joanna Shields, who used to run <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>in Europe and headed London's Tech City before becoming a senior adviser to David Cameron and a life peer, says the tech giants should do more to protect their customers from everything from invasions of privacy to terrorists. \"Firms have a social responsibility to act,\" she says.</p><p>What has gone wrong? Just about everything that could - and all at once.</p><p>LAST week politicians here accused <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>of failing to pass on vital information that might have prevented the terrorist murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby. One of his killers had boasted on <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>that he wanted to murder a soldier. His account was closed but nobody alerted the authorities. Security chiefs and police also expressed fury that Apple and Google are now encrypting their new smartphones to prevent state snooping.</p><p>At the House of Commons, the science and technology committee told tech firms to be more transparent about how they collect and exploit personal data from our mobile phones, tablets and computers to sell ads or market products. MPs heard stories of women being targeted by advertisers after searching for pregnancy-related products before they had told anyone they were pregnant.</p><p>In America Taylor Swift, the world's highest-grossing pop star, has taken up the cudgels. She condemned the most popular music streaming service, Spotify, for paying \"derisory\" sums to artists - sometimes as low as a fraction of a penny every time their song is played - and removed her songs from the sight.</p><p>Things got even worse in Europe. MEPs approved a resolution last week that could force Google to \"unbundle\" its core search engine from the other businesses it operates, notably YouTube. French and German politicians say Google \"abuses\" its market dominance - nine out of 10 searches in Europe is a Google search - to promote its own web products.</p><p>Privacy regulators went on to ask Google to extend worldwide the EU's new \"right to be forgotten\" law. It enables anyone who thinks Google's search results unfairly damage their reputation to ask the web giant to remove the offending links permanently. Google has reluctantly agreed to comply in Europe but not in the rest of the world. That is weaselly, say the Eurocrats.</p><p>Tax is also taxing the web giants.</p><p>Governments are cracking down on the elaborate webs of overseas companies Apple, Google, Amazon and <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>use to funnel revenues from high-tax economies, such as Britain and Germany, through havens such as Ireland, Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands to legally avoid hundreds of millions of dollars.</p><p>Last month the Irish government pledged to outlaw the \"double Irish\", a manoeuvre in which tech giants move profits made in Britain into the low-tax republic but immediately move the money offshore a second time, reducing their tax rates to zero or near-zero.</p><p>In the past, the Silicon Valley behemoths have brushed off criticism - even when Google broke the law to harvest the secret details of our home wi-fi networks - but this time it is different. One Google executive, speaking privately, admitted: \"The corporate risk models we operate didn't register much risk to our business before.</p><p>But now the dials are flashing, especially on reputational damage.\"</p><p>Small wonder Google's big guns are boarding their private jets and turning on the charm. Its chief executive, Larry Page, and its executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, are travelling to Europe for meetings with officials in Paris, Berlin and other capitals.</p><p>Why has the mood changed so fast? In sunny places with bucolic names such as Mountain View and Menlo Park, the barons of high-tech like to think of themselves as a cut above conventional business leaders. Google's motto is \"Don't be evil\". <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>billionaire boss, Mark Zuckerberg, is dedicated to \"openness, connecting and sharing\". Apple's late chief executive, Steve Jobs, used to intone: \"Saying we've done something wonderful, that's what matters.\"</p><p>The trouble is, observers say, legislators and regulators have suddenly woken up to the fact that behind the evangelical bluster the big tech firms are just as corporate, money-grabbing and venal as the oldschool entrepreneurs they disdain. Rob Cox, a leading US technology writer, said: \"Under the hoodies lurk rapacious businesspeople, robber barons, with the same profit motive that drives all businesses and a ruthlessness rivalling history's greatest industrial bullies.\"</p><p>He blames big tech for pinching our personal data, violating our privacy, turning a blind eye to copyright, avoiding tax and failing to prevent consumers from accessing pornography and terror videos. Is he right? Should we be afraid of big bad tech? SOME argue that following Edward Snowden's revelations that security services in Britain and the US secretly tapped into the tech firms' networks to harvest vast amounts of private data, they have only themselves to blame if Silicon Valley refuses to help with their inquiries. Schmidt says the US government \"made a huge, huge mistake\".</p><p>But most agree social networking sites and mobile phone makers should do more to help fight terrorism. Brent Hoberman, the London-based entrepreneur best known as one half of the duo that set up <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.lastminute.com\">www.lastminute.com</url>, says: \"Tech companies should be prepared to dig in when trusted security services have cause for concern. It is bad citizenship for mobile phone companies to market 'unhackable phones'.</p><p>\"As the Lee Rigby case shows, we need to find out who the bad guys are talking to, what they are saying and who their friends are before it is too late.\"</p><p>Shields points out that internet service providers, such as TalkTalk, have made progress in other areas, notably providing safe search to prevent children accessing pornography or other unsuitable content.</p><p>What about market abuse? Google and Apple provide more than 90% of the operating systems for smartphones; <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>counts more than half of north Americans and Europeans as its customers. If a bank or power supplier had that much power, regulators would dismantle it in a heartbeat.</p><p>Robert Thomson, the chief executive of News Corp, parent company of The Sunday Times, wrote to the EU competition commissioner in September to argue that Google was \"willing to exploit its dominant market position to stifle competition\".</p><p>However, John Micklethwait, editor of the Economist, on whose board Schmidt sits, argues the European parliament's Googlephobia is more about protecting European companies than forcing Google to play fair.</p><p>\"Instead of attacking successful American companies, Europe's leaders should ask themselves why their continent has not produced a Google or a <person><nameText>Facebook. </nameText></person>Opening up the EU's digital services market would do more to create one than protecting local incumbents.\"</p><p>Eurocrats who back the right to be forgotten online argue it is an inalienable human right that should extend from Europe to the rest of the world. Since the new law was introduced in May, Google has received almost 200,000 requests to remove links and complied with about half. That, say many free speech campaigners, amounts to censorship. \"One person's right to be forgotten is another person's Orwellian memory hole,\" says Marc Andreessen, a prominent Silicon Valley investor.</p><p>On tax, even those who used to run the firms agree that big tech outfits are guilty as charged. <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>Google, Apple and Amazon should pay more tax, says Shields, \"but it's up to governments to change the rules. Firms will not volunteer.\"</p><p>As they lick their wounds this weekend, the tech firms can take comfort from the fact that although regulators are holding their hands up in horror, consumers have theirs where they want them - in their pockets. On Black Friday last week, British shoppers fought to snap up the latest smartphones and tablets for Christmas.</p><p>Rohan Silva, new boss of tech incubator Second Home and a former adviser to David Cameron, says the frenzy proves consumers remain happy to trade a little bit of their privacy for the tech firms' magic.</p><p>\"I share my profile and my location so that I can get a taxi when I want; so I can get directions to where I am going; so I can access the information I want that is right for where I am; so the Instagram photos I take are automatically tagged for time and place. And so on and on. I think the trade-off, the social contract I have with my phone, is worth it. And, I tell you what: I don't think I'm the only one.\"</p><p>There's no magic maths that will trap a terrorist, News Review, page 7</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-93177865</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5DR2-8GF1-DY9P-N0DN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-09-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1583\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"11\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>November 30, 2014 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>GOOG (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Consider the newly introduced  legislation from Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) called the Data Care  Act of 2018, for which we provided feedback in its draft form.</p><p> The bill, one of the first and most significant moves to  establish a new American privacy identity, favors three key  non-waivable obligations for companies that use the Internet to  collect personal information: duties of care, loyalty and  confidentiality.</p><p> These duties are modeled on the privacy requirements for any  fiduciary, such as doctors, lawyers or accountants -- all of whom  are legally required to act in good faith on behalf of their  patients or clients and are bound to keep our disclosures safe and  confidential.</p><p> Schatz's legislation would apply more broadly, compelling tech  companies to be discreet and secure, discouraging manipulative  practices and keeping companies from elevating their short-term  profits over our long-term interests.</p><p> In other words, the bill would require such companies to act  more like doctors than telemarketers.</p><p> The bill would also give regulators the resources they need to  enforce privacy protections and prohibit companies from using dense  terms-of-use agreements to get us to waive those obligations.</p><p> Companies would have to be trustworthy regardless of what we  \"agree\" to online.</p><p> It's time to take a bold step forward.</p><p> The United States has an opportunity to redefine itself as the  country that protects the trust that people give to companies.</p><p> By embracing trust, the United States can become a leader on  privacy instead of following the path of false promises and  diminishing returns.</p><p> Call it legal innovation, if that's what it takes.</p><p> But whatever we call it, the United States can pave the way for  a safe, sustainable and profitable digital future.</p><p>Woodrow Hartzog is a professor of law and computer science at</p><p>Northeastern University.

I'm Joanne Myers, and on behalf of the Carnegie Council, I'd like to thank you for starting this part of your morning with us. Our guest speaker is the two-term senator from Rhode Island<person><nameText>Sheldon Whitehouse. </nameText></person>His reputation for introducing legislation showing that the planet is warming, and for not being afraid to call out his Senate colleagues who deny the problem exists has earned him recognition for being Congress's climate change champion. </p><p>It is an honor to welcome you to the Public Affairs breakfast program. Also on the podium is Ted Widmer, one of our senior fellows here at the Council. Ted has graciously agreed to engage <person><nameText>Senator Whitehouse </nameText></person>in conversation about climate change. This is a perfect match, for not only is Ted from Rhode Island, writing a book on climate change, but he is no stranger to Washington, as he was a foreign policy speechwriter and senior advisor to <person><nameText>President Bill Clinton[</nameText></person>3]. You all should have received copies of their bios and have read them. If you haven't, please do because you'll know what interesting paths their careers have taken them. Last year was a landmark year for climate change. It marked both the warmest year on record[4] and the advent of a new climate pact, demonstrating unprecedented global cooperation. The Paris Agreement[5], as it is known, has now been signed by 174 countries, including the United States. Though most Americans accept that the Earth is warming, they are split along party lines in disagreement as to whether humans are the cause and whether policy responses are warranted. This issue has become one of the most polarizing subjects in American politics, and it has also been one that Congress has been inclined to avoid. But this hasn't deterred <person><nameText>Senator Whitehouse. </nameText></person>Believing that this issue is too important to ignore, he has said that as long as the atmosphere continues to warm, ice continues to melt, seas rise and acidify, he has promised to talk about climate change. Firing up his Senate colleagues is exactly what he has been doing. Frustrated by the Senate's apparent avoidance of the issue, our guest has risen each week on the Senate floor, more than 135 times[6], to alert his colleagues to what is happening to planet Earth. In the next 30 minutes or so, Ted will have a conversation with the senator about climate change, addressing such issues as what the United States is doing to meet its pledges to the Paris Agreement and whether in this feisty presidential election[7] season political struggles are threatening progress. Please join me in welcoming both of our speakers today, <person><nameText>Senator Whitehouse </nameText></person>and Ted Widmer.ConversationTED WIDMER: Thank you, Joanne. I just want to begin by saying that Rhode Island is a small enough state that you can actually get to know your senator. It is the way the founders[8] designed our system to work; it doesn't often work that well. But in Rhode Island it can, and it does. In our case, I've known the senator since he ran in 2006. I was a volunteer for him them. We're all so proud of him. As Joanne mentioned, his standing up every week on this issue[9]\u2014he's standing up for Rhode Islanders, but for a lot of other people too because this is one of the great issues of our time. Today he has a letter[10] published in The New York Times on money and climate change. I think today we'll talk not only about the science of what is happening, but it's a political crisis as well in which not much is happening in the U.S. Senate. Maybe we could just begin with your insider's view of what's it like standing up and talking about climate change once a week and having to deal with senators[11] coming and holding snowballs[12] in rebuttal. <person><nameText>SHELDON WHITEHOUSE</nameText></person>: Well, the rebuttal has more or less stopped. I think the Republicans are now at a stage where they would prefer to run from this issue than engage on it, because they understand that this is not one that helps them. That has been a bit of a change, because the more ardent deniers were unhesitant about coming out earlier on. But I think the sense has been from the more moderate Republicans: \"Shut up. We are tired of hearing this. It is not helping us. Keep it to yourself. This is not good for our brand.\" The one thing that I would want to emphasize here is that this is not a true partisan divide. There are somewhere between 12 and 20 Republican senators who would happily work on a good climate bill. It isn't that Republicans believe one thing and Democrats believe another. That's not true in the public. Even Republicans usually accept the reality of climate change. There's a Tea Party[13] cohort that, for a whole variety of reasons, doesn't. But if you take the Tea Party out, there are even majorities on the Republican side. What's happened is a very simple piece of political mechanics. That is that Citizens United[14], that god-awful Supreme Court decision, allowed special interests to spend unlimited amounts of money in politics. It took musketry to Gatling guns. It took rifles to heavy artillery. The group that lives off of Congress more than any other is the fossil fuel industry. They were the quickest to adapt, and they went right to work. So you have groups like Americans for Prosperity[15], the Koch[16] brothers[17]' front group, saying, \"We're going to spend $750 million in this election\"\u2014and it's a credible threat; they're already through $450 million and climbing\u2014\"And, by the way, if you cross us on climate change\"\u2014these are their words\u2014\"you're going to be severely disadvantaged and in political peril.\" You don't have to be a very clever politician to put the $750 million club next to the political peril threat and realize that maybe you should shut up. So what's frustrating for me is hearing from those 12 to 20 Republican senators: \"Sheldon, I want to be with you. Sheldon, you're doing the right thing. Sheldon, hang in on the climate fee bill; I'll find a way. Sheldon, as soon as I'm through my primary. Sheldon\u2014\"\u2014you know, all of that, but not actually willing to take the step. So really, the story of our failure on climate change is a story of our failure to understand the truly manipulative and evil effects of money in politics. It's being deployed right now. You undo Citizens United and you disable those big gun decks of the artillery industry and we will have a bill in a month. TED WIDMER: Is there an equivalent financial pressure on the other side? <person><nameText>SHELDON WHITEHOUSE</nameText></person>: No, nothing like that. The International Monetary Fund is a reasonably intelligent and thoughtful organization. They have put what they call the \"effective subsidy\" for the fossil fuel industry. That's not just the direct payments for tax benefits and drilling subsidies and things like that. It's the avoided cost of the harms of carbon. They confess that they define effective subsidy very, very broadly. That said, they peg it at north of $600 billion a year just in the United States alone. So if you're an industry that's on the receiving end of a $600-billion-plus-per-year subsidy, throwing $750 million at politics is a laughably small investment to protect your stake. Unless there is some limit on the spending, they have virtually unlimited ROI (return on investmnet) motivation to spend, spend, spend, spend on politics. On our side, we have groups like LCV[18] (Leauge of Conservation Voters) and we have individuals like Tom Steyer[19], who for eleemosynary[20] reasons, to try to do the right thing, are paying. But I think, as anybody knows, charitable efforts are very hard to compete and maintain up against a motivated effort that has a huge return on investment for every dollar that gets spent. TED WIDMER: And yet, the science just continues to build a stronger argument every year. Joanne mentioned 2015. But 2016 is already going to be the hottest year ever[21]. <person><nameText>SHELDON WHITEHOUSE</nameText></person>: Every month in the last 12 was the hottest month ever. TED WIDMER: We saw the forest fires[22]. If you're from Rhode Island, there's a distressing adjective that's often used to describe the huge chunks of ice melting in the Arctic and Antarctic, \"Rhode Island-sized.\" [Laughter] <person><nameText>SHELDON WHITEHOUSE</nameText></person>: We don't like being used as a unit of measure, thank you all very much. TED WIDMER: No. And there must be a political tipping point coming in which some smart Republican will see that there are enough young voters who really care about this that they will take a stand. We both remember John Chafee[23], a great Republican senator from Rhode Island, who was very good on the environment, and arguably was the leading environmental senator of his time. But where is that great moderate Republican senator to come? <person><nameText>SHELDON WHITEHOUSE</nameText></person>: Last week was the 30th anniversary of the Chafee Hearings on Climate Change[24]. As a Republic senator, he chaired an Environment Public Works Committee Subcommittee on Environmental Pollution. Imagine nowadays having a Republican EPW that actually had a subcommittee on environmental pollution. Anyway, they had one. He chaired it. They had great hearings. Al Gore[25] was one of the witnesses, Michael Oppenheimer[26] was one, James Hansen[27]. And here we are, 30 years later, still, and if you read what John Chafee said, it could be front page of the newspapers today. There is pressure building on the Republican colleagues. If you are Kelly Ayotte[28], your state biologist is telling the world that the iconic New Hampshire moose is in terrible trouble[29] because the moose hasn't developed the capability to groom itself of ticks. What keeps ticks down off of moose is snow cover, and as the snow cover isn't present in New Hampshire, the people who go out on moose tours are now finding moose that have 20,000, 30,000, 50,000 ticks on them. The young moose are dying because they can't support their own body as well as the 30,000-50,000 ticks that get on them, and they look like brown blueberry bushes and not moose. There are these local individual situations\u2014the dying of the Western forest[30] because of the pine beetle and the resulting fires; the Charleston coast coming up[31] so that stores have to put tape as to where they think the next high tide is going to be; Miami Beach having to pump out at every high tide[32]. TED WIDMER: Right. Houston had flooding[33]. <person><nameText>SHELDON WHITEHOUSE</nameText></person>: Those realities are putting pressure on people. But there's always another day. That's the problem. There's always another day. If you cross the Koch brothers and ExxonMobil and API (American Petroleum Institute) and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce today, they will punish you today. If you just have one more day go by, you can get away with it for just one more day. TED WIDMER: These senators presumably are tracking the way people think on this issue. That does seem to be changing a lot. Among the young I think the numbers are overwhelmingly on the right side. But among everyone too. <person><nameText>SHELDON WHITEHOUSE</nameText></person>: So there's an avenue, and they do feel the pressure. But look on the other hand at the NRA (National Rifle Assocation). Their truly focused and determined political operation can keep people from voting on things that have 85-95 percent support in the general public, that have 75 percent support among gun owners. So it's not just a question of popular will. It's a question of somebody who's willing to come and clobber you if you disagree with them and has a really credible threat that they can do so in a very, very big way. The fossil fuel industry has also infiltrated the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Elizabeth Warren[34] and I just did a report[35] showing how the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's climate policies are not shared by any of their board members. They're just out there with the fossil fuel industry. They have climbed into the Farm Bureau, which is a complete climate-denial operation, which is insane when you consider what farmers are seeing in their fields. Even groups like the National Association of Manufacturers are very anti, and you probably do more manufacturing for solar and wind than you do for oil. So it's not just that you're going to have the fossil fuel guys coming after you. You'll have the Koch brothers, you'll have the Chamber. They have sort of taken over the business establishment. So they can make pretty in terrorem[36] threats\u2014and they do. TED WIDMER: It seems like no one would argue that our foreign policy is strengthened by adhering to climate denial. Canada just changed its government[37], as everyone knows. This is a foreign policy crowd, but I would submit that being right on this issue is very good for our overall foreign policy. It's an area of really important cooperation with China at a time when we don't cooperate in every field of the relationship. There was just a successful visit[38] from the prime minister of India, Prime Minister Modi[39]. Couldn't that be a new tack of an argument, that our relationship with the rest of the world depends heavily on this, on getting right with climate? <person><nameText>SHELDON WHITEHOUSE</nameText></person>: I think it puts us at terrible risk. Bill Clinton[40] always used to say that the power of our example as Americans has always mattered more in the world than any example of our power. TED WIDMER: That's right. <person><nameText>SHELDON WHITEHOUSE</nameText></person>: He was shortening Daniel Webster[41]'s famous Bunker Hill[42] speech[43], that what the founders left to us was an example, a powerful example in the world; and if at any time the world's experience of our example was that it was failing, then, in Websterian terms, he said, \"the knell of popular liberty would sound throughout the world.\" So this sense that America stands for something and that it matters in the world is a very lasting proposition. What we stand for is that we will do the right thing. We will have Marshall Plans[44] and MacArthur Plans[45], and come to the rescue when there are terrible floods and tsunamis and not take advantage of all of that, and that we're a beacon, that our system is a model for others. Well, when people who are operating at a subsistence level around the world are facing really dramatic changes in the way that they live, and the blame is very obviously upon carbon pollution and we're the top carbon polluter, and we knew about it, and we had a system that tried to respond but couldn't because special-interest money that had such a nefarious, malign influence in it, that the great vaunted democracy of America failed at this very thing that matters so much to you in your village, to you in your barrio, to you in your farm, to you in your native fishery, that's a very deep chasm for the power of our example to fall into. TED WIDMER: On that subject we have a major agreement, an almost unprecedented agreement, the Paris Agreement[46], that every nation in attendance, basically every nation on Earth, signed, very few have ratified. But what are your feelings about its prospects going forward? It's a time of incredible turbulence here at home. We don't know how the election[47] is going to go. Donald Trump[48] has called[49] climate change a hoax created by the Chinese. [Laughter]\u00a0I wonder about him, because he's also a New York City-based developer with a lot of properties on the shoreline. He must know that the seas are rising. In some part of his mind he must know that it's real. <person><nameText>SHELDON WHITEHOUSE</nameText></person>: His companies have actually filed for seawalls[50] to protect golf courses on grounds of sea level rise and climate change. So he knows. In 2009 there was a full-page ad[51] taken out in The New York Times to urge Obama[52] a really strong outcome in the Copenhagen conversations[53], and among the New York business signatories who said, \"Climate change is serious, it's real, it's potentially catastrophic, we can't postpone the planet, you've got to do this,\" were Donald, Eric[54], and Ivanka Trump[55]. TED WIDMER: Amazing. I didn't know that. <person><nameText>SHELDON WHITEHOUSE</nameText></person>: So he was for it before he was against it. TED WIDMER: So is Paris going to survive our election? <person><nameText>SHELDON WHITEHOUSE</nameText></person>: Yes. Paris has immense momentum at this point. To me the most significant part of Paris wasn't just the deal itself, because there's, I think, more to be achieved before we can say \"mission accomplished\" there. But it's certainly a terrific stage in the rocket launch and with more to come. Nor is it that 160 countries joined. It's that the corporate community came forth in an enormous way, very powerfully, to say, \"We want a really strong deal.\" The other dirty secret of what's happening in our politics is that while the fossil fuel guys are in there hammer and tongs beating the hell out of anybody who might cross them on climate change, the rest of the corporate community is totally AWOL (absent without leave)\u2014totally. I had the Cleantech lobby group come in, which is Apple, Google, and the big tech industry, but it's also a lot of green energy companies. And I had the lumber industry come in. And I had the property/casualty industry, the guys who write the checks when the big terrible storms and floods and so forth happen. They all came in in the same week. So it was kind of a noteworthy week. They all had their list of things that they wanted out of Congress that they were lobbying on. Hard to imagine three sets of interests that should be more attuned to climate change and that had a more direct financial interest in getting something done on climate change\u20140 for 3 in any interest in climate change, zero. And they don't show up. None of them show up\u2014not Apple, not Google, none of them. They're starting to show up a tiny bit in the food industry. Ceres and BICEP (Business for Innovative Climate and Energy Policy) is starting to organize people a little bit. There's a Partnership for Responsible Growth that is, among other beautiful things, starting to take ads out on The Wall Street Journal editorial page saying what a horrible nonsense position The Wall Street Journal editorial page has on climate. So there are tendrils of corporate political support for this. But if you're, say, John Boozman[56] in Arkansas, a Republican, if you're going to vote wrong on climate, you know what the fossil fuel guys are going to do. They've told you. The Koch brothers have told you. Walmart is not saying, \"John, don't worry about those guys. We've got your back. When they come after you, we'll make sure that you're fine. Stick with it. Do what you want. This is important to us.\" They're just not saying it. They're not there. None\u00a0of them are there. It's not that I'm picking one particular bad guy. Coke and Pepsi are terrific, terrific, terrific on this stuff, but they lobby through the American Beverage Association, which is moribund on climate, and which is a member of the U.S. Chamber board. The U.S. Chambers are in complete climate denial. They're absolutely against anything that might be done. So Coke and Pepsi have these terrific, terrific, terrific policies, but the bulk of their lobbying work runs counter to their policies, just because of the way they do it. So that's the world that I live in. Somebody who wants to do something good on climate on the Republican side has no friends\u2014none\u2014and their enemies are very fierce and pointing guns right at their heads. And you wonder why nothing happens. It's political hydraulics. As soon as that changes, people will come in. You've got really good Republicans in Congress who want to do this. TED WIDMER: There's a kind of simplistic political argument the right makes a lot, which is that to be effective on climate is job-killing. Marco Rubio[57] was saying that a lot. Yet, there's a lot of evidence out there that it's job-creating and that GDP can rise as emissions decline. Can we do more to substantiate that and get that good news in solar and wind, obviously? In Rhode Island we're doing a lot with wind. There's a project called Deepwater Wind[58] that's going into the water now. It's the first successful ocean-based wind turbine system on the Eastern Coast of the United States. It's going to be online in a couple of years. But can we get the good news business story out there? <person><nameText>SHELDON WHITEHOUSE</nameText></person>: Yup. It's coming more and more too. I mean you go to places like Iowa, where more than 30 percent of the energy is wind. One of the biggest employers in Iowa is MidAmerican Energy, the company that runs all those wind turbines. The farmers are very happy because somebody comes to them and says, \"Hey, can I put six wind turbines on your farm? I'll pay you 50,000 bucks a year for the privilege. All we need is some gravel access roads to be able to come and service them. You can farm up to them.\" They say, \"Sure, where do I sign?\" The electricians and the mechanics who are working on the machines are paid very well. You drive around the Iowa highways, you see the green trucks zipping all over. I mean they're big. So Chuck Grassley[59], for instance, is a really keen advocate of wind because he's got a very strong base in his corporate sector of workers, and then in his farming sector of even very conservative farmers, for whom this is a really powerful economic proposition, and they're sold because of the reality of it. If you look at most of the stuff that's put out that tries to show that it's a job killer, they only look at one side of the equation. They assume a carbon fee but don't assume the revenue gets returned in any way. So it doesn't even pass muster as accounting. TED WIDMER: This is an institution that cares a lot about ethics, among other things. It often seems like the way we define these issues is very short term; it's about who will win the election or the vote in the Senate this week. Even GDP is a category that's very short term. Can we change the way we talk about issues to put more weight into long-term outcomes and less weight into short-term, because the short term is always going to give you worse ethics? <person><nameText>SHELDON WHITEHOUSE</nameText></person>: I think it may take a really significant whack in the head to get us to begin to think that way. One of the things that is observable in Congress is that values tend to be reflected only to the extent that they can be monetized. So we are now in a month in which we have probably killed off a third of the Great Barrier Reef[60]. It's bleaching, which means that it's basically in cardiac arrest. Nobody foresees a very good future for it. It's one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World[61] and visible from space. But there's nobody who's monetizing the Great Barrier Reef in the United States, so nobody really gives a red-hot damn. The pteropod is a beautiful little creature. It's a snail. It swims in the ocean with its little snail foot. It has adapted beautifully by nature to do what it does. Half of them now have severe shell damage[62] in the Northwest Pacific from the acidification of the seas, from the absorption of carbon pollution, which changes the chemistry of the ocean so it's more acidic. You can replicate that in a high school science lab. It's not debatable science. Who cares about the damn pteropod? Well, somebody will someday care because salmon won't eat it and it won't help the salmon fishery, and then they'll be angry. But the sort of dissolution of all of our values down to what can be monetized I think is a very important question for us to address because it's short term, it ignores things that matter but don't count, and it is a really stupid way of resolving conflicts. TED WIDMER: Did the Pope[63]'s visit[64] change that calculus, because if anyone could inject a long-term view into this, it's him. He did a lot last year. He came and he spoke in person and he wrote his encyclical[65]. <person><nameText>SHELDON WHITEHOUSE</nameText></person>: Yes. TED WIDMER: But was that just a breeze that came and went in the Senate? <person><nameText>SHELDON WHITEHOUSE</nameText></person>: Yes, I'm afraid so. You also in many respects have not seen the Catholic Church in the United States pick up on that. TED WIDMER: The bishops? <person><nameText>SHELDON WHITEHOUSE</nameText></person>: Yes. I don't see it making a very big difference in the Catholic colleges in the United States. The Conference of Bishops has been very good on this, but it hasn't kind of worked its way into the schools, it hasn't worked its way into the Catholic organizations, it hasn't worked its way into the pulpits, at least not in a way that I have seen or that anybody else seems to be noticing.QuestionsQUESTION: Robert Smith, Turan Corporation in Boston. How much has Bernie Sanders[66] helped you, because this is one of his main issues? Maybe you can tell me if there has been any helpful output to this question by him. <person><nameText>SHELDON WHITEHOUSE</nameText></person>: One of the truisms of politics that Bernie has upended[67] has been that young people don't vote. You put a practicing politician in a car driving around on a campaign, and he sees a group of 30 gray-haired individuals at picnic tables, he's going to stop the car and jump out and hand out materials and say \"I hope you'll all vote for me,\" and jump in the car and go on. He'll go 10 blocks down the street and there'll be 30 kids playing on a basketball court and he'll drive right on by. It's kind of inculcated in political culture that older people vote and younger people don't. Younger people care an enormous amount about this issue. The fact that Bernie has now motivated them to the point where people are looking around and saying, \"Wow!\u00a0They can vote, they will vote. They'll get organized. We just haven't been reaching them yet.\" I think has really helped lift this issue. I think it's a great opportunity for Hillary[68] to use this issue to reach into that community. Trump is a complete nightmare on the subject\u2014I mean just an idiot. So she has just unlimited amounts of room to maneuver. And then, I think, also in the bad political temper of our times, I think it's a telling added kind of impetus on this that: \"Oh, and by the way, they're not just wrong. This is the dark hand of the fossil fuel industry controlling them. You think your voice doesn't count in Washington? You think special interests are running the show? Boy, this is your example.\" I think both the merits of climate change and that extra sort of corruption juice can make it a really, really powerful election issue beyond just green people. So it's lying there latent. I'll be interested to see how it moves. But I think it really could be a very, very, very powerful issue in November. QUESTION: I'm Warren Hoge of the International Peace Institute. Senator, at the very beginning you mentioned Citizens United and the consequences if it could be reversed. I wanted to ask you if there's any possibility of that happening. Are there some campaign finance issues out there that might find their way to the Court one day, when hopefully the makeup of the Court will be different than it is now? <person><nameText>SHELDON WHITEHOUSE</nameText></person>: I think that the Citizens United decision has proven to be an unexpected disaster from the perspective of the five\u2014now four\u2014surviving Justices who wrote it. I think that Justice Kennedy[69] and Justice Roberts[70] may be particularly sensitive to this. So if I had to make a bet, my bet would be that Hillary Clinton becomes the president, either Merrick Garland[71] or somebody else joins the Court. No new judge who's not picked specifically for that purpose will continue Citizens United. Now you have a 5-4 decision going the other way. When an occasion comes, I think there's a very strong case that Kennedy and/or Roberts would defect and go back, because it has been such a nightmare, and that ultimately we will look back on this as an eccentric and embarrassing moment in the Supreme Court's history. But it's a real blot on the Supreme Court's record. If you look at the maneuver that it took\u2014I mean you've got to be kind of an appellate expert to follow the course of it\u2014the maneuvering that the Court did to be able to get to that decision was very telling. It was not calling balls and strikes, as Justice Roberts said. It was stretching the strike zone all over the place and moving the batter down to third base. I mean they really warped things a lot, and it looks very much like it was an outcome-determinative strategy. That doesn't reflect well on the Court either. The more it gets looked at, the more damaging and embarrassing that decision is going to be. On the legislative side, I have a bill called the Disclose Act[72]. The Court left open that you should at least know who the hell is giving the unlimited amounts of money. That is something that we could cure legislatively, and it's a key part of our sort of clean-up agenda that we announced last week that we'll be taking into the election. I think that will make a difference as well. The last thing I'll mention is that if the IRS (Internal Revenue Service) would do its job, you could clean this up very quickly. The 501(c)(4)[73] mess that allows groups that aren't supposed to do any politics at all and in return get to keep their donors private, they're reporting to the IRS that they're not engaged in politics, and at the same time they're reporting to the Federal Election Commission that they're spending $70 million in an election. That to me looks like a false statement under the Federal Criminal Code. But the Department of Justice doesn't want to pick the fight. The IRS won't refer it to them, the IRS won't enforce anything, and they haven't tried to clean up their rules at all. But if you want to surmise why the Republicans are kicking the hell out of the IRS commissioner[74] [John Koskinen], I think if you've got an agency that could shut off the air hose of your dark money, it's a very powerful thing to just be batting them about the head as hard as you possibly can all the time so that they're just on defense and not thinking about what they should be doing, and basically just bullying them so that they don't do their jobs and shut the dark money air hose off. Nobody has observed this yet, but there could very easily be a powerful ulterior motive for the Republicans to beat the hell out of Koskinen that has nothing to do with whether or not he knew about the materials that were or were not disclosed. So there's plenty of room to fix it. QUESTION: Susan Gitelson. This has been such an eye-opener. Thank you for giving us all this background information. I'd like you to continue the trend that you started now about the possibility of changing the situation. Apparently nobody knows as much as you about where the bodies are buried. You mentioned the Catholic Church for example. What about the evangelicals? Which are the groups that take climate change very seriously and how can they be motivated? You started. Please continue. <person><nameText>SHELDON WHITEHOUSE</nameText></person>: There's an emerging group of evangelicals. The two leaders are a woman named Katharine Hayhoe[75], who is also a climate scientist and teaches at that well-known left-wing redoubt Texas Tech University; and then a fellow named Mitchell Hescox[76], who's a very energetic, lively evangelical leader who just happens to believe that this is God's Earth and that we have an obligation to maintain it in reasonable condition for our forebearers. He is very active in a lot of the conservative and Christian colleges growing youth groups for climate action. So there are the beginnings of some stirring in that area. I think it's important that that continue, because it's a very significant rearguard action if the Republicans are starting to hear from the evangelical side that they take this seriously. JOANNE MYERS: And what about the mainline Protestants? <person><nameText>SHELDON WHITEHOUSE</nameText></person>: I think people are pretty much onboard with that. But it doesn't turn into much political clout up against the power of the fossil fuel industry. The Protestant Church isn't saying, \"We've got $750 million we're going to spend in the election this year and if you don't get right on climate change you're going to be in political peril.\" QUESTION: Hi. My name is Anne. I'm at the Mayor's Office of Recovery and Resiliency over the summer. I also study at the City College of New York. My focus is on energy, and especially the role that utilities can play in reforming energy and the energy system, the infrastructure of it. I'm thinking about Reforming the Energy Vision[77]. We cannot lose sight of really incentivizing renewable energies, because right now to integrate them into community energy or micro grids is still expensive, and going back to fossil fuels is still the cheaper option. I don't know if you can talk to what role really utilities can play in reforming this vision. <person><nameText>SHELDON WHITEHOUSE</nameText></person>: I think a lot of the utility sector has been pretty good. In New England, we have National Grid. Out on the West Coast there's Pacific Gas ...ectric (PG... They are really leaning forward on this. When we were trying to do cap and trade, there was a utility group that was pretty active in trying to get that going. Some of them have been less good. But even the less good ones, like Southern, are starting to come around slowly, slowly, slowly. Renewable fuel standards are really important to them. They understand the siting risks for new plants. They are seeing, I think, real opportunity in wind and solar, particularly as large-scale private entities are showing up who can basically do the building and have it be turnkey for the utility. They are seeing, I think, opportunity, but also huge risk in distributed generation, individual rooftop, and what does that mean for them. A lot of them are in a panic that for a lot of places distributed generation means that you have to pay the person the full retail price of what comes off their roof. As that grows, that leaves no revenue to deal with their sunk costs. How do you solve that problem? The little battle[78] in Nevada recently was a result of that. That's a political battle that I think will sort itself out. I hope that they come up with a good standard model between the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) and Edison Electric and the solar industry. I think you could say, \"Okay, this is the way we're going to handle that. That seems pretty fair across the board.\" And then on we go. But you've got to say that solar and wind are really, really, really exploding. There were tens of thousands of megawatts added in the last year, and I think 60 are fossil fuel. It's just accelerating as it gets cheaper and cheaper and cheaper. We had a Mexican official come in and say that they had just had an auction of solar at 3.5 cents equivalent kilowatt hour. The advantage of just continuing lowering of price is something that I think makes in the long term renewables a natural win. QUESTION: Don Simmons. Two ways that have been discussed for using our free market economy to reduce carbon emissions are a carbon tax and cap and trade. <person><nameText>SHELDON WHITEHOUSE</nameText></person>: Yes. QUESTIONER: Which of those would you say is likelier or less unlikely to be enacted? <person><nameText>SHELDON WHITEHOUSE</nameText></person>: Carbon tax is much less unlikely. Every single Republican, whether they're former executive officials like Shultz[79] and Paulsen[80], or former EPA (Environmnetal Protection Agency) administrators, or former Republican members of Congress like Bob Inglis[81], or famous economists like Art Laffer[82] or Gregory Mankiw[83]\u2014I mean you can pick your poison. Everybody who thought this through to a solution has come to the same thing, which is a revenue-neutral carbon fee. Revenue-neutral means all the money goes back to the people; it doesn't fund bigger, more government. Cap and trade has the disadvantage that you have to deal with a trading system. After the Wall Street meltdown[84], to carry that burden across the line of having to trust a Wall Street-managed cap and trade\u2014there's just no way. It's just too much of a load to carry. The carbon fee is simple. It's border-adjustable. It allows for a better assessment of what the border adjustment should look like. If you're dealing with competing regulatory systems, how do you price that? If you're dealing with a carbon fee, it's really clear. So we have an interesting proposition. We've got a lot of Republicans who are willing to do a bill. Talking to them about climate change is like talking to prisoners about escape. [Laughter]\u00a0They're really, really careful. They want to know like, \"Okay, so how do we get through the barbed wire? Is there going to be a tunnel? Are people going to escort me? How is all that going to work?\" But I think everybody understands that if they get over the fence or tunnel under or get escorted out, or however that is made to work, the getaway car that they want is right there, parked, idling, and ready to go. We as Democrats are totally willing to work with them on a revenue-neutral border-adjustable carbon fee. I call it a \"fee\" not a \"tax,\" both to be cute and avoid the \"tax\" word, but also to be legit. A tax implies that you are raising revenues to fund the government. If it's revenue-neutral, you're not raising money to fund the government; you're giving it back. The way we give it back is that we give everybody 500 bucks, either against their payroll tax or in addition on their Social Security and veterans' benefits, and we reduce the corporate tax rate from 35 to 28 percent. There's a lot of people who are in the corporate sector who are paying a 35 percent tax rate who have said to me, \"Sheldon, when that becomes a horse I want to ride it. Right now it's a unicorn. I don't see that it's all that real.\" But it's really hard to do anything else that can in one fell swoop lower the top corporate tax rate from 35 to 28 percent. So that's where we are right now. If the retail sector decides to chime in because it really wants that tax reduction, that's a very powerful sector of the economy. Now you've got retail fighting fossil instead of fossil out there with nobody fighting them, and that can change the dynamics quite a lot. So in addition to the economic merit of a carbon fee and the simplicity of a carbon fee and the bipartisan prospects of a carbon fee, it also has the chance to bring onboard strong political allies who would like that outcome. QUESTION: I'm Krishen Mehta. Senator, I wonder if there's a broader issue than climate change that is a threat to our democracy even if we take into account Citizens United. You've given the example of the fossil fuel industry controlling the air we breathe. <person><nameText>SHELDON WHITEHOUSE</nameText></person>: Yes. QUESTIONER: The food industry through the labeling efforts controls the food we eat. The pharmaceutical industry through its lobbying efforts controls in a big way the medicines we consume. <person><nameText>SHELDON WHITEHOUSE</nameText></person>: The price we pay. QUESTIONER: The defense industry plays a big role in our foreign policy and our actions abroad. The financial service industry is also state-captured in terms of transparency and shell companies. So this whole issue of state capture in a democracy is a big threat. As a politician, you are dealing with this all the time. I wonder what is a long-term solution for future generations that we need to get our arms around that can help us get beyond this threat. <person><nameText>SHELDON WHITEHOUSE</nameText></person>: Let me open by saying I'm a very, very strong believer in both capitalism and democracy. This election shows both on the Trump side and on the Bernie side how disillusioned and disenchanted many, many Americans have become with the way things work, both in terms of capitalism and in terms of democracy. I think they've got a real case to be made that in a whole variety of areas government has been captured by special interests. Citizens United, of course, put the throttles all the way forward for the special interests. There has long been an argument in political theory that there is a difference between the influencers who come to democracy looking for results in a specific way and the general public that has an abiding interest in a polity that can defend itself from the influencers without them having to put down the plough and come in from Iowa and say, \"Dammit, knock this off.\" In recent years, that contest has been just completely given over to the influencers. So I think that an adjustment needs to come. As Henry Kissinger[85] once said in a meeting, \"The great transitions and the great revolutions in the world have always come from a confluence of resentments.\" The question is, is there a big enough confluence of resentments that you start to lose really precious things that we care about? But I do think the people who are ardent capitalists, people who are CEOs, people who are on the boards of major corporations, need to see what is happening out there as a threat to the system that they support, that if you can't get it right and they're not willing to sacrifice a little to make capitalism honest and fair and perceived to be so, that then there is the risk that an out-of-control wave does more damage than anybody wants. I do think we're at a point where that is a conversation that people who are leaders of the business community need to have and people who are leaders in government also need to have. It's not just foreign people who are living at the sustenance level who are going to be mad as hell about us for wreaking climate change. It's going to be a lot of other people as well inside the country. The explanation is not a good one: \"Oh, yeah, sorry. Yeah, we knew for actually 30 years. We didn't do anything about it because the fossil fuel industry made threats, they gave money.\" That's not why they bloodied the snows of Valley Forge[86] with their footprints. QUESTION: Do you see local governments stepping up more as the federal government seems to be paralyzed? <person><nameText>SHELDON WHITEHOUSE</nameText></person>: Much more. And thank you, Michael Bloomberg[87], for what he has done to organize mayors[88] all around the world. States are doing a lot more. We're actually going to be probably hemmed in a little bit by Canada and Mexico. It will be interesting. Canada is trying to organize a national carbon price. A lot of their provinces have; even Alberta, the home of the tar sands, has gone there. It will be interesting if suddenly we were having to pay a border adjustment dealing with Canada and Mexico because they had a good carbon price and we didn't. It wouldn't be a moment I would be proud of, but it would be an interesting signal to our society. QUESTION: I'm Carol Spomer. Thank you for your really remarkable presentation. I wanted to ask you what we as individuals can do to help influence this. I feel kind of powerless to do much. <person><nameText>SHELDON WHITEHOUSE</nameText></person>: I think voices matter and organizations matter. So even if it's as simple as writing a letter to the editor, make sure your own voice is heard. And then groups like this, groups like your church or your temple or your book club\u2014this is a room that has a lot of clout. I do think that if you both use the organizations that you're a member of and your own voice, it more and more will begin to make a difference. We've just been through the 50th anniversary of Bobby Kennedy[89]'s speech[90] in South Africa. Send a ripple because together the ripples can pile up and tear down the largest walls of indifference. We actually know what the walls are. It's actually the fossil fuel industry leadership and the Chamber of Commerce leadership and The Wall Street Journal editorial page\u2014to pick a few of their redoubts. Paul Gigot[91] out to be shamed into accountability for the truly horrific dishonest position that his page takes every day on climate change. Tom Donohue[92] at the Chamber of Commerce ought to be shamed. Tillerson[93] at ExxonMobil ought to be shamed. Charles Koch ought to be shamed. In fact, we're close enough that Tillerson and Koch are both saying, \"Oh, wait a minute. Climate change is real. Humans do have a cause in it.\" Tillerson and Exxon are even saying, \"And we support a carbon fee.\" Now, they don't, that's not true, but they say it. Down on the gun decks their political armamentarium is all still pointed at anybody who might dare cross them on the Republican side and saying, \"Move and I'll shoot.\" But the fact that they feel that they have to say this to get through cocktail parties and to be invited to Davos and whatever it is\u2014you know, it's a difference when they have to give lip service, even if it's phony baloney lip service. So I will take their lip service as a victory and I would ask all of you to crank up the pressure. It is simply not acceptable any longer not to be serious about climate change. The science is crystal clear. It just isn't subject to debate. Like anything, you can find some strange point at the margin way over here where you can debate it. Really? You're going to debate the acidification of the oceans? No. You're going to debate the fundamental proposition of greenhouse gases? No. That was discovered when Abraham Lincoln[94] was riding around Washington in his top hat, for crying out loud. So don't let them get away with it. You're in circles where a lot of these people exist, and they should feel the pressure. It is not acceptable, and we're all going to pay the price from their truculence and their folly if they don't come around. It's not like it's free to us to have ExxonMobil be climate deniers. It isn't, not as Americans. We look like hell because of what they're doing. It hurts every single damn one of us. It hurts every ambassador in every post in every country. It hurts our soldiers when they have a different reputation, different view of the world, when they put their boots on the ground in the country. It hurts. It is simply not right for these very well-paid, very privileged, very protected people to continue to behave this way. It's reprehensible. And they should know it. TED WIDMER: Could DoD (Department of Defense) be an ally in the years ahead? The Navy seems alert. <person><nameText>SHELDON WHITEHOUSE</nameText></person>: The Navy is very good. Mabus[95] has been terrific. The Navy is doing amazing investments in jet fuel from algae and things like that. They brought the price down, I think, from about $300 per gallon to $3-and-change per gallon in the last contract. The problem has been that the uniformed military has been reluctant to put its voice or its image into this fight. So you get the civilians. You've got the quadrennial defense reviews. You've got the intelligence estimates. You've got the statements from our head of\u00a0USPACOM (U.S. Pacific Command)[96] back when Admiral Locklear[97] said that this was the threat in the Pacific more than any other likely to disrupt things in a way that would disturb American interests. But it's hard to put a panel of people in uniform in front of the Environmental and Public Works Committee and say, \"I'm a general, I'm an admiral, I'm the head of the Marine Corps. We're telling you.\" What the Navy has done that has been really interesting\u2014Ray Mabus said he's starting to actually evaluate\u2014the military lives by evaluation\u2014they're starting to evaluate their base commanders on how well they communicate the risk of climate change about the base. So if you're the base commander of Norfolk or of Naval Station Newport or of Cherry Creek Marine Air Station in North Carolina, you suddenly have on your checklist of what you're evaluated on how well you've communicated what the risk of climate change is. For those bases, for Navy bases particularly, it's a really real risk. They're on the sea. The sea level rise is going to swamp what they do. It's really practical. So when people hear it from as trusted a source as a uniformed military officer, it will make a big difference. They have not been very forward about it from the uniformed side of the military. DoD has been good. Mabus has been the best. TED WIDMER: There is a strategic argument also, which is that long-term desertification in Africa is sending millions of climate refugees into North Africa and into the Middle East where they can easily become recruited into war. <person><nameText>SHELDON WHITEHOUSE</nameText></person>: Yes. And we lose our major communications base in the Indian Ocean if it floods, which it looks like it's going to do. There are really practical strategic consequences from this. The military is saying it, and so are people like Tom Friedman[98], who's a pretty smart guy and pretty well-respected. Read[99] his[100] stuff[101] about what's happening in Syria[102] and why. QUESTION: Susan Rudin. Is it naive to think that if you follow the money trail on both sides it all comes down to greed and saving the job? The ethics of someone like Muhammad Ali[103], who stood up and said[104], \"I'll take the consequences. I'm not going to do this\"\u2014you know, he lost his salary, lost his job, lost everything, and then ended up being an international hero because he stood for what is right. Is \"right might\" in this case? If someone stands up, will the rest follow, and that would end it? QUESTION: I'm Dr. David Bassiouni from the Bassiouni Group and originally from South Sudan. That's very important. The world's youngest country. Senator, America's global role in climate change is so important. Without it, we would not have brought China onboard, nor India onboard, or even have the Paris Agreement. But in this country it's either misunderstood or underplayed. We don't have the population behind this elegant and laudable effort. So what can be done to bring the American population onboard? <person><nameText>SHELDON WHITEHOUSE</nameText></person>: I'll just say quickly I think the American population is way more onboard than it would seem. You see 60-80 percent polling numbers supporting the Paris deal and recognizing the importance of climate change and so forth. And when you take Tea Partiers out, you actually even see some more numbers among regular Republicans. QUESTION: Ellen Berenson. You said that there were 10 or 12 Republican senators that you\u2014 <person><nameText>SHELDON WHITEHOUSE</nameText></person>: Twelve to 20. QUESTIONER: Twelve to 20, excuse me\u2014that you believe are on the side of climate change policy. What can be done to put pressure on these people? I understand the reasons they feel that they can't do it. But what can be done, as representatives of elected officials, to make them be strong and support what they should be doing? <person><nameText>SHELDON WHITEHOUSE</nameText></person>: I think they need some political cover. So if Walmart would tell Senator Boozman \"I'll have your back,\" that would make a big difference. If Coca-Cola based in Atlanta, Georgia, would tell Senator Isakson[105], \"We'll have your back, don't worry,\" that would make a big difference. If VF Corporation, which is a really big clothing conglomerate in North Carolina, would tell Senators Tillis[106] and Burr[107], \"Don't worry, we'll have your back,\" that would make a big difference. I think that the key point at this point is for the corporate sector to get off its tail and start lobbying on this. They do wonderful things within their own corporate fence line, many of them, some really just outstanding things\u2014Mars, Cargill, General Mills, Unilever. They're just really, really, really good. And many of them actually are pushing it out. Walmart is pushing it actually up their supply chain; it's not just in the fence line. But when they come to Congress it's like Dante[108]'s Inferno[109]\u2014\"Abandon hope all ye who enter here.\" My message is actually: No, don't abandon hope. There are people who are thirsting, waiting for somebody to say, \"I'll be with you if you dare to move.\" I think that's the same concern that we have about people standing up. I think there will be some. I think Lindsey Graham[110] has showed a lot of courage. He has pushed it right to the very tipping edge. But I think beneath what you're saying is the fundamental problem that I'll revert back to. As a matter of political science, there are people for whom going to the government and exerting influence is a hugely profitable enterprise. There are others for whom it is not, and they're the vast majority. What they want more than anything else is a system that just leaves them alone and contains the influencers enough that they feel that the system itself will protect them and give them a fair shot. That's what's gone out of balance with Citizens United. If you divide the world into the class of influencers and regular human beings, it's probably 4 percent and 96 percent. But for the 4 percent for whom engagement in politics is a highly remunerative proposition, there's almost no restraining them because they make money by spending money on politics. It is powerfully lucrative to distort and intrude into and interfere with the operation of the American political system. We have to fundamentally solve that problem. Then you don't need so much heroics in the face of catastrophe. You have actually a system that tends to self-clean. What the Supreme Court totally, totally, totally missed in its Citizens United decision is two things. One, there actually is a political science difference between the small influencer class and the rest of the world who just want good government. The second is that if you're going to allow the influencer class to spend all that kind of money and to be as threatening as they are, what you've also allowed them to do is, if you can spend it, you can threaten to spend it. It's that threat that they totally left out of the Citizens United decision. The threat is never going to be either independent of the candidate or public or transparent or any of those things that they thought of when they were just thinking about the money. So that has been the problem. They ignored the fact of an influencer class. They ignored the fact that when you allow special interests to spend unlimited amounts of money publicly, you allow them to threaten to spend unlimited amounts of money privately. That is always going to be a backroom conversation. It has distorted and disgraced our democracy.

Sheldon Whitehouse:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">09.15.20</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As-prepared for delivery</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr./Mdm. President, I rise for the 271st time to call this chambers attention to two reports on the defining issue of our generation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As I speak, wildfires devour the American West, and consume American lives: in East of Salem, Oregon, two people dead in a scorched vehicle; in Butte County, California, three dead, overrun by a fast-moving fire; in Ashland, a 1-year-old boy; almost the entire town of Malden, Washington burned down. Half a million Oregonians evacuated due to fire; one out of ten people in the entire state. Over the weekend, Oregon's Emergency Management Director said theyre preparing for a mass fatality event.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Paradise, California suffered apocalyptic destruction in the 2018 Camp Fire, and its once again under fire warnings, this time the North Complex fire, which has stunned firefighters with its rapid growth and ferocity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We cannot avoid it, Mr./Mdm. President: climate change is here. Plenty of factors contribute to individual wildfires, but climate change is now always among them. Last fall, I visited the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Colorado, and met leading wildfire researcher Daniel Swain.</p><p>As Dr. Swain puts it, Climate change has not just made the extreme heat waves that coincided with fires worse. The bigger effect is the more subtle, long-term warming. That couple of degrees of (average) warming over decades ... its lurking in the background, sucking extra moisture out of the vegetation and the soil.</p><p>The new normal is smoke, ash, orange skies, and constant, nerve-fraying vigilance.</p><p>Climate change impacts throughout the West land crushing economic blows. The 2018 Camp Fire that burned Paradise cost $16.7 billion dollars. NOAA says natural disasters mostly hurricanes and wildfires, both highly climate-related inflicted $91 billion-worth of damage that year; and over the past 40 years, 241 climate- and weather-related disasters cost Americans $1.6 trillion.</p><p>But the first report warns: its not just whats lost in floods and flames. As climate risk worsens, the harder it is for communities to rebuild, for bankers to write mortgages, cor owners to find insurers willing to continue writing policies and paying out claims. That risk spreads beyond burned or flooded land, through the rest of the economy. Climate risk becomes systemic risk, as economists call it. So one of our leading regulatory agencies, the CFTC, has done a report on risk.</p><p>Think of the 2008 Financial Crisis. The home mortgage problem spread far beyond mortgage lenders, into a brutal global economic recession. Millions of people who had no connection to a bad mortgage lost their jobs, their homes, or their retirement savings. We are still recovering from that collapse.</p><p>Now think even bigger. The Stanford Business Schools Corporations and Society Initiative believes the financial risks from climate change are systemic; that these risks are singular in nature; and that [g]lobal economic losses from climate change could reach $23 trillion three or four times the scale of the 2008 Financial Crisis.</p><p>Senator Schatz and I have been calling for financial regulators to do a better job accounting for these risks. In May, we wrote to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Subcommittee on Climate-Related Market Risk. We made two simple requests: one, recommend a carbon price, and two, urge our financial regulators to include climate risks in their core market risk assessments and supervisory practices.</p><p>The CFTC Subcommittee report is out, and Im happy to say, they did both. They write:</p><p>Financial markets will only be able to channel resources efficiently to activities that reduce greenhouse gas emissions if an economy-wide price on carbon is in place at a level that reflects the true social cost of those emissions.</p><p>-and-</p><p>Climate change poses a major risk to the stability of the U.S. financial system and to its ability to sustain the American economy . . . U.S. financial regulators must recognize that climate change poses serious emerging risks to the U.S. financial system, and they should move urgently and decisively to measure, understand, and address these risks.</p><p>What if we dont? The CFTC report goes on: Failing to act would lead to disorderly repricing of assets with cascading effects through the economy. Put simply: do nothing, and trigger financial chaos far and wide. Just like 2008.</p><p>The report calls for corporate America to tell the truth about climate-related risks to their business models. Investors need to know the truth for the free market to work. The Subcommittee writes that we must require disclosure by corporations of information on material, climate-related financial risks . . . to ensure that climate risks are measured and managed effectively. Thats a key point. Weve seen Exxon downplay climate risks to investors and the general public. That mischief will stop if financial regulators require an honest accounting of climate-related risks.</p><p>The CFTC report is a big deal, but it requires Congress to act. America is among the few industrialized nations worst-prepared for wide-ranging reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Regulators will not be enough; Congress must act.</p><p>Thats where another report comes in: Senate Democrats Special Report on the Climate Crisis. Under Chairman Schatzs leadership, we recently released a road map for fixing that problem. We propose a plan to cut emissions across our economy; to get on course to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius; to create a host of new, well-paying jobs in clean energy and other emerging industries; and to remedy the burdens of pollution across all sectors of the economy.</p><p>We know we have a battle ahead. The fossil fuel industry runs a covert operation that has blocked progress. This covert op is extremely well funded, and has reached its roots deeply into our politics. We need to tear up those roots. This is how.</p><p>First, our report tells the dark story of that covert op: the story of the fossil fuel industry apparatus built to obscure the industrys hands behind phony front groups; the story of capture and control of corporate trade associations; the story of lies marketed by flashy PR firms; and of brute-force political spending and threats to blockade climate progress. The tactics were test-run by Big Tobacco. Manufacture false doubt in the science, and flex political muscle against anyone who dares challenge you. That bullying worked pretty well. And when the Supreme Court handed down the Citizens United, the fossil fuel industry supercharged its covert campaign with dark money, almost immediately turning the ability to spend unlimited money in politics into spending unlimited dark money in politics. Then the bullying worked really well.</p><p>Citizens United was a climate watershed. After that decision unleashed its fearful weaponry, not one Republican in this body joined any comprehensive bill to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The Senate heartbeat of bipartisan climate activity before Citizen United flat-lined under the supercharged political pressure unleashed by fossil fuel interests.</p><p>Our Senate report tells the full rotten story, because thats step one in fighting covert influence. Follow the money. Show the American people how corporate interests pay to block progress on climate. Show the trade associations and front groups. See the scheme, and youre less likely to fall for it.</p><p>Second is cleaning it up. Fully exposing and ending Citizens United dark money and the fossil fuel scheme will take reform. Bold transparency measures, like the DISCLOSE Act, are needed. Our report calls for that.</p><p>Then, we need to wake up the so-called good guys in corporate America. They need to see the mischief a few bad actors have perpetrated under their noses. They need to see how the fossil fuel industry commandeered their corporate trade associations, like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which is one of the two most obstructive organizations against climate action right under their noses. And they need to examine how their own lobbyists, their own trade associations and their own political operatives are doing on climate. Because with very few and very rare exceptions, the answer is that they are doing nothing to lift a finger in Congress. Just last week the giant tech companies came in with a thirteen page list of their priorities thirteen pages and not a mention of climate. Google, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, the tech barons never even mentioned climate.</p><p>Everyone needs to understand the two faces of corporate America. Imagine how quickly Congress could act if powerful trade associations like the Chamber became actual advocates for serious climate policies. Or if other interests like Big Ag, or Big Tech, or Wall Street, or the insurance industry actually took an interest in something more than their own special-interest programs and tax benefits. It would be a game changer.</p><p>A 16th century alchemist by the name of Paracelsus is credited with the phrase sola dosis facit venenumthe dose makes the poison. The idea is that everything, from a nerve agent to the water we need to survive, can be lethal if delivered in sufficient dosage.</p><p>Right now in the American West, toxins in the climate wildfire smoke waft in such high concentrations that our typical measurement systems fail. The dosage is literally off the charts.</p><p>And in our Earths atmosphere, the dosage of carbon dioxide is way outside the entire range of human experience, putting all of mankind into uncharted territory, to face unprecedented dangers.</p><p>And Citizens United unleashed toxic doses of money, and unprecedented doses of virulent dark money, into our political atmosphere. Our democracy is poisoned, stunned by secret fossil fuel money and threats, and failing to listen to plain warnings. We must act before the poisons overpower us, and we must get the dosages back to safe and normal levels. A good start would be to wake up to the reality of climate change. I yield the floor.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123953605</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60VP-0KW1-JCBF-S1V4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1671\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 15, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Sheldon Whitehouse:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr./Mdm. President, I am here today for the 267th time to call this chamber to wake up to the threat of climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Let me dive right in with a report from over 30 years ago that was presented to a major conference here in Washington, D.C. On the first page, it reads:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Increases in atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other key gases . . . that are opaque to portions of the infrared spectrum result in the \"greenhouse effect\" or global warming. When short wavelength infrared radiation from the sun warms the earth's surface, and this heat is later radiated from the earth, some gases in the atmosphere are not transparent to the longer wavelength re-radiation, the heat does not escape, and the atmosphere becomes warmer, much as does the interior of a greenhouse.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That's a flawless description of climate change, Mr./Mdm. President.</p><p>Now, after some hedging about the state of the science and the uncertainty surrounding how much climate change could be attributed to humans at that point in time, the report delves into the expected effects of climate change on our planet. It reads:</p><p>There is qualitative agreement among prognosticators that sea levels will rise, wetlands will flood, salt water will infuse fresh water supplies, and there will be changes in the distribution of tree and crop species and agricultural productivity.</p><p>A significant rise in sea levels will flood now habitable land in some countries . . . . Developed countries may be able to protect their cities, at least for some years, by building levees and dikes at a considerable cost to avoid major displacements of people and their economic bases.</p><p>These same actions will affect wetlands and it may not be possible to protect both coastal and wetland areas. Flooding will intrude into water supplies, such as coastal cities (e.g. Miami and New Orleans). . . .</p><p>Changes in temperature patterns will affect natural ecosystems by altering the distributions of species, and affecting forestry and silviculture. Under various scenarios, commonly harvested species will move north and try to grow in different soil types. Ranges of particular species are likely to change because trees in the southern part of the present range may die off much more quickly than they can propagate further north. . . .</p><p>Similarly, crop lands will change. In present farm areas, there will be greater reliance on irrigation. The stress will depend on changes in precipitation patterns, which is now difficult (at best) to predict. Grain production will move north and productivity may fall because of differing soil types. Global warming could expand the northern range of livestock disease and pests. . . . .</p><p>Global warming will affect snowfall patterns, hence melt, and affect water supplies. Most of California's water supplies are from snow melt and if snow is reduced to rain, or melts quickly during the winter, water supplies in the summer will be less than now.</p><p>Fast forward to today and that's what we're seeing. All of it already. Sea level rise is well underway; the tide gauge in Naval Station Newport in Rhode Island shows about 10 inches of sea level rise over the last century. Temperatures are up globally, with some areas measuring increases well above 2 degrees Celsius. Wildlife and plants are shifting away from the equator, like the maple trees that are creeping out of the United States toward Canada. And, of course we have seen water tables continue to drop as temperatures rise and snowpack dwindles.</p><p>What about the prescriptions this report lays out? Those are pretty good for 30 years ago, too. Here's what its authors reckon typical sensible governments will do in response to climate change:</p><p>(1) Reduce the emissions of CO2 by reducing the use or mix of fossil fuels; (2) reduce the emissions of potential pollutants; (3) improve energy efficiency; (4) ban or restrict the manufacture of certain chemicals; and (5) seek to affect the natural emissions of key chemical compounds.</p><p>Indeed, governments around the world have adopted these policies. There are dozens of carbon pricing regimes in place, including in some of our biggest global competitors like the program China is rolling out this year. There are comprehensive energy efficiency programs, and bans on climate-damaging chemicals like HFCs, and global efforts to harness natural processes like growing trees to sequester carbon.</p><p>This rigorous analysis was so good that its authors eagerly thrust it into the hands of political leaders. Not only did they present it to the Symposium on Industrial Development and Climate Change in May 1989, they submitted it to the U.S. House of Representatives at a hearing on the same day. In that hearing, the authors \"commended\" the House committee on the legislation and expressed support for \"coordinat[ing] federal research and national global climate change policy efforts.\"</p><p>So what was this sensible, forward-thinking group lauding a smart bill designed to prepare us for climate change? Who was it over 30 years ago presenting these sound findings and recommendations to international business leaders and members of Congress?</p><p>It was the U.S. Chamber of Commercethe biggest, most powerful trade group in Washington and one of the biggest obstructors of climate action in Washington today, according to the non-partisan watchdog Influence Map.</p><p>Here's a chart showing the big corporate players in Washington on climate. Here are the good guys the ones pressing for smart climate solutions on one end. And here's the Chamber, on a sparsely populated island here on the other end. As Influence Map's Dylan Tanner testified last fall, \"The US Chamber of Commerce . . . is likely the most authoritative voice of American business\" and it has been one of the most ardent opponents of climate action.</p><p>Gross. The Chamber knew about this problem early on. It took its own sound climate report to business leaders and the U.S. Congress in the 1980s. It was poised to be a part of the solution to climate change, early on before it metastasized into the crisis we see today.</p><p>But here's what the Chamber did instead:</p><p>It has opposed one comprehensive climate bill after another in Congress.</p><p>First, the bipartisan cap and trade bill in 2005, the Energy Policy Act; the Chamber sent out a \"Key Vote Alert\" signal that whoever voted in favor of the bill could face an onslaught of political attacks in the next election.</p><p>In 2007, the Chamber ran political TV ads against climate legislation claiming that it would prevent people from heating their homes and driving to work.</p><p>In 2009, the Chamber led the charge against the Waxman-Markey bill.</p><p>Since the Chamber tanked Waxman-Markey, Republicans in Congress have refused to hold hearings on, mark up, debate, or vote on any legislation proposing a policy framework for economy-wide reductions in carbon pollution.</p><p>The Chamber fought climate action in the courts and at the executive branch. Here are some lowlights of that mischief:</p><p>In 2010, the Chamber sued the EPA, seeking to overturn the finding that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health and welfare. Disabling the \"endangerment finding\" would cripple the agency's ability to regulate carbon pollution under the Clean Air Act.</p><p>When courts rejected the Chamber's lawsuit, the Chamber became central command for corporate lawyers, coal lobbyists, and Republican political strategists who devised the legal schemes to fight climate regulations. This produced another Chamber lawsuit, to block the Clean Power Plan to reduce carbon pollution from power plants.</p><p>Once President Trump took office, the Chamber switched from defense to offense, and began attacking Obama administration rules limiting carbon pollution. The Chamber even funded the phony report the Trump administration used to justify leaving the Paris Accord.</p><p>Perhaps worst of all, the Chamber has been fighting science itself.</p><p>It proposed putting the evidence of climate change on trial in what its own officials branded \"the Scopes monkey trial of the 21st century.\" Indeed, the Chamber said the trial \"would be evolution versus creationism.\"</p><p>And of course, the Chamber has been the 800-pound gorilla in elections that every member of Congress and candidate for Congress knows all too well.</p><p>Since the 2010 Citizens United decision allowed outside groups to spend unlimited sums on electioneering activities, the Chamber has funneled roughly $150 million into congressional races. This makes the Chamber the largest spender of undisclosed donations or dark money on congressional races.</p><p>Cross the Chamber and you risk triggering an ad against you like the one run against a US Senate candidate in Pennsylvania in 2016 suggesting her climate position was akin to stealing youthful energy from American children.</p><p>Classy.</p><p>So what gives? How did the Chamber go from sensible climate realist to hardened climate obstructor?</p><p>The answer is pretty simple: fossil fuel money. As Influence Map's Dylan Tanner told us at our hearing, big trade groups like the Chamber \"tend to adopt the lowest common denominator positions on climate of their most oppositional members.\" For the Chamber, that lowest common denominator is Big Oil and other fossil fuel giants. Fossil fuel needs the Chamber to defend at all costs what the IMF estimates was a $650 billion subsidy in the U.S. in 2015. So that's exactly what the Chamber does.</p><p>Ok, but what about the rest of the Chamber's big members?</p><p>Big Tech? What about you? After all, you've got companies in your ranks who claim to care a lot about climate.</p><p>Google's company motto is don't be evil. Google warns investors that climate change threatens its operations; that its \"systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from . . . natural disasters [and] the effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, wildfires, and increased storm severity).\" Google also tells investors that \"[c]limate change is one of the most significant global challenges of our time,\" and that its goal is to reach 100 percent renewable energy for our operations.\" Google signed the Corporate Renewable Energy Buyers' Principles and the American Business Act on Climate Pledge.</p><p>Yet Google too funds the Chamber's anti-climate crusade.</p><p>Or big food and beverage companies, what about you? After all, those crops that Chamber report told us would be affected by climate change, those are your bread and butter. Indeed, many food and beverage companies say they understand the threat of climate change.</p><p>Pepsi signed the Ceres BICEP Climate Declaration and the Prince of Wales's Corporate Leaders Group Trillion Tonne Communique both important commitments to climate action.</p><p>Coke says it plans to reduce CO2 emissions by 25 percent, and that to do so it \"will work to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions across its value chain, making comprehensive carbon footprint reductions across its manufacturing processes, packaging formats, delivery fleet, refrigeration equipment and ingredient sourcing.\"</p><p>Yet both Coke and Pepsi fund the Chamber of Commerce! And they fund the American Beverage Association, which in turn runs money to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The end result? Two companies that are actively reducing their carbon emissions and enthusiastically supporting good climate policy have the position, via their funding of the Chamber, of opposing climate action in Washington, the place where it really counts.</p><p>Mr./Mdm. President, decades ago one of the most powerful political forces in Washington, the U.S. Chamber, knew climate change was coming. It understood the risks. It knew what we need to do to head off the worst consequences. It even supported legislation to help us prepare.</p><p>Nevertheless, due to the greed of one member industry and the indifference of many others, we have yet to act.</p><p>At the close of the Chamber's report is a quote from the satirical comic strip Pogo: \"We have met the enemy, and it is us.\"</p><p>Corporate America, until you extract yourself from the thrall of evildoers in your midst, you will remain the enemy of action on climate change.</p><p>Please, at long last, wake up.</p><p>I yield the floor.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123531998</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YC3-VK51-DYTH-G16R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2023\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 5, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

I'm a technologist who spends his days building software, studying the economy and thinking about the future. On December 13th, 2013, I lost my job. It was my birthday and so I spent the next 9 days thinking about my life. On December 24th, 2013, I decided to bet my life savings of $1,100 on the US cable industry and hedge fund manager <person><nameText>John Paulson[</nameText></person>2] of Paulson Co. After reading hundreds of articles, analyzing charts and discussing the idea with others, I made a bet on Time Warner Cableoptions. Why? Because the original Cable Cowboy, <person><nameText>John Malone </nameText></person>is preparing a bid for TWC with Liberty and Charter with backing from Goldman Sachs. I believe this bid will be the first shot fired in a War for Airwaves. Comcast is interested, Cox is in the mix and a host of other big tech companies detailed below. The Feds have indicated they will not create high regulatory barriers for approval, so this looks like a recipe for fireworks and I'm about to explain why I think this.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/>Though under fire and losing customers, Time Warner Cableis a rare target at a rare time. It's been more than 7 years since we saw a cable company of this size go on the block. This news is breaking over the holidays and not many are paying attention to the important facts of what will become one of the greatest battles in corporate history. The world's tech titans will clash over this, fight for it and someone will win. I call it 'Time Warner Cable: An Epic War for the Last Mile'.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The War<br/><br/><br/><br/>This is my prediction for what will be a high-intensity and expensive battle for the pipes. The tech titans of the world have more cash than they've ever had in history and all of them want your eyeballs. On January 1st, 2014, Rob Marcus will take over as CEO of Time Warner Cableand then it will begin. It's a very 'weird time' says BusinessWeek. My opinion, it signals that opening bids are due for the AUCTION. Rob Marcus, who has been in MA for years, is our auctioneer and he will signal that TWC is now for sale. Marcus is also incentivized as he will receive a $50MM exit bonus for selling. How's that for encouragement from the board? Another interesting fact, even though Time Warner Cableis losing subscribers, the company has quit fighting content pricing and are agreeing to pay higher rates to the likes of Viacom, CBS and others. That sounds like you plan on selling the company Mr. Marcus.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Players<br/><br/><br/><br/>Below are all the people and companies who might have an interest in controlling the last mile to your home and they will be firing on all cylinders in this one. Once you own the last mile, you own the consumer until such time as a new technology disrupts your business. Time Warner and Charter among others have been building out their networks with fiber into buildings around the country so the asset is valuable and the consumer is even more valuable.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Time Warner Cablebowing out signals the decline of the old model for the cable industry because of competition, pricing increases and terrible business models. But the pipes are what everyone has always wanted and this is a gem. The pipes are gold folks.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Why would they do this? Let's take a look at the players:<br/><br/><br/><br/>1. Apple: $140+ billion cash, $500 billion market cap, $53.666 billion free cash flow[3]<br/><br/>The Big Cash Machine\u2026bidders beware. Apple wants pipes for their TV system. They are also suing Time Warner for patents. Winning this let's Apple take control of phones, music, cable, tablets, tv and more. Once combined, it will be hard to beat them with the full integration between those platforms. That's why we can expect some serious bids. Apple winning may cause damage to almost all the hardware manufacturers in the US locking consumers to Apple.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>2. Microsoft: $68.3 billion cash, $312 billion market cap[4]<br/><br/>XBOX One.<br/><br/><br/><br/>3. Google: $30+ billion cash, $373 billion market cap[5]<br/><br/>Sergey and Larry just bought Boston Robotics with plenty more cash to spend. So why not enhance the existing google fiber rollouts with the addition of the TWC network.<br/><br/><br/><br/>4. Cisco: $46.4 billion cash, $116 billion market cap[6]<br/><br/>They control the switching and plumbing of the net. Why wouldn't they want to own the TV?<br/><br/><br/><br/>5. Oracle: $33.7 billion cash, $169.51 billion market cap[7]<br/><br/>Larry Ellison flies Russian Migs, wins America's cup with high-tech sailboats and he has a corporation named Oracle. He should jump in this war and drive prices higher. In the end, his databases will power the storage of content, data and make more money.<br/><br/><br/><br/>6. Qualcomm: $28.4 billion, $124 billion market cap[8]<br/><br/>They have chips and hardware for the industry so they might lose some business especially if Apple takes over.<br/><br/><br/><br/>7. America Movil (Carlos Slim):[9]<br/><br/>He's the richest man in the world and owns the largest Latin American wireless network. This would be a prime asset to have a controlling stake in the US cable market.<br/><br/><br/><br/>8. Warren Buffet: Berkshire Hathaway[10]<br/><br/>He is the Oracle of Omaha. He's got cash. $40+ billion. Warren makes great bets like Goldman Sachs at the bottom of the crash. Sit this one out Warren. The asset isn't worth it. Buy the options though.<br/><br/><br/><br/>9. Intel: $8.5 billion cash, $127 billion market cap[11]<br/><br/>Intel wins either way, but they'd also like to expand their brand to the TV. The pipes are right.<br/><br/><br/><br/>10. Amazon: $8 billion cash $185 billion market cap[12]<br/><br/>Bezos has Amazon's video system and tying it to the pipes would be awesome for him.<br/><br/><br/><br/>11. Walt Disney: $4 billion, $131 billion market cap[13]<br/><br/>Disney has a partner in Apple as Steve Jobs was the largest shareholder from the Pixar buyout. I see them working together on this one.<br/><br/><br/><br/>12. Yahoo!: $41 billion market cap[14]<br/><br/>CEO Marissa Mayer is an ex-Googler. Not core space for them but their content networks, search and finance sites are great. Partner up Marissa!<br/><br/><br/><br/>13. Verizon: $225 billion in assets, $140 billion market cap[15]<br/><br/>They want the pipes so expect some action out of them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>14. ATT: $5 billion cash, $185 billion market cap, $275 billion assets[16]<br/><br/>See above.<br/><br/><br/><br/> 15. Comcast: $11 billion cash, $134.27 billion market cap[17]<br/><br/> See above<br/><br/><br/><br/> 16. Michael Dell: billions, hardware manufacturing[18]<br/><br/> Mike has a highly efficient company for making hardware devices. PCs are dead and entering cable might give him a boost to his hardware business by vertically integrating it. It also ensures we keep the pipes open and stop Apple from limiting innovation. Bring back the WinTel cartel and fight!<br/><br/><br/><br/>17. Liberty Media and Charter: $130+ / share ($62 billion)[19]<br/><br/><person><nameText>John Malone, </nameText></person>the original Cable Cowboy, is firing the First Shot. I think he should team up with the satellites to fight this one.<br/><br/><br/><br/>18. Cox Communications: Private, BBB+ rated bonds.[20]<br/><br/>They want the pipes like everyone else.<br/><br/><br/><br/>19. Dish: $3 billion cash, $27 billion market cap[21]<br/><br/>The dish is done. It's bulky, slow and has so many issues. Dish can ensure survival if they get this deal.<br/><br/><br/><br/>20. DirecTV: $2 billion, $35.4 billion market cap Needs a partner[22]<br/><br/>See[23] my assessment from DISH.<br/><br/><br/><br/> 21. GE: $77 billion cash, $281 billion market cap[24]<br/><br/> Thomas Edison founded this company. They own NBC and other media properties. They are a powerhouse and they wants pipes.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>22. News Corp: $10 billion market cap, $2 billion cash[25]<br/><br/>Newspapers are in major decline and nothing will bring them back. Pipes could revitalize the business for Murdoch.<br/><br/><br/><br/>23. Viacom: $2.4 billion, $38 billion market cap.[26]<br/><br/>Viacom must have been surprised when Time Warner just rolled in and shook hands. Signals that Time Warner knows they're going to get some action.<br/><br/><br/><br/>24. Netflix[27]<br/><br/>They have content flowing like House of Cards and a model that releases all episodes at once. That's real innovation and players like Hulu, Wal-mart and others w/ digital video delivery systems may be involved.<br/><br/><br/><br/>25. Mark Cuban:[28]<br/><br/>Mark is a guy who likes to rough up the business world, sports and other industries. Let's go Mavs!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Top Shareholders<br/><br/><br/><br/><person><nameText>John Paulson, </nameText></person>Paulson and Co. (4MM shares)[29]<br/><br/>He is always ahead of the curve, killed it in 2007-2008 with default swaps and I believe he sees a battle coming. He loaded up on<br/><br/><br/><br/>Conclusion <br/><br/>My conclusion is that someone is going to win this deal and it will change the face of the industry, but before it does, its going to cost some serious cash. In the end, these are pipes and they deliver content. The questions these companies must answer are the following: What happens if I lose? How much are the pipes worth today and how much value do they bring to me in the future. Lastly, does owning the pipes give you control of the consumer if we have freedom of speech, expression and religion? Does it mean we are free to surf the web if one company controls it all? These are important questions that will be answered in the near future.<br/><br/><br/><br/>So Let the games begin!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>References:<br/><br/><br/><br/>Cox Bid:<br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-26/cox-said-to-be-mulling-time-warner-cable-takeover-joining-fray.html\">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-26/cox-said-to-be-mulling-time-warner-cable-takeover-joining-fray.html</url>[30]<br/><br/><br/><br/>TWC @ $170 bid<br/><br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://blogs.barrons.com/techtraderdaily/2013/12/03/time-warner-charter-bid-could-be-worth-170-in-a-year-says-evercore/\">http://blogs.barrons.com/techtraderdaily/2013/12/03/time-warner-charter-bid-could-be-worth-170-in-a-year-says-evercore/</url>[31]<br/><br/><br/><br/>Buyout Buzz: Verizon or TWC???<br/><br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://investorplace.com/2013/12/verizon-vz-twc-cmcsa-chtr-catv-buyouts/\">http://investorplace.com/2013/12/verizon-vz-twc-cmcsa-chtr-catv-buyouts/</url>[32]<br/><br/><br/><br/>Apple TV Snubbed by TWC: Pay up AAPL, TWC wants that $180 / share<br/><br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.tweaktown.com/news/34445/apple-tv-snubbed-time-warner-cable-app-out-on-amazon-kindle-fire/index.html\">http://www.tweaktown.com/news/34445/apple-tv-snubbed-time-warner-cable-app-out-on-amazon-kindle-fire/index.html</url>[33]<br/><br/><br/><br/>Warren Buffet:<br/><br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-31/buffett-s-40-billion-cash-pile-provides-acquisition-fuel.html\">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-31/buffett-s-40-billion-cash-pile-provides-acquisition-fuel.html</url>[34]<br/><br/><br/><br/>Intel TVs<br/><br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/smart-tv/tv-devices.html\">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/smart-tv/tv-devices.html</url>[35]<br/><br/><br/><br/>This guy didn't do his homework:<br/><br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://247wallst.com/media/2013/12/05/time-warner-cable-wants-150-to-160-in-buyout-maybe-too-much/\">http://247wallst.com/media/2013/12/05/time-warner-cable-wants-150-to-160-in-buyout-maybe-too-much/</url>[36]<br/><br/><br/><br/>Regulators rolling over even after cable fees were hiked by triple digits over last few years.<br/><br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://wallstcheatsheet.com/stocks/time-warner-merger-could-find-path-past-regulators.html/?a=viewall\">http://wallstcheatsheet.com/stocks/time-warner-merger-could-find-path-past-regulators.html/?a=viewall</url>[37]<br/><br/>Patent Trolling:<br/><br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dailytech.com/Apple\">http://www.dailytech.com/Apple</url>+and+Microsoft+Expand+Patent+Trolling+Sue+TWC+Cisco+via+Subsidiary/article33987.htm[38]<br/><br/><br/><br/>Apps for different companies, picking and choosing\u2026<br/><br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.deadline.com/2013/08/apple-tv-gets-disney-channels-app-microsofts-xbox-offers-time-warner-cable/\">http://www.deadline.com/2013/08/apple-tv-gets-disney-channels-app-microsofts-xbox-offers-time-warner-cable/</url>[39]<br/><br/><br/><br/>Patent Trolls YouTube:<br/><br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3bPpyJxvY4\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3bPpyJxvY4</url>[40]<br/><br/><br/><br/>Apple's 10% of Corporate Cash Hoard<br/><br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.geekwire.com/2013/apple-controls-10-percent-corporate-cash-microsoft-place/\">http://www.geekwire.com/2013/apple-controls-10-percent-corporate-cash-microsoft-place/</url>[41]<br/><br/>TWC offering for Big Brother<br/><br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB20001424052970203716204577018171500032472\">http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB20001424052970203716204577018171500032472</url>[42]<br/><br/><br/><br/>Buffet cash:<br/><br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-31/buffett-s-40-billion-cash-pile-provides-acquisition-fuel.html\">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-31/buffett-s-40-billion-cash-pile-provides-acquisition-fuel.html</url>[43]<br/><br/><br/><br/>Buyout is caused by Falling Subs.

It definitely knew I was getting married within hours of my husband bending down on one knee. It was the first time I realised just how sophisticated the social network was at harvesting and using my data to target adverts at me. And ever since I've been slightly wary about what I click on.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm not entirely sure that Facebook isn't listening to my conversations too, such are the coincidental posts that appear in my timeline seconds after I've mentioned my temporary veganism or eating a pasty in the office.</p><p>I know Facebook is monitoring me. And I've been aware for several years now that personality quizzes or \"guess my age\" posts or \"click on the month you were born to find out which animal you are\" are designed to extract my data. Why else would they exist? I've always been slightly uncomfortable that Facebook creates a bubble around me, showing me only the posts that it thinks I'll be interested in. It's why in the lead-up to the EU Referendum, I - and millions of others - were convinced that Remain would win. How wrong we were.</p><p>The hashtag #DeleteFacebook has been trending on Twitter this week, appearing more than 10,000 times within a two-hour period on Wednesday, according to the analytics service ExportTweet. The news that Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm that worked on Donald Trump's Presidential campaign, was able to gain access to private data through the social network has sparked a huge backlash among its users.</p><p>For all those people who accepted that Facebook's algorithms were monitoring us and creating an echo chamber around us, the idea that our data may have been used to influence elections is definitely a step too far.</p><p>It seems absurd that when the Government is bringing in a new Data Protection Bill in May and companies are about to become governed by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to restrict how people's data is being used, that huge tech firms such as Facebook are seemingly still harvesting data at every opportunity and using that data in a way that none of their users would agree to if they were given a clear choice.</p><p>The new data rules make data collection and direct marketing incredibly restrictive for most organisations, from sole traders to charities, small and medium sized enterprises to huge companies. Even a small charity looking to email a select group of supporters with updates on their fundraising has to gain opt-in permission from those supporters to contact them under GDPR.</p><p>It's such a massive change that pub chain JD Wetherspoon deleted its entire email mailing list last year and announced it would stop sending newsletters via email. Instead, it tellingly said it would promote deals on its website and Twitter and Facebook. Several companies have also received fines for sending marketing messages to people who didn't explicitly consent to receive emails.</p><p>This drive towards ensuring people consent in a meaningful way to how their data is used is great but it has to apply to big tech companies as well.</p><p>The likes of Facebook need to be far more transparent about what they're doing with people's data - it shouldn't be up to them to decide what's OK when it comes to using our information. It should be up to us. And it should be clear. </p><p>Cambridge Analytica has forced everyone to sit up and take notice of how much data we're giving away and where and how it's being used. And it's not just about Facebook. Google is all over me like a rash, instantly guessing my search queries based on previous searches and serving ads that follow me around the internet like an annoying shadow, just because I once looked at a dress in Matalan online.</p><p>Twitter and Instagram and Snapchat and all the other networks aren't much better.

But when it comes to papering over the problems it's created, it's happy taking a page out of a well-worn corporate playbook.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Over the last month, Google, Apple, and, most recently, Facebook and Instagram, have all unveiled features intended to give people a better understanding of and control over how they use their phones.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The features are part of the \"Time Well Spent\" movement, a phrase popularized in 2017 meant to address concerns about screen addiction, particularly for adolescent development. The idea of the movement, and now its Big Tech-endorsed manifestations, is that through tools to understand and manage use, people can fight addiction and have a sense that the time sucked into the vortex of our smartphones is \"well spent.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Sounds great, right? The first step to correcting a behavior is through understanding it, after all. But there's reason to be skeptical of Facebook's Time Management, Apple's Screen Time, and Google's Digital Wellbeing, too.</p><p> They're a solution offered by the people that created the problem in the first place. Why should we embrace an answer presented by organizations for whom a true solution to smart phone addiction \u2014 I.E. not using smartphones at all \u2014 would put them out of business?</p><p> We should also be wary because these initiatives look similar to the efforts to combat addiction enacted by Big Tobacco, Big Food, and other industries that create addictive products \u2014 namely, light cigarettes and \"fat free\" food. That similarity, and the impulse to self-police before government regulators step in, links industries that history has deemed harmful, with Big Tech \u2014 an industry that likes to think of itself as a global do-gooder. That's an association we can learn from in order to better judge the tech industry's volunteered solutions to the problems of its own making.</p><p> What Time Well Spent features really do is re-frame the screen addiction issue in a way that benefits tech companies, and does not necessarily help tech users. They place the blame for screen addiction on the way people use products, shifting accountability off of the products themselves. It's not us, it's you, the initiatives seem to say.</p><p> Now where have we heard that before...</p><p>Facebook is working on \"Your Time on Facebook\" which could help users to manage their time spent on Facebook app.</p><p>Instagram is also working on helping users to improve their digital wellbeing: <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/y38mV3RtqB\">https://t.co/y38mV3RtqB</url></p><p> as previously spotted: <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/D26M9RuSxG\">https://t.co/D26M9RuSxG</url> pic.twitter.com/YqSyH0fpII</p><p> \u2014 Jane Manchun Wong (@wongmjane) June 22, 2018</p><p> All aboard the bandwagon</p><p> It began as a brewing PR storm. In the summer of 2017, former Google employee Tristan Harris started making the media rounds, arguing for the need for a new ethics in technology design: Time Well Spent. He founded his own company called Humane Tech, did a popular Ted Talk, participated in several media features, and spread the gospel about what he was calling a \"digital attention crisis\": the intentional creation of addictive products by Google, Facebook, and other tech companies.</p><p> Then, in the fall, a few impactful articles and studies about the negative effects that smartphones were having on childhood development landed. Not only were smartphones perhaps intentionally addictive, but they were having impacts beyond just adults feeling like they were wasting time: they were making children rampantly more depressed, under-developed, and, ironically, anti-social.</p><p> Next, in early 2018, the problem went mainstream. Apple shareholders penned a letter to the company asking it to address screen-time addiction. The New York Times published a sweeping take about anxiety-inducing \"red dot\" notifications. And Tristan Harris reappeared on TV to criticize Facebook directly, calling it a \"living, breathing crime scene\"  \u2014 and advocate for his solution, time well spent.</p><p> The narrative that tech companies weren't just creating products to \"help people\" was starting to break through. And, amidst revelations about Russian election meddling and companies like Cambridge Analytica sucking millions' of peoples' data, Facebook in particular \u2014 but the tech industry as a whole \u2014 faced a torrent of negative public opinion, including calls to #DeleteFacebook and create space in our lives away from technology.</p><p>Facebook was the first to react with an attempt to turn its image around through the time well spent credo. Through a Facebook post from Mark Zuckerberg, it announced plans to re-focus Facebook products on \"meaningful\" interactions. It in fact directly co-opted the 'Time Well Spent' motto for itself, in name as well as in intention.</p><p> \"Facebook has always been about personal connections,\" Zuckerberg wrote in a Facebook post. \"By focusing on bringing people closer together \u2014 whether it's with family and friends, or around important moments in the world \u2014 we can help make sure that Facebook is time well spent.\"</p><p> Next, Instagram confirmed that it was working on some Time Well Spent features, mostly focused on an activity dashboard to see how much you use the app.</p><p> We're building tools that will help the IG community know more about the time they spend on Instagram \u2013 any time should be positive and intentional.</p><p> \u2014 Kevin S. (@kevin) May 16, 2018</p><p> Then, during developer conference season, Google and then Apple both unveiled new tools to both understand and manage time spent on iPhone and Android. Google's \"digital wellbeing\" and Apple's \"screen time\" both offer an activity dashboard, as well as app time limits and more robust do not disturb modes.</p><p> Finally, Facebook announced on August 1 that it would roll out a suite of tools called \"Time Management\" as an extension of its time well spent directive. With Time Management, Facebook and Instagram users can see how much time they're spending in the apps per week (though not week over week), can mute notifications for up to eight hours at a time, and can set notifications to pop up when they've reached the amount of time they decide they want to spend in the app.</p><p>Facebook representative Gretchen Sloan said that Facebook does not have a formal relationship with Harris' Center for Humane Technology, but acknowledges the connection as an industry movement.</p><p> \"We are incredibly invested in ensuring people have a healthy relationship with technology, so I think we all share a similar goal,\" Sloan said.</p><p> People have already started using the features, some aghast at how much they pick up their phones, some  \u2014 like Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey \u2014 embracing the feature.</p><p> \"They want you to like your device, they want you to be in a long term relationship with it,\" Nir Eyal, a behavioral design expert, said. \"The natural market response is we can make this better.\"</p><p> This is a great feature. Will be interesting to see how this changes behavior pic.twitter.com/q5U5npj6QH</p><p> \u2014 jack (@jack) June 27, 2018</p><p> Same song, different tune</p><p> Tell me if this sounds familiar. Over the course of several years, health officials begin warning the public about the potential dangers of a product. Next, lawmakers start bringing up the issue in Congress. Then, the industries unveil a solution to the burgeoning problem. See, they say, we can change the product to address these \"concerns.\" Not to worry! We care about our customers!</p><p> Even with not strictly addictive products, there is a long history of industries changing their products or behavior when the public gets wind of a problem. Sometimes, this genuinely benefits consumers and makes products safer or better.</p><p> But other times, it is a stopgap measure, implemented to maintain profits and avoid external consequences like regulation, that doesn't actually improve the underlying problem, and can even make it worse.</p><p> The most nefarious example of this tactic is light cigarettes. In the 1960's cigarette companies decided to go on the offensive in response to reports that cigarettes caused cancer. They came out with \"light\" cigarettes, which lowered the amount of cancer-causing tar  \u2014 along with the nicotine content. But smokers who opted for light cigarettes just ended up smoking more to compensate for the lowered hit of tobacco. Or, users would cover filtering holes, so they'd end up sucking more (just different) toxic chemicals into their lungs.</p><p> Light cigarettes were an attempt to supposedly empower smokers to use the product more healthfully. That appeased concerns in the short term, but didn't actually stop addiction or its consequences. Congress ultimately banned light cigarettes in 2010.</p><p>University of Michigan Professor Ken Warner has studied the Big Tobacco playbook, and how Big Food borrowed from it when it faced a health PR crisis of its own.</p><p> Big Food followed Big Tobacco's lead in the 1980s once health experts and then lawmakers started realizing that red blooded Americans were getting red blooded heart disease thanks to all the fatty foods they were eating. Voila, the food industry unveiled \"low fat,\" \"fat free,\" and sugar free products. But now, studies show that the popular diet foods of the '80s and '90s actually caused weight gain by both making people eat more, and by introducing calorie-free, artificial ingredients that actually mess with the way we digest food, and can even cause cancer.</p><p> Light cigarettes and diet food are part of a legacy of preemptive self-regulating, according to Warner. That includes the auto industry with seatbelts, the health industry with insurance premiums, and most recently, with Juul's attempt to discourage youth vaping.</p><p> \"There are lots of examples like this of industries trying to voluntarily either regulate themselves or discourage abusive use of their products,\" Warner said. \"Frequently, there's reason to be skeptical.\"</p><p> This pattern does not necessarily work against consumers. But we shouldn't forget the history of light cigarettes on one hand, and seatbelts on the other, before we embrace Time Well Spent.</p><p> Healthy Skepticism</p><p> Light cigarettes, diet food, and seatbelts have some suspect similarities, but also crucial differences, with tech companies' Time Well Spent features.</p><p> First, these new features and products are all presented by the companies that created the societal problem. In these instances, being skeptical with regard to the source of the solution is important, because the source determines the motivations behind the creation of that solution \u2014 and that's where things get a little trickier.</p><p> One simple and overarching motivation for all of these products, is the need to maintain profits. Marlboro, Ford, and certainly Facebook, all have an interest in keeping their customers using their products \u2014 even if that means encouraging people, for some time, to use their products less.</p><p> \"Their motivation is in a backwards kind of way to maintain profit by trying to avoid more strict regulation or intervention by others,\" Dr. Warner said. \"They may take a short term hit on their bottom line, in order to maintain long-term customer retention.\"</p><p>Facebook addressed the question of how Time Management will impact its business in similar, but softer, terms. Facebook sees keeping people engaged, rather than passively scrolling, as good for its bottom line.</p><p> \"In terms of the business, engagement is a great metric for us, and when people are passively scrolling, that's not good for us either,\" Sloan said. \"We want people's time to be intentional and meaningful \u2014 that's actually good for the business.\"</p><p> But social media companies would be loathe to put themselves in the same category as the makers of addictive products. That's because there is a perception seemingly within \u2014 and certainly outward facing \u2014 that they want their companies to be good for the world.</p><p> \"They think of themselves as good guys,\" Dr. Warner said. \"A campaign like this may be somewhat well-motivated to preserve that image. We are interested in you, we're interested in protecting you, we want to protect the broader society, and so on.\"</p><p> Tech companies maintain that they truly care about their users. Google told Mashable over email that it tries to listen to the concerns of its users, and created its digital wellbeing tools in response to the 70 percent of Android users it spoke with who want to find a better balance with their phones. When asked about the impetus for digital wellbeing in response to screen time addiction, Google stressed that it takes very seriously what it sees as its responsibility to improve people's lives.</p><p>Apple has also stressed that it wants Screen Time to empower its users, and both Facebook and Instagram (via founder Kevin Roose) echoed that sentiment.</p><p> \"These tools are the first step in understanding how people better want to use and find a balance with technology,\" David Ginsberg, Facebook's head of research, said. \"The goal here is giving people the power to better manage their time, and then allowing them to decide for themselves.\"</p><p> Understanding how time online impacts people is important, and it's the responsibility of all companies to be honest about this. We want to be part of the solution. I take that responsibility seriously.</p><p> \u2014 Kevin S. (@kevin) May 16, 2018</p><p> So it's likely that Time Well Spent features can both improve the bottom line and retain cagey customers, while also even perhaps being driven by what the tech industry says is good intention.</p><p> \"What happens is if you overdo it and you burn people out, they dial back and they quit altogether,\" Nir Eyal said. \"It behooves any product maker to make sure they think in the long term, to enable people to find value in the product for a long time.\"</p><p> Even if tech companies have possibly rosier-tinted intentions than the addiction-reliant tobacco industry, its Time Well Spent features have more in common with light cigarettes and diet food than just source and motivation.</p><p> Just as diet food and light cigarettes caused people to eat and smoke more, respectively, it's entirely possible that checking your activity dashboard could become an addictive smartphone habit in its own right. Especially for stats-lovers, it's easy to see how counting what you do on your smart phone just becomes another thing you can't stop doing.</p><p> Then there's the question of why tech companies chose the options of an activity dashboard, and timers. Mashable reached out to Google, Facebook, Apple, and Instagram, and asked whether and what research these companies conducted or consulted that showed that Time Well Spent features, including activity dashboards, would actually reduce time spent on smartphones. Google and Apple declined to comment. Facebook said that it worked very closely with researchers to learn how social media can improve wellbeing, but has yet to cite, nor did it conduct, specific research showing that time well spent features have a proven ability to impact behavior.</p><p> This apparent lack of sound research into the tactics presented to fight a problem mirrors the insufficient scientific work by both the tobacco and food industries, who created solutions that actually made their problems worse.</p><p> Yet the way that Time Well Spent diverges from light cigarettes and diet food may actually be the biggest indictment of all. In the case of food and tobacco, these companies changed their products to be \"healthier.\" The time well spent features tweak the products, but don't fundamentally change the smartphone. Instead, these tools come with the expectation  \u2014 presented as an opportunity for empowerment \u2014 that it's up to the users to change their behavior; the onus is not on the products themselves.</p><p> Time Well Spent features turn the tables on the problem of screen time addiction. Providing \"helpful tools\" to let people have supposedly healthier relationships with their phones actually works to absolve the tech industries of blame for creating an addictive product. These tools send the message that the problem is not the addictive product itself \u2014 it's the fact that you, human, get addicted. But there's no need to go cold turkey, of course \u2014 here's a suite of stats and reminders to have a \"healthy relationship\" with your time-sucking pocket robot, because we're here to help.</p><p> Nearly 63% of Instagram users report being miserable, a higher share than for any other social network <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/ufvmC6hY0P\">https://t.co/ufvmC6hY0P</url></p><p> \u2014 The Economist (@TheEconomist) August 2, 2018</p><p> Burn one down</p><p> Of course, there are few among us at this point who would even want to quit our smartphones and social media entirely. As Nir Eyal pointed out, technology has changed the world, and maybe for the better. And, naturally, anything that changes the world does take some time to get right.</p><p> \"For the first time in human history, we have an abundance of calories and entertainment,\" Eyal said. \"I don't know anybody who wants to go back. I think we all would much prefer an age where we can create enough food for everyone. The same thing happens with our technology. We want to be connected to people. But that also learns that we have to moderate our use sometimes.\"</p><p> And, it's true that light cigarettes may not be a perfect metaphor for Time Well Spent features, primarily because we don't know yet that they'll actually cause harm  \u2014 beyond maybe keeping some people who were considering quitting hooked up to the matrix.</p><p> \"I think a better analogy for the tech initiative is fast food restaurants' publishing of nutritional information on their menus,\" Prof. Greta Hsu, who has studied cigarette industry marketing, said. \"In both cases, I don't believe there is reason to assume or expect deception. However, it's not clear either will impact consumer behavior.\"</p><p> But... what if we were able to go cold turkey? I'm not sure if I buy the tech industry's narrative that social media and smart phones have made the world a better place; the ability to instantly connect is not necessarily a gift. That skeptical and concerned counter-story is the one that was starting to get told \u2014 and increasingly spread \u2014 before Time Well Spent came along to place the tech industry on our side.</p><p> What if social media and smart phones have made the world a worse place? If we can acknowledge that no timer, no dashboard, no reminder to breathe or stand, could make the use of a smartphone \"healthy,\" going cold turkey doesn't sound unreasonable. Maybe, we shouldn't just cut down to one cigarette a day, even \u2014 but throw out the whole damn pack.</p><p> Unlike cigarettes, smartphones and Time Well Spent features won't kill us. But in our democracy, our social lives, our senses of selves, and our souls, smartphones just might be the death of us. So maybe we should quit, and not just cut back, if we still can.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>I wish I could quit u.

Wu, a former candidate for lieutenant governor of New York, writes that we've reverted to the economic structures of a over century ago \"as if trapped in a bad movie sequel.\" Today fewer, larger companies dominate the economy. Since 1997, US public markets have lost more than half of their publicly traded firms, and oligopolies control industries like finance, communications, airlines, and pharmaceuticals. In the United States, the top 1 percent has amassed 38.6 percent of the national wealth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the era of the great monopolists also offers us the antidote: robust antitrust laws. Wu wants to recover the political courage to go after concentrated private power, and his book draws lessons from the likes of Louis Brandeis and Theodore Roosevelt. To understand the danger we're in, he argues that we must look back at the last period of great inequality and relearn how we made it out.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Wu sat down with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Nation</emphasis>'s Christopher Shay and discussed the connections between corporate concentration, democracy, and living a fulfilling life.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">-Christopher Shay</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Christopher Shay: Why should we be so concerned with corporate concentration?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tim Wu:</emphasis> It's at the root of so many problems. In a concentrated industry, you don't have to raise wages, and you find ways to give your shareholders a lot of money. It's a major factor in inequality, but then if you say, \"OK, how are we going to get rid of inequality?\" Maybe raise the minimum wage? Maybe change the tax code? Whatever your answer, you're then faced with the fact that corporate concentration affects politics as well. Concentrated industries lobby better, so all the measures you're interested in run into a wall.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CS: In your book, you talk about the way corporate consolidation can pave the way for fascism. Could you expand on that more?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TW:</emphasis> The failures of economic policy to serve the general public are what have most obviously led to totalitarianism, nationalism, and fascism. Let me try to spell out how I think that happens: In step one, you allow enormous concentration of corporate wealth and power as we did in the late 19th century, and as we have in the early 21st century. This leads to a great divide between rich and poor, much material suffering, the mistreatment of workers, and, in turn, to demands that someone do something. So someone comes to power; takes on enemies foreign and domestic, including big business; and promises bread for the workers, a return to greatness, and, above all, to relieve this economic suffering.</p><p>The story of fascism, however, is one where the strong leader is actually allied with the great monopolists so long as they obey him. The most terrifying prospect is the danger of a political union between private and public power, and we're failing to heed that lesson in this century. Right now we're experimenting with approaches that led in very dark directions in the 20th century.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CS: It's also easy to imagine someone like Trump using trust-busting powers to go after enemies. How do you make sure the trust-busting power of the government isn't wielded in a political way?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TW:</emphasis> That's always a challenge. Any time you call for more government power against industry, it can be misused. In this country you need an independent Justice Department and an independent Federal Trade Commission that sees as its mandate the enforcement of the Sherman Act and the breaking up of monopolies.</p><p>There is the danger that you refer to, but I also wouldn't take it too far. I wouldn't try to divorce politics entirely. If someone runs for office and says, \"I'm going to break up the big monopolies,\" and that person does it, that's called democracy. It's what Woodrow Wilson did, it's what [Theodore] Roosevelt did. They ran saying they would break up the monopolies, and they did it. We can't pretend that's devoid of political content.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CS: Is breaking up these massive companies enough? If you split off Instagram from Facebook, you still have Facebook the social network being used to spread disinformation. How</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">will breaking up these companies engender enough competition to prevent these companies from being a threat to our democracies?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TW:</emphasis> It's probably not enough, but it's a start. Breaking up a couple of companies is not the solution to all social ills. But at the foundation of a lot of our challenges is this lodestone of concentrated corporate power. If you spend any time in DC, you see its effects. It's like a gravitational field-a black hole-that warps everything towards its will.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CS: To what extent do we need to simply apply the trust-busting techniques of the 20th century and to what extent do we need new tools for new companies?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TW:</emphasis> We need both. If we could recover the courage of Woodrow Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Louis Brandeis, that would be a major undertaking. It takes courage to say, \"Listen, we're going to break you into 36 pieces\"-not vaguely insist on some conditions that you're going to ignore. Courage is not a new invention.</p><p>In terms of what we need that's new, I think we need adaptation. One reason the antitrust laws have failed over the last 20 years, particularly in regards to merger control, is that we've failed to understand current business models. Agencies have gotten themselves tied in knots over business models that purport to be free. We have to at least retool or re-understand some of these business models.</p><p>But the baseline thing I stress in this book is political courage-a kind that would make Congress actually stand up for a powerful anti-concentration agenda and fight even when the opponents are strong. We have a tendency in the United States for law enforcement to pick on weak targets. Instead, the full strength of government needs to tame those that are almost as powerful as the government itself. It comes back to this question: What is government for? I believe that it is to serve as a countervailing force to private power. But now, as opposed to countervailing, it has become a co-conspirator.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CS: You talked about Teddy Roosevelt, but in order for him to unleash his trust-busting era, he needed a 5-4 Supreme Court decision in his advantage. If we want to tame private power, what can we do with our current conservative Supreme Court?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TW:</emphasis> The only precedent for this current Supreme Court is the court of the 1920s in terms of its facilitation of an economic libertarian program. But there are a few things future presidents could do. They need to start appointing judges who believe in the antitrust law and are not trapped by the Chicago thinking of the '60s, '70s, and '80s.</p><p>I think even this judiciary will listen to Congress when it speaks clearly, so it's important that Congress re-pass some of the main antitrust laws, and essentially reassert that it meant what it said in the past: That we believe in an anti-monopoly agenda. I think the judiciary would face a crisis if it attempts to nullify laws reaffirming the intent of Congress, which has always been anti-monopoly.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CS: You say one of your goals in this book is to resurrect the tenants of a \"Brandeisian economic vision.\" Could you spell out what you mean by that?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TW:</emphasis> I think Louis Brandeis has been done a disservice. He's remembered as a great [Supreme Court] justice. But forgotten is the fact that his life passion was economic policy and that he had an incredibly compelling vision of the role of the economy and what it means to be a citizen. Brandeis believed that private forces could be as enslaving and encumbering as the government. He was opposed to both oppressive government and oppressive industry. He thought that in order to have a good life that you needed to have a certain amount of freedom from economic and political forces.</p><p>These days when people think about the economy, they mostly think about their own self-enrichment. But Brandeis thought that we needed a structure that was suitable to human development, to becoming the best person you could be. So, he, for example, believed very strongly that people needed stable jobs with ample time off. He put a lot into this idea of citizenship, and we've lost a lot of that. We're very materialist about the economy. We don't think about its spiritual dimensions. We don't really think about what it would mean to structure an economy that makes people happy. Brandeis had a positive economic program for making that happen, and part of it was a powerful de-concentration agenda-a war on the trusts and the monopolies.</p><p>Monopolies were the opposite of what he wanted. They put all the freedom in one man or one woman. He was worried that employees became almost serf-like in their relationship with these great and unaccountable private powers. Now we live in an era where private industry is so much more powerful than any of us individually. Some people work today in conditions that are so horrific and so draining that they really are in a state of serfdom, and somehow we tolerate this. We tolerate this by saying, \"Well, that's the maximization of profit\"-as if that's some kind of constitutional goal. This republic was supposed to be for its citizens, not for these fictional creations that have started to take over. I'm not worried about conquest by robots-we've already been conquered by inhuman creatures.</p><p>The Brandeisian vision points us back toward putting humanity at the center of our concerns. That seems simple, but when you look at how we've deviated from it, it's really quite shocking.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CS: After Brandeis, there was Teddy Roosevelt and the trust-busting movement, and that went on for decades. Why did that change?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TW:</emphasis> Beginning in the late 1970s and gaining its full speed by the 1980s, there arose a contending ideology to the Brandeisian ideology. This ideology is most associated with Robert Bork and the so-called Chicago School of antitrust, and it essentially took monopolists as misunderstood. Instead of oppressive creatures, they were gentle giants. They rarely, if ever, did anything anticompetitive.</p><p>Now, antitrust had never been left-right thing before. Nixon, believe it or not, started the case against AT&amp;T. This movement is obviously popular with big business, and through this relentless pressure, just case by case, antitrust fell. A lot of academic work ate away at the antitrust line until by 2004 the Supreme Court is no longer condemning monopoly. It's celebrating it in its antitrust opinions. [Justice Antonin] Scalia in a case said that it is monopoly that drives business and lures people into taking risks. In that case, Verizon was destroying one of those entrepreneurs who actually took the risk. Brandeisian antitrust has been an enfeebled shadow of its former self and has particularly failed when comes to a big tech.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CS: So Europe has taken the lead in some antitrust-law enforcement. Is that a model we should follow?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TW:</emphasis> What we could learn from Europe is that they have had the courage to bring a lot more cases than the United States. They haven't backed down, but they also haven't had an appetite for breakups, which is the American tradition. Europe has a stronger taste for regulatory approaches, which sometimes can be good. You bring the company to heel, and you impose a series of regulatory regimes. I'm not categorically opposed to that, but the real problem lies in excessive size and concentration, and so I am personally more dedicated to a break-up mentality.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CS: This book and your work is part of this budding progressive movement, a neo-Brandeisian movement. [Republican Senator from Utah] Orrin Hatch called it #HipsterAntiTrust. Where is this movement now, and where do you see it going?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TW:</emphasis> It has taken off in the last couple of years. I think it's an unsurprising response to a four-decade-long experiment, which has failed. You don't need to be a genius to look at the American cable industry and the airlines and say, \"What the hell happened here?\"</p><p>I think the movement has three sides. One is more political: More and more senators and members of the House Representatives think that things have gone too far and want to know what's happened to the antitrust law that they passed. The last time they amended the law in 1950, they gave clear instructions that they wanted this law enforced and that there was a potential problem with excessive concentration in United States. It has a populist side, too. People like Bernie Sanders campaigned on a strong trust-busting mandate, particularly in finance. And there's an academic side, which is asking hard questions about the arguments that have led us to abandon the antitrust laws and whether we, in this technocratic process, abandoned the soul and spirit of what these laws were meant for.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CS: How do you know what companies should be broken up? Would you support the automatic breakup of a company if it reached say 70 percent domination of an industry?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TW:</emphasis> I don't think everything should be fully automatic. There are a number of signs that a monopoly should be broken up. One is a merger pattern. Some companies-and Facebook is an example of this-have managed to build themselves by suppression, by buying up their rivals. I'm of the belief that many of those mergers were illegal to begin with, but the path to undoing this is undoing the company.</p><p>Second, and this is closer to the automatic breakup you refer to, you should have a law that investigates persistent monopolies-ones that have had been there for 20 years and have been resistant to competition and just see whether we'd be better served by a breakup, even if we don't have evidence of long-standing abuse.</p><p>The third category is the old category of the abusive monopolists-the company that destroys everyone in their path. We need to take a hard look at who falls into that category.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CS: Which companies would you prioritize? Who would you go after first?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TW:</emphasis> The industries that are clearly suffering extreme concentration are finance, the airline industry, the cable industry and related media industries, and the pharmaceutical industry. I think those would be the main priorities for almost anyone. And, actually, in the Obama administration, in which I worked, we knew this, but we played around the edges.</p><p>Here's an example where we structurally failed. Everyone is familiar with the fact that over the last 10 years, the pharmaceutical industry has been jacking up its prices in a matter that is unethical, shocking to the conscience, and indefensible. The combined powers of law and consumer protection have done absolutely nothing. A big pharma company will spin off a drug to some smaller company, which only exists to jack the price. I would guess at least 90 percent of Americans would say we should crack down on these practices, but in a supposedly democratic government, no one has been able to do anything.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CS: You don't really go into great depth about it in your book, but you seem skeptical of allowing the government to nationalize large industries.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TW:</emphasis> I don't really get into it in my book, because I wanted to defend one front at a time. But let me be more precise on my position.</p><p>I'm not a believer in nationalization approaches where the government becomes a sole provider in an area, but I'm not against public options. The government provides public education. It provides libraries. It doesn't mean it occupies the field, and no one else can sell a book or offer schooling. I believe that government should get involved in a lot more areas than it does.</p><p>There's a whole new generation of approaches where it's clear that industry has failed and what they actually need is competition from government. Right-leaning libertarians can't get their heads around this-mainly because they assume that industry never fails, for some unknown reason. There are all kinds of industries where the entry of government in a competitive manner would be terrific.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CS: You're a lawyer, you've been involved in politics, why did you choose to write a history book and not focus on some of these more contemporary issues that you've been speaking about?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TW:</emphasis> We have a very powerful and rich tradition in the United States of fighting monopoly. We invented the trusts, and we were the first to decisively dismantle them. And I feel like we've forgotten ourselves. Maybe it's my personality, but I believe the country should self-examine and bring back its best versions of itself. I believe, like Louis Brandeis, that all of life and all of politics is an experiment, and if we don't spend time rigorously examining the results, we'll be much stupider as a society.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CS: Considering our president and our courts, your book isn't without optimism. There is an idealism in the book. Where does that come from?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TW:</emphasis> Maybe it comes from campaigning with Zephyr Teachout.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CS: She just joined our editorial board! </emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TW:</emphasis> Zephyr always said if we're going to convince people to embrace a progressive vision, it can't be depressing. We have to give people something to live for. It's within our grasp as humanity to build something magnificent-to create a society where people live fulfilling lives and have a sense of economic security and political involvement. It's very easy to become dour, but I do strongly believe that we can do better.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NATMAG-297405</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NATMAG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VYJ-BBD1-DXR3-20T6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">465017</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2895\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Nation Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Nation Magazine</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"7718\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 13, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Did you know you can support The Nation by drinking wine?In The Curse of Bigness[3], Columbia law professor Tim Wu argues that if the Gilded Age taught us anything, it's that corporate consolidation leads to inequality, suffering, and, sometimes, fascism. Wu, a former candidate for lieutenant governor of New York, writes that we've reverted to the economic structures of a over century ago 'as if trapped in a bad movie sequel.' Today fewer, larger companies dominate the economy. Since 1997, US public markets have lost more than half of their publicly traded firms, and oligopolies control industries like finance, communications, airlines, and pharmaceuticals. In the United States, the top 1 percent has amassed 38.6 percent of the national wealth. Ad Policy[4] But the era of the great monopolists also offers us the antidote: robust antitrust laws. Wu wants to recover the political courage to go after concentrated private power, and his book draws lessons from the likes of Louis Brandeis and Theodore Roosevelt. To understand the danger we're in, he argues that we must look back at the last period of great inequality and relearn how we made it out. Wu sat down with The Nation's Christopher Shay and discussed the connections between corporate concentration, democracy, and living a fulfilling life. \u2014Christopher ShayRelated Article Christopher Shay: Why should we be so concerned with corporate concentration? Tim Wu: It's at the root of so many problems. In a concentrated industry, you don't have to raise wages, and you find ways to give your shareholders a lot of money. It's a major factor in inequality, but then if you say, 'OK, how are we going to get rid of inequality?' Maybe raise the minimum wage? Maybe change the tax code? Whatever your answer, you're then faced with the fact that corporate concentration affects politics as well. Concentrated industries lobby better, so all the measures you're interested in run into a wall. CS: In your book, you talk about the way corporate consolidation can pave the way for fascism. Could you expand on that more?Current Issue <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenation.com/issue/december-3-10-2018-issue/\">https://www.thenation.com/issue/december-3-10-2018-issue/</url> TW: The failures of economic policy to serve the general public are what have most obviously led to totalitarianism, nationalism, and fascism. Let me try to spell out how I think that happens: In step one, you allow enormous concentration of corporate wealth and power as we did in the late 19th century, and as we have in the early 21st century. This leads to a great divide between rich and poor, much material suffering, the mistreatment of workers, and, in turn, to demands that someone do something. So someone comes to power; takes on enemies foreign and domestic, including big business; and promises bread for the workers, a return to greatness, and, above all, to relieve this economic suffering. The story of fascism, however, is one where the strong leader is actually allied with the great monopolists so long as they obey him. The most terrifying prospect is the danger of a political union between private and public power, and we're failing to heed that lesson in this century. Right now we're experimenting with approaches that led in very dark directions in the 20th century.CS: It's also easy to imagine someone like Trump using trust-busting powers to go after enemies. How do you make sure the trust-busting power of the government isn't wielded in a political way? TW: That's always a challenge. Any time you call for more government power against industry, it can be misused. In this country you need an independent Justice Department and an independent Federal Trade Commission that sees as its mandate the enforcement of the Sherman Act and the breaking up of monopolies. There is the danger that you refer to, but I also wouldn't take it too far. I wouldn't try to divorce politics entirely. If someone runs for office and says, 'I'm going to break up the big monopolies,' and that person does it, that's called democracy. It's what Woodrow Wilson did, it's what [Theodore] Roosevelt did. They ran saying they would break up the monopolies, and they did it. We can't pretend that's devoid of political content. CS: Is breaking up these massive companies enough? If you split off Instagram from Facebook, you still have Facebook the social network being used to spread disinformation. How will breaking up these companies engender enough competition to prevent these companies from being a threat to our democracies?TW: It's probably not enough, but it's a start. Breaking up a couple of companies is not the solution to all social ills. But at the foundation of a lot of our challenges is this lodestone of concentrated corporate power. If you spend any time in DC, you see its effects. It's like a gravitational field\u2014a black hole\u2014that warps everything towards its will. CS: To what extent do we need to simply apply the trust-busting techniques of the 20th century and to what extent do we need new tools for new companies?Related Articles TW: We need both. If we could recover the courage of Woodrow Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Louis Brandeis, that would be a major undertaking. It takes courage to say, 'Listen, we're going to break you into 36 pieces'\u2014not vaguely insist on some conditions that you're going to ignore. Courage is not a new invention. In terms of what we need that's new, I think we need adaptation. One reason the antitrust laws have failed over the last 20 years, particularly in regards to merger control, is that we've failed to understand current business models. Agencies have gotten themselves tied in knots over business models that purport to be free. We have to at least retool or re-understand some of these business models. But the baseline thing I stress in this book is political courage\u2014a kind that would make Congress actually stand up for a powerful anti-concentration agenda and fight even when the opponents are strong. We have a tendency in the United States for law enforcement to pick on weak targets. Instead, the full strength of government needs to tame those that are almost as powerful as the government itself. It comes back to this question: What is government for? I believe that it is to serve as a countervailing force to private power. But now, as opposed to countervailing, it has become a co-conspirator. CS: You talked about Teddy Roosevelt, but in order for him to unleash his trust-busting era, he needed a 5-4 Supreme Court decision in his advantage. If we want to tame private power, what can we do with our current conservative Supreme Court? TW: The only precedent for this current Supreme Court is the court of the 1920s in terms of its facilitation of an economic libertarian program. But there are a few things future presidents could do. They need to start appointing judges who believe in the antitrust law and are not trapped by the Chicago thinking of the '60s, '70s, and '80s. I think even this judiciary will listen to Congress when it speaks clearly, so it's important that Congress re-pass some of the main antitrust laws, and essentially reassert that it meant what it said in the past: That we believe in an anti-monopoly agenda. I think the judiciary would face a crisis if it attempts to nullify laws reaffirming the intent of Congress, which has always been anti-monopoly. CS: You say one of your goals in this book is to resurrect the tenants of a 'Brandeisian economic vision.' Could you spell out what you mean by that? TW: I think Louis Brandeis has been done a disservice. He's remembered as a great [Supreme Court] justice. But forgotten is the fact that his life passion was economic policy and that he had an incredibly compelling vision of the role of the economy and what it means to be a citizen. Brandeis believed that private forces could be as enslaving and encumbering as the government. He was opposed to both oppressive government and oppressive industry. He thought that in order to have a good life that you needed to have a certain amount of freedom from economic and political forces. These days when people think about the economy, they mostly think about their own self-enrichment. But Brandeis thought that we needed a structure that was suitable to human development, to becoming the best person you could be. So, he, for example, believed very strongly that people needed stable jobs with ample time off. He put a lot into this idea of citizenship, and we've lost a lot of that. We're very materialist about the economy. We don't think about its spiritual dimensions. We don't really think about what it would mean to structure an economy that makes people happy. Brandeis had a positive economic program for making that happen, and part of it was a powerful de-concentration agenda\u2014a war on the trusts and the monopolies. Monopolies were the opposite of what he wanted. They put all the freedom in one man or one woman. He was worried that employees became almost serf-like in their relationship with these great and unaccountable private powers. Now we live in an era where private industry is so much more powerful than any of us individually. Some people work today in conditions that are so horrific and so draining that they really are in a state of serfdom, and somehow we tolerate this. We tolerate this by saying, 'Well, that's the maximization of profit'\u2014as if that's some kind of constitutional goal. This republic was supposed to be for its citizens, not for these fictional creations that have started to take over. I'm not worried about conquest by robots\u2014we've already been conquered by inhuman creatures. The Brandeisian vision points us back toward putting humanity at the center of our concerns. That seems simple, but when you look at how we've deviated from it, it's really quite shocking. CS: After Brandeis, there was Teddy Roosevelt and the trust-busting movement, and that went on for decades. Why did that change? TW: Beginning in the late 1970s and gaining its full speed by the 1980s, there arose a contending ideology to the Brandeisian ideology. This ideology is most associated with Robert Bork and the so-called Chicago School of antitrust, and it essentially took monopolists as misunderstood. Instead of oppressive creatures, they were gentle giants. They rarely, if ever, did anything anticompetitive. Now, antitrust had never been left-right thing before. Nixon, believe it or not, started the case against AT...This movement is obviously popular with big business, and through this relentless pressure, just case by case, antitrust fell. A lot of academic work ate away at the antitrust line until by 2004 the Supreme Court is no longer condemning monopoly. It's celebrating it in its antitrust opinions. [Justice Antonin] Scalia in a case said that it is monopoly that drives business and lures people into taking risks. In that case, Verizon was destroying one of those entrepreneurs who actually took the risk. Brandeisian antitrust has been an enfeebled shadow of its former self and has particularly failed when comes to a big tech. CS: So Europe has taken the lead in some antitrust-law enforcement[5]. Is that a model we should follow? TW: What we could learn from Europe is that they have had the courage to bring a lot more cases than the United States. They haven't backed down, but they also haven't had an appetite for breakups, which is the American tradition. Europe has a stronger taste for regulatory approaches, which sometimes can be good. You bring the company to heel, and you impose a series of regulatory regimes. I'm not categorically opposed to that, but the real problem lies in excessive size and concentration, and so I am personally more dedicated to a break-up mentality. CS: This book and your work is part of this budding progressive movement, a neo-Brandeisian movement. [Republican Senator from Utah] Orrin Hatch called it #HipsterAntiTrust[6]. Where is this movement now, and where do you see it going? TW: It has taken off in the last couple of years. I think it's an unsurprising response to a four-decade-long experiment, which has failed. You don't need to be a genius to look at the American cable industry and the airlines and say, 'What the hell happened here?' I think the movement has three sides. One is more political: More and more senators and members of the House Representatives think that things have gone too far and want to know what's happened to the antitrust law that they passed. The last time they amended the law in 1950, they gave clear instructions that they wanted this law enforced and that there was a potential problem with excessive concentration in United States. It has a populist side, too. People like Bernie Sanders campaigned on a strong trust-busting mandate, particularly in finance. And there's an academic side, which is asking hard questions about the arguments that have led us to abandon the antitrust laws and whether we, in this technocratic process, abandoned the soul and spirit of what these laws were meant for. CS: How do you know what companies should be broken up? Would you support the automatic breakup of a company if it reached say 70 percent domination of an industry? TW: I don't think everything should be fully automatic. There are a number of signs that a monopoly should be broken up. One is a merger pattern. Some companies\u2014and Facebook is an example of this\u2014have managed to build themselves by suppression, by buying up their rivals. I'm of the belief that many of those mergers were illegal to begin with, but the path to undoing this is undoing the company. Second, and this is closer to the automatic breakup you refer to, you should have a law that investigates persistent monopolies\u2014ones that have had been there for 20 years and have been resistant to competition and just see whether we'd be better served by a breakup, even if we don't have evidence of long-standing abuse. The third category is the old category of the abusive monopolists\u2014the company that destroys everyone in their path. We need to take a hard look at who falls into that category. CS: Which companies would you prioritize? Who would you go after first? TW: The industries that are clearly suffering extreme concentration are finance, the airline industry, the cable industry and related media industries, and the pharmaceutical industry. I think those would be the main priorities for almost anyone. And, actually, in the Obama administration, in which I worked, we knew this, but we played around the edges. Here's an example where we structurally failed. Everyone is familiar with the fact that over the last 10 years, the pharmaceutical industry has been jacking up its prices in a matter that is unethical, shocking to the conscience, and indefensible. The combined powers of law and consumer protection have done absolutely nothing. A big pharma company will spin off a drug to some smaller company, which only exists to jack the price. I would guess at least 90 percent of Americans would say we should crack down on these practices, but in a supposedly democratic government, no one has been able to do anything. CS: You don't really go into great depth about it in your book, but you seem skeptical of allowing the government to nationalize large industries. TW: I don't really get into it in my book, because I wanted to defend one front at a time. But let me be more precise on my position. I'm not a believer in nationalization approaches where the government becomes a sole provider in an area, but I'm not against public options. The government provides public education. It provides libraries. It doesn't mean it occupies the field, and no one else can sell a book or offer schooling. I believe that government should get involved in a lot more areas than it does. There's a whole new generation of approaches where it's clear that industry has failed and what they actually need is competition from government. Right-leaning libertarians can't get their heads around this\u2014mainly because they assume that industry never fails, for some unknown reason. There are all kinds of industries where the entry of government in a competitive manner would be terrific. CS: You're a lawyer, you've been involved in politics, why did you choose to write a history book and not focus on some of these more contemporary issues that you've been speaking about? TW: We have a very powerful and rich tradition in the United States of fighting monopoly. We invented the trusts, and we were the first to decisively dismantle them. And I feel like we've forgotten ourselves. Maybe it's my personality, but I believe the country should self-examine and bring back its best versions of itself. I believe, like Louis Brandeis, that all of life and all of politics is an experiment, and if we don't spend time rigorously examining the results, we'll be much stupider as a society. CS: Considering our president and our courts, your book isn't without optimism. There is an idealism in the book. Where does that come from? TW: Maybe it comes from campaigning with Zephyr Teachout. CS: She just joined our editorial board[7]! TW: Zephyr always said if we're going to convince people to embrace a progressive vision, it can't be depressing. We have to give people something to live for. It's within our grasp as humanity to build something magnificent\u2014to create a society where people live fulfilling lives and have a sense of economic security and political involvement. It's very easy to become dour, but I do strongly believe that we can do better.

One, the majority of the politicians pearl clutching over the teen dancing app have been utterly absent from other privacy and security debates (say like U.S. network security flaws[1] or the abuse of location data[2]). In fact, many of them have actively undermined efforts to shore up U.S. privacy and security, whether we're talking about the outright refusal to fund election security improvements[3], or repeated opposition[4] to even the most basic of privacy laws for the modern era. Most are simply engaged in performative, xenophobic politics and couldn't care less about U.S. privacy and security. Two, banning TikTok doesn't actually accomplish much of anything. </p><p>It doesn't really really thwart Chinese intelligence[5], which could just as easily buy this data from an absolute ocean of barely regulated international adtech middlemen[6], obtain it from any one of a million hacked datasets available on the dark net, or steal it from the, you know, millions upon millions of \"smart\" and IOT devices we attach to our home and business networks with no security and reckless abandon[7]. In full context of the U.S., where privacy and security standards are hot garbage, the idea that banning a Chinese teen dancing app does all that much is just silly. That said, I remain surprised by the big names in tech policy who continue to believe the Trump administration's sloppy and bizarre[8] TikTok ban accomplishes much of anything. Case in point: Columbia law professor Tim Wu, whose pioneering work on net neutrality and open platforms I greatly admire, penned a new piece for the New York Times[9] arguing that a \"ban on Tiktok is overdue.\" Effectively, Wu argues that because China routinely bans U.S. services via its great firewall, turnabout is fair play:\"For many years, laboring under the vain expectation that China, succumbing to inexorable world-historical forces, would become more like us, Western democracies have allowed China to exploit this situation. We have accepted, with only muted complaints, Chinese censorship and blocking of content from abroad while allowing Chinese companies to explore and exploit whatever markets it likes. Few foreign companies are allowed to reach Chinese citizens with ideas or services, but the world is fully open to China's online companies.\"Wu proceeds to insist that refusing to behave like China and ban their products in retaliation is somehow a sucker's bet:\"Some think that it is a tragic mistake for the United States to violate the principles of internet openness that were pioneered in this country. But there is also such a thing as being a sucker. If China refuses to follow the rules of the open internet, why continue to give it access to internet markets around the world?\"This being 2020, I suppose I'm not surprised to see the guy who invented the idea of net neutrality advocate that the United States begin behaving more like one of the most repressive countries on the planet in regards to technological openness. My problem, again, is that Wu's piece lacks any mention of what this singular ban of a teen dancing app actually accomplishes. So we ban TikTok, then what? Do we ban every single Chinese-made \"smart\" television in the country (TCL has a 16.5% market share)? Every single IOT device? Every crappy Chinese-made router? All global adtech? Because they're all technically threats. Many TikTok hyperventilators would immediately say, \"yes!\" We're to ignore that America currently can't even help its citizens obtain food and shelter during a health crisis, much less properly implement a ban on all domestic Chinese hardware, software, adtech, apps, and services (something you'd need to do to follow this logic to its ultimate conclusion). But TikTok isn't operating in a vacuum. Context matters. And in full context, American security and privacy standards are a dumpster fire, and TikTok is among the very least of our worries. If we genuinely wanted to protect U.S. consumer data from bad actors, we'd be funding a major expansion in election security reform. We'd stop kneecapping and under-funding our privacy regulators[10]. We'd pass a basic privacy law for the internet era. We'd hold adtech, telecom, and \"big tech\" companies genuinely accountable for violating consumer trust. We'd shore up the integrity of our communications networks[11]. We'd help develop and implement security standards for IOT devices[12]. We'd build a coherent framework of policy that protects consumers and businesses from all threats, not just Chinese apps. To be abundantly clear we aren't doing this. Instead, we've spent the last month freaking out over a teen dancing app (when we weren't busy trying to ruin encryption[13]). Despite the growing list of big policy names that somehow think this proposal makes sense, I still don't see the point.

Among other policy proposals, Wu recommends a \"simple but per se ban on mergers that reduce the number of major firms to less than four.\" He also proposes that regulators use breakups rather than consent decrees because they are \"self-executing\" and \"a much cleaner way of dealing with competition problems.\"<br/>In his narrative history of American antitrust law, Wu's hero is Louis Brandeis, who served on the Supreme Court from 1916 to 1939 and coined the phrase \"curse of bigness\" to refer to the societal problems he saw as engendered by Gilded Age monopolies. Bork is the villain of the story, having spearheaded the Chicago School's role in narrowing antitrust regulation to economic concerns and establishing consumer welfare as its lodestar.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Small Business Myth</emphasis><br/>While it is understandable that Brandeis suspected there was a curse of bigness in the economy given the paucity of data available at the time, the same cannot be said in Wu's case. In their book published earlier this year, Big Is Beautiful, Robert D. Atkinson and Michael Lind show that large firms pay their employees more than small firms, give their employees better benefits, create more jobs on a net basis, and employ a more diverse workforce. Big business is more likely to be unionized than small business, and workers in large firms are less likely to be laid off or injured on the job. Large companies are also an engine of productivity growth, investing more in both research and development and in employee training.<br/>Source: Jacobin<br/>Source: Jacobin<br/>Citing much of the same evidence, socialist writer Matt Bruenig has tried to persuade the left that small businesses are overrated, noting that \"In reality, small-business promotion is mostly a bad idea. Small businesses pay lower wages, provide worse benefits, are often exempt from important worker protections, and are incompatible with the way unionization works in the U.S.\" Rejecting the myth of small business is thus neither a left- nor a right-wing conspiracy, as in Wu's cynical narrative of the Chicago School. Rather, recognizing the value of bigness is possible whether your primary concern is for the well-being of workers or economic productivity overall.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Conflating Natural Monopolies and De Jute Monopolies</emphasis><br/>But maybe bigness tips from a positive to a negative when a single firm takes over a whole market. Monopolization enables companies to raise prices and lower output for the sake of maximizing profits. However, if we are to vanquish the evils of monopoly, we must distinguish between its sources. Natural monopolies, which exist due to high fixed costs or economies of scale, differ from government-granted monopolies, and the two require distinct policy responses. Here again, Wu's analysis falls short. <br/>In the most infamous case of abusing market power in recent memory, Martin Shkreli, now in prison for securities fraud, raised the price of an infectious-disease drug from $13.50 to $750 overnight. In his retelling, Wu fails to mention that Shkreli was only able to profitably jack up the price of this lifesaving drug because of a regulatory backlog at the FDA. Daraprim, the drug in question, was no longer under patent, but no other producer was approved to sell the generic, and the approval process is notoriously long in the United States. <br/>Similarly, whenever discussing Big Pharma or hospital monopolies, Wu erroneously characterizes them as the consequence of derelict antitrust regulators lacking sufficient will to enforce the laws on the books. Yet in many of these cases, the lack of competition is a result of poorly-designed patent laws and exclusionary regulations, from certificate-of-need laws to occupational licensing. As my colleague Will Wilkinson put it, \"There are companies that do nothing but hoard pre-existing tech patents and then sue everyone who comes within a country mile of infringing on one of them ... Just buy up little state-sanctioned monopolies, then make a mint destroying rather than creating economic value.\" This is monopoly at its worst, yet Wu's framework provides little help in understanding it.<br/>The inability to distinguish between natural and government-granted monopoly is most glaring when Wu says the \"original Boston Tea Party was, after all, really an anti-monopoly protest.\" Yes, but it was a protest against government-granted monopoly. The British government had passed the Tea Act of 1773 to reinforce the East India Company's monopoly on the sale of tea in the colonies. If private power had been the real concern of the protest, maybe the colonists would have revolted against the East India Company instead of King George III.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Simple Industry Concentration Ratios Can Be Misleading</emphasis><br/>\"In a run that lasted some two decades, American industry reached levels of industry concentration arguably unseen since the original Trust era. A full 75 percent of industries witnessed increased concentration from the years 1997 to 2012,\" Wu explains. He goes on to use increasing market shares by companies ranging from AT&amp;T to Bayer to Ticketmaster to sound the antitrust alarm.<br/>But market share statistics, which are used to define a monopoly in structural analysis, often obscure more than they reveal about the state of competition in an industry. To deal with this problem, antitrust economists have developed more advanced analytical tools for studying market power, such as diversion ratios, the Gross Upward Pricing Pressure Index (GUPPI) test, and merger simulations. A deeper look at the beer, airline, and book retailing sectors shows how relying solely on the structural framework leaves much to be desired. <br/>Mergers in the airline industry have left us with only three traditional major airlines. That must lead to monopoly profits, right? In fact, as the Priceonomics blog notes, \"six major airlines went through bankruptcy in the 2000s, and from 1979 to 2014, airlines lost $35 billion.\" One recent paper in the American Economic Review was simply titled \"Why Can't US Airlines Make Money?\" Airfares are also down by about a third over the same period. It is hard to conclude that allowing mergers in a persistently unprofitable industry with falling prices and rising output is really what ails our society.<br/>Source: Priceonomics<br/>Source: Quartz<br/>The book also notes ominously that after recent mergers and acquisitions in the beer industry, \"Anheuser-Busch InBev and MillerCoors control over 70 percent of beer sales.\" But there are more than 6,000 breweries in the United States, a 150-year high. Is this really a market that lacks choice or is difficult to enter? Of all of its markets, Amazon is most dominant in books, which is no surprise considering it was the product category that launched the company. So did Amazon kill the independent bookstore? Not quite. The number of indie bookstores is up by about 35 percent in the last decade.<br/>Source: Brewers Association<br/>Source: Quartz<br/>The trickiest part of market definition in antitrust analysis is determining the boundaries of the market. Which products are inside or outside of the market? In modern antitrust analysis, this question is important but not essential, as there are many other factors for determining competitive effects. In the old, structural approach, which relies on bright-line presumptions based on market shares, market definition is pivotal. Consider Amazon, which has 49 percent of the U.S. e-commerce market but only 5 percent of the U.S. retail market. Which one is the appropriate market for structural analysis? Or take Google and Facebook. In the U.S., together they control 57 percent of the digital advertising market but only 25 percent of the total advertising market. Which one is the appropriate market for structural analysis?<br/>The second-to-last chapter of Wu's book is titled \"The Rise of the Tech Trusts,\" and the extra attention these companies receive is understandable given their prominence in the economy. But before we break up Big Tech, there are other important facts about the tech industry to consider. The top five companies that spent the most on research and development last year were all tech companies. Combined spending on R&amp;D and capital expenditures at technology companies is increasing as a percent of revenue over time. The Big Five - Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft - may be dominant, but they also compete against each other in a wide range of product categories. Big tech companies simply are not acting like the complacent monopolies Wu portrays.<br/>Source: Recode<br/>Source: KPCB<br/>Most importantly, policymakers should be cognizant of the cyclical nature of the tech industry. AT&amp;T was dominant in telephone service; IBM in mainframe computing; Microsoft in desktop; AOL and Yahoo in Web 1.0; Google and Facebook in mobile. As Benedict Evans shows, each cycle in tech allows a few dominant companies to build a moat and create quasi-monopolies. No competitor ever does cross the moat - the castle just becomes irrelevant when the next cycle begins.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Economics Is Not a Morality Play</emphasis><br/>Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman once wrote: \"Economics is not a morality play. It's not a happy story in which virtue is rewarded and vice punished. The market economy is a system for organizing activity ... with no special moral significance. The rich don't necessarily deserve their wealth, and the poor certainly don't deserve their poverty.\"<br/>In the early chapters, Wu makes a strained connection between the Social Darwinists and the Gilded Age monopolists, claiming they were motivated by the same eugenicist ideology as applied to society and business. The problem with inferring moral motives behind economic decisions is that they don't neatly map onto the good and bad teams. Teddy Roosevelt, the trustbuster himself, was also a eugenicist, an inconvenient fact left out by Wu. <br/>In a letter to Charles Davenport, one of the leaders of the American eugenics movement, Roosevelt wrote that \"society has no business to permit degenerates to reproduce their kind ... \u00a0Any group of farmers who permitted their best stock not to breed, and let all the increase come from the worst stock, would be treated as fit inmates for an asylum ... we have no business to permit the perpetuation of citizens of the wrong type.\"<br/>Wu's book does a serviceable job relating the history of American antitrust law, but one wonders whether we should follow antitrust policy recommendations from an author who makes claims about economic concentration leading to the rise of Nazism based on sources that don't withstand the most basic scrutiny.<br/>Wu makes errors and omits facts when they serve his narrative, substituting rigor for a simple story of good versus evil. The book is particularly ungenerous in its description of Peter Thiel's short essay, \"Competition Is for Losers,\" which argues that entrepreneurs should pursue businesses or product lines that are hard to substitute - a call for startup founders to resist being copycats that gets translated by Wu, through omitted context, into a kind of \"monopoly worship.\"<br/>In sum, Professor Wu fetishizes \"smallness\" despite the evidence showing that most things progressives and free-marketers alike value increase with firm size. He conflates natural and de jure monopolies, underrating the role that regulations and patent law play in establishing and sustaining monopoly power. He advocates returning to a structural approach in antitrust enforcement despite it being abandoned by empirical researchers decades ago because \"market structure and competitive effects are not systematically correlated\" except in special circumstances. And lastly, in an attempt at narrative, Wu constructs a morality play in which he lobs ad hominem attacks at monopolists for their ethical shortcomings and abhorrent political viewpoints, when many of the same viewpoints were held by the trustbusters he otherwise praises.<br/>It is easy to demonize and scapegoat big business, particularly tech companies. At a time when the president of the United States views many of those same companies as his political enemies - and is groping around for any tool to punish them - it is disappointing that one of our leading policy thinkers wants to hand him the biggest club of all.<br/>The post Tim Wu's Morality Play: A Review of \"The Curse of Bigness\" appeared first on Niskanen Center.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-45490</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WC8-PRM1-F03R-W0HJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2156\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 Niskanen, USA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Niskanen Center</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 12, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Uncategorized</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Tina, great to have you with us, I mean you've long said that social media, digital disruption of elections is a confluence of factors really that there are increasing risks right now. You can tie into that data protection in this case which is another issue. What are your thoughts at this stage?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORDHAM</emphasis>:  Well, my main reaction as a macro analyst is that the problem of low trust institutions, which is very much related to this much popular risk (ph) kind of idea, is only going to get worse with developments like this. Then it will be the next frontier in political science, and in opinion polling, to try to understand and quantify what the impact of these ads might be because on the one hand, you know, Facebook tells us that you should buy their ads because they're very effective.  </p><p>      And on the other hand, we hear that it's impossible to say if there was any impact from these ads in the political space. But, you know, in my world, anticipating election results, it's going to be more difficult. And then at the, you know, the biggest take away I think is, will people believe that any elections are won fairly?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>:  How corporate flow like Facebook, like Twitter, whatever it is, whatever company it is that we're giving our data to, were they held to a lower standard because they offer some utility benefit, and in many cases we're probably quite addicted to them, so we can't hold them to the same standard this institution.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORDHAM</emphasis>:  What is our alternative as consumers?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORDHAM</emphasis>:  Right, I saw some people on Twitter saying, they were deleting Facebook accounts. But what are they going to do instead and will they migrate back.  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISENTHAL</emphasis>:  That's a pretty strong statement that we may just never have election again where people are totally confident that the election was won fair and square.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORDHAM</emphasis>:  And that is probably a casualty of this low trust phenomenon. I mean it's remarkable when you look at citizens in advanced economies and compare it to emerging markets when they talk about, you know, corruption and in politics and in business. People in advanced economies are almost as mistrustful as in developing markets. That's new, by the way.  </p><p>      Our trust has declined steadily. There's probably some correlation there, same with economic growth. But yes, I mean for democracy, loser has to accept the results. That's the only condition of having a democracy.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>:  And peaceful transition of power as well. As trust deteriorates in public institutions, we're seeing a lot more people in favor of strongmen, authoritarian rulers. Strongmen are definitely back in favor of these days. What kind of confrontation do you foresee between big tech especially the companies like Facebook, like Google, like Amazon, with these authoritarian leaders?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORDHAM</emphasis>:  Well, I mean, so far they've tried to toe a pretty careful line. You know, I'm originally from the Silicon Valley. And it took the Silicon Valley a long time to get interested in Washington and policy.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORDHAM</emphasis>:  And I think the next stage of global leaders and how to engage there is going to be challenging as well. This is, you know, this is really another frontier in international relations than global business.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>:  But there's a connection there for many of these people. I mean the president himself, President Trump he actually harnesses social media for his own purpose. So when you're talking about greater regulation, where do those two things meet?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORDHAM</emphasis>:  Well, I mean going on a slightly different point, I've been thinking about Brexit and the campaign for leave, which was, you know, which was roundly criticized for, you know, numbers that didn't exist and everything else. There's no accountability. If you are a company and you engage in false advertising, there's a penalty for that. We don't have that in politics and in campaigning.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISENTHAL</emphasis>:  Would you expect to see at some point seriously harsh regulations? I mean the regulations discussed right now is seem to mostly be kind of on the margins, things like disclosure of who's buying ads and tighter regulations about who can buy them and where the money is coming from. But at some point would you expect governments to feel that gigantic social networking or tech companies are truly encroaching on their sovereignty and that something draconian must be done?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORDHAM</emphasis>:  I don't -- I actually don't see that on the horizon at this point. And furthermore, you don't see a public outcry suggesting for example that Trump won fraudulently, if you see what I mean. We look at the comments from Cambridge Analytica, and they're micro-targeting, which by the way President Obama and his campaign was applauded for applying these with the new --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISENTHAL</emphasis>:  Do you think --  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORDHAM</emphasis>:  I'll leave to one side. If things work, it's difficult to imagine them being withdrawn. It's the privacy and the data protection element that I think is probably most significant.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>:  Yes. So put this all together. How does this affect how people vote, how people approach for the midterm elections?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORDHAM</emphasis>:  I think there's a real cognitive dissonance at this point. You just don't see people connecting these headlines with outcomes just yet, anyway. I saw a super wonky statement from an academic research institute, because think tanks remember have also been kind of roped in under this idea of, you know, performing tailored work for the benefit of governments and also for companies.  </p><p>      And, you know, the idea is the -- is there such a thing as independent research? Well, like a free press which argued that it's extremely important to have independent research and standards but this is really in the wonky world, I'm afraid.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>:  When does the penny drop? When do people something to go, actually are we being -- do you tear and are we being led? And I mean --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORDHAM</emphasis>:  I think it takes a lot for people to think that. And most people think that they are making their decisions based on information that they have collected from, you know --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>:  They need accurately gathered.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORDHAM</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>:  But we've been talking about --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORDHAM</emphasis>:  They would say other people live in a bubble, but not there.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>:  Yes. I'm --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISENTHAL</emphasis>:  In my case, yes.  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>:  So we're talking this as far as Wisconsin is concerned that actually people's lack of trust in institutions will making them vote for things that were counterintuitive not having more Medicaid coverage, we're voting against that. Not seeing greater spending on infrastructure, on roads, on education, they were voting because they didn't trust the institutions to put the money to work in the way they were saying they would.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORDHAM</emphasis>:  And this is a very insidious phenomenon.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHATTERLEY</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORDHAM</emphasis>:  And we actually haven't been here. But in emerging markets, you know, low trust in Brazil has been a factor for a very long time, finally culminating in Dilma (ph) and the other scandals, (INAUDIBLE), et cetera.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEISENTHAL</emphasis>:  Real quickly from a political science perspective, is there anyway Trump avoids the midterm curse of having his party getting demolished or is that just sort of won this iron loose of politics that that will happen.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORDHAM</emphasis>:  I think the map for a true wave election looks challenging. But, you know, but we have to remember that wave elections in midterms happen all the time. And remember, after the first Obama term or the Obama victory in '08, you know, commentator said, Republicans out of power for a generation, and low and behold.

Tina, great to have you with us, I mean you've long said that social media, digital disruption of elections is a confluence of factors really that there are increasing risks right now. You can tie into that data protection in this case which is another issue. What are your thoughts at this stage?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TINA FORDHAM, CHIEF GLOBAL POLITICAL ANALYST, CITIGROUP: Well, my main reaction as a macro analyst is that the problem of low trust institutions, which is very much related to this much popular risk (ph) kind of idea, is only going to get worse with developments like this. Then it will be the next frontier in political science, and in opinion polling, to try to understand and quantify what the impact of these ads might be because on the one hand, you know, Facebook tells us that you should buy their ads because they're very effective.</p><p>And on the other hand, we hear that it's impossible to say if there was any impact from these ads in the political space. But, you know, in my world, anticipating election results, it's going to be more difficult. And then at the, you know, the biggest take away I think is, will people believe that any elections are won fairly?</p><p>CHATTERLEY: How corporate flow like Facebook, like Twitter, whatever it is, whatever company it is that we're giving our data to, were they held to a lower standard because they offer some utility benefit, and in many cases we're probably quite addicted to them, so we can't hold them to the same standard this institution.</p><p>FORDHAM: What is our alternative as consumers?</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>FORDHAM: Right, I saw some people on Twitter saying, they were deleting Facebook accounts. But what are they going to do instead and will they migrate back.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>JOE WEISENTHAL, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: That's a pretty strong statement that we may just never have election again where people are totally confident that the election was won fair and square.</p><p>FORDHAM: And that is probably a casualty of this low trust phenomenon. I mean it's remarkable when you look at citizens in advanced economies and compare it to emerging markets when they talk about, you know, corruption and in politics and in business. People in advanced economies are almost as mistrustful as in developing markets. That's new, by the way.</p><p>Our trust has declined steadily. There's probably some correlation there, same with economic growth. But yes, I mean for democracy, loser has to accept the results. That's the only condition of having a democracy.</p><p>SCARLET FU, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: And peaceful transition of power as well. As trust deteriorates in public institutions, we're seeing a lot more people in favor of strongmen, authoritarian rulers. Strongmen are definitely back in favor of these days. What kind of confrontation do you foresee between big tech especially the companies like Facebook, like Google, like Amazon, with these authoritarian leaders?</p><p>FORDHAM: Well, I mean, so far they've tried to toe a pretty careful line. You know, I'm originally from the Silicon Valley. And it took the Silicon Valley a long time to get interested in Washington and policy.</p><p>FU: Yes.</p><p>FORDHAM: And I think the next stage of global leaders and how to engage there is going to be challenging as well. This is, you know, this is really another frontier in international relations than global business.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: But there's a connection there for many of these people. I mean the president himself, President Trump he actually harnesses social media for his own purpose. So when you're talking about greater regulation, where do those two things meet?</p><p>FORDHAM: Well, I mean going on a slightly different point, I've been thinking about Brexit and the campaign for leave, which was, you know, which was roundly criticized for, you know, numbers that didn't exist and everything else. There's no accountability. If you are a company and you engage in false advertising, there's a penalty for that. We don't have that in politics and in campaigning.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Would you expect to see at some point seriously harsh regulations? I mean the regulations discussed right now is seem to mostly be kind of on the margins, things like disclosure of who's buying ads and tighter regulations about who can buy them and where the money is coming from. But at some point would you expect governments to feel that gigantic social networking or tech companies are truly encroaching on their sovereignty and that something draconian must be done?</p><p>FORDHAM: I don't -- I actually don't see that on the horizon at this point. And furthermore, you don't see a public outcry suggesting for example that Trump won fraudulently, if you see what I mean. We look at the comments from Cambridge Analytica, and they're micro-targeting, which by the way President Obama and his campaign was applauded for applying these with the new --</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Do you think --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORDHAM: I'll leave to one side. If things work, it's difficult to imagine them being withdrawn. It's the privacy and the data protection element that I think is probably most significant.</p><p>FU: Yes. So put this all together. How does this affect how people vote, how people approach for the midterm elections?</p><p>FORDHAM: I think there's a real cognitive dissonance at this point. You just don't see people connecting these headlines with outcomes just yet, anyway. I saw a super wonky statement from an academic research institute, because think tanks remember have also been kind of roped in under this idea of, you know, performing tailored work for the benefit of governments and also for companies.</p><p>And, you know, the idea is the -- is there such a thing as independent research? Well, like a free press which argued that it's extremely important to have independent research and standards but this is really in the wonky world, I'm afraid.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: When does the penny drop? When do people something to go, actually are we being -- do you tear and are we being led? And I mean --</p><p>FORDHAM: I think it takes a lot for people to think that. And most people think that they are making their decisions based on information that they have collected from, you know --</p><p>CHATTERLEY: They need accurately gathered.</p><p>FORDHAM: Yes.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: But we've been talking about --</p><p>FORDHAM: They would say other people live in a bubble, but not there.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. I'm --</p><p>WEISENTHAL: In my case, yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So we're talking this as far as Wisconsin is concerned that actually people's lack of trust in institutions will making them vote for things that were counterintuitive not having more Medicaid coverage, we're voting against that. Not seeing greater spending on infrastructure, on roads, on education, they were voting because they didn't trust the institutions to put the money to work in the way they were saying they would.</p><p>FORDHAM: And this is a very insidious phenomenon.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>FORDHAM: And we actually haven't been here. But in emerging markets, you know, low trust in Brazil has been a factor for a very long time, finally culminating in Dilma (ph) and the other scandals, (INAUDIBLE), et cetera.</p><p>WEISENTHAL: Real quickly from a political science perspective, is there anyway Trump avoids the midterm curse of having his party getting demolished or is that just sort of won this iron loose of politics that that will happen.</p><p>FORDHAM: I think the map for a true wave election looks challenging. But, you know, but we have to remember that wave elections in midterms happen all the time. And remember, after the first Obama term or the Obama victory in '08, you know, commentator said, Republicans out of power for a generation, and low and behold. And in the midterms two years later, they wiped the floor with Democrats.</p><p>No responsible pollster is picking a, you know, a strong view at this point on the midterms. But I have to think that the Republican establishment is pretty worried about that migration of middle-class white suburban college- educated voters that we've seen here and there.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>FU: And especially since what we saw a right outside Pittsburgh.</p><p>FORDHAM: Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FU: Tina Fordham, Citigroup managing director and chief global political analyst thank you so much.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Tina,  great to have you with us, I mean you've long said that social media,  digital disruption of elections is a confluence of factors really that  there are increasing risks right now.  You can tie into that data  protection in this case which is another issue.  What are your thoughts at  this stage?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TINA FORDHAM, CHIEF GLOBAL POLITICAL ANALYST, CITIGROUP:  Well, my main  reaction as a macro analyst is that the problem of low trust institutions,  which is very much related to this much popular risk (ph) kind of idea, is  only going to get worse with developments like this.  Then it will be the  next frontier in political science, and in opinion polling, to try to  understand and quantify what the impact of these ads might be because on  the one hand, you know, Facebook tells us that you should buy their ads  because they're very effective.</p><p>And on the other hand, we hear that it's impossible to say if there was any  impact from these ads in the political space.  But, you know, in my world,  anticipating election results, it's going to be more difficult.  And then  at the, you know, the biggest take away I think is, will people believe  that any elections are won fairly?</p><p>CHATTERLEY:  How corporate flow like Facebook, like Twitter, whatever it  is, whatever company it is that we're giving our data to, were they held to  a lower standard because they offer some utility benefit, and in many cases  we're probably quite addicted to them, so we can't hold them to the same  standard this institution.</p><p>FORDHAM:  What is our alternative as consumers?</p><p>CHATTERLEY:  Yes.</p><p>FORDHAM:  Right, I saw some people on Twitter saying, they were deleting  Facebook accounts.  But what are they going to do instead and will they  migrate back.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>JOE WEISENTHAL, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  That's a pretty strong statement that we  may just never have election again where people are totally confident that  the election was won fair and square.</p><p>FORDHAM:  And that is probably a casualty of this low trust phenomenon.  I  mean it's remarkable when you look at citizens in advanced economies and  compare it to emerging markets when they talk about, you know, corruption  and in politics and in business.  People in advanced economies are almost  as mistrustful as in developing markets.  That's new, by the way.</p><p>Our trust has declined steadily.  There's probably some correlation there,  same with economic growth.  But yes, I mean for democracy, loser has to  accept the results.  That's the only condition of having a democracy.</p><p>SCARLET FU, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  And peaceful transition of power as well.   As trust deteriorates in public institutions, we're seeing a lot more  people in favor of strongmen, authoritarian rulers.  Strongmen are  definitely back in favor of these days.  What kind of confrontation do you  foresee between big tech especially the companies like Facebook, like  Google, like Amazon, with these authoritarian leaders?</p><p>FORDHAM:  Well, I mean, so far they've tried to toe a pretty careful line.   You know, I'm originally from the Silicon Valley.  And it took the Silicon  Valley a long time to get interested in Washington and policy.</p><p>FU:  Yes.</p><p>FORDHAM:  And I think the next stage of global leaders and how to engage  there is going to be challenging as well.  This is, you know, this is  really another frontier in international relations than global business.</p><p>CHATTERLEY:  But there's a connection there for many of these people.  I  mean the president himself, President Trump he actually harnesses social  media for his own purpose.  So when you're talking about greater  regulation, where do those two things meet?</p><p>FORDHAM:  Well, I mean going on a slightly different point, I've been  thinking about Brexit and the campaign for leave, which was, you know,  which was roundly criticized for, you know, numbers that didn't exist and  everything else.  There's no accountability.  If you are a company and you  engage in false advertising, there's a penalty for that.  We don't have  that in politics and in campaigning.</p><p>WEISENTHAL:  Would you expect to see at some point seriously harsh  regulations?  I mean the regulations discussed right now is seem to mostly  be kind of on the margins, things like disclosure of who's buying ads and  tighter regulations about who can buy them and where the money is coming  from.  But at some point would you expect governments to feel that gigantic  social networking or tech companies are truly encroaching on their  sovereignty and that something draconian must be done?</p><p>FORDHAM:  I don't -- I actually don't see that on the horizon at this  point.  And furthermore, you don't see a public outcry suggesting for  example that Trump won fraudulently, if you see what I mean.  We look at  the comments from Cambridge Analytica, and they're micro-targeting, which  by the way President Obama and his campaign was applauded for applying  these with the new --</p><p>WEISENTHAL:  Do you think --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORDHAM:  I'll leave to one side.  If things work, it's difficult to  imagine them being withdrawn.  It's the privacy and the data protection  element that I think is probably most significant.</p><p>FU:  Yes.  So put this all together.  How does this affect how people vote,  how people approach for the midterm elections?</p><p>FORDHAM:  I think there's a real cognitive dissonance at this point.  You  just don't see people connecting these headlines with outcomes just yet,  anyway.  I saw a super wonky statement from an academic research institute,  because think tanks remember have also been kind of roped in under this  idea of, you know, performing tailored work for the benefit of governments  and also for companies.</p><p>And, you know, the idea is the -- is there such a thing as independent  research?  Well, like a free press which argued that it's extremely  important to have independent research and standards but this is really in  the wonky world, I'm afraid.</p><p>CHATTERLEY:  When does the penny drop?  When do people something to go,  actually are we being -- do you tear and are we being led?  And I mean --</p><p>FORDHAM:  I think it takes a lot for people to think that.  And most people  think that they are making their decisions based on information that they  have collected from, you know --</p><p>CHATTERLEY:  They need accurately gathered.</p><p>FORDHAM:  Yes.</p><p>CHATTERLEY:  But we've been talking about --</p><p>FORDHAM:  They would say other people live in a bubble, but not there.</p><p>CHATTERLEY:  Yes.  I'm --</p><p>WEISENTHAL:  In my case, yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHATTERLEY:  So we're talking this as far as Wisconsin is concerned that  actually people's lack of trust in institutions will making them vote for  things that were counterintuitive not having more Medicaid coverage, we're  voting against that.  Not seeing greater spending on infrastructure, on  roads, on education, they were voting because they didn't trust the  institutions to put the money to work in the way they were saying they  would.</p><p>FORDHAM:  And this is a very insidious phenomenon.</p><p>CHATTERLEY:  Yes.</p><p>FORDHAM:  And we actually haven't been here.  But in emerging markets, you  know, low trust in Brazil has been a factor for a very long time, finally  culminating in Dilma (ph) and the other scandals, (INAUDIBLE), et cetera.</p><p>WEISENTHAL:  Real quickly from a political science perspective, is there  anyway Trump avoids the midterm curse of having his party getting  demolished or is that just sort of won this iron loose of politics that  that will happen.</p><p>FORDHAM:  I think the map for a true wave election looks challenging.  But,  you know, but we have to remember that wave elections in midterms happen  all the time.  And remember, after the first Obama term or the Obama  victory in '08, you know, commentator said, Republicans out of power for a  generation, and low and behold.  And in the midterms two years later, they  wiped the floor with Democrats.</p><p>No responsible pollster is picking a, you know, a strong view at this point  on the midterms.  But I have to think that the Republican establishment is  pretty worried about that migration of middle-class white suburban college- educated voters that we've seen here and there.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHATTERLEY:  Yes.</p><p>FU:  And especially since what we saw a right outside Pittsburgh.</p><p>FORDHAM:  Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FU:  Tina Fordham, Citigroup managing director and chief global political  analyst thank you so much.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Then it will be the  next frontier in political science, and in opinion polling, to try to  understand and quantify what the impact of these ads might be because on  the one hand, you know, Facebook tells us that you should buy their ads  because they're very effective.</p><p> And on the other hand, we hear that it's impossible to say if there was any  impact from these ads in the political space.

In a press release issued yesterday, the Chairman of the subcommittee, Raja Krishnamoorthi, sent letters to Match Group, Inc \u2014 the parent company of major dating apps \u2014 seeking information related to recent reports that numerous dating apps have failed to effectively screen out underage users, #8216;which creates dangerous and inappropriate situations.#8217; Dating services will have to hand over information on the age of its users, the procedure it takes to verify ages, and any complaints raised by users regarding assault, rape, or use by minors. [Read: Report: Tinder's new panic button is sharing your data with Facebook and YouTube[1]] #8216;Our concern about the underage use of dating apps is heightened by reports that many popular free dating apps permit registered sex offenders to use them, while the paid versions of these same apps screen out registered sex offenders,#8217; Krishnamoorthi wrote. </p><p>#8216;Protection from sexual predators should not be a luxury confined to paying customers.#8217; The report Krishnamoorthi is referring to is an investigation[2] by ProPublica, BuzzFeed, and Columbia Journalism Investigations last year. They found that more than 150 instances of sexual assault involving dating apps, and approximately 10 percent involved users being matched with dates who had previously been accused or convicted of sexual assault. At the time of the report, a Match Group spokesperson called the report #8216;disingenuous#8217; and #8216;inaccurate,#8217; though declined to comment on any specific facts reported in the story. However, the statement did say that Match Group didn't collect enough data on its free users to conduct meaningful background checks. #8216;As technology evolves, we will continue to aggressively deploy new tools to eradicate bad actors, including users of our free products like Tinder, Plenty of Fish, and OkCupid where we are not able to obtain sufficient and reliable information to make meaningful background checks possible.#8217; In a statement to Time[3], the Match Group said the US national sex offender registry needs to be updated so perpetrators' digital footprints can be tracked and blocked by social media and dating services. As well as sharing information on its users' ages, the investigated dating apps have been asked to share its privacy policies along with its terms and conditions and how the company handles collected user data including sexual orientation and political views, among others. This isn't the only controversy facing dating apps at the moment. Earlier this week, a report by Gizmodo found that Tinder's new #8216;Panic Button#8217; is sharing users' data with ad-tech companies[4] including Facebook and YouTube. Currently, the investigated dating apps have not immediately responded to the subcommittee requests, but it's yet another reminder of the realities of free apps and how the law struggles to keep up with regulating big tech firms.

They found that more than 150 instances of sexual assault involving dating apps, and approximately 10 percent involved users being matched with dates who had previously been accused or convicted of sexual assault.<br/>At the time of the report, a Match Group spokesperson called the report \"disingenuous\" and \"inaccurate,\" though declined to comment on any specific facts reported in the story. However, the statement did say that Match Group didn't collect enough data on its free users to conduct meaningful background checks.<br/>\"As technology evolves, we will continue to aggressively deploy new tools to eradicate bad actors, including users of our free products like Tinder, Plenty of Fish, and OkCupid where we are not able to obtain sufficient and reliable information to make meaningful background checks possible.\"<br/>In a statement to Time, the Match Group said the US national sex offender registry needs to be updated so perpetrators' digital footprints can be tracked and blocked by social media and dating services.<br/>As well as sharing information on its users' ages, the investigated dating apps have been asked to share its privacy policies along with its terms and conditions and how the company handles\u00a0 collected user data including sexual orientation and political views, among others.\u00a0<br/>This isn't the only controversy facing dating apps at the moment. Earlier this week, a report by Gizmodo found that Tinder's new \"Panic Button\" is sharing users' data with ad-tech companies including Facebook and YouTube.\u00a0<br/>Currently, the investigated dating apps have not immediately responded to the subcommittee requests, but it's yet another reminder of the realities of free apps and how the law struggles to keep up with regulating big tech firms.\u00a0<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITNEXT-M-587440</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITNEXT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y3P-NP71-DYDW-74DK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410719</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"502\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>IT Next</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 31, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC0004SFY</classCode><className>MATCH GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS812990 ALL OTHER PERSONAL SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>SIC7299 MISCELLANEOUS PERSONAL SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In 1958, The Small Business Investment Act gave tax breaks to start-ups. As a result, small enterprises opening shop around Stanford benefitted immensely.

The Code - Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America traces Silicon Valley's growth story since the 1940s.</p><p>Having worked in the White House during Bill Clinton's presidency, which was also the time when the IT industry grew phenomenally, O'Mara shares an insider's view of the US government's close involvement in nurturing Big Tech. In its review, The New York Times hails O'Mara as \"an academic historian blessed with a journalist's prose, [who] focuses less on the actual technology than on the people and policies that ensured its success\".</p><p>O'Mara explains how decades of investments by the military establishment in science and research during the Cold War spurred growth and innovation. At the same time, it recounts the pivotal role played by Stanford University, which bolstered its engineering and science departments after World War II, thus making the San Francisco Bay area a preferred destination for such investments. A decentralised and competitive system of distributing funds through contractors also helped foster entrepreneurship.</p><p>Legislation and regulatory policy also played their part. In 1958, The Small Business Investment Act gave tax breaks to start-ups. As a result, small enterprises opening shop around Stanford benefitted immensely. California's policy of prohibiting non-compete contracts also brought about a proliferation of knowledge sharing between companies. Finally, the Immigration and Naturalization Act in 1965 opened the floodgates for talent across the world to enter the US and the tech industry.</p><p>Having given her account of Silicon Valley, which is today the engine room of the US economy, O'Mara points out that the industry is still male-dominated, with few women leaders reaching the top.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDEXP-0048535561</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDEXP2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJD-HNK1-DXMP-K407-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">364854</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"312\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Indian Express, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Express</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 12, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000199</classCode><className>BOOK REVIEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009U58</classCode><className>HISTORY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001581</classCode><className>SMALL BUSINESS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000298</classCode><className>CITIZENSHIP</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A4QF</classCode><className>COLD WAR</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001020</classCode><className>LEGISLATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N921100MM</classCode><className>US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkM1MTYwRDE0NkJBNEVFMEIxQjM3RUE2NDRFQUFEODY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA</classCode><className>Federal Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001960</classCode><className>PUBLIC POLICY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009XVW</classCode><className>WORLD WAR II</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX000629</classCode><className>ENTREPRENEURSHIP</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001688</classCode><className>TAXES &amp;

The business started in the Americas but has expanded to Spain and is set to take off in the rest of Europe as more companies look to lock in power prices and emphasize their sustainability.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Javier Vaquerizo Alonso, head of the commercial office at Enel's global renewable subsidiary, Enel Green Power, spoke to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence about the state of the market and what is needed to spur further growth in corporate PPAs. The following is an edited transcript of the conversation.</p><p>S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence: How is the corporate PPA market shaping up in Europe?</p><p>Javier Vaquerizo Alonso: I think that the European market is going to be different from others, first of all, because of the regulatory framework. The preferred schemes in order to support renewables, obviously, are going to condition the way the bilateral PPA market is going to develop in the future. [For] example the Nordics, historically, have been the first ones in which we've seen PPAs, but the main reason is that their quota system, the green certificate system, was perfect in order to foster PPAs. In the rest of Europe, the decision was not to have a quota system. So we've been living with a mix of some support schemes based on auctions or feed-in tariffs, feed-in premiums ... those support mechanisms are competing as another alternative route to market for sellers.</p><p>And then in Europe, another big difference is going to be the structuring part. The physical supply is more important in Europe than in the United States, both because of accounting treatment issues and because of the [higher] competition you can find in the retail segment in different European markets.</p><p>With corporates becoming more of a market driver, how do the dynamics change for utilities?</p><p>The interest is at a very high level in the corporate space. [But] a lot of corporates are still in the decision phase ... [and] historically in Europe, the energy purchases were based more in the short term ... so that the liquidity of the future and forward markets in Europe for energy has been one, two years. And now we are starting to see new products come in, but with very limited liquidity.</p><p>I think that the commercial and industrial space, they are willing to take advantage of the competitiveness of new renewables. They understand that in order to do that, they need to ensure longer [contract] terms because of bankability aspects of those new investments. But I would say we're still struggling a bit with that bankability concept. For a seller, for a developer, it's still very difficult to find bankable conditions   mainly regarding credit   and we need to evolve a little bit the business model, we need to find different ways to ensure that the investment can be done.</p><p>Another important piece of the equation is going to be the evolution of the energy market. So the reference prices, the benchmark prices that the corporates are going to see and how internally these organizations that, historically, have been focused mainly on price in the short-term, are going to transform their procurement departments and sustainability and energy management departments into more risk management departments ... This is a transformation that is not going to be done in a short period of time.</p><p>Javier Vaquerizo Alonso.Source: Enel Green Power How do you plan to open this market to smaller companies?</p><p>There are some experiments. One is community solar or aggregation platforms. We are really interested in following those activities, trying to understand if, through the right support from advisers and platforms, associations, we can somehow replicate [what we do] with a big company for big volumes with good credit, with a pool of off-takers of small and medium-size that can bring together some needs in terms of volume and can also bring together some statistical composition of the different [levels of] creditworthiness. The issue is that it is very difficult to put together several [off-takers] with different interests ... but step-by-step, some initiatives are going to get traction, and we will see some new aggregation PPAs.</p><p>Of course, companies like Enel and big utilities in markets where we are integrated, and we have our retail activity, we are also looking for solutions for our own clients willing to enter into long-term PPAs with new renewables for a part of their loads ... [But] we need to see some pilot contracts, some green shoots, to try and catch different models and see how we can bring those PPAs to the lower level of the iceberg. Now we are just on the tip of the iceberg, with the big tech [companies] and these early movers, but the untapped market is so huge.</p><p>Do you see any clear preference from companies for one type of PPA over another?</p><p>In Europe, so far, we see a preference for physical PPAs, physical supply ... [But], in my opinion, we will see in the future how more companies are going to be open to explore the virtual PPA, the financial product. The additionality benefits are there either with physical PPA or with financial PPA, [but] it's easier to have the same counterparty.</p><p>Depending on the kind of customer, I would say that there is [even] an advantage in doing virtual versus physical. If you have just few loads, a very concentrated load in a particular market, probably it's better to do physical, so to do a PPA through the retail company. If you have multiple loads, dispersed loans, smaller loads but a lot of them, probably it's better to enter into a virtual PPA.</p><p>Which markets in Europe will develop next?</p><p>We all expect that, in the future, we can see PPAs across Europe. Of course, we need some policy in place, we need some barriers to be removed. We need to improve the way [guarantees of origin] are tracked and traded. I would say that Spain is an example because market conditions, market prices, customer appetite and renewable sector readiness   all those elements are there. And we have started to see a lot of PPAs [as a result]. We foresee something similar is going to happen in Italy; probably we're going to need a little bit more of time because some of these elements are still coming together.</p><p>In other countries like Germany, we need to see clearly how the new national regulation is going to adopt [the EU's clean energy] directive, and Poland, which we are all monitoring. In the meantime, we see some PPAs in those markets, but not for additional [projects], in some cases   long-term bilateral contracts with existing assets, or very small contracts with some traders, like in Italy. So some activity is starting to be visible, but I think that each market is going to get traction in a different moment because we need those elements to be altogether aligned in order to see this take off.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLPWD-54684537</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLPWD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8M-JHP1-JDVW-N08R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">360287</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1201\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL Power Daily with Market Report</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 11, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC0001ZCY</classCode><className>ENEL SPA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC000CQNK</classCode><className>ENEL GREEN POWER SPA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS221122 ELECTRIC POWER DISTRIBUTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS221111 HYDROELECTRIC POWER GENERATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>SIC4939 COMBINATION UTILITIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>SIC4911 ELECTRIC SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS221112 FOSSIL FUEL ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS221210 NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS221117 BIOMASS ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS221114 SOLAR ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC4924 NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The business started in the Americas but has expanded to Spain and is set to take off in the rest of Europe as more companies look to lock in power prices and emphasize their sustainability.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Javier Vaquerizo Alonso, head of the commercial office at Enel's global renewable subsidiary, Enel Green Power, spoke to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence about the state of the market and what is needed to spur further growth in corporate PPAs. The following is an edited transcript of the conversation.</p><p>S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence: How is the corporate PPA market shaping up in Europe?</p><p>Javier Vaquerizo Alonso: I think that the European market is going to be different from others, first of all, because of the regulatory framework. The preferred schemes in order to support renewables, obviously, are going to condition the way the bilateral PPA market is going to develop in the future. [For] example the Nordics, historically, have been the first ones in which we've seen PPAs, but the main reason is that their quota system, the green certificate system, was perfect in order to foster PPAs. In the rest of Europe, the decision was not to have a quota system. So we've been living with a mix of some support schemes based on auctions or feed-in tariffs, feed-in premiums ... those support mechanisms are competing as another alternative route to market for sellers.</p><p>And then in Europe, another big difference is going to be the structuring part. The physical supply is more important in Europe than in the United States, both because of accounting treatment issues and because of the [higher] competition you can find in the retail segment in different European markets.</p><p>With corporates becoming more of a market driver, how do the dynamics change for utilities?</p><p>The interest is at a very high level in the corporate space. [But] a lot of corporates are still in the decision phase ... [and] historically in Europe, the energy purchases were based more in the short term ... so that the liquidity of the future and forward markets in Europe for energy has been one, two years. And now we are starting to see new products come in, but with very limited liquidity.</p><p>I think that the commercial and industrial space, they are willing to take advantage of the competitiveness of new renewables. They understand that in order to do that, they need to ensure longer [contract] terms because of bankability aspects of those new investments. But I would say we're still struggling a bit with that bankability concept. For a seller, for a developer, it's still very difficult to find bankable conditions   mainly regarding credit   and we need to evolve a little bit the business model, we need to find different ways to ensure that the investment can be done.</p><p>Another important piece of the equation is going to be the evolution of the energy market. So the reference prices, the benchmark prices that the corporates are going to see and how internally these organizations that, historically, have been focused mainly on price in the short-term, are going to transform their procurement departments and sustainability and energy management departments into more risk management departments ... This is a transformation that is not going to be done in a short period of time.</p><p>Javier Vaquerizo Alonso.Source: Enel Green Power How do you plan to open this market to smaller companies?</p><p>There are some experiments. One is community solar or aggregation platforms. We are really interested in following those activities, trying to understand if, through the right support from advisers and platforms, associations, we can somehow replicate [what we do] with a big company for big volumes with good credit, with a pool of off-takers of small and medium-size that can bring together some needs in terms of volume and can also bring together some statistical composition of the different [levels of] creditworthiness. The issue is that it is very difficult to put together several [off-takers] with different interests ... but step-by-step, some initiatives are going to get traction, and we will see some new aggregation PPAs.</p><p>Of course, companies like Enel and big utilities in markets where we are integrated, and we have our retail activity, we are also looking for solutions for our own clients willing to enter into long-term PPAs with new renewables for a part of their loads ... [But] we need to see some pilot contracts, some green shoots, to try and catch different models and see how we can bring those PPAs to the lower level of the iceberg. Now we are just on the tip of the iceberg, with the big tech [companies] and these early movers, but the untapped market is so huge.</p><p>Do you see any clear preference from companies for one type of PPA over another?</p><p>In Europe, so far, we see a preference for physical PPAs, physical supply ... [But], in my opinion, we will see in the future how more companies are going to be open to explore the virtual PPA, the financial product. The additionality benefits are there either with physical PPA or with financial PPA, [but] it's easier to have the same counterparty.</p><p>Depending on the kind of customer, I would say that there is [even] an advantage in doing virtual versus physical. If you have just few loads, a very concentrated load in a particular market, probably it's better to do physical, so to do a PPA through the retail company. If you have multiple loads, dispersed loans, smaller loads but a lot of them, probably it's better to enter into a virtual PPA.</p><p>Which markets in Europe will develop next?</p><p>We all expect that, in the future, we can see PPAs across Europe. Of course, we need some policy in place, we need some barriers to be removed. We need to improve the way [guarantees of origin] are tracked and traded. I would say that Spain is an example because market conditions, market prices, customer appetite and renewable sector readiness   all those elements are there. And we have started to see a lot of PPAs [as a result]. We foresee something similar is going to happen in Italy; probably we're going to need a little bit more of time because some of these elements are still coming together.</p><p>In other countries like Germany, we need to see clearly how the new national regulation is going to adopt [the EU's clean energy] directive, and Poland, which we are all monitoring. In the meantime, we see some PPAs in those markets, but not for additional [projects], in some cases   long-term bilateral contracts with existing assets, or very small contracts with some traders, like in Italy. So some activity is starting to be visible, but I think that each market is going to get traction in a different moment because we need those elements to be altogether aligned in order to see this take off.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLERW-54684537</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLERW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XB4-BX21-F19Y-C057-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">360301</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1201\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL Renewable Energy Weekly</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 18, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC0001ZCY</classCode><className>ENEL SPA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC000CQNK</classCode><className>ENEL GREEN POWER SPA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS221122 ELECTRIC POWER DISTRIBUTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS221111 HYDROELECTRIC POWER GENERATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>SIC4939 COMBINATION UTILITIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>SIC4911 ELECTRIC SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS221112 FOSSIL FUEL ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS221210 NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS221117 BIOMASS ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS221114 SOLAR ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC4924 NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

This has become- ever more obvious since Russian agents used Facebook in an -attempt to manipulate the US public in the 2016 presidential election. It's clearer every time somebody searches or posts about dogs, only to find their feeds in-undated with dog food ads.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Capitalising on the oceans of data produced by the web has turned Facebook and Alphabet's Google into empires, but it hasn't made the internet a more open place, says Christian Fuchs, a media professor at the University of Westminster in London.</p><p>\"The internet is a corporate monopoly today,\" he says, \"and monopolies are always a danger to democracy.\" Web's original promise While US politicians try to combat the concerns by talking about antitrust and regulation, a cottage -industry of true decentralisers is emerging in the computer space. They want to recapture the original promise of the web, to create a platform where information isn't siloed by private companies or monitored by police states.</p><p>It's a stiff challenge. The apps and websites that run on top of the internet - Facebook's, Amazon's, etcetera - are managed from centrally- controlled servers. To run -efficiently, those programs and servers capture and manage all of the data that is created. When you write something on Facebook you are writing from your device, but the data is captured- on Facebook's servers.</p><p>To be clear, no website or compan-y controls the internet. And people using the internet spread their personal information across strings of different sites and servers. But still, the key for most web companies is controlling as much data as possible.</p><p>\"The key is centralisation of -information,\" says David Chaum, a computer scientist who built the first working digital currency in the 1990s and today is building a new internet platform called Elixxir.</p><p>\"You don't have to control things to exert power in the inform-ation space. Just knowing a lot about everybody lets you manipula-te the whole situation.\" Berners-Lee's solution Platforms such as Elixxir are using the somewhat heady idea of linking everyone's computers together to share data and, in some cases, even processing power. Websites and apps might look the same - and still be connected to the internet that we know - but companies wouldn't be able to amass data, and they might not even need to build massive cloud-server centres just to run their sites.</p><p>One proponent of this -approach is the creator of the world wide web himself, Tim -Berners-Lee. Thirty years after he launched it, the \"perverse incent-ives\" and unintended consequences of the original design have people wondering \"if the web is -really a force for good\", he wrote in a letter this year.</p><p>He is trying to improve his creation- on several fronts. The non-profit World Wide Web Foundation he leads launched a \"contract for the web\" movement, a sort of bill of rights for the online world. Privately, he co-founded Inrupt, a company developing a protocol called Solid.</p><p>Ending data monopolies Solid's core concept is the POD, for \"personal online data\", which the company compares to a -secure, though virtual, USB stick. All of your personal data is stored there, along with data verifying your identity.</p><p>For example, if you were sharing photos through a social media site, the photos could be viewed on the site, but the photos wouldn't be stored on the site's servers, they'd remain in the POD. The user, not a company, would have control over all his or her data.</p><p>\"We want to introduce a mid-course correction to the web,\" says John Bruce, co-founder of Inrupt, \"one that moves it away from a centralised web to a decentralised web. We like the term 'me-centralised'.\" This approach might also -remove the incentive to build massive cloud data-storage facilit-ies that help monopolists maintain a grip. Muneeb Ali, a Princeton-educated engineer, co-founded Blockstack, which -approaches this using a distributed computing syste-m known as blockchain. Rather than each company maintaining its own servers, computing power is shared across the network-.</p><p>\"People's computers and phones are very powerful,\" he says. \"They can do most of the work.\" Blockstack would provide the overarching platform, a new -version of the world wide web, but it would only exist as software on everybody's devices. Developers would build on that network, and also contribute computing power to help maintain it. This shared model theoretically lowers the overall costs needed to run an app.</p><p>The computing costs for developers would be further reduced because of the way in which Blockstack's platform handles user data. As with Solid, all the data created by users is stored on their own -devices - what they read, what sites or apps they use, what they buy.</p><p>Ali says users could eventually monetise their own data. He envis-ions them joining co-operatives that negotiate with advertisers. If a burger chain wanted to promote something, it could offer to pay the users directly for access.</p><p>\"That's the biggest potential,\" he says. \"We cannot only enable users to be in control, but to really plug into the internet economy.\" Chaum's Elixxir focuses on handling the \"metadata\". When you write a text message, for instance-, a string of information is created - where you are, what internet service you're using - and attached to the words you type.</p><p>In something of an irony, Elixxir takes all that data and centralises it in one giant blob. From there, though, it uses a system Chaum developed to slice that inform-ation up, separate the bits and -encrypt them, then run them through myriad different nodes.</p><p>The message you write gets -received intact on the other side, but all the data underneath it is -impossible to reassemble.</p><p>\"It's all spread out in tiny pieces,\" Chaum says, likening it to a shredder. \"It's completely useless.\" Spreading data This would blunt the data-collection efforts of big web companies, which underpin their business models. There's also a theoretical security benefit: In a centralised web, hackers can get data on million-s of users by focusing on one target, such as a server site.</p><p>In a decentralised web, they -potentially would have to go from user to user individually.</p><p>This in itself might pose a regul-atory challenge, however, since it would enable anonymous interact-ions online.</p><p>Law enforcement's job is easier when dealing with companies and centralised data, not individuals. For example, the US, Britain and Australia jointly asked Facebook to delay adding encryption to its messaging services.</p><p>That's just one more hurdle for the new internetters, who are -playing David to the entrenched Goliaths. The task of building a completely new community of users is hard.</p><p>Weaning them off existing network-s could be even harder, not least of all because the companie-s that have centralised computing power and data stores won't give them up without a fight. Also, there's no guarantee some Goliath won't find a way to monopolis-e these new networks.</p><p>\"We need a web of the people, not a web of the corporations,\" says Fuchs. While he worries about the curren-t web, he is optimistic about the odds of improving it: \"There's now more public awareness, and that's the foundation of changing things.\"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-1b046704f84111e990dee5ef1e6dd983c18f65ea7da1ee23e0784feb406a14fe</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XCN-T031-F0JP-W1DB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1275\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 30, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0004EWO</classCode><className>UNIVERSITY OF WESTMINSTER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But the critical question for them and their investors is whether anything significant actually flows from it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The interrogations of Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Apple's Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai, who runs Google's parent company Alphabet, was intense and aggressive, and centred - as one would expect from a hearing focused on anti-trust issues - on claimed abuses of their enormous market power.</p><p>The question of how the technology giants use their dominant positions in e-commerce has been an increasingly vexatious issue globally, along with the continuing global scrutiny of how much, or how little, tax they pay or should pay.</p><p>The four big platforms, with a combined market capitalisation of close to $US5 trillion (about $7 trillion), between them dominate online retailing and advertising, and the core question explored in the hearing is whether they use that dominance unfairly.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the tech CEOs argued that they aren't really that dominant.</p><p>Apple says it holds only 15 per cent of the global smartphone market, Amazon claims a share of only 12 per cent of US retail sales, Facebook cited Chinese social media app TikTok to argue it faces strong competition and Google says it has less than 30 per cent of the US digital advertising market.</p><p>Members of the House anti-trust committee, however, weren't convinced, accusing the companies of abusing their vast hoards of user data to crush competitors, eliminating or acquiring them, and of exploiting users by pushing them towards their own products and services and - in the case of commercial users - to unfairly compete with them. Republicans, naturally, also accused the platforms of left-wing, or anti-conservative, content bias.</p><p>It is unclear what actions - if any - the hearing and the preceding 12-month inquiry by the committee might bring. The committee is not empowered to take action directly against the companies, although it could recommend reforms of the anti-trust laws. But it's not the only body looking at the behaviour of the big tech companies.</p><p>The US Department of Justice is considering whether Google breached anti-trust laws in the online advertising market; the Federal Trade Commission is considering whether Facebook protected its social network's dominance and killed off competitors when it acquired Instagram and WhatsApp; and the Justice Department is investigating both Facebook's online advertising practices and the walled garden around Apple's app store.</p><p>The Trump administration has also asked the Federal Communications Commission to review the laws that protect the platforms from liability for the content that they host, and Donald Trump himself tweeted during the hearing that if Congress didn't \"bring fairness to Big Tech\" he would do it himself via executive orders.</p><p>Around the world, but most particularly in Europe, there have been similar investigations and some action - including more than $US8 billion of fines for Google - in relation to the way the platforms exploit their considerable dominance.</p><p>The European Union is currently drawing up new rules for data-sharing and digital marketplaces.</p><p>Here in Australia, the tech companies face either a voluntary, or involuntary, scheme to compensate media companies for the use of their content.</p><p>The Morrison government - along with most of the rest of the developed world, excluding the US - wants to impose a digital services tax on their activities.</p><p>France tried to do that unilaterally, introducing a proposed 3 per cent tax on digital revenues, but was forced to \"defer\" its implementation from April to December this year after Trump threatened to retaliate by imposing tariffs on French wine and other products. There needs to be a global consensus, and US acceptance, if digital services taxes are to be imposed.</p><p>There is evidence that the platforms have misused customer and third-party data and acquired competitors (allegedly after actively weakening them) or used their insights to compete in order to enhance or protect their dominance. Against that, it is inarguable that they have also generated enormous innovation and consumer benefit.</p><p>There is a question as to whether these gatekeepers to 21st century commerce effectively charge too much for access and whether the economic detriment of their dominance outweighs those benefits, but the core of their paramountcy rests on their abundant appeal to users.</p><p>The dilemma for legislators and regulators is how to preserve the benefits of the Big Tech scale and innovation while curtailing behaviour that unfairly extends that dominance and protects the companies from competitors.</p><p>That may, or may not, involve some forced divestments or structural separations of some of their activities.</p><p>Under-explored in the debate about the remarkable rise of the big tech companies is the role that capital has played.</p><p>They have had, and continue to have, a massive cost-of-capital advantage over traditional competitors and the nature of the capital they attract is different.</p><p>Amazon, for instance, has by choice never delivered the profitability that its scale and business model could deliver, choosing instead to sacrifice profits to invest in expanding and deepening its operations and undercutting competitors to maximise its eventual global market positions.</p><p>Investors who dump their holdings in, for instance, bricks and mortar retailers when they barely miss market expectations, have been prepared to fund Amazon's strategy and capitalise its possibilities in a way they wouldn't even contemplate for a company that didn't have a dot.com in its name.</p><p>That capital is not only prepared to tolerate sub-optimal profitability, but is truly patient. It's a priceless advantage, and a very substantial one, that neither the competitors nor the legislators and regulators trying to put some boundaries around the big tech companies' quasi-monopolies can do anything about.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-doc7bo1tcu0pc6m6pfli2u</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G9-9691-JD34-V055-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1009\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sydney Morning Herald (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

But the critical question for them and their investors is whether anything significant actually flows from it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The interrogations of Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Apple's Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai, who runs Google's parent company Alphabet, was intense and aggressive, and centred - as one would expect from a hearing focused on anti-trust issues - on claimed abuses of their enormous market power.</p><p>The question of how the technology giants use their dominant positions in e-commerce has been an increasingly vexatious issue globally, along with the continuing global scrutiny of how much, or how little, tax they pay or should pay.</p><p>The four big platforms, with a combined market capitalisation of close to $US5 trillion (about $7 trillion), between them dominate online retailing and advertising, and the core question explored in the hearing is whether they use that dominance unfairly.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the tech CEOs argued that they aren't really that dominant.</p><p>Apple says it holds only 15 per cent of the global smartphone market, Amazon claims a share of only 12 per cent of US retail sales, Facebook cited Chinese social media app TikTok to argue it faces strong competition and Google says it has less than 30 per cent of the US digital advertising market.</p><p>Members of the House anti-trust committee, however, weren't convinced, accusing the companies of abusing their vast hoards of user data to crush competitors, eliminating or acquiring them, and of exploiting users by pushing them towards their own products and services and - in the case of commercial users - to unfairly compete with them. Republicans, naturally, also accused the platforms of left-wing, or anti-conservative, content bias.</p><p>It is unclear what actions - if any - the hearing and the preceding 12-month inquiry by the committee might bring. The committee is not empowered to take action directly against the companies, although it could recommend reforms of the anti-trust laws. But it's not the only body looking at the behaviour of the big tech companies.</p><p>The US Department of Justice is considering whether Google breached anti-trust laws in the online advertising market; the Federal Trade Commission is considering whether Facebook protected its social network's dominance and killed off competitors when it acquired Instagram and WhatsApp; and the Justice Department is investigating both Facebook's online advertising practices and the walled garden around Apple's app store.</p><p>The Trump administration has also asked the Federal Communications Commission to review the laws that protect the platforms from liability for the content that they host, and Donald Trump himself tweeted during the hearing that if Congress didn't \"bring fairness to Big Tech\" he would do it himself via executive orders.</p><p>Around the world, but most particularly in Europe, there have been similar investigations and some action - including more than $US8 billion of fines for Google - in relation to the way the platforms exploit their considerable dominance.</p><p>The European Union is currently drawing up new rules for data-sharing and digital marketplaces.</p><p>Here in Australia, the tech companies face either a voluntary, or involuntary, scheme to compensate media companies for the use of their content.</p><p>The Morrison government - along with most of the rest of the developed world, excluding the US - wants to impose a digital services tax on their activities.</p><p>France tried to do that unilaterally, introducing a proposed 3 per cent tax on digital revenues, but was forced to \"defer\" its implementation from April to December this year after Trump threatened to retaliate by imposing tariffs on French wine and other products. There needs to be a global consensus, and US acceptance, if digital services taxes are to be imposed.</p><p>There is evidence that the platforms have misused customer and third-party data and acquired competitors (allegedly after actively weakening them) or used their insights to compete in order to enhance or protect their dominance. Against that, it is inarguable that they have also generated enormous innovation and consumer benefit.</p><p>There is a question as to whether these gatekeepers to 21st century commerce effectively charge too much for access and whether the economic detriment of their dominance outweighs those benefits, but the core of their paramountcy rests on their abundant appeal to users.</p><p>The dilemma for legislators and regulators is how to preserve the benefits of the Big Tech scale and innovation while curtailing behaviour that unfairly extends that dominance and protects the companies from competitors.</p><p>That may, or may not, involve some forced divestments or structural separations of some of their activities.</p><p>Under-explored in the debate about the remarkable rise of the big tech companies is the role that capital has played.</p><p>They have had, and continue to have, a massive cost-of-capital advantage over traditional competitors and the nature of the capital they attract is different.</p><p>Amazon, for instance, has by choice never delivered the profitability that its scale and business model could deliver, choosing instead to sacrifice profits to invest in expanding and deepening its operations and undercutting competitors to maximise its eventual global market positions.</p><p>Investors who dump their holdings in, for instance, bricks and mortar retailers when they barely miss market expectations, have been prepared to fund Amazon's strategy and capitalise its possibilities in a way they wouldn't even contemplate for a company that didn't have a dot.com in its name.</p><p>That capital is not only prepared to tolerate sub-optimal profitability, but is truly patient. It's a priceless advantage, and a very substantial one, that neither the competitors nor the legislators and regulators trying to put some boundaries around the big tech companies' quasi-monopolies can do anything about.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-doc7bo1ne2d1b66cxn9g0q</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G9-9691-JD34-V01D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1009\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

One of them is the world's richest individual (Bezos), another is the fourth-ranked billionaire (Zuckerberg).</p><p>The four were set to testify remotely for a hearing yesterday by the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust. In its bipartisan investigation, the panel collected testimony from mid-level executives of the four firms, competitors and legal experts, and pored over more than a million internal documents from the companies.</p><p>A key question is whether existing competition policies and century-old antitrust laws are adequate for overseeing the tech giants, or if new legislation and enforcement funding is needed.</p><p>Subcommittee chairperson Representative David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, has called the four companies monopolies, although he says breaking them up should be a last resort.</p><p>The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have been investigating the four companies' practices.</p><p>Each company has a distinct profile and sets its widening footprint in specific markets, and each tech titan has his own approach and story to tell. For Bezos, who presides over an e-commerce empire and ventures in cloud computing, personal \"smart\" tech and beyond, it will be his first appearance before Congress.</p><p>Bezos is introducing himself, in a way, in his hearing testimony, unusual for the occasion. He lays out his challenging life story growing up in New Mexico as the son of a single mother in high school, and later with an adoptive father who emigrated from Cuba at 16. Previewing his written testimony in a blog post on Tuesday, Bezos traces his origins as a \"garage inventor\" who came up with the concept of an online bookstore in 1994.</p><p>He claims Amazon accounts for less than 4% of retail in the US, Bezos maintains. He affirms his rebuff to critics who call for the company to be broken up: Walmart is more than twice Amazon's size, he says.</p><p>In the wake of George Floyd's death and protests against racial injustice, Facebook's handling of hate speech has recently drawn more fire than issues of competition and privacy, especially after Facebook's refusal to take action on inflammatory Trump posts.</p><p>Zuckerberg has said the company aims to allow as much free expression as possible unless it causes imminent risk of specific harms or damage. \"I understand that people have concerns about the size and perceived power that tech companies have,\" Zuckerberg's statement says. \"Ultimately, I believe companies shouldn't be making so many judgements about important issues like harmful content, privacy and election integrity on their own. That's why I've called for a more active role for governments and regulators, and updated rules for the internet.\"</p><p>Attorneys-general from both parties in 50 states and territories, led by Texas, launched an antitrust investigation of Google in September, focused on its online advertising business. \"Google operates in highly competitive and dynamic global markets, in which prices are free or falling, and products are constantly improving,\" Pichai says in his written testimony.</p><p>Apple, whose iPhone is the third-largest seller in the world, faces EU investigations over the fees charged by its App Store and technical limitations that allegedly shut out competitors to Apple Pay.</p><p>\"Apple does not have a dominant market share in any market where we do business,\" Cook says. He is making the case that the fees Apple charges apps to sell services and other goods are reasonable. | AP</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPTIM-120131328</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPTIM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G7-KPV1-F091-R507-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">312415</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"647\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Independent Newspapers Pty (Ltd) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Cape Times (South Africa)</publicationName><edition>E1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It has a big stick,\u00a0called 'Title II,' but most people think the agency lacks the\u00a0political juice to\u00a0wield it against some very powerful companies.</p><p><br/> And while some\u00a0have proposed\u00a0'light touch' options to avoid a confrontation, that\u00a0may be\u00a0wishful thinking: FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler will have to go all-in and swing the Title II stick, or just it lay down altogether.\u00a0To get a better idea of Wheeler's predicament, here's a fresh\u00a0look at Title II: what it is, who is for and against it, and why insiders think Wheeler won't use his only weapon to enforce net neutrality.<br/>Title II: what it\u00a0means in plain English<br/>The telecom scene\u00a0is jargon-heavy, and the Title II debate is no exception: the crux of the fight turns on whether the FCC\u00a0should re-classify broadband companies as a\u00a0'telecommunications service' instead of as\u00a0an 'information service.'<br/> Why does the label matter? In theory, it should\u00a0not: the FCC could\u00a0call\u00a0Comcast a cat food company, and it would still provide the same services. But\u00a0under FCC rules, the 'telecommunications service' label is important\u00a0because it triggers a series of obligations[1] under\u00a0Title II of the Communications Act of 1934.<br/><br/>Those obligations, which cover everything from price-caps\u00a0to closed-captioning to emergency services, have traditionally applied to 'common carriers' like wireline\u00a0phone companies, and place restrictions on\u00a0how they run their business. That's why broadband\u00a0providers like Comcast and Verizon don't want to live under Title II \u2014 they want to continue on as 'information services' under a different part of the law (Title I) which, on paper, involves a lighter regulatory load.<br/> There's one more important element to the Title II debate, however. It's the idea of 'forbearance,' which is industry-speak for the FCC's power to impose some obligations but not others. For instance, the agency could say the rules of\u00a0section 224[2] on 'Pole Attachments' no longer\u00a0apply, while leaving\u00a0other sections in place \u2014 perhaps section 202[3] (non-discrimination) and section 208[4] (complaint procedures).<br/> This would mean that Title II would not be as onerous as it appears, but it would still require a legal two-step on the part of the FCC: the agency would have to issue a re-classification order to make the broadband companies a 'telecommunications service' under Title II, and then declare a series of forbearance measures to explain which parts of the law will\u00a0not apply.<br/> The FCC, by the way, has the legal authority\u00a0to do all this. There's no doubt about it,\u00a0because the D.C. Court of Appeals said so\u00a0in a thunderbolt court ruling[5] in January. The ruling struck down the FCC's last set of rules on net neutrality, but said they would have been legal if they had been issued under\u00a0Title II.<br/>Why some\u00a0say we need Title II, and others\u00a0say we can't have it<br/>The Electronic Frontier Foundation recently took the position[6] that\u00a0the\u00a0FCC should use its Title II power to bring broadband providers to heel. This declaration, coming\u00a0from a group that has long been suspicious of government regulating the internet, came as a surprise and reflects growing concerns over the power of\u00a0Comcast and other big ISP's.<br/> According to the EFF, Title II is necessary to stop a future where big ISP's can give special 'fast lane' treatment to websites they like (or that pay them) and slow down small\u00a0sites, or ones tied to\u00a0their competitors. Comcast, for instance, might one day decide to give a speed boost to its tech site\u00a0Re/Code, while slowing down readers' access to\u00a0Gigaom.<br/> The EFF isn't the only one calling for Title II. The\u00a0CEO of Kickstarter recently warned[7]\u00a0that 'fast lanes' could impede\u00a0the next\u00a0generation of web services from emerging because a future Facebook or Twitter might not be able to\u00a0afford the toll to reach customers\u00a0in the first place. The Title II chorus is also coming from the likes of Reddit and Netflix, and from politicians like Sen. Charles Schumer[8] (D-NY).<br/><br/>The goal\u00a0of the Title II advocates is not, of course, to reclassify broadband providers for the heck of it. Rather, they believe the\u00a0FCC has no other choice if it truly wants to prevents\u00a0ISPs from favoring some websites over others. As Netflix told[9] the agency last week, two previous attempts to use other laws to enforce net neutrality have failed \u2014 meaning it's Title II or bust.<br/> Meanwhile, big telecom companies\u00a0have come down just as strongly against Title II. Their best\u00a0argument is that reclassification would turn them into public utilities with no incentive to invest in pipes or\u00a0new technologies. Comcast said so in a recent blog post[10], adding that Title II is not necessary given the FCC's auxiliary power under Title I, and trying to use it will only cause a mess of legal headaches.<br/> The anti-Title II companies, which also include Verizon and ATT, are supported by some conservatives[11] who take the position that the FCC will stifle innovation, and by Republican politicians like Rep. Bob Latta (R-Oh) who is trying to pass a law[12]\u00a0to clip the FCC's net neutrality wings.<br/> As you can see, the Title II debate is divisive, which has led some to call for a middle ground \u2014 one that is unlikely to work.<br/>'Title II lite' is an illusion<br/>Net neutrality advocates who want to help the FCC escape its\u00a0dilemma have come forward with ideas that, they suggest, will let the agency impose Title II but without too much screeching from Comcast and the gang.<br/> One idea comes via the Mozilla Foundation[13], which has called for the FCC to apply\u00a0Title II but only at a deeper layer of the internet where ISP's meet 'edge providers' like Level 3 or Netflix. Another comes from law professor Tim Wu, an authority in the field who first coined the term 'net neutrality, and who proposes[14] a belt-and-suspenders approach:<br/> the Commission's best course is to pass tough rules under 706 with Title II as the backup, to insure the rules survive a court challenge. This strategy may actually ward off court challenges, given that it presents the carriers with a kind of trip wire.<br/> Under Wu's proposal, the FCC would draw, but not fire, its Title II weapon, while also keeping the ISP's in line on a day-to-day basis with the Title I powers it has used in the past.<br/> These proposals hold out the\u00a0promise of Title II lite \u2014 a way to show the ISPs that the FCC means business but without triggering a political brawl. And the\u00a0FCC appears to be listening:<br/> .@rgslutsky[15] We specifically asked questions about the Wu/Tejas/Mozilla \"sender-side\" #netneutrality[16] idea in our request 4 comments, so very.\u2014 Gigi Sohn (@GigiBSohnFCC) July 14, 2014[17]<br/> The problem, however, is that opponents will likely fight\u00a0just as fiercely no matter how Title II is invoked, since it is not the details they oppose so much as any type of reclassification in the first place.<br/> According to Paul Werner[18], a veteran telecom lawyer at Shepherd Mullin, Wu is correct\u00a0that agencies like the FCC can and do create rules\u00a0under multiple sources of law; however, in the case of Title II, Werner suggested by email that\u00a0Wu's 'backup' plan wouldn't fly with the courts:<br/> But what the courts have said the FCC cannot do is use Title II as a 'backstop' for imposing core Title II obligations - such as non-discrimination or common carriage requirements - on internet service providers. The DC Circuit invalidated just such an approach recently in holding that the FCC cannot backdoor Title II regulations under the guise of its Section 706 authority. Instead, the fundamental legal and policy choice facing the Commission is whether or not to re-classify internet service as a 'telecommunications service' subject to the full complement of Title II regulations.<br/> This\u00a0is\u00a0another way of saying that, when it comes to Title II, the FCC can't be half-pregnant. While the agency could\u00a0invoke\u00a0Title II and immediately forebear on its more onerous\u00a0obligations, it\u00a0would still have to stand and fight for Title II in the first place \u2014 and that is something\u00a0it's\u00a0reluctant to do.<br/>Why the FCC won't use its only weapon<br/>The FCC has received more than a million\u00a0public comments about net neutrality \u2014 a huge response, second only to Janet Jackson's infamous nipple-slip \u2014 and many of them explicitly call for Title II. But, for now, those comments won't matter too much.\u00a0Title II may have popular\u00a0support and it appears to be the correct policy choice, but that's still no match for\u00a0corporate\u00a0realpolitik.<br/> Simply put, Title II advocates just don't have the money and lobbying firepower to challenge the telecom\u00a0industry. New figures[19], for instance, showed that ISPs\u00a0have spent $42.4 million so far this year, and that Comcast alone spent nearly $4.5 million in the second quarter.<br/> The notion that ISPs are throwing money around is nothing new, of course, but the critical issue when it comes to Title II is that no one is spending on the other side.<br/><br/>FCC Commissioners (L to R): Commissioner Ajit Pai, Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, Chairman Tom Wheeler, Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel and Commissioner Michael O'Rielly (Source: FCC)<br/><br/>According to Washington insiders, the Title II cause appeared doomed after\u00a0big tech companies like Google and Facebook decided to sit out the fight. While Yahoo\u00a0last\u00a0week made a slight peep[20] that Title II might be necessary to prevent discrimination, the rest of the Silicon Valley giants \u2014 apart from Netflix \u2014 have stayed mum. While the tech industry would have likely lost a lobbying battle to Comcast even if it\u00a0had opened its\u00a0check book, its absence from the fight\u00a0all but guarantees\u00a0the FCC will leave Title II on the shelf.<br/> Not everyone is pessimistic, of course. Harold Feld, a VP at consumer interest group Public Knowledge, says that the level of public awareness this time is far higher than the last time the FCC debated net neutrality.<br/> 'A lot of this\u00a0clever political analysis\u00a0applies to\u00a0the last war,' he said, noting that pundits have declared other\u00a0FCC decisions to be foregone conclusions \u2014 and then been proved wrong.<br/> Finally, there is the matter of Chairman Tom Wheeler, who holds the ultimate card in the Title II debate. He's a former cable lobbyist, and seemed a pushover, but has also shown\u00a0a recent independent streak \u2014 and even warned that he 'won't hesitate to use Title II.'<br/> If Wheeler is reading this, he may wish to ponder the example of the man who said\u00a0'speak softly and carry a big stick.' It was Teddy Roosevelt, who is the subject of another famous quote[21]\u00a0by\u00a0a powerful corporate baron, who complained of the President that:\u00a0'We bought the son of a bitch, and then he didn't stay bought.'<br/> Image copyright sirylok via Pond5[22].<br/><br/>Related research and analysis from Gigaom Research: Subscriber content.

Chumley</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All this social media censorship talk that's been fueling conservative angst in recent months has had the distressing effect of putting the ideological right exactly where the left wants it in a regulatory box with nowhere to go.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The solution? The ideological right needs to create a new battlefield. How about amending Title VII of the Civil Rights Act?</p><p> Look at the situation; look at what's going on.</p><p> You've got months and months of headlines and stories and statistics and analyses showing the censorship realities of being caught conservative on social media. Ask Diamond and Silk, the black pro-President Donald Trump duo who were shut out of Facebook for what they say were their political posts. Ask conservative talk show host Dennis Prager, who sued YouTube  unsuccessfully  for unfairly restricting access to Prager University videos. Ask Alex Jones who was just the target of a massive social media scrubbing by Facebook, by Google, by Apple.</p><p> That's but a partial list.</p><p> So what have conservatives done to fight this unfair censorship?</p><p> By and large, to call for government regulation against the big-tech companies.</p><p> No, no and triple no. Regulating the free market is a leftist's talking point, not a conservative one. Conservatives calling for crackdowns on social media companies plays right into the left's hands.</p><p> There's nothing the hard left serving the globalist gods would like more than to get a foot in the door of regulating content on the internet. First a foot  then a fist.</p><p> \"Leaked [George] Soros document calls for regulating Internet to favor 'Open Society' supporters,\" screamed one Daily Caller headline in August of 2016.</p><p> \"Hacked documents reveal Soros plans for more Internet regulation,\" ran another from the Washington Examiner, a month later.</p><p> This is the plan.</p><p> \"Documents obtained through the breach of George Soros' Open Society Foundations reveal a comprehensive vision for the future of the Internet, with the philanthropic group funding at least 13 organizations to promote expanding government-funded access and encouraging regulatory influence over the content users view,\" the Examiner piece stated.</p><p> This is the goal.</p><p> It's really rather ingenious how the left has managed to create a censorship system that has the ideological right calling for government regulation.</p><p> Ingenious and despicable.</p><p> \"Infowars,\" Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy just tweeted, \"is the tip of a giant iceberg of hate and lies that uses sites like Facebook and YouTube to tear our nation apart. These companies must do more than take down one website. The survival of our democracy depends on it.\"</p><p> But conservatives need to tread cautiously here.</p><p> Choices are limited  it's not as if there's a Republican-led tech firm waiting to bust open the social media market and provide a welcoming mat for the conservatives of the world.</p><p> But here's a thought: What if instead of pressing for Congress to do something, the White House to do something, the regulators on Capitol Hill to do something  what if instead of demanding the social media giants be treated like public utilities or as monopolies, and regulated accordingly  what if conservatives took a different tack?</p><p> What if conservatives created a new battle ground that makes the left at least dance a little nervous dance?</p><p> Currently, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits employers from discriminating based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin.</p><p> Let's add a category called \"political belief.\"</p><p> It's not the perfect solution, but it's a start. Yes, it's true, Title VII only guides employer-employee relations. And yes, it's true \u00a0amending the code to include political belief is not an overnight fix to all this censorship.</p><p> But creating this category would help keep censorship regulation away from government hands and more in the private market, and it would give those employees who've been harmed by censorship  who've been discriminated against or treated unfairly at the workplace  the tools to successfully fight the bias in court.</p><p> Companies don't like to pay punitive damages. They also don't like the negative publicity that goes along with fighting civil rights' infringements in court.</p><p> Adding \"political belief\" to Title VII would soon enough send the signal throughout the private market that discriminating against someone for the crime of being an elephant in a firm filled with donkeys is as serious an offense as discriminating against someone's skin color. It wouldn't take long for these same provisions to be extended to customers, consumers and clients of these social media companies. And why wouldn't they be? Culture changes can indeed start small but sweep a nation.</p><p> Title VII protections for political beliefs may not be the only solution to the social media censorship problem, or even the best one. But it's an idea worth considering, at least for the long-term and at least while floundering to find ways to control the bias without violating core conservative principles.</p><p> At the least it might keep conservatives from walking right into the lion's den of Democratic talking points, and giving away the internet to government regulators.</p><p> \u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:cchumley@washingtontimes.com\">cchumley@washingtontimes.com</email> or on Twitter, @ckchumley.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WTIMES-16DB51E99F9F5258</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T1C-SNP1-DXVP-V558-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8176</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"872\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Washington Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>10 August 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

I'm here with Tom Rogers, the President and CEO of TiVo. A little bit of a fireside chat here at the media, internet, and telecom conference. Thanks everyone for joining. And thank you, Tom, for joining us today. I think this is our second year in a row in this format.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TOM ROGERS, PRESIDENT AND CEO, TIVO INC.: Thank you for having us. There has never been a time I more looked forward to being in Palm Beach.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: I think a lot of us from the Northeast feel the same way. So, Tom, maybe if you could, we could kind of just dive in on your recent results and talk a little bit about the Company's performance and then maybe we'll get into a little bit more on where you see the marketplace going.</p><p>TOM ROGERS: Well, we announced our full-results last week and it was a great year. We had record net income, we had record service and technology revenues, our key revenue measure. We had record EBITDA, gross profit. Year-over-year we up over 1 million subs. For the fourth quarter, we had record revenues, record SMO sub growth of 313,000. So from a metrics point of view, a good year, a good quarter and I think when you look beyond the numbers to look at what did the year mean in terms of what TiVo is most know for which is innovation in the advanced television space, I think it was a banner year for us also in terms of maintaining leadership there.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Fantastic. And Tom, obviously you are getting pretty close to 10 years now at the helm. And when you think about the TV landscape, which there has been a lot of change and then looking at viewer habits and where things are going, how do you see --</p><p>TOM ROGERS: I said eight years. Don't advance me too quickly.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: I was eight years in the Marines. I tend to round off to 10 years sometimes myself, call it a decade.</p><p>How do you see things going forward for viewing in the home and for outside the home and how do you think TiVo will play into those strategies?</p><p>TOM ROGERS: Well, when I came to TiVo, the Company was really in a down and out position. Many didn't think we were going to survive. It looked like TiVo was known for having created the DVR but having been rejected soundly by the cable industry that had taken on a bunch of generic alternatives, we looked like we had been marginalized.</p><p>And the question was asked repeatedly, so what happens to TiVo. The question was are the patents worth anything? It doesn't look like you guys really have defensible intellectual property given how the world has created generic alternatives to your major innovation.</p><p>Then people said, the cable industry is never going to embrace TiVo as we began to focus on could we work with operators as a way to overcome the fact that they had initially rejected us? Look, they have rejected you, they have moved on, they have no role for you. The question was whether -- the Company will never be profitable, it is losing $100 million EBITDA a year, something to that effect, it is going to run out of cash. And you can't be a one trick pony in a constantly moving world of technological development. And you guys are going to quickly be surpassed by much bigger players who can innovate much faster than you can.</p><p>And we kind of one at a time knocked those off. We showed that the patents are valuable to the tune of almost $2 billion of patent wins, that certainly answered the question are we going to run out of cash. The issue of whether the cable industry will work with us, we said, look, we offer something when it comes to where the world is going, it goes way beyond the DVR because what the DVR really was about was giving people an easy way to access on-demand television. And with everything moving on demand most recently streaming video, how do you create a user experience that is all about giving people the access of what they want, when they want it? We were able to demonstrate that working with the cable industry was something we could do. And now 18 of the top 25 cable, satellite and phone operators in the United States are one way or another dependent on us for driving their user experience.</p><p>And when it came to profitability, we said, look, this year we will be probably north of $100 million of EBITDA. Certainly we think that is well within the realm of what we're capable of doing. And they answered that question.</p><p>And then the question is, are you a one trick pony? And look at the reviews for Roamio, our most recent retail product, and people think it has innovated and evolved in a way that is beyond anything else offered by way of an advanced television solution.</p><p>The big question now is, okay, you have got a lot of cash on your balance sheet and what you are going to do with it? And we have begun to answer that but in the scheme of the questions that have been hanging over our heads for the last eight years, that is an easier one than the other ones.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: So, on the cable side, you are obviously having tremendous success and your range of solutions on how you approach MSO customers is a little different with each. I think we have seen in some cases you're able to fully integrate with the video on demand product with some of the operators. And there is just a range of alternatives.</p><p>Can you talk a little bit about where you are with the MSOs and do you have a preferred way to play when you partner with them on their user experience?</p><p>TOM ROGERS: Well, I think one of the reasons that we have been partnered with by a number of MSOs is there are many different ways to play with TiVo. And I think we've shown that there is a high degree of flexibility there and there are guys who are still fully in the QAM-based technology world where we have got one set of answers, there are people that are transitioning that are highly QAM based on the set-top box front but want to implement IPTV to secondary screens and we've shown a way to do that. And there are others who are moving more quickly into a full IPTV implementation most recently with Com Hem, the largest cable operator in Scandinavia. We have shown the ability to do that.</p><p>And I think the preferred way for us to work with operators is to say, look, we've got a great user experience, and the UI elements on the screen are critical to the -- how we've traditionally shown people that menuing, navigating, discovering, searching, browsing through content, TiVo has a great way to do it. But there is the TiVo service, which powers the user experience, which is increasingly the fundamental elements that we built into the cloud and that relating to us through those elements is another way to think about what TiVo does. And that includes moving ultimately to an nDVR which we've demonstrated how our particular approach to that we think gives the cable operators some unique flexibility in the cloud space.</p><p>And so we have also been able to show that for operators that want a whole home solution, a multi screen solution, a solution that goes beyond the set-top itself, we have the flexibility to do that.</p><p>And the acquisition of Digitalsmiths, which was really a way for larger operators to think about it, they were going to focus on the user experience themselves and not take the full -- not take a TiVo type solution that was the full array of all those pieces how they could relate to a cloud-based service for that component.</p><p>And so now the flexibility has turned into yet one more way to relate to TiVo and I think the more we do for an operator the more we like it, the more we package in the UI as part of what we do, the more we think it gives the consumer the best of breed of everything. But certainly there are multiple ways to access working with us at this point.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: And for the consumers who purchase their hardware at retail and have a relationship directly with TiVo, having their video service provided by a third party, are you learning from those customers and where do you see the retail component going longer term? Is it something that will continue to grow and you will find ways to serve them in a different way?</p><p>TOM ROGERS: Well, that was another area where we had a great quarter. We were up 40% year-over-year in terms of retail subs. It was the first quarter in six years that we had net positive sub additions because that retail line, which had been churning heavily in terms of older TiVo units certainly for the first time seeing a net sub addition there was great. Lowest churn in absolute terms that we've seen in that line in eight years. So a lot of positive elements there.</p><p>We do believe based on the fact that we marketed in about a dozen markets Roamio in the fourth quarter more heavily than we did on a national basis, which was very limited money spent and we saw much higher than 40% year-over-year growth in those markets. That all gives us the sense that the metrics are pointing in the direction that people can understand the difference between TiVo and alternatives, they can be educated that no just because they have a DVR, it doesn't mean they have TiVo, that there are elements there that make it a winning proposition that can resonate.</p><p>We have a new CMO, which we announced today, a guy who ran marketing for both Dish and Sirius Satellite at different points who we think armed with the right product, the right fourth quarter testing and the knowhow he has can help drive that.</p><p>But what we learned from those subscribers is everything that you want to be as a consumer electronics company with cutting edge information and cutting edge DNA about what consumers want and what you need to know to satisfy them. And it relates heavily to how we to have won accounts on the cable side. because cable operators know, they know one thing, they know the traditional vendors in the cable space let them down, let them down badly. That it was principally driven by hardware box guys who did not see what the power of the cable industry was when it came to having channels and programming content that was more extensive than any other player out there and a broadband pipe that they had invested billions in to being the highest speed Internet connection that was tailor-made for high volumes of video getting to the home. And yet the notion of combining the video and broadband sides of their business into an advanced television experience that was commensurate with those attributes that they had, their vendors just let them down.</p><p>And TiVo came and created an opportunity for us and the fact that we were driven by a consumer electronics DNA that was much more attuned to what the consumer needed and where the market was going is something that has resonated with operators in a way most of our accounts are based on that.</p><p>Now the retail side of the equation, people said, well how can you have a retail business that competes with the operator? Well, it doesn't really compete with the operator. It is all based on cable card technology where you have to be a cable subscriber to get our box. And what we've shown is if somebody is a retail customer of TiVo, they churn less and watch more DoD and the characteristics of that sub look much better than a cable operator who wouldn't otherwise be offering TiVo.</p><p>So the fact of the matter is it looks like it helps us in the cable world.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: And are most of those retail customers that you are adding, are they doing a self installation or are the cable companies involved at all in helping put your equipment into a customer's home?</p><p>TOM ROGERS: It differs. Most are involved in a self installation. There is friction in the cable card world because the cable operator has to give you that cable card and some insist on showing up and needing a service call to do it even though they may only charge you a couple dollars for the cable card or some give it to you for free. And in those cases, they don't necessarily make it easy for self installation and that whole process could have less friction. And it is an unfortunate part of the retail setup that it isn't totally frictionless. But it has gotten better than it was and the FCC has had some regulations that have had some effect to make it better than it was.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: And, Tom, on multiroom functionality, what percentage of your new retail customers are taking on more than one piece of TiVo equipment and a new purchase? Are you tracking that at all?</p><p>TOM ROGERS: We do track that. We found I think close to 78% of those who have the capability were using it -- some streaming, roaming capability in the course of a month meaning they were connecting to some other piece of hardware beyond their television set for purposes of a television experience.</p><p>I was in my hotel room this morning and wanted to watch Morning Joe, my alma mater network of MSNBC, and took out my iPad and tapped into my bedroom TiVo and was sitting there with the ability to see my recordings in live television and that is not only getting more usage, the sessions are turning longer. I think unlike other alternatives for doing that where people are able to see something remotely but they hijack the tuner of the television set, so the person at home now is stuck watching what you have to watch remotely, our implementation of that with the number of tuners we have gives the ability for a kid at college, say, who has no ability to get cable in his dorm to have full access to their -- to his home cable television service and it totally doesn't disrupt the brothers and sisters at home from watching what they want to watch when they want to watch it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: You don't just hijack the basement TV.</p><p>TOM ROGERS: Right, right. And it has become a -- I think one of those key features that has really resonated with consumers.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: That's fantastic. And you have come very far, very fast in these last few quarters. Where do you see new product innovation going for TiVo? And how do you continue to deliver value other than executing and growing your sub base, where are the new points of value for TiVo likely to come from?</p><p>TOM ROGERS: Well, it is a world of constantly evolving content and the promise with TiVo is get everything you want when any of you want it. So integrating more and more content. But then three key themes. One is continued mobility; there is no doubt that more ways for people to watch where they want, when they want with features and elements that make the mobile experience even easier is one key area.</p><p>Two is clearly ongoing IPTV and cloud-based implementation. That is important in a lot of respects but most importantly for the cable operator to get out from under the CapEx burdens of their current environment and be able to have as much reliance on the cloud as possible, cheaper CapEx in the home and I think the TiVo service has already proved that it is a real embodiment of that whole theory of the case and our nDVR implementation I think has characteristics that make the management of content for the cable operator equivalent to the ease and simplicity that we provided for content management for the consumer. And so there is more to come on that front, where there is R&amp;D going.</p><p>And thirdly really importantly, is personalization. What we see over and over again is the thing that consumers most value is speed to content. Connect me to what I most care about as quickly as you can and don't put me into a world of infinite choice with no ability to really get at what is relevant to me when I turn on the television set. And having the ability to filter for what you have watched in the past, what you have recorded, what your friends and family recommend to you, what key reviewers or people in the press you follow by way of recommendations, what is popular and buzzy in the genres you most care about, be able to filter that and immediately any time somebody comes to the television, have the kind of relevance available that gives them immediate access to the choices that would filter to the top.</p><p>We have done some of that already, we have more of that to come this year. And I think really the underpinnings of TiVo in terms of what makes us successful is more and more about how many -- how much data we can process to constantly improve the product.</p><p>There is the Digitalsmiths is a great example of that vast amount of content metadata that we ingest to be able to power the user experience. This personalization data which gets to the individual users predilections for what matters and be able to constantly process and spit that back out. And then thirdly, audience research analytics and the value for advertisers as to what or how that can be relevant to their decisions. And the amount of metadata that are key anchors of the TiVo product when you take all three of those buckets and combined them is really quite extraordinary.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: So there's a lot of elements to the personalization then, right, from getting to the content that matters most in as quick a fashion as possible, having commercials that are relevant, searching for new shows and recommendations I would assume would be an important part of that. And it seems like things like a tablet are a much more personal TV experience than their family TV on the wall.</p><p>TOM ROGERS: I think a lot of the innovation starts with the tablet. You can get it out faster, but what distinguishes us in many respects is how complicated getting it to the set-top box is and the ability, for instance, what is on now, which is what to watch now, which is a key feature on TiVo that takes your favorite channels and tells you movies, sports, other things that are hugely relevant and gets to know which sports teams you care most about and tells you immediately if it is a close game or something and what to go in for.</p><p>And that started on the tablet. We brought it to the TV six months later. And so the set-top box continuing to be -- gives you the main screen experience is something that we consider vital to what we do, but you are right, you can more quickly bring these things to the fore with an iPad.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: And are people using more and more their iPads and their iPhones as a remote control and how they are interacting with the TV and bypassing the traditional mode or is TiVo traditional remote still a really important product?</p><p>TOM ROGERS: I mean, we have that capability, for a remote control on the phone and I think over time that will increasingly become a way people do it. Right now we are just seeing -- it is amazing but in the cable world if you don't have TiVo, there is no way to move a recording which are the things by definition people care most about because most people don't watch, particularly their favorite entertainment as opposed to sports except on a recorded basis.</p><p>And the most -- if you are a cable subscriber and you want to move that stuff to an iPad, you can't do it, you can't move a recording unless you have TiVo. And we are finding the viewing consumption resonating much more than anything else. Remote control is kind of sure, if I have my phone available, I don't need to know where my remote is. But one of the things about TiVo that is unique is people are always misplacing the remote, it is under a couch cushion or something. We have a little button on the TiVo you can push and it sounds the remote so you can find it easier. So that is important but less valued.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: And then bringing it back to financial results. And you are obviously creating more net income, more free cash flow. Where do you see that in evolving over the next few years and maybe then we can talk a little bit about the research and development and where the budget and capital goes on that side.</p><p>TOM ROGERS: Well, we really haven't projected out beyond saying that our expectation is we should be able to do $100 million of the EBITDA this year. But the elements that grow the model are clearly continued penetration of our existing MSO subscribers. We have about -- if you take away our deals with Comcast and DIRECTV, have about 10 million homes in the footprint of the MSOs today that use us as their primary advanced TV solution, we are about 30% penetrated there. But we have substantial upside.</p><p>Digitalsmiths, which has worked with operators that have a footprint of about 65 million homes and they are about 10% penetrated. We think they can get to 50% penetrated or more in the next few years so there is substantial upside there. And both of those are before new deals are brought on board where we have a very substantial pipeline.</p><p>So MSO growth generally coming from those sources we think is a substantial way to power it. We have seen what has in a declining revenue line in the retail business what we saw with the fourth-quarter growth I mentioned and up 40% in retail subs, some opportunity for beginning to look at that line again because of how distinctive the Roamio product is, it is a way to drive additional growth.</p><p>And then the advertising and analytics line of our business, which has been a minor area but one that the market as you can see from rent track stock is being highly valued even with revenue streams that are relatively nascent at this point, we believe that the contribution again core to us being metadata and the capturing of data and having software that uniquely is able to process that data, that that is going to be an increasingly valued component of our overall model and that one we think also has substantial upside.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: And to stay with that media measurement piece and look at the mobile environment, you mentioned using your TiVo from home in your hotel room. Obviously you watch certain programs and probably viewed certain advertisements that advertisers would like to know. Is that the kind of thing that you are measuring these days and is there as large an opportunity on sort of the mobile or portable side as there is in the home?</p><p>TOM ROGERS: Well, there is a number of pieces that advertisers want to know. First, they want to know that you've got a sample size that is really giving them a view, which is where Nielsen's sample was pretty constrained, 20,000 homes. And the more viewing options there are, the more fragmented it becomes, the more important the sample size becomes important.</p><p>Two is the whole cross media and multi-screen element; they don't want to just know what you are watching off the television, they also want a major sample size when it comes to the cross media element.</p><p>Third, they want to understand another point you made, which is on-demand television, if you are not watching a traditional channel but somehow it is an on-demand viewing experience, they want to know what that is. And within all of those what they really want to know is who saw the ad? Because there are different ways of measuring the programming. But we all know that programming and watching a commercial have really become separated in terms of how consumers go about it.</p><p>And one of the key things which really launched our whole analytics approach here is to show, hey, just because somebody has watched a recording doesn't mean they have watched the ad. We all know that is what you do is you fast-forward through the ads. And the thing about the television space is the most highly rated programs, the more highly rated you are as an entertainment show, the more likely you are you going to be recorded and the more likely your commercials are going to be avoided.</p><p>And measuring that since that is the most highly sought after advertising time, the fact that it also has the highest degree of commercial avoidance creates a real issue for the advertiser understanding who is seeing what. And then what we have added to that is it wasn't enough to know who saw what, you had to know what people would purchase based on what they saw or where the swing purchasers were showing up that you could most influence. And we have shown that the return on investment of your marketing dollar when guided by those kind of analytics are far more important than the traditional ways people have bought and sold advertising time, which is age and income demographics and sex demographics.</p><p>And that is I think going to continue to wane as a key means of evaluating media buying and purchasers swing purchasers, competitive purchasers is going to increasingly grow. But being able to show that on a cross media and on-demand basis is critical.</p><p>The kind of analytics we capture I think are going to be uniquely suited to serving that environment. The market hasn't moved there yet, it is going slower than we hoped. Certainly though the market is valuing set-top box data. As Rent Track showed, we think we begin to capture that when it begins to highly value these other forms of advanced analytics, which can really guide marketing decisions.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: And is the right way to think about this that the personalization and the user experience and the data that comes from -- or the services that are enabled by the excellent personalization, will tie in ultimately with the -- what the advertisers want to learn about consumer behavior and ad skipping versus --.</p><p>TOM ROGERS: Yes, it will and they already do. I mean when we capture this information today across several million homes, we know what somebody has watched on a second-by-second basis and then we know exactly what that same household bought. We aren't taking samples and equating, well, this is the characteristic so it is this kind of household and they may have bought these products. We know exactly the viewing and purchasing behavior coming out of that very home. As that begins to be increasingly personalized, the value of that information obviously increases. We are (inaudible) by the way so we know it is the same home. We don't know whose home it is.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Protect your customers' data. That is right. So, Tom, a question I'm sure you get all the time. But with all of the cash that TiVo has accumulated through the performance of the business and just accessing the litigation, what do you think about the cost of carrying that cash and is it something you view as enabling potential M&amp;A, potential return of capital to shareholders, the balance, how do you explain that position to investors these days?</p><p>TOM ROGERS: We said we were going to be cautious and deliberate, and I think we have been. And I think we will continue to be. If I had taken a survey of analysts and said what are the companies we should consider buying, I think I would've gotten a dozen responses and none of them would have been Digitalsmiths. And we looked at a number of companies, turned things inside out and came away with a decision that in terms of a first major purchase, which was only about 10% of our cash on the issue of putting us in business with major operators who weren't in business yet, in terms of something that was accretive but also had substantial long-term growth characteristics, had a software as a service model with the kind of margins that flow from it and was completely strategically consistent with going to the cloud and a TiVo service type offering, it met a lot of characteristics that we said make this a winning M&amp;A opportunity.</p><p>But it was a very cautious and deliberate approach to assessing that. And I think we will continue to do that. Some people get quite ideological about this, you ought to return all of your money to shareholders or, you know what, you guys should not be doing M&amp;A unless there is something truly transformative out there that you should buy and invest and be done with it but make your decision and move on.</p><p>And we have had over $1 billion on our balance sheet really only the last seven, eight months and our view was look, we will return money to shareholders as we have had. We have announced we have increased our authorization to $300 million. We indicated earnings, we were going to execute another $100 million of buy back on top of what we have already done, which has been over $100 million. And I think we have shown a balanced deliberate approach that has been cautious but both which both passed very much geared toward increasing shareholder value in a way that I think the cash is a real strategic asset for us.</p><p>TOM ROGERS: On relationships that you would like to have maybe with technology vendors or others, are there any out there that you are thinking about from a category perspective where you are obviously building great relationship with the MSOs on the sort of the big tech players. Are there anybody out there that you think is interesting that could help TiVo grow to the next level?</p><p>TOM ROGERS: Well, we certainly are constantly evaluating that. We play with a lot of other technology companies and first and foremost when it comes to technology is our own R&amp;D. We have substantial R&amp;D investment. I think one of the interesting things about what we've accomplished in the last year or so is we have never innovated more, we have never done more R&amp;D projects or more implementations for operators yet we've been able to take our R&amp;D down, took it down about 7% last year. We are going to continue to reduce our R&amp;D this year.</p><p>And I think the fact that we can look at a more efficient R&amp;D line with more and more innovation coming out of the pipeline at the same time is a pretty good statement of our feeling that we can handle our technology needs but obviously if there's something out there that we think does it more cheaply or can accelerate our growth and minimize our internal investment, we will take a hard look at it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: And on the R&amp;D side, as you have provided solutions to different carriers they probably become applicable to other carriers. So your toolkit probably grows. How far do you think you've pushed the envelope there on the solutions that TiVo has today relative to your R&amp;D budget? And is the continued ability to scale back and generate more free cash flow and grow the products you have maybe likely for the foreseeable future?</p><p>TOM ROGERS: I think on the domestic US front our efficiencies relative to what we -- the scale of innovation that we bring to an operator has been really phenomenal. We now can get from deal to implementation with an operator in about four months and a $300,000 investment or so. And it is -- when you think -- when an operator sees how quickly we can move the -- I'm not talking about the recurring sub fees -- but just the cost of getting them up and going and ability to roll and the vastness of the change that it means in terms of the technology available to other subscribers, that is a really efficient play.</p><p>And we haven't been able to get to that same level of efficiency internationally, technologies aren't just homogeneous, many different vendor combinations, many different stages of DVR rollout, development and all that makes the customization in those implementations far more R&amp;D and [RE] heavy. But I am hopeful that with the increasing amount moving to the cloud and with that bringing a certain amount of homogeneity to the implementation that we will begin to see some efficiencies on that front as well.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Perfect. Thank you for dividing that between the US and International, that is helpful. I think we have time for a couple of questions if anybody in the audience had anything they wanted to ask Tom while we are together. Okay.</p><p>Well Tom, we talked about a lot of things about TiVo and maybe in closing before closing remarks, maybe you can talk a little bit about the risks in the business and how you see them being mitigated and then whatever you would like to share as we close the session.</p><p>TOM ROGERS: Well, I guess the risks are -- relate most to MSO deployment of what we do. One is certainly the pace of decision-making. That has probably been our biggest frustration. We have moved the marketplace substantially, have won more advanced television accounts than anybody else, but we would have hoped that by now given how operators need to do this with over-the-top cord cutting, other technology threats, that internationally particularly we would have seen a faster pace of making the decisions to get this stuff going to get to market. And so that is a risk, how quickly those decisions are made.</p><p>Certainly another risk is players out there that don't have anywhere near the quality of software solution we have but may have a huge balance sheet even by its standards of what we have on our balance sheet and are able to subsidize hardware decisions even though they have far less robust software capability. Cisco comes to mind. Operators who have to make massive CapEx investment relative to and make that trade off and say, I want to have best-of-breed software but somebody is just making it real attractive for me on the hardware front. You know, that kind of decision-making process is certainly a risk to us.</p><p>But a lot of the risks that people have pointed to for us over the last few years have kind of gone by the wayside and we see a much clearer path to our continued leadership in the MSO front. And that is a good thing but decision-making risks and those competitive risks certainly abound.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Good. We thank you very much for your time today, Tom, I think we are a little bit over. But it was a pleasure speaking with you.</p><p>TOM ROGERS: Thank you for having me, enjoy it, thank you very much.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Thanks for coming.</p><p>[Thomson Financial reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

secrecy encompasses any information that provides an advantage, even if someone is already using it; the only limitation is that it is not general knowledge.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

The deal would combine the two companies into a $146 billion behemoth better poised to compete with market leaders Verizon and AT&amp;T.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But while T-Mobile and Sprint certainly want everyone to feel good about wireless competition, what they're really trying to stoke is fear of China.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The country isn't named in the official announcement, which is full of predictable talk of job creation, \"synergies,\" and scale, scale, scale. You can tell a lot from a document's first line, though, and in this case Sprint and T-Mobile chose to emphasize that the merged company would have the network capacity to deploy 5G technology with a \"breadth and depth critical to extend U.S. global internet leadership.\"</p><p> It only takes an elementary reading between the lines to know they're talking about China. A recent study by CTIA, a U.S.-based wireless association, found that China had a narrow lead in the race to deploy 5G, followed by South Korea in second place. Third place? That would be the good ol' U.S.A.</p><p> Getting scared yet? All the wireless carriers \u2014 not just T-Mobile and Sprint \u2014 hope you are, because if there's broad support to \"beat\" China to 5G, there will be more investment and government funding to create their networks.</p><p> Ultimately, the 5G race is really a matter of months: Both the U.S. and China have already started to develop these networks. But theoretically, whichever country deploys it first will have the most say in the direction it takes.</p><p> The problem is, by focusing on these macroeconomic issues, there's a greater chance regulators and stakeholders will overlook the person they should be keeping top of mind: the consumer.</p><p> The new Red Menace</p><p> This is starting to become an uncomfortable theme in tech these days: The growing call to demonize China and its tech companies with exaggerated fears, then exploiting those fears to push for policy that is fundamentally anticompetitive. Before T-Mobile and Sprint's 5G scare, AT&amp;T responded to government pressure by scuttling a deal to sell phones from Huawei, China's top smartphone manufacturer.</p><p> The U.S. has decided to build its own Great Firewall, with economics instead of tech</p><p> That means, if you live in America, you can't buy the Huawei P20, one of the most innovative phones on the market today thanks to its three-camera system. It also means that not many U.S. companies will be using Huawei network equipment while they deploy 5G, even though there's no evidence to support claims of spyware in their phones or equipment. Huawei USA even employs as its head of cybersecurity a former director for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.</p><p> Mark Zuckerberg was even ready to peddle the anti-China narrative when he testified before Congress. (His notes revealed that one possible defense against breaking up Facebook is the notion that it would strengthen Chinese internet companies.)</p><p> In the case of T-Mobile-Sprint, the China factor is a question on emphasis. Of course, the two companies claim customers will enjoy \"unmatched value\" when they merge, but consumer choice is clearly a secondary question. You only need watch T-Mobile CEO John Legere in this interview with Cheddar to get the real message.</p><p> .@JohnLegere says the T-Mobile and Sprint merger is necessary because only by combining the two companies will they have the resources to build out a broad 5G network in the U.S. #CheddarLIVE pic.twitter.com/BvJ2viPte0</p><p>  \u2014 Cheddar (@cheddar) April 30, 2018</p><p> Here's the key quote from Legere (emphasis added):</p><p> Why now? Why will this get approved? One is the criticality of 5G for the United States and the innovation cycle that's underway that we currently as a nation are behind on.... This is very important policy-wise for the country.</p><p> Translation: Customers? Yeah, they'll be fine, but who cares? We gotta beat China to 5G!</p><p> Don't get me wrong here. China is no U.S. ally, and its track record on human rights is atrocious. State-mandated censorship has resulted in the Great Firewall, with Google and Facebook being banned. And the country is now wielding the incredible power of facial recognition and big data with the zeal of a Black Mirror writer  \u2014 beefing up mass surveillance and assigning every citizen a \"social credit score,\" with real consequences if it creeps too low. The gap in values between China and the West is vast.</p><p> But we can acknowledge China's problems and also be honest about what's really behind Big Tech's newfound concerns about them. This is economic protectionism, essentially a buy-in to a worldview also used as justification for the Trump administration's declared trade war with China, and the controversial tariffs that go along with it.</p><p> Who's afraid of fair competition?</p><p> To be fair, it's true that China has invested heavily in tech in recent years. It clearly wants to be No. 1 in 5G, and the strong link between wireless carriers and the government means it can move quickly on that plan. Chinese internet giants Tencent and Alibaba are two of the most valuable companies in the world. And just last year China announced an ambitious $150 billion vision to become a world leader in artificial intelligence by 2030.</p><p> But the U.S. is no slouch either.  Even absent a T-Mobile-Sprint merger, all the big networks have announced aggressive deployment of 5G, with some trials planned to start this year, and network rollouts coming in 2019. China's commitment to AI is impressive, but so are the investments from all the major tech companies: Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft. And as nice as the Huawei P20 is, the iPhone still owns the high-end smartphone market.</p><p> So why not drop the scare tactics, and just let the market decide who has the best approach? T-Mobile itself \u2014 once left for dead after a failed AT&amp;T merger of 2011 \u2014 is ironically one of the best examples of how fair competition leads to better products and lower prices. But somehow the fear of a technologically influential China means consumer choice comes second.</p><p> That should give everyone pause, but especially the U.S., because it's fundamentally un-American. It used to be the West was confident enough in its own innovations and ideas that it would accept competition in open markets. Instead, we've decided to start building our own version of the Great Firewall, just with economics instead of tech. Maybe this protectionism will work, and in the arenas of 5G, smartphones, and AI, China will lose. But either way, consumers certainly will.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MSHNWS-d952e5206f937290a177aabec69bc98d44ea255f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289C251672A101 MSHNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S76-TKV1-JBCN-40BV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401989</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1099\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Mashable, Inc.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

If approved by regulators, the deal would unite the nation's third- and fourth-largest carriers into a combined entity with subscriber numbers comparable to industry leaders AT&amp;T and Verizon. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The rumored merger has generated skepticism from some industry observers who worry about the creation of another telecom behemoth. But both <person><nameText>Sprint </nameText></person>and T-Mobilehave been losing money consistently, and they argue that they need to combine to take on their larger competitors.</p><p>T-Mobilehas provided a strong argument for the virtues of competition in recent months. Since the beginning of last year, the company has been engaged in an aggressive marketing campaign dubbed its \"uncarrier\" strategy. The goal is to upend the mobile industry, and it's been doing that by eliminating contracts, dropping international roaming charges and offering to pay competitors' customers $650 to switch over.</p><p>The company is also investing heavily to upgrade its infrastructure and expand its high-speed 4G-LTE network.</p><p><person><nameText>Sprint, </nameText></person>AT&amp;T and Verizon have all cut prices in response to T-Mobile's campaign, and they have begun moving away from two-year contracts as well. </p><p>This is the scenario the Justice Department envisioned when it blocked AT&amp;T from buying T-Mobileback in 2011, saying the deal \"would eliminate the important price, quality, product variety, and innovation competition that an independent T-Mobilebrings to the marketplace.\"</p><p>So far, T-Mobile's efforts have paid off in the form of increased market share. The company said last month that it added a record 2.4 million subscribers in the first three months of this year, its fourth consecutive quarter with over 1 million total net additions. </p><p>But these efforts have come at the cost of narrowing margins and widening losses. T-Mobilefinished the first quarter with a loss of $151 million, up from $20 million in the last three months of 2013.</p><p>\"They can't continue this forever because it will cost them too much money, so the question is what's next,\" said industry analyst Jeff Kagan.</p><p>Some analysts see the carrier's recent moves as an effort to boost its asking price in a potential acquisition. T-MobileCEO <person><nameText>John Legere </nameText></person>said last month that consolidation in the industry was \"a matter of when and not if,\" and that his company could benefit from the additional scale and assets a merger would offer.</p><p>Masayoshi Son, CEO of <person><nameText>Sprint </nameText></person>parent SoftBank, calls the U.S. wireless industry a duopoly, and says sustainable competition will emerge only with a third strong competitor. </p><p><person><nameText>Sprint </nameText></person>and T-Mobiledid not respond to requests for comment. </p><p>The merger proposal has yet to be officially announced, but antitrust officials already have a lot on their plates. </p><p>AT&amp;T announced last month that it hopes to buy America's biggest satellite television provider, DirecTV, in a deal worth almost $50 billion. Comcast, meanwhile, is trying to acquire Time Warner Cable, a $45 billion deal that would create the country's dominant provider of television channels and Internet connections.</p><p>\"So much is in flux,\" Kagan said. \"The industry is changing, and regulators now have to look at it from a new perspective.\"</p><p>Akshay Sharma, an analyst with Gartner, said the Justice Department would likely look more favorably on <person><nameText>Sprint's </nameText></person>bid for T-Mobilethan AT&amp;T's failed effort from a few years ago, given <person><nameText>Sprint's </nameText></person>smaller size. </p><p>Should the deal fall through, T-Mobilecould prove an attractive acquisition target for another big tech company like DISH Network or an overseas carrier.

If approved by regulators, the deal would unite the nation's third- and fourth-largest carriers into a combined entity with subscriber numbers comparable to industry leaders AT&amp;T and Verizon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The rumored merger has generated skepticism from some industry observers who worry about the creation of another telecom behemoth. But both <person><nameText>Sprint </nameText></person>and T-Mobilehave been losing money consistently, and they argue that they need to combine to take on their larger competitors.</p><p>T-Mobilehas provided a strong argument for the virtues of competition in recent months. Since the beginning of last year, the company has been engaged in an aggressive marketing campaign dubbed its \"uncarrier\" strategy. The goal is to upend the mobile industry, and it's been doing that by eliminating contracts, dropping international roaming charges and offering to pay competitors' customers $650 to switch over.</p><p>The company is also investing heavily to upgrade its infrastructure and expand its high-speed 4G-LTE network.</p><p><person><nameText>Sprint, </nameText></person>AT&amp;T and Verizon have all cut prices in response to T-Mobile's campaign, and they have begun moving away from two-year contracts as well.</p><p>This is the scenario the Justice Department envisioned when it blocked AT&amp;T from buying T-Mobileback in 2011, saying the deal \"would eliminate the important price, quality, product variety, and innovation competition that an independent T?Mobile brings to the marketplace.\"</p><p/><p>So far, T-Mobile's efforts have paid off in the form of increased market share. The company said last month that it added a record 2.4 million subscribers in the first three months of this year, its fourth consecutive quarter with over 1 million total net additions.</p><p>But these efforts have come at the cost of narrowing margins and widening losses. T-Mobilefinished the first quarter with a loss of $151 million, up from $20 million in the last three months of 2013.</p><p>\"They can't continue this forever because it will cost them too much money, so the question is what's next,\" said industry analyst Jeff Kagan.</p><p>Some analysts see the carrier's recent moves as an effort to boost its asking price in a potential acquisition. T-MobileCEO <person><nameText>John Legere </nameText></person>said last month that consolidation in the industry was \"a matter of when and not if,\" and that his company could benefit from the additional scale and assets a merger would offer.</p><p>Masayoshi Son, CEO of <person><nameText>Sprint </nameText></person>parent SoftBank, calls the U.S. wireless industry a duopoly, and says sustainable competition will emerge only with a third strong competitor.</p><p><person><nameText>Sprint </nameText></person>and T-Mobiledid not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>The merger proposal has yet to be officially announced, but antitrust officials already have a lot on their plates.</p><p>AT&amp;T announced last month that it hopes to buy America's biggest satellite television provider, DirecTV, in a deal worth almost $50 billion. Comcast, meanwhile, is trying to acquire Time Warner Cable, a $45 billion deal that would create the country's dominant provider of television channels and Internet connections.</p><p>\"So much is in flux,\" Kagan said. \"The industry is changing, and regulators now have to look at it from a new perspective.\"</p><p>Akshay Sharma, an analyst with Gartner, said the Justice Department would likely look more favorably on <person><nameText>Sprint's </nameText></person>bid for T-Mobilethan AT&amp;T's failed effort from a few years ago, given <person><nameText>Sprint's </nameText></person>smaller size.</p><p>Should the deal fall through, T-Mobilecould prove an attractive acquisition target for another big tech company like DISH Network or an overseas carrier.

It's a major reversal for a company with a history of failed acquisitions, including previous takeover attempts from AT&amp;T and Sprint.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Not that long ago, we thought T-Mobile was going to get acquired and leave town,\" real estate developer and former Bellevue City Councilman Kevin Wallace said. \"Now they are the acquirer and they've made a long-term commitment to their Bellevue headquarters. It's such a remarkable turnaround.\"</p><p>T-Mobile said the company doesn't have specifics to share about which teams will be located where, but has said that the company will operate two headquarters.</p><p>The company's recent real estate moves, however, suggest Bellevue will remain the center of gravity for the combined T-Mobile.</p><p>T-Mobile is working on a $160 million renovation of the company's corporate headquarters in the Factoria neighborhood and extended leases for the space through 2030. The company has also been the main driver of real estate demand along the Interstate 90 corridor and has inked major leases in the past year outside of its headquarters office.</p><p>\"All of their real estate actions to date indicate T-Mobile is cementing its footprint in Bellevue,\" said Gary Guenther, a Kidder Mathews senior vice president and partner who tracks the Bellevue market. \"They're putting a lot of time and money into renovation for recruiting and retention purposes.\"</p><p>The decision ends some of the uncertainty created by the merger discussions. Employees are less likely to make big life decisions such as buying a home or starting a family during such uncertainty, and they are more likely to lose focus or search for a new job elsewhere.</p><p>While the conclusion of the merger may help to relieve uncertainty for employees, Guenther said it's not likely to result in a significant wave of new Bellevue-based workers or homebuyers.</p><p>\"Big tech firms coming into the area will have a much bigger impact on housing and affordability than the merger,\" he said. \"Employees of T-Mobile might be happy to have this in the rearview mirror, but T-Mobile is already established. It may grow by increments, but the big wave we're going to be seeing on the Eastside will be from Amazon, Facebook and Google.\"</p><p>Amazon, Facebook and Google are expanding in cities all across the Eastside. Most recently, Amazon disclosed plans to build a 1 million-square-foot tower in Bellevue.</p><p>While there are concerns that the merger may lead to layoffs, Broderick Group Principal Grant Yerke said T-Mobile's expansion \"relieves any anxiety that a merger will result in job cuts in our area.\"</p><p>The combined company hasn't disclosed how it will operate two separate headquarters. Sprint tried that once before and it didn't work out.</p><p>When Sprint acquired Nextel in 2004 for $35 billion, the companies planned dual headquarters. Nextel's campus in Reston, Virginia, became the combined company's executive headquarters while Sprint's campus in Overland Park, Kansas, served as its operations headquarters.</p><p>Less than three years later, the two headquarters merged. Former Sprint Nextel Corp. CEO Dan Hesse at the time said the dual headquarters hampered teamwork and the integration of the companies' culture, increased travel and real estate costs and \"hurt our ability to execute well in the marketplace.\"</p><p>T-Mobile CEO John Legere once told a group of Sprint employees he'd rather live in Kansas City, but later walked back those comments.</p><p>\"For me right now, it's to remove the fear by people in Kansas City that we have a gigantic campus in Bellevue that's about to be renovated, for 10 years, it's an incredible piece,\" he said. \"And we've got to acknowledge that we've got something there that we need and that we want - and, by the way, is a place that people like to live, right? And that we can attract and retain employees, too.\"</p><p>T-Mobile in 2018 had 51,787 employees, including 7,807 in Washington state, and reported more than $43 billion in revenue. The company in November said it had increased its headcount inside the Factoria campus by more than 56 percent in the past five years to more than 6,200 employees, excluding retail employees. The company employs 8,100 people in the Puget Sound region, also excluding retail employees.</p><p>Guenther, the Kidder Mathews partner, said it's unlikely T-Mobile will move a significant amount of employees to Kansas.</p><p>\"I don't know much about Overland Park, Kansas, but I can't imagine they have the talent they have, although it probably has an affordability advantage,\" he said. \"T-Mobile's corporate real estate decisions feels like it's planning to continue to grow in this area.\"</p><p>Did you find this article useful?

Moody\u2019s currently gives Italy a Baa2 rating, its second lowest \u201cinvestment grade\u201d rating.</p><p>Just the threat of a downgrade is likely to increase pressure on Italy\u2019s government.</p><p>Its leaders proposed policies that are aimed at raising Italy\u2019s anemic economic growth rate. But the measures could also weaken the government\u2019s finances and bring it into sharp conflict with other countries in the European Union. Italy\u2019s public debt <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/italy-debt-cenbank/italy-2017-debt-to-gdp-ratio-fell-0-5-points-vs-2016-central-bank-idUSR1N1NM014\">is equivalent</url> to 132 percent of its gross domestic product, a relatively high level.</p><p>Moody\u2019s said two main concerns drove its decision. The ratings agency said there was a \u201csignificant risk of a material weakening in Italy\u2019s fiscal strength, given the fiscal plans of the new coalition government.\u201d Moody\u2019s also said there was a risk that overhauls aimed at making Italy\u2019s economy more efficient might now stall.</p><p>Yields on Italian government bonds, which move in the opposite direction to their price, have spiked higher in recent days. Italy\u2019s 10-year government bond had a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GBTPGR10:IND\">yield of 2.46 percent on Friday</url>, up from 1.79 percent at the end of April. The Wall Street Journal on Friday       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/hedge-funds-raise-bets-against-italy-bond-yields-soar-1527255926\">reported that investors</url> have upped their bets against the bonds.</p><p>- Peter Eavis</p><p>The problem with problems in Europe is that they can drag on for so long.</p><p>The Greek debt crisis has been a confidence-sapping, multi-year saga that is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f72a2d14-4888-11e8-8ee8-cae73aab7ccb\">still not over</url>, while tensions over Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union could persist beyond the official exit date in March next year. And the big question now: How long might a battle between the European Union and Italy\u2019s new government last?</p><p>Italy\u2019s leaders are proposing fiscal policies that could bring it <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eurozone-italy-budget/eu-tells-italy-to-cut-debt-eyes-market-pressure-idUSKCN1IO1F0\">into confrontation with other countries in the E.U.</url> Italian government bonds have sold off, and the nervousness has started to weigh on the bonds of Spain, Portugal and Greece. Rising interest rates could dampen an economic recovery in Europe that has already appeared to have lost some steam.</p><p>There are ways in which the \u201cItalian problem\u201d might get dealt with swiftly. The country\u2019s government bonds may get such a pounding in the markets that the new government backtracks from policies that put it at loggerheads with the E.U. And, as analysts at the Peterson Institute for International Economics <url normalizedValue=\"https://piie.com/blogs/realtime-economic-issues-watch/how-worried-should-we-be-about-italian-debt-crisis\">note</url>, Italy\u2019s government may struggle to get its fiscal policies through the country\u2019s own parliament:</p><p>But even if Italy\u2019s government backed away from its policies, the country\u2019s problems \u2014 a high debt load and a sluggish economy \u2013 would remain. It might thus only be a matter of time before Italy again attempts to stand up to the E.U. Some analysts might contend that Italy should soldier on with orthodox, fiscally responsible policies and become more like Spain, whose economy has done well in recent years. But, as Ben Chu, economics editor of The Independent, asserted on Twitter, Italy\u2019s governments in recent years have not been profligate.</p><p>And the fact that Italy is not Greece presents the European Union with an opportunity. The bloc could give Italy some leeway on fiscal policy and take seriously its government\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-politics-economy-policy-factbox/factbox-economic-proposals-in-italys-5-star-league-government-pact-idUSKCN1IJ1IF\">desire to tap</url> the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://ec.europa.eu/esf/home.jsp\">European Social Fund</url>, a special pool of E.U. money whose aim is to bolster employment. Of course, any time a country wants to bend the European Union\u2019s rules or push back against its policies, it is accused of wanting to have its cake and eat it, too. But sometimes the complexity and depth of Europe\u2019s underlying problems require more compromise than the E.U. is willing or able to make. After Greece\u2019s trials and Britain\u2019s vote to leave the bloc, Europe\u2019s leaders now may want to shake free of some of its built-in constraints and offer Italy something early on.</p><p>- Peter Eavis</p><p>Smart speakers are listening in. Can we control what\u2019s done with the things they hear?</p><p>Something like this was bound to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kiro7.com/news/local/woman-says-her-amazon-device-recorded-private-conversation-sent-it-out-to-random-contact/755507974\">happen</url>: Unbeknown to its owners, an Amazon Echo recorded a couple\u2019s conversation, then sent it to someone on their contact list. But even with sweeping new data laws going into effect in Europe, it\u2019s unclear exactly how the use of data gobbled up by such devices will be regulated.</p><p>Amazon <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.recode.net/2018/5/24/17391480/amazon-alexa-woman-secret-recording-echo-explanation\">blamed</url> the new invasion of privacy on an improbable chain of events. Alexa, says the company, woke up when it thought it heard its name in a conversation taking place between the husband and wife in Portland. Then, it took action upon hearing a \u201csend message\u201d request, the name of a friend, and finally a confirmatory \u201cright,\u201d in that order. Minutes later, an employee of the husband received an audio recording of the couple\u2019s conversation.</p><p>Ultimately, the incident wasn\u2019t as awkward as it might\u2019ve been \u2014 the couple was discussing hardwood flooring. But it raises questions about the accuracy of the A.I. assistants on these devices, what they do with your data, and how that might be regulated.</p><p>Anyone who has used an Amazon Echo (or Google Home, or Apple HomePod) knows that their interfaces can be unreliable. While artificial intelligence has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/magazine/the-great-ai-awakening.html\">made bounds in recent years</url>, voice recognition is complex, and strange accents, muffled voices, and external noise can lead to mistakes. That means misfires \u2014 like the ones Amazon pointed to \u2014 can and do happen.</p><p>Misidentification of a wake word by a device \u2014 on Amazon\u2019s, that\u2019s \u201cAlexa\u201d by default \u2014 automatically sends data to the company\u2019s servers. Why? Because the small speakers don\u2019t have the computing power required to make sense of entire sentences, so that must be done on the cloud.</p><p>You can\u2019t turn off the always-listening feature of these devices, because, if you could, they wouldn\u2019t be able to respond to your voice, rendering them useless. But misidentification of words can, according to Amazon, set in motion a chain of events that are troubling from a privacy perspective.</p><p>The question: What happens to that data? And what should these devices be able to do with it?</p><p>In answer to the first question: It will stay on the servers of tech companies indefinitely. (Unless you choose to delete, which isn\u2019t too hard. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-echo-and-google-home-voice-data-delete/\">Here\u2019s how</url>.) And once it\u2019s on those servers, it can be       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603380/alexa-gives-amazon-a-powerful-data-advantage/\">used by engineers</url> to tune their artificial intelligence algorithms so that they can better understand your voice commands in future.</p><p>Did you know all that? Maybe not. While companies like Amazon do explain in their terms of service that user data will be stored on servers and used to improve their products, it\u2019s perfectly possible to start using such a device in your home without being alerted to the fact. Data privacy is weakly regulated in the U.S., and there\u2019s no rule that demands Alexa tell you through its speaker what it will do with your data. So many people remain unaware of how their data is being used.</p><p>In Europe, that should change Friday, with t<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/24/technology/europe-gdpr-privacy.html\">he introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation</url> \u2014 a set of strict data privacy rules that will be enforced across the entire E.U., with harsh penalties for organizations that don\u2019t comply. In theory, the rules could mean that smart speakers have to somehow tell consumers about their information collection\u2014what\u2019s being recorded, how it\u2019s being used, where it\u2019s being stored, and whether it\u2019s being secured, for instance.</p><p>Responding to a request for details about the ways in which Amazon is making its Echo devices G.D.P.R.-compliant, a spokesperson told DealBook:</p><p>A spokesman for Google told DealBook that any requests made to the company\u2019s Home devices are treated in much the same way as the search data that is stored about users. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.blog.google/topics/public-policy/our-preparations-europes-new-data-protection-law/\">In a blog post about its preparations for G.D.P.R.</url>, the company points out that \u201cnothing is changing\u201d about the way the firm collects or processes such data in order for it be compliant with the new rules.</p><p>So, that\u2019s Europe. What about the U.S.? Big tech firms \u2014 in particular, Facebook \u2014 say they are responding to those new European rules with policies that will also apply in America. The same is likely to be true of smart speakers.</p><p>But for now, the best way to control what\u2019s done with your data is to regularly delete the audio recorded by the devices, and opt out of any arrangement that allows the companies to use it to improve their services.</p><p>\u2014 Jamie Condliffe</p><p>What\u2019s happened since Europe\u2019s new data rules went into action</p><p>We\u2019re not even a full day into a new era in which the E.U.\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/24/technology/europe-gdpr-privacy.html\">General Data Protection Regulation</url>clamps down on what organizations do with the data of European citizens. But it\u2019s already causing headaches. So far:</p><p> Some U.S. news outlets have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/25/business/media/europe-privacy-gdpr-us.html\">blocked European readers</url></p><p> A nonprofit has <url normalizedValue=\"https://noyb.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/pa_forcedconsent_en.pdf\">filed official complaints</url> about Google, Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram with E.U. privacy regulators</p><p> Read-it-later app Instapaper is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/40577170/instapaper-is-blocking-european-users-because-of-gdpr\">currently not accessible</url> by European users</p><p>It\u2019d take the average worker 275 years to earn a C.E.O.\u2019s annual pay</p><p>It\u2019s not surprising to hear that many C.E.O.s are handsomely paid \u2014 Doug McMillon of Walmart, for example, earned $22 million last year. (That said, the $102 million collected by Frank Bisignano of the credit card processor First Data is still eye-popping.)</p><p>But now corporate America is required to disclose pay ratios, which reveal how the C.E.O.\u2019s pay stacks up to that of median workers. (The median ratio is 275.) Here\u2019s what the NYT uncovered as part of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/25/business/highest-paid-ceos-2017.html?dlbk\">its annual executive pay report</url>:</p><p> The median Walmart employee would need 1,188 years to match Mr. McMillon\u2019s 2017 compensation.</p><p> At Live Nation, it would take 2,893 years.</p><p> At Time Warner, it\u2019s a comparatively low 651 years.</p><p>The caveats: Some companies reporting high ratios rely on overseas workers who earn far less than counterparts in the U.S. Some reporting low ratios achieve high median incomes by outsourcing labor. And many C.E.O. pay packages rely on stock, which could make their payouts smaller \u2014 or much larger \u2014 in the end.</p><p>A day few in Hollywood thought possible</p><p>The once-untouchable Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/24/nyregion/harvey-weinstein-arrest-new-york.html?dlbk\">turned himself in</url> to Manhattan police today. The NYT reports was charged with rape and a first-degree criminal sex act, continuing a downfall that led to a global reckoning with sexual harassment and assault.</p><p>As part of a bail package negotiated in advance, Mr. Weinstein will have to put up $1 million in cash, surrender his passport and agree to wear an ankle-monitoring device. But the charges may not be the last against him, according to the NYT:</p><p>The fallout from the #MeToo movement hasn\u2019t stopped yet. The actor Morgan Freeman apologized after <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/24/movies/morgan-freeman-sexual-harassment.html\">several women accused him of sexual harassment</url>.</p><p>Fiat Chrysler: Don\u2019t use cruise control</p><p>Fiat Chrysler <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/25/us/ap-us-fiat-chrysler-stuck-cruise-control.html\">is recalling 4.8 million vehicles in the United States</url>, saying in rare circumstances drivers may not be able to turn off the cruise control, the Associated Press reports.</p><p>The auto maker warned owners not to use cruise control until the cars, S.U.V.s and trucks can be fixed with a software update. The recall includes 15 Jeep, Dodge, Chrysler and Ram models from six model years.</p><p>PHOTO:  (PHOTOGRAPH BY Charles Sykes/Associated Press FOR THE NEW YORK
