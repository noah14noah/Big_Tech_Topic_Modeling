If it works, it could potentially save you money and give you new ways to watch television.</p><p>The proposal aims to increase the number of companies that build and sell set-top boxes, injecting competition into the industry. Whether it's big tech firms like Apple or small, independent developers, the new rules could make it easier for some to challenge the cable industry - and lower your cable bill.</p><p>It would allow non-cable companies to make new set-top boxes, customizing search functions, menu designs and other aspects of the user interface that consumers might not currently enjoy from their provider, officials say.</p><p>Right now, most people rent their boxes directly from their cable or satellite TV providers, to the tune of $20 billion a year, according to the Federal Communications Commission. Consumers pay, on average, about $20 a month to rent their boxes from cable providers, a congressional probe found last year.</p><p>\"Ninety-nine percent of pay-TV subscribers are chained to their set-top boxes because cable and satellite operators have locked up the market, according to an agency fact sheet released Wednesday.</p><p>The proposal from FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler would require operators to behave differently in several ways. In general, they'd have to provide much of the information that their own set-top boxes already rely on to other companies. That includes everything related to a cable firm's channel line-up - such as which networks appear on which channels, and what programming can be found there.</p><p>Cable providers will also have to relay basic data about privileges and permissions, such as whether a device can record shows for later playback. And, of course, the companies will have to make the actual shows available to third party devices, as well.</p><p>This isn't the first time the FCC has tried to crack open the set-top box. But changes in technology are demanding new approaches to the issue, senior FCC officials told reporters Wednesday.</p><p>The cable industry's supporters are opposed to this move, lashing out at what it views as government overreach and a threat to consumers. Many of them joined a new group that launched Wednesday called the Future of TV coalition.</p><p>\"Innovation and competition should drive the creative marketplace, not government mandates that have the potential to undermine and impede the best TV market in the world, the group said in a release.</p><p>The FCC's proposal will be voted on at its Feb. 18 meeting. If it's approved, it will open up a proceeding to allow for public feedback before the rules are finalized during a later vote.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHRGAZ-2016028552</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHRGAZ2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HYJ-G621-JCB7-14WV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">146813</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-01-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"454\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Charleston Newspapers</copyright><publicationName>Charleston Gazette-Mail</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"01\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>January 28, 2016, Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Communications Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEQxMkU0NzE2OEE2NDIxNEE3QzU0NjU2MDRERUNGNDE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Jurisdiction</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODg0OUQ4QzVBOTdFNDY2RTlBN0YwQTVBNjA4NDVGRTU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODRCNkU5NTg3RTNGNDUzMUFEREU0RURCMTEwMDNDMUE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RE3</classCode><className>CABLE SYSTEM REGULATION</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QTZGRjRGMTBDNjBFNDQ3NDk4Qjc1MUMwRTRDNDMyNjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzNFQTlENUZGNUIyNEUyMzhEOEZFNUEzNzYzNEE4Qzg</classCode><className>Cable Systems</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008WWI</classCode><className>ENERGY &amp;

More direct streaming from the likes of HBO and Netflix, more services like Apple TV and Amazon Fire, and more innovative devices from Roku boxes to wall-size smart TVs with cross-platform search.</p><p>The revolution that is allowing television and video to serve the multicultural world that is the America we celebrate has birthed new and diverse voices like my network - Crossings TV - that offers hyper-local programming in six different languages throughout the United States. </p><p>Yet worrisome new federal regulations proposed by FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, with the support of large technology companies such as Google, have thrown a dark cloud over this revolution - one that could deprive many communities of the tailored, in-language program options we have worked so hard to provide. </p><p>Under the FCC's proposed new rules (known commonly as \"AllVid\" after an earlier industry lobbying effort the Obama administration rejected in 2010), big technology companies such as Google would be given the right to poach the program license deals we negotiate with pay TV providers like DirecTV or Time Warner Cable without being bound to the underlying license terms that help fund our networks and ensure they get enough exposure to thrive. </p><p>The FCC chairman says the rule is intended to create competition for set-top box devices. He argues that exempting these companies from the obligation to negotiate for rights will enable them to focus on developing new boxes to repackage your existing programming and place it alongside the more underfunded internet video in a single cross-platform search.  </p><p>Leaving aside that the rationale for this giveaway to Big Tech is totally undermined by the fact that smart TVs and other home gateways already provide cross-platform search, there is a compelling reason to oppose the AllVid mandate: it will likely bring us less diversity, not more, in television's golden age. </p><p>Today, small and niche networks like mine can negotiate for channel placement they think will help them be seen by their target audience and can cross-promote with other networks to gain exposure from potential fans.  </p><p>But the Wheeler \"AllVid\" rule directly attacks that crucial system and allows tech firms to disregard negotiated terms such as channel placement, digital rights and much else. </p><p>The FCC should step back. Putting a thumb on the scale in favor of technology giants so that they can sell more ads, track our viewing habits and bury diversity programming hardly seems to be part of the progressive legacy this FCC should leave. </p><p>Frank Washington is the CEO of Crossings TV.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUFNEW-435676</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUFNEW2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5JYD-P441-DY37-D0GN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8391</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"454\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The Buffalo News All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Buffalo News (New York)</publicationName><edition>Buffalo News Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"06\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>June 7, 2016 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Opinion</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Another Voice</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001042</classCode><className>LOBBYING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009JXS</classCode><className>ARTS &amp;

What Is Computerized CBE? No More Classrooms, No More 'Credit Hours' As I have documented[4] in several articles[5], 'CBE' is a euphemism for educational methods that deploy computer modules based on Harvard Psychologist B. F. Skinner's 'teaching machines,' which implement operant-conditioning methods to 'shape' student learning into 'competent' behaviors geared toward college or career readiness. The terms 'competency-based education' and 'CBE' are used 147 times in the new Proposed Rules for 85 FR 18638[6], which is a total of 64 pages long. </p><p>Compare this to the 392-pages of federal legislation that cover the entire Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA[7]), which only contains 6 references to 'competency-based education.' According to Skinnerian CBE advocates, competency-based computer learning at home is better than human instruction in a classroom because the one-to-one student/computer ratio enables each student to learn at his or her own pace. 85 FR 18638[8] states 'CBE programs . . . measure student progress based on their demonstration of specific competencies rather than sitting in a seat or at a computer for a prescribed period of time. Many CBE programs are designed to permit students to learn at their own pace.' Stated differently, when a student enrolled in CBE courseware is ready to move on to the next lesson, he or she can click on the next learning module without having to wait for the teacher to deliver the next lecture. And if a CBE student is not ready to move on to the next virtual lesson, he or she can remediate by repeating the same digital learning module without being 'left behind' when the teacher moves on to the next lecture. 'Subscription-Based' Distance Learning, Pay-as-You-Go To facilitate 'self-paced' CBE learning, online education corporations and other software companies are offering 'subscription-based' e-learning services that enroll students on a pay-as-you-go basis. These self-paced CBE courses allow a student to 'subscribe' for enrollment into virtual-learning modules which can be rolled over with monthly subscription fees for as long or as soon as it takes for the student to demonstrate 'competency' in the course. Now that basically every US school has converted to virtual 'distance learning' through computers, 85 FR 18638 is attempting to loosen federal requirements for self-paced CBE courseware so that online education corporations can rake in federal funding for delivering more subscription-based 'competency' lessons through digital platforms: Current regulations require an institution to evaluate a student's pace of completion by dividing completed credits over attempted credits. This calculation is difficult to apply in competency-based programs, including subscription-based programs, because there is often no set period of time during which a student 'attempts' a competency in such programs; rather, the student works on a competency until he or she can demonstrate mastery of it. Given the limitations in this proposed definition on a student's eligibility to receive additional disbursements [of federal funds], we believe it is unnecessary and needlessly burdensome for an institution's SAP policy to include pace requirements for subscription-based programs. In other words, these new (de)regulations will relax the legal requirements for online education corporations to receive federal funds, such as financial aid grants, as payments for students' CBE subscription fees. It should be noted that 'subscription-based' e-learning is referenced 112 times in these new Proposed Rules. Adaptive Learning = Post-Human Artificial Intelligence As I have documented[9] in numerous articles, self-paced CBE subscriptions and 'adaptive-learning' software basically go hand in hand. CBE 'courseware' subscriptions 'personalize' lessons for students through 'adaptive-learning' computers, which are nothing less than modern digitalized versions of the 'Skinner box,' or 'teaching machine[10].' Adaptive-learning software revamps B. F. Skinner's 'programmed instruction' with 'artificial intelligence' that automates 'stimulus-response' methods of educational psychology to train students for academic and career 'competences.' Essentially, adaptive-learning courseware enables 'self-paced' learning because the psychological-conditioning software 'adapts' its lessons based on how the student 'responds' to the virtual 'stimuli,' such as multiple-choice or short-answer modules on digital windows. The faster the student responds with correct answers, the faster the learning stimuli will progress the student towards full 'competence' at the end of the subscription-based course's module sequence. Incentivizing broader enrollment in subscription-based adaptive-learning courseware, 85 FR 18638[11] expands the definition of accreditable 'academic engagement' as 'participation by a student in . . . an online course with an opportunity for interaction or an interactive tutorial, webinar, or other interactive computer-assisted instruction. . . . Such interaction could include the use of artificial intelligence or other adaptive learning tools.' Under this revised definition of 'academic engagement,' schools will be given expanded flexibility to accredit a vast range of self-paced CBE curriculums delivered by online education companies through adaptive-learning AI that programs students with operant-conditioning algorithms. Moreover, 'academic engagement' is being further expanded to give adaptive CBE courseware the green light to phase out certain requirements for human instruction: '[a]ctive engagement . . . could include the use of artificial intelligence or other adaptive learning tools so that the student is receiving feedback from technology-mediated instruction. The interaction need not be exclusively with a human instructor.' Indeed, adaptive AI can deliver 'feedback' on student learning through 'direct assessment[12],' which is referenced 226 times in the new Proposed Rules. Of course, in a bankrupt economy where people are locked down under emergency pandemic pretenses, such adaptive AI courseware will be more convenient since the software can be available for the student 24-hours a day (unlike a human teacher). In addition, the non-human AI bots will be much cheaper than human instructors who need to be fed and housed. So it looks like the proposed (de)regulations will set up incentives which will ensure that the virtual-learning industry is able to swallow up federal education funds while public brick-and-mortar schools and human teachers are starved out into obsolescence. Sweeping Deregulation of Artificial Intelligence: AI Will Make Decisions for You To be sure, AI adaptive-learning algorithms are evolving faster than legislators can deliberate on new regulations for such new 'machine learning' innovations. Thus, to get out of the way of 'progress,' 85 FR 18638[13] is basically writing a blank check for AI corporations to sell schools and students new e-learning products and ed-tech 'updates' without preliminary regulatory permission from the federal government: [t]he current regulations [which] do not address subscription-based programs or consider programs made possible through artificial intelligence-driven adaptive learning. . . . Because of the time it takes to implement new regulations, it is unlikely that the Department will be able to keep pace with developing technologies and other innovations in real time. These proposed regulations attempt to remove barriers that institutions face when trying to create and implement new and innovative ways of providing education to students, and also provide sufficient flexibility to ensure that future innovations we cannot yet anticipate have an opportunity to move forward without undue risk of a negative program finding or other sanction on an institution. To put it another way, AI-learning algorithms evolve faster than legislators can regulate, so these new federal rules will 'remove barriers' to AI ed-tech progress by allowing educational institutions the 'flexibility' to rubber stamp new AI courseware programs without prior regulatory approval from the US Department of Ed. But if the federal government allows AI ed-tech to develop faster than Congress can regulate, then the Department of Ed will render itself into a mere ceremonial bureaucracy that has abdicated its authority to AI algorithms, which means artificial intelligence will be in the driver's seat taking control of the future of education policy as virtual distance learning becomes the mainstream mode of schooling in a post-corona economy. It should be noted that Edgar McCulloch, who is a Government Relations representative of the IBM Corporation[14], sat on the 'Accreditation and Innovation negotiating committee' involved in the proposal of these new federal rules. This is worth noting because IBM develops AI ed-tech through its Watson artificial-intelligence[15] program which partners with the globalist Pearson Education LLC[16]: the 'world's largest education company,' which also runs online schooling companies including Connections Academy. How much stimulus money will be vacuumed up by online education corporations and AI courseware companies under these new federal rules? Will brick-and-mortar schools be able to survive in a post-corona economy in which people are either heavily travel restricted or too poor to pay for school buildings and human employees? Will human teachers, or even human ethics, survive in a world in which the total deregulation of technocratic advancement exalts AI as the judge, jury, and executioner[17] of human learning?

The vision, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said, is to make sending cash as quick and easy as sending someone a photo.</p><p>Banking regulators across the globe were quick to comment on Libra, saying the new currency would require their oversight.

one platform to another, according to Axios, which first reported news of the Dashboard Act Sunday.<br/>\"If you have data portability, it could open things up quite a bit,\" said French Caldwell, CFO of The Analyst Syndicate, an IT research and analysis group based in Washington, D.C.<br/>\"It would allow you to easily move your data from a player like Facebook to a new competitor,\" he told TechNewsWorld.<br/>How easy -- or frictionless -- the companies will make it to move data among platforms will be a thorny issue should the bill become law.<br/>\"I doubt it's going to be made real easy to do,\" Caldwell said.<br/>What's more, portability can only have an impact on the competitive landscape if there are competitors to take the data to.<br/>\"Many of the large tech companies effectively purchase their competitors,\" observed Kendra Albert, clinical instructor at the Cyberlaw Clinic at Harvard University's Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society in Cambridge, Massachusetts.<br/>\"Data portability is all well and good and could foster competition, but it doesn't work if there are no effective competitors in the market because they keep getting purchased by the larger companies,\" Albert told TechNewsWorld.<br/>Wrong AssumptionsMore information about how companies gather data would provide greater benefit to consumers than how much money they make off it, Albert also noted. \"Knowing what your data is worth doesn't get you much when there's effectively no competition in particular services.\"<br/>The idea that consumers are getting a rotten deal when they give up their data for free services is wrong, maintained Daniel Castro, director of the Center for Data Innovation of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a research and public policy organization in Washington, D.C.<br/>\"While data may have value, 'paying' for a service with data is not the same as paying with money,\" he explained.<br/>\"Unlike money, consumers do not have less data after sharing personal information, and they can share that same data with other services as well,\" Castro pointed out. \"On the contrary, for most commercial services, consumers always come out ahead by sharing data in exchange for a free service.\"<br/>The legislation would make companies go through an expensive process of trying to assign a value to each user, an activity that almost certainly would irritate consumers -- even if required by the government.<br/>\"In no other sector does the government require businesses to reveal which customers are most valuable to them,\" Castro said. \"Further, if Congress wants to require this disclosure, it should extend it to businesses of all sizes, as well as political campaigns.\"<br/>Provisions in the proposed law that direct the SEC to develop a methodology for calculating data value, its sources for data collection, and how the company safeguards the data \"are all reasonable and should be the basis for any bill that moves forward,\" he added.<br/>The Value HangupAs things stand now, the tech companies know the value of the data they're collecting and consumers don't know that value, said Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group, an advisory services firm in Bend, Oregon.<br/>\"Typically, when one side knows the value of something and the other side doesn't, then the side that doesn't know the value of that thing gets cheated,\" he told TechNewsWorld.<br/>The problem with this bill is the companies will be doing the valuations, and \"there's nothing to stop the company from undervaluing the asset,\" Enderle said. \"This bill needs a stronger process for setting the value of information so it does not excessively advantage the vendor.\"<br/>However, the chances of the bill becoming law are low, he predicted. \"Congress doesn't know enough about these issues, and when people don't know enough about something, they're likely to hold to the status quo.\"<br/>However, the bill could be arriving at a good time, Caldwell said, noting that \"concerns about privacy and the power of big tech are higher than ever right now.\"<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Instead, those opposing the new California Privacy Rights Act are some of the same types of consumer, labor and civil rights advocates who support its predecessor.</p><p>\"Proposition 24 is a wolf in sheep's clothing,\" said Richard Holober, president of the Consumer Federation of California and a leader of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://noon24ca.org/\">No on 24</url> effort. \"It's loaded with giveaways to tech companies.\"</p><p>Not so, said Alastair Mactaggart, the East Bay real estate developer who spurred California's adoption two years ago of the country's toughest data privacy law. He says he's now bankrolling <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.caprivacy.org/prop-24-california/\">Proposition 24</url> to make the state's privacy law both stronger and harder for Sacramento lobbyists and lawmakers to water down, and is astounded anyone would claim otherwise.</p><p>\"Why would I do that?\" asked Mactaggart, who founded Californians for Consumer Privacy to promote personal data protection. \"On what planet does that make sense?\"</p><p>California adopted its current data privacy law, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/06/28/california-data-privacy-bill-speeds-through-legislature-as-deadline-nears/\">California Consumer Privacy Act</url>, in 2018 after Mactaggart qualified a similar ballot measure, then withdrew it and worked with lawmakers on a compromise bill. It gives Californians the right to know what information is being collected about them, to opt out of that collection, and to hold companies liable for breaches.</p><p>Over the 18 months before the law became effective this year, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/07/29/heres-how-tech-companies-want-to-change-californias-landmark-consumer-privacy-act/\">industry representatives</url> sought to pare back provisions they said would have \"unintended consequences.\" Though the law remains largely the same, Mactaggart sought a new ballot measure fearing industry lobbying would eventually weaken it.</p><p>Mactaggart said Proposition 24 would give Californians protections comparable to those in Europe's General Data Protection Regulation, which took effect in 2018 and is considered the world's toughest.</p><p>Proposition 24 would expand consumer rights to see all information collected on them, which current law limits to the last 12 months. It would add a right to correct that information. Consumers could tell companies not to sell or use \"sensitive\" information, such as race, sexual orientation and precise geolocation. It would triple fines for violating children's privacy. It would expand enforcement, establishing a new California Privacy Protection Agency. And it still would allow amendments in the Legislature if they don't weaken privacy protection.</p><p>Critics say the newly enacted state law should get a longer road test before a new initiative. Beyond that, they say the initiative would lock in a \"pay for privacy\" provision allowing companies to charge consumers who opt out of data collection an amount reflecting its value, or to offer corresponding discounts to those who allow collection, such as through loyalty or rewards programs.</p><p>Holober said that provision is a bad aspect of current law that will be harder to undo if the initiative passes, comparing it to express lanes.</p><p>\"If you're wealthy, you can pay to get onto the electronic fast lane, and if you're not, you're stuck in an electronic traffic jam,\" Holober said.</p><p>Critics also say the initiative would add a two-year delay for workers to learn what information their employers collect on them, and prevents protections from applying to Californians when they leave the state. They say the new state privacy agency would add bureaucracy and weaken rather than enhance enforcement.</p><p>Mactaggart said allowing companies to charge for the value of collected data protects companies that rely on the revenue for their business, he said, such as news organizations.</p><p>\"They call it 'pay for privacy,' I call it 'preserve the free press,'\" Mactaggart said.</p><p>Mactaggart said he's not surprised big tech companies are standing down on Proposition 24 - data privacy is popular, fighting it is a bad look and they're already abiding by similar rules in Europe. But he said criticism from those who would seem natural allies is \"pretty disappointing.\"</p><p>The CaliforniaNAACP supports Proposition 24; the CaliforniaACLU and civil rights activist Dolores Huerta are opposed.

AFSCME and California Professional Firefighters support it; the California Nurses Association is opposed.</p><p>California's Democratic Party contributed to Proposition 24, but Democratic Party groups in San Francisco, Santa Clara, Santa Monica and other areas are opposed, as are the California Republican Party and California Small Business Association.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2020/10/04/letters-90-2/\"> Letters: Yes on Prop. 22 | Column vs. reality | New debate format | Admiration diminished </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2020/10/02/proposition-15-commercial-tax-increase-could-raise-billions-for-schools-local-government-funding/\"> Proposition 15: Commercial tax increase could raise billions for schools, local government funding </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2020/10/02/opinion-direct-democracy-could-be-the-cure-for-what-ails-the-nation/\"> Opinion: Direct democracy could be the cure for what ails the nation </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2020/10/01/walters-proposition-19s-tortuous-journey-to-the-ballot/\"> Walters: Proposition 19's tortuous journey to the ballot </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2020/09/29/opinion-dont-believe-what-uber-and-lyft-claim-about-prop-22/\"> Opinion: Don't believe what Uber and Lyft claim about Prop. 22 </url> Holober said the confluence of liberal and conservative groups in opposition is telling, and \"the silence from the big tech companies is deafening.\"</p><p>Mactaggart has put more than $5 million of his time and money toward Proposition 24's passage - nearly all the cash and in-kind contributions raised on its behalf.</p><p>That's far more than the $45,000 raised so far by Proposition 24's opponents, which included $20,000 from the California Nurses Association political action committee and $25,000 from the Consumer Federation of California.

Instead, those opposing the new California Privacy Rights Act are some of the same types of consumer, labor and civil rights advocates who support its predecessor.</p><p>\"Proposition 24 is a wolf in sheep's clothing,\" said Richard Holober, president of the Consumer Federation of California and a leader of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://noon24ca.org/\">No on 24</url> effort. \"It's loaded with giveaways to tech companies.\"</p><p>Not so, said Alastair Mactaggart, the East Bay real estate developer who spurred California's adoption two years ago of the country's toughest data privacy law. He says he's now bankrolling <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.caprivacy.org/prop-24-california/\">Proposition 24</url> to make the state's privacy law both stronger and harder for Sacramento lobbyists and lawmakers to water down, and is astounded anyone would claim otherwise.</p><p>\"Why would I do that?\" asked Mactaggart, who founded Californians for Consumer Privacy to promote personal data protection. \"On what planet does that make sense?\"</p><p>California adopted its current data privacy law, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/06/28/california-data-privacy-bill-speeds-through-legislature-as-deadline-nears/\">California Consumer Privacy Act</url>, in 2018 after Mactaggart qualified a similar ballot measure, then withdrew it and worked with lawmakers on a compromise bill. It gives Californians the right to know what information is being collected about them, to opt out of that collection, and to hold companies liable for breaches.</p><p>Over the 18 months before the law became effective this year, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/07/29/heres-how-tech-companies-want-to-change-californias-landmark-consumer-privacy-act/\">industry representatives</url> sought to pare back provisions they said would have \"unintended consequences.\" Though the law remains largely the same, Mactaggart sought a new ballot measure fearing industry lobbying would eventually weaken it.</p><p>Mactaggart said Proposition 24 would give Californians protections comparable to those in Europe's General Data Protection Regulation, which took effect in 2018 and is considered the world's toughest.</p><p>Proposition 24 would expand consumer rights to see all information collected on them, which current law limits to the last 12 months. It would add a right to correct that information. Consumers could tell companies not to sell or use \"sensitive\" information, such as race, sexual orientation and precise geolocation. It would triple fines for violating children's privacy. It would expand enforcement, establishing a new California Privacy Protection Agency. And it still would allow amendments in the Legislature if they don't weaken privacy protection.</p><p>Critics say the newly enacted state law should get a longer road test before a new initiative. Beyond that, they say the initiative would lock in a \"pay for privacy\" provision allowing companies to charge consumers who opt out of data collection an amount reflecting its value, or to offer corresponding discounts to those who allow collection, such as through loyalty or rewards programs.</p><p>Holober said that provision is a bad aspect of current law that will be harder to undo if the initiative passes, comparing it to express lanes.</p><p>\"If you're wealthy, you can pay to get onto the electronic fast lane, and if you're not, you're stuck in an electronic traffic jam,\" Holober said.</p><p>Critics also say the initiative would add a two-year delay for workers to learn what information their employers collect on them, and prevents protections from applying to Californians when they leave the state. They say the new state privacy agency would add bureaucracy and weaken rather than enhance enforcement.</p><p>Mactaggart said allowing companies to charge for the value of collected data protects companies that rely on the revenue for their business, he said, such as news organizations.</p><p>\"They call it 'pay for privacy,' I call it 'preserve the free press,'\" Mactaggart said.</p><p>Mactaggart said he's not surprised big tech companies are standing down on Proposition 24 - data privacy is popular, fighting it is a bad look and they're already abiding by similar rules in Europe. But he said criticism from those who would seem natural allies is \"pretty disappointing.\"</p><p>The CaliforniaNAACP supports Proposition 24; the CaliforniaACLU and civil rights activist Dolores Huerta are opposed. Consumer Watchdog and Common Sense support it; Consumer Action and Consumer Federation of California are opposed. AFSCME and California Professional Firefighters support it; the California Nurses Association is opposed.</p><p>California's Democratic Party contributed to Proposition 24, but Democratic Party groups in San Francisco, Santa Clara, Santa Monica and other areas are opposed, as are the California Republican Party and California Small Business Association.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/10/04/letters-90/\"> Letters: Yes on Prop. 22 | Column vs. reality | New debate format | Admiration diminished </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/10/02/opinion-direct-democracy-could-be-the-cure-for-what-ails-the-nation/\"> Opinion: Direct democracy could be the cure for what ails the nation </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/10/01/walters-proposition-19s-tortuous-journey-to-the-ballot/\"> Walters: Proposition 19's tortuous journey to the ballot </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/09/29/opinion-dont-believe-what-uber-and-lyft-claim-about-prop-22/\"> Opinion: Don't believe what Uber and Lyft claim about Prop. 22 </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/09/29/letters-82/\"> Letters: Prop. 19 | Pedestrian hazard | A good example | Columnist's creative writing | Trump and transfer | Evangelical mystery </url> Holober said the confluence of liberal and conservative groups in opposition is telling, and \"the silence from the big tech companies is deafening.\"</p><p>Mactaggart has put more than $5 million of his time and money toward Proposition 24's passage - nearly all the cash and in-kind contributions raised on its behalf.</p><p>That's far more than the $45,000 raised so far by Proposition 24's opponents, which included $20,000 from the California Nurses Association political action committee and $25,000 from the Consumer Federation of California.

Gone are the days of every Tom, Dick or Harriet believing they can set up a proptech start-up from their bedroom and attract investment. Now, when it comes to proptech it is survival of the fittest.That was the finding of the University of Oxford\u2019s Sa\u00efd Business School\u2019s latest report into the proptech sector. Building on its report from 2017, its Proptech 2020 report shows an increase in the amount of investment being pumped into proptech, but a significant decline in the number of start-up businesses.\u201cWe are seeing much, much bigger sums of money applied to the proptech businesses that are making more and more inroads into the market,\u201d says Professor Andrew Baum, author of the report.The report identifies five areas of development for tech and innovation in the real estate sector: smart cities, smart buildings, the sharing economy, real estate fintech and data engineering.Data engineeringData engineering, says Baum, is the \u201cgrimy plumbing\u201d of proptech, but the area where businesses can make the biggest gains.\u201cThe easy thing for any property company or organisation to do is just to evolve a very clear data strategy. </p><p>A strategy which involves understanding what you\u2019ve got, how to organise it, how to visualise it and then understand how to share it for the benefit of your own business without losing control of it,\u201d he says.For Baum, the future of innovation in real estate is less about the high tech and more about that which is practical, build-able and usable.\u201cIt\u2019s a classic sign of a maturing industry,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is survival of the fittest now, rather than the idea that you can start a new proptech business in your garage and expect to succeed. We are also seeing Facebook, Google and Amazon all entering the real estate area through smart building technology. Those big tech giants are in there now as well as the big engineering companies, so you\u2019re not going to make any progress as a start-up. It\u2019s a big-scale game now.\u201cThat era of hype characterised by cryptocurrency-backed property funds, for example, is over. People have seen through the hype and blown the whistle on the things that are plainly ridiculous \u2013 those things that just don\u2019t have any real possibility of succeeding in the next decade.\u201dBaum says that the coming together of real estate and tech professionals over the past three or four years has enabled them to learn and start to deploy investment more efficiently.Blockchain and tokenisationOne of the big hypes that was around in the early days of proptech was blockchain and tokenisation and, while real estate fintech forms one of the Proptech 2020 report\u2019s five key trends, whether tokenisation will form a significant part of that trend is unclear.\u201cIt\u2019s a classic example of the post-financial-crash, millennial-driven new world of hippies that circumvents the traditional financial system,\u201d says Baum of the idea. \u201cIt\u2019s a lovely idea. It\u2019s very elegant and appealing, but it won\u2019t work as it currently stands because of a lack of understanding of all the things that get in the way and all the things that you need to do to be able to make this work.\u201dTo truly tokenise a building it would need to be put into a legal structure such as a company, partnership or trust. That structure would then become a regulated investment entity, meaning it could not escape the rules and regulations of the Financial Conduct Authority. A manager would then need to run that investment. Then to trade the tokens, a blockchain-based system would be needed, which, says Baum, might actually be the easiest part of it.\u201cBut, to go through all of those stages to create a market where the demand is by no means proven is a huge leap,\u201d says Baum. \u201cIt\u2019s clunky, it\u2019s expensive and it\u2019s not obvious that it makes any sense for anybody to do any of this stuff.\u201dA less clunky wayRegulated securities exchange IPSX has yet to trade its first asset but hopes that it can offer a less clunky way to democratise the ownership model.\u201cIPSX is a very interesting example of non-tokenised fractionalisation project,\u201d says Baum. \u201cThe only problem with IPSX is whether it can prove the demand for units in buildings.\u201dIPSX has the benefit, says Baum, of being both regulated and founded on the concept that every building is in a company. It does not use a blockchain, however, and the benefit of a tokenised system using blockchain is that in the long run it could be cheaper and faster to trade units.So while IPSX may well be an option for a fresh, new, digital way of trading assets, it might not be the solution.Where Baum does see opportunity for the progression of tokenisation within real estate is in the institutional sector as funds are already in the right legal format, are regulated entities and are already split into units.Regardless, Baum still is not convinced that tokenisation is the future of real estate. He is not convinced that the loss of control for the building owner and the potential for mis-selling and for people to buy things that they shouldn\u2019t be buying are worth the elegance of a tokenised system.\u201cThat\u2019s my fundamental problem with all of this,\u201d he says. \u201cSome people call it democratisation. I\u2019d call it dangerous. Funds exist for a very good reason: because they\u2019re managed by professional people and are diversified and regulated. And all those things are good for investors, or should be.\u201cI suppose one of the reasons people are attracted to tokenisation is that they lost so much faith in the fund management industry in the global financial crisis and I think this idea that you can do better than the system is still pervasive. But hopefully that sort of idea will fade as the investment industry starts to prove its value again.\u201dTo send feedback, e-mail <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:samantha.mcclary@egi.co.uk\">samantha.mcclary@egi.co.uk</email> or tweet @samanthamcclary or @estatesgazette</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RBIEGI-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RBIEGI2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y9C-SNN1-DYX4-728K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">274985</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"974\"/><timeReceived>08:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Reed Business Information Ltd.

Gone are the days of every Tom, Dick or Harriet believing they can set up a proptech start-up from their bedroom and attract investment. Now, when it comes to proptech it is survival of the fittest.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That was the finding of the University of Oxford\u2019s Sa\u00efd Business School\u2019s latest report into the proptech sector. Building on its report from 2017, its Proptech 2020 report shows an increase in the amount of investment being pumped into proptech, but a significant decline in the number of start-up businesses.</p><p>\u201cWe are seeing much, much bigger sums of money applied to the proptech businesses that are making more and more inroads into the market,\u201d says Professor Andrew Baum, author of the report.</p><p>The report identifies five areas of development for tech and innovation in the real estate sector: smart cities, smart buildings, the sharing economy, real estate fintech and data engineering.</p><p>Data engineering</p><p>Data engineering, says Baum, is the \u201cgrimy plumbing\u201d of proptech, but the area where businesses can make the biggest gains.</p><p>\u201cThe easy thing for any property company or organisation to do is just to evolve a very clear data strategy. A strategy which involves understanding what you\u2019ve got, how to organise it, how to visualise it and then understand how to share it for the benefit of your own business without losing control of it,\u201d he says.</p><p>For Baum, the future of innovation in real estate is less about the high tech and more about that which is practical, build-able and usable.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a classic sign of a maturing industry,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is survival of the fittest now, rather than the idea that you can start a new proptech business in your garage and expect to succeed. We are also seeing Facebook, Google and Amazon all entering the real estate area through smart building technology. Those big tech giants are in there now as well as the big engineering companies, so you\u2019re not going to make any progress as a start-up. It\u2019s a big-scale game now.</p><p>\u201cThat era of hype characterised by cryptocurrency-backed property funds, for example, is over. People have seen through the hype and blown the whistle on the things that are plainly ridiculous \u2013 those things that just don\u2019t have any real possibility of succeeding in the next decade.\u201d</p><p>Baum says that the coming together of real estate and tech professionals over the past three or four years has enabled them to learn and start to deploy investment more efficiently.</p><p>Blockchain and tokenisation</p><p>One of the big hypes that was around in the early days of proptech was blockchain and tokenisation and, while real estate fintech forms one of the Proptech 2020 report\u2019s five key trends, whether tokenisation will form a significant part of that trend is unclear.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a classic example of the post-financial-crash, millennial-driven new world of hippies that circumvents the traditional financial system,\u201d says Baum of the idea. \u201cIt\u2019s a lovely idea. It\u2019s very elegant and appealing, but it won\u2019t work as it currently stands because of a lack of understanding of all the things that get in the way and all the things that you need to do to be able to make this work.\u201d</p><p>To truly tokenise a building it would need to be put into a legal structure such as a company, partnership or trust. That structure would then become a regulated investment entity, meaning it could not escape the rules and regulations of the Financial Conduct Authority. A manager would then need to run that investment. Then to trade the tokens, a blockchain-based system would be needed, which, says Baum, might actually be the easiest part of it.</p><p>\u201cBut, to go through all of those stages to create a market where the demand is by no means proven is a huge leap,\u201d says Baum. \u201cIt\u2019s clunky, it\u2019s expensive and it\u2019s not obvious that it makes any sense for anybody to do any of this stuff.\u201d</p><p>A less clunky way</p><p>Regulated securities exchange IPSX has yet to trade its first asset but hopes that it can offer a less clunky way to democratise the ownership model.</p><p>\u201cIPSX is a very interesting example of non-tokenised fractionalisation project,\u201d says Baum. \u201cThe only problem with IPSX is whether it can prove the demand for units in buildings.\u201d</p><p>IPSX has the benefit, says Baum, of being both regulated and founded on the concept that every building is in a company. It does not use a blockchain, however, and the benefit of a tokenised system using blockchain is that in the long run it could be cheaper and faster to trade units.</p><p>So while IPSX may well be an option for a fresh, new, digital way of trading assets, it might not be the solution.</p><p>Where Baum does see opportunity for the progression of tokenisation within real estate is in the institutional sector as funds are already in the right legal format, are regulated entities and are already split into units.</p><p>Regardless, Baum still is not convinced that tokenisation is the future of real estate. He is not convinced that the loss of control for the building owner and the potential for mis-selling and for people to buy things that they shouldn\u2019t be buying are worth the elegance of a tokenised system.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my fundamental problem with all of this,\u201d he says. \u201cSome people call it democratisation. I\u2019d call it dangerous. Funds exist for a very good reason: because they\u2019re managed by professional people and are diversified and regulated. And all those things are good for investors, or should be.</p><p>\u201cI suppose one of the reasons people are attracted to tokenisation is that they lost so much faith in the fund management industry in the global financial crisis and I think this idea that you can do better than the system is still pervasive. But hopefully that sort of idea will fade as the investment industry starts to prove its value again.\u201d</p><p>To send feedback, e-mail <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:samantha.mcclary@egi.co.uk\">samantha.mcclary@egi.co.uk</email> or tweet @samanthamcclary or @estatesgazette</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EG-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y9Y-79C1-JCF2-H11T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">164780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"974\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Reed Business Information Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Estates Gazette</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33631\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 29, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Law Reviews &amp;

Increased productivity brought with it rising household income and innovation-enhanced quality of life. But the disruption, displacement and dispossession it entailed meant that many at the time would have struggled to recognise its good. So too with the digital revolution.</p><p>But if SA has an advantage in not being the first frontier of the digital revolution it is that it can be better prepared for negative disruption and able to offset it.</p><p>While SA has tried to facilitate e-commerce by passing legislation such as the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act, it hasn't really grappled with the reality of South Africans being customers of online behemoths such as the so-called Fangs: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google.</p><p>Take Netflix. It is making significant inroads in SA, disrupting pay-TV behemoth MultiChoice by providing a cheaper, more convenient and nonlinear way of watching TV content.</p><p>The streaming content provider is drawing increasing numbers of consumers away from the incumbent, as it has done to other pay-TV operators across the world, and this is happening despite the absence of live sport. If the UK, where Netflix has more young viewers than all BBC channels combined, is any indication, SA's free TV and linear pay-TV providers are in trouble.</p><p>Recently, in an attempt to head off pro-competitive regulations being imposed by the Independent Communications Authority of SA on its subscription TV business, MultiChoice gave valuable insights into the threat to DStv's business model posed by Netflix.</p><p>MultiChoice says it lost over 100,000 premium subscribers in its last financial year, a fact it blames on Netflix, which it says has amassed between 300,000 and 400,000 subscribers since it launched here in 2016.</p><p>This is not the place to debate MultiChoice's monopoly in the subscription TV market, but it is not wrong to question the appropriateness of regulating subscription TV while having zero regulation for online businesses such as Netflix.</p><p>Let's think about it: a licensed television service such as DStv has to make the following contributions to the South African economy: it has to pay VAT, company tax, PAYE, UIF, the skills development levy and a percentage of its turnover to the Media Development and Diversity Agency, while it also has to invest in local content development (including independent productions) and contribute to self-regulatory bodies such as the Broadcasting Complaints Commission of SA through its membership of the National Association of Broadcasters. Besides these investment and taxation requirements, DStv is required to be 30% black owned in accordance with the Information and Communication Technology Charter and the Electronic Communications Act.</p><p>Now think about what Netflix pays. VAT. Just VAT.</p><p>So how are we to manage this type of disruption? What should local companies do to improve their chances of survival against these digital behemoths? The first task is to understand what you are up against. Research suggests that industries are increasingly described as &amp; winner take most&amp; where a small number of firms take a very large share of the market.</p><p>Although weak antitrust enforcement over an extended period has played a part, those industries most disrupted by the shift to digital display other characteristics we have not necessarily seen before in economic history.</p><p>Network effects, where there are large &amp; positive spillovers from having many customers using the same product&amp; have propelled companies like Facebook and Google towards achieving global dominance in an extraordinarily short period.</p><p>In the past, the dominant manufacturing firms relied on large amounts of capital to gradually achieve scale and become low-cost producers. The giant platform companies of today, mostly in technology services, need surprisingly little capital. The combination of weak anti-trust enforcement and a rapid rise to dominance of capital-light digital firms means traditional companies have an intense period ahead as they adopt digital processes to raise their productivity scores.</p><p>The second task is to appreciate that these old and new firms do not necessarily operate under the same rules. Facebook's data leak of personal details on 87-million people resulted in no financial penalties, whereas BP's Deepwater Horizon oil spill has cost the firm some $65bn in fines and redress. As crude as this comparison may be, the reality is that social media, search, online travel, retail and many other digital industries are young and the authorities, in many cases, haven't established a way to regulate or police them.</p><p>The EU has started doing something - through its General Data Protection Regulation - and Australia is not far behind.</p><p>However, for the most part these new digital players are operating in a regulatory no man's land. And this is where the old companies need to speak out about unequal playing fields.</p><p>The European banking sector, which is yet to recover properly from the global financial crisis, is finding its voice as fintech and big tech companies threaten to pick the eyes out of an already weak business model, with the lucrative payments segment being the target.</p><p>Old-fashioned bankers contend that e-wallets are another form of deposit-taking and should thus be regulated.</p><p>In the US, retailers have long complained about an exemption that allows online retailers not to charge sales tax in states where they do not have a physical presence. So, with endless such examples across the globe, the disruptors themselves are, sadly, too often only a handful of US and Chinese firms.</p><p>How a predominance of US and Chinese global disruptors will square with a world of rising nationalism is also hard to fathom. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government may be desperate for foreign investment but does it really want two US-owned firms - Amazon India and Flipkart (Walmart) - dominating the nascent e-commerce market in the country? India's sole traders are estimated to carry out some 90% of the country's retail.</p><p>It's a challenge facing SA, too, as more people are online and are no longer unbanked. Being able to engage in e-commerce has become a reality for South African shoppers, and why not? It's convenient and the choice is massive. What would a major switch to online shopping with Amazon mean for retailers? And what would this mean for company taxes, personal income taxes, skills development levies and commitments to black economic empowerment?</p><p>We have already seen what a switch to online has meant for the print media. Advertising has been decimated. The newspaper industry is now increasingly reliant on digital subscriptions, which means there is only space for the national titles, while the local press fades away, with implications for local accountability and a healthy democracy.</p><p>South African businesses need to start lobbying for a fairer set of regulations for online and traditional businesses or our weak economy will be subject to a period of disruption that may be too tough to absorb.</p><p>In our view, all companies that do business in SA by offering goods and services to South African customers ought to contribute to the social good through paying taxes and upskilling local workers. Only then will the digital revolution possibly bear the fruits of rising household income for us all.</p><p>Gibb manages the Anchor Worldwide Flexible Fund and heads the global tech unit at Anchor Capital. Limpitlaw is an electronic communications consultant and visiting adjunct professor at Wits University's LINK centre.</p><p>Regulations needed: A television monitor displays the home screen for the Netflix series The Mechanism. SA's free TV and linear pay-TV providers are burdened with wages and numerous taxes and levies. The global streaming company offers a convenient service and it only has to pay VAT.

Being able to engage in e-commerce has become a reality for South African shoppers, and why not? It's convenient and the choice is massive.

And what would this mean for company taxes, personal income taxes, skills development levies and commitments to black economic empowerment?</p><p>We have already seen what a switch to online has meant for the print media.

Increased productivity brought with it rising household income and innovation-enhanced quality of life. But the disruption, displacement and dispossession it entailed meant that many at the time would have struggled to recognise its good. So too with the digital revolution.</p><p>But if SA has an advantage in not being the first frontier of the digital revolution it is that it can be better prepared for negative disruption and able to offset it.</p><p>While SA has tried to facilitate e-commerce by passing legislation such as the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act, it hasn't really grappled with the reality of South Africans being customers of online behemoths such as the so-called Fangs: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google.</p><p>Take Netflix. It is making significant inroads in SA, disrupting pay-TV behemoth MultiChoice by providing a cheaper, more convenient and nonlinear way of watching TV content.</p><p>The streaming content provider is drawing increasing numbers of consumers away from the incumbent, as it has done to other pay-TV operators across the world, and this is happening despite the absence of live sport. If the UK, where Netflix has more young viewers than all BBC channels combined, is any indication, SA's free TV and linear pay-TV providers are in trouble.</p><p>Recently, in an attempt to head off pro-competitive regulations being imposed by the Independent Communications Authority of SA on its subscription TV business, MultiChoice gave valuable insights into the threat to DStv's business model posed by Netflix.</p><p>MultiChoice says it lost over 100,000 premium subscribers in its last financial year, a fact it blames on Netflix, which it says has amassed between 300,000 and 400,000 subscribers since it launched here in 2016.</p><p>This is not the place to debate MultiChoice's monopoly in the subscription TV market, but it is not wrong to question the appropriateness of regulating subscription TV while having zero regulation for online businesses such as Netflix.</p><p>Let's think about it: a licensed television service such as DStv has to make the following contributions to the South African economy: it has to pay VAT, company tax, PAYE, UIF, the skills development levy and a percentage of its turnover to the Media Development and Diversity Agency, while it also has to invest in local content development (including independent productions) and contribute to self-regulatory bodies such as the Broadcasting Complaints Commission of SA through its membership of the National Association of Broadcasters. Besides these investment and taxation requirements, DStv is required to be 30% black owned in accordance with the Information and Communication Technology Charter and the Electronic Communications Act.</p><p>Now think about what Netflix pays. VAT. Just VAT.</p><p>So how are we to manage this type of disruption? What should local companies do to improve their chances of survival against these digital behemoths? The first task is to understand what you are up against. Research suggests that industries are increasingly described as &amp; winner take most&amp; where a small number of firms take a very large share of the market.</p><p>Although weak antitrust enforcement over an extended period has played a part, those industries most disrupted by the shift to digital display other characteristics we have not necessarily seen before in economic history.</p><p>Network effects, where there are large &amp; positive spillovers from having many customers using the same product&amp; have propelled companies like Facebook and Google towards achieving global dominance in an extraordinarily short period.</p><p>In the past, the dominant manufacturing firms relied on large amounts of capital to gradually achieve scale and become low-cost producers. The giant platform companies of today, mostly in technology services, need surprisingly little capital. The combination of weak anti-trust enforcement and a rapid rise to dominance of capital-light digital firms means traditional companies have an intense period ahead as they adopt digital processes to raise their productivity scores.</p><p>The second task is to appreciate that these old and new firms do not necessarily operate under the same rules. Facebook's data leak of personal details on 87-million people resulted in no financial penalties, whereas BP's Deepwater Horizon oil spill has cost the firm some $65bn in fines and redress. As crude as this comparison may be, the reality is that social media, search, online travel, retail and many other digital industries are young and the authorities, in many cases, haven't established a way to regulate or police them.</p><p>The EU has started doing something - through its General Data Protection Regulation - and Australia is not far behind.</p><p>However, for the most part these new digital players are operating in a regulatory no man's land. And this is where the old companies need to speak out about unequal playing fields.</p><p>The European banking sector, which is yet to recover properly from the global financial crisis, is finding its voice as fintech and big tech companies threaten to pick the eyes out of an already weak business model, with the lucrative payments segment being the target.</p><p>Old-fashioned bankers contend that e-wallets are another form of deposit-taking and should thus be regulated.</p><p>In the US, retailers have long complained about an exemption that allows online retailers not to charge sales tax in states where they do not have a physical presence. So, with endless such examples across the globe, the disruptors themselves are, sadly, too often only a handful of US and Chinese firms.</p><p>How a predominance of US and Chinese global disruptors will square with a world of rising nationalism is also hard to fathom. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government may be desperate for foreign investment but does it really want two US-owned firms - Amazon India and Flipkart (Walmart) - dominating the nascent e-commerce market in the country? India's sole traders are estimated to carry out some 90% of the country's retail.</p><p>It's a challenge facing SA, too, as more people are online and are no longer unbanked. Being able to engage in e-commerce has become a reality for South African shoppers, and why not? It's convenient and the choice is massive.

Increased productivity brought with it rising household income and innovation-enhanced quality of life. But the disruption, displacement and dispossession it entailed meant that many at the time would have struggled to recognise its good. So too with the digital revolution.</p><p>But if SA has an advantage in not being the first frontier of the digital revolution it is that it can be better prepared for negative disruption and able to offset it.</p><p>While SA has tried to facilitate e-commerce by passing legislation such as the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act, it hasn't really grappled with the reality of South Africans being customers of online behemoths such as the so-called Fangs: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google.</p><p>Take Netflix. It is making significant inroads in SA, disrupting pay-TV behemoth MultiChoice by providing a cheaper, more convenient and nonlinear way of watching TV content.</p><p>The streaming content provider is drawing increasing numbers of consumers away from the incumbent, as it has done to other pay-TV operators across the world, and this is happening despite the absence of live sport. If the UK, where Netflix has more young viewers than all BBC channels combined, is any indication, SA's free TV and linear pay-TV providers are in trouble.</p><p>Recently, in an attempt to head off pro-competitive regulations being imposed by the Independent Communications Authority of SA on its subscription TV business, MultiChoice gave valuable insights into the threat to DStv's business model posed by Netflix.</p><p>MultiChoice says it lost over 100,000 premium subscribers in its last financial year, a fact it blames on Netflix, which it says has amassed between 300,000 and 400,000 subscribers since it launched here in 2016.</p><p>This is not the place to debate MultiChoice's monopoly in the subscription TV market, but it is not wrong to question the appropriateness of regulating subscription TV while having zero regulation for online businesses such as Netflix.</p><p>Let's think about it: a licensed television service such as DStv has to make the following contributions to the South African economy: it has to pay VAT, company tax, PAYE, UIF, the skills development levy and a percentage of its turnover to the Media Development and Diversity Agency, while it also has to invest in local content development (including independent productions) and contribute to self-regulatory bodies such as the Broadcasting Complaints Commission of SA through its membership of the National Association of Broadcasters. Besides these investment and taxation requirements, DStv is required to be 30% black owned in accordance with the Information and Communication Technology Charter and the Electronic Communications Act.</p><p>Now think about what Netflix pays. VAT. Just VAT.</p><p>So how are we to manage this type of disruption? What should local companies do to improve their chances of survival against these digital behemoths? The first task is to understand what you are up against. Research suggests that industries are increasingly described as &amp; winner take most&amp; where a small number of firms take a very large share of the market.</p><p>Although weak antitrust enforcement over an extended period has played a part, those industries most disrupted by the shift to digital display other characteristics we have not necessarily seen before in economic history.</p><p>Network effects, where there are large &amp; positive spillovers from having many customers using the same product&amp; have propelled companies like Facebook and Google towards achieving global dominance in an extraordinarily short period.</p><p>In the past, the dominant manufacturing firms relied on large amounts of capital to gradually achieve scale and become low-cost producers. The giant platform companies of today, mostly in technology services, need surprisingly little capital. The combination of weak anti-trust enforcement and a rapid rise to dominance of capital-light digital firms means traditional companies have an intense period ahead as they adopt digital processes to raise their productivity scores.</p><p>The second task is to appreciate that these old and new firms do not necessarily operate under the same rules. Facebook's data leak of personal details on 87-million people resulted in no financial penalties, whereas BP's Deepwater Horizon oil spill has cost the firm some $65bn in fines and redress. As crude as this comparison may be, the reality is that social media, search, online travel, retail and many other digital industries are young and the authorities, in many cases, haven't established a way to regulate or police them.</p><p>The EU has started doing something - through its General Data Protection Regulation - and Australia is not far behind.</p><p>However, for the most part these new digital players are operating in a regulatory no man's land. And this is where the old companies need to speak out about unequal playing fields.</p><p>The European banking sector, which is yet to recover properly from the global financial crisis, is finding its voice as fintech and big tech companies threaten to pick the eyes out of an already weak business model, with the lucrative payments segment being the target.</p><p>Old-fashioned bankers contend that e-wallets are another form of deposit-taking and should thus be regulated.</p><p>In the US, retailers have long complained about an exemption that allows online retailers not to charge sales tax in states where they do not have a physical presence. So, with endless such examples across the globe, the disruptors themselves are, sadly, too often only a handful of US and Chinese firms.</p><p>How a predominance of US and Chinese global disruptors will square with a world of rising nationalism is also hard to fathom. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government may be desperate for foreign investment but does it really want two US-owned firms - Amazon India and Flipkart (Walmart) - dominating the nascent e-commerce market in the country? India's sole traders are estimated to carry out some 90% of the country's retail.</p><p>It's a challenge facing SA, too, as more people are online and are no longer unbanked. Being able to engage in e-commerce has become a reality for South African shoppers, and why not? It's convenient and the choice is massive. What would a major switch to online shopping with Amazon mean for retailers? And what would this mean for company taxes, personal income taxes, skills development levies and commitments to black economic empowerment?</p><p>We have already seen what a switch to online has meant for the print media. Advertising has been decimated. The newspaper industry is now increasingly reliant on digital subscriptions, which means there is only space for the national titles, while the local press fades away, with implications for local accountability and a healthy democracy.</p><p>South African businesses need to start lobbying for a fairer set of regulations for online and traditional businesses or our weak economy will be subject to a period of disruption that may be too tough to absorb.</p><p>In our view, all companies that do business in SA by offering goods and services to South African customers ought to contribute to the social good through paying taxes and upskilling local workers. Only then will the digital revolution possibly bear the fruits of rising household income for us all.</p><p>Gibb manages the Anchor Worldwide Flexible Fund and heads the global tech unit at Anchor Capital. Limpitlaw is an electronic communications consultant and visiting adjunct professor at Wits University's LINK centre.</p><p>Regulations needed: A television monitor displays the home screen for the Netflix series The Mechanism. SA's free TV and linear pay-TV providers are burdened with wages and numerous taxes and levies. The global streaming company offers a convenient service and it only has to pay VAT.

And ever since its initial public offering in 2004, GOOG stock has performed accordingly. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fifteen years after its <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/best-stocks-ipo-this-year\">IPO</url>, the world's leading search engine isn't the growth dynamo once was, but adjusted for its size, revenue growth remains enviable. That said, its rivals are getting stronger, and for the first time it's an open question in Silicon Valley whether Google might eventually lose its search mojo as popular consumer tech products evolve. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">See:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/best-stocks-to-buy-this-year\">10 of the Best Stocks to Buy for 2019.</url>]</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here's a brief overview of the Mountain View, California-based technology giant, its core areas of business, and -- most importantly for prospective investors -- the pros and cons to buying GOOG stock. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alphabet Stock at a Glance</emphasis></p><p>In 2015, Google restructured its business and reincorporated itself as Alphabet, a holding company whose major subsidiary would be Google, the world's dominant search company. Under the restructuring, investors were able to differentiate the results between the cash-cow Google and its money-losing \"moonshot\" investments in the \"Other Bets\" category. </p><p>Despite the separation, there's a reason the company kept its ticker as GOOG; Alphabet is still essentially just a big proxy for its crown jewel, Google. </p><p>The search giant controls more than 60% of the U.S. market, and likely over 80% or more of the global market share. </p><p>GOOG stock's lifeblood is digital advertising, a massive and growing industry that, along with Facebook ( <url normalizedValue=\"http://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/fb-facebook-inc\">FB</url>), it dominates. Google sells ads against its search results for specific terms, and also operates a sprawling ad network, placing ads on third-party sites for a cut of the resulting revenue. </p><p>With mobile overtaking desktop as the world's preferred search device, Google's Android operating system becomes ever more valuable; Android enjoys somewhere between 70% and 80% of global market share and Google is the default search engine for Android. </p><p>YouTube, Gmail, Google Play, Pixel phones, Google Home smart speakers, Google Cloud and the company's expanding hardware business are a few of the big-name products and services aside from the search engine. </p><p>As for Other Bets, it accounted for an immaterial 0.4% of Alphabet's overall revenue last quarter, and loses a disproportionate amount of money doing so. In the second quarter of 2019, Google posted $10.4 billion in operating income while Other Bets posted an operating loss of $1 billion. This is where some of the wacky yet potentially huge long term projects live, such as Google Fiber, the Waymo self-driving car unit, anti-aging research outfit Verily, a network of internet-beaming balloons and a drone delivery unit. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pros to Buying GOOG Stock</emphasis></p><p>The first and most obvious advantage to owning Alphabet stock, is simply owning a piece of the biggest, baddest search engine in the world. </p><p> Total paid clicks in the second quarter of 2019 rose 28% year-over-year. And for the time being Android serves as a pretty good insurance policy against other search companies meaningfully cannibalizing mobile share. </p><p/><p>[<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">READ</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/best-stocks-to-buy-for-the-5g-revolution\">7 of the Best Stocks to Buy for the 5G Revolution</url>]</p><p>The second \"pro\" to owning GOOG stock, aside from its big-time search engine cash cow and exceptional brand, is the company's investment in diversification: self-driving cars, YouTube, artificial intelligence, cloud and voice search. </p><p>YouTube is arguably at the epicenter of the consumer transition from traditional mass-market media to dispersed, on-demand and increasingly mobile media consumption. </p><p>At this point, advertisers who aren't shifting more and more of their budget to online video platforms are simply missing out. </p><p>Longer term, Google's willingness to invest in bold new projects outside its core competency as a search engine could be precisely what allows it to continue as a <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/best-growth-stocks-to-buy\">growth stock</url> despite hundreds of billions in annual revenue. </p><p>Several promising areas hold the type of game-changing potential that could launch a new era of growth for GOOG shareholders: In particular, AI and autonomous vehicles (AVs). Alphabet's Waymo subsidiary is already a leader in AVs, and Alphabet's R&amp;D investments in artificial intelligence have made it one of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/artificial-intelligence-stocks-the-10-best-ai-companies\">best AI companies</url> too. </p><p>A line item dubbed \"Google other revenues,\" which includes both Google Cloud and its Pixel mobile phones, enjoyed revenue growth of 40% in the second quarter to $6.2 billion -- not bad for a couple side businesses. </p><p>The final \"pro\" when it comes to buying Google stock is an open secret: chief financial officer Ruth Porat. Widely respected on Wall Street and poached from Morgan Stanley ( <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/ms-morgan-stanley\">MS</url>) in 2015, she oversaw the reorganization of Google into the holding company Alphabet, allowing the company to show just how profitable the core search business was -- and how investing in potential \"moonshots\" affects overall earnings. Porat's presence gives investors the sense that there's an adult in the room making sure spending doesn't get too out of hand. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cons to Buying GOOG Stock</emphasis></p><p>Interestingly enough, one of the biggest cons to buying Alphabet shares is the fact that Amazon.com ( <url normalizedValue=\"http://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/amzn-amazoncom-inc\">AMZN</url>) exists. Not only that it exists, but that it's attacking the search giant on all fronts. </p><p>Perhaps the greatest long-term risk Amazon poses to GOOG is its encroachment into voice search -- perhaps the future of search itself -- where Amazon's Alexa virtual assistant has a huge first-mover advantage that it's ruthlessly capitalized on. </p><p>Amazon is also seizing digital advertising dollars, as marketers shift spending to Amazon.com's growing platform and more and more lucrative product searches begin on Amazon than Google. In cloud, <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/pros-cons-to-buying-amazon-amzn-stock\">Amazon Web Services</url> is the clear market leader, with Google Cloud playing catch-up and occupying a distant third place behind Amazon and Microsoft (       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/msft-microsoft-corp\">MSFT</url>) Azure. Jeff Bezos's ruthlessly opportunistic company is also devoting time, energy and resources to AI. </p><p>Taken in concert, these trends don't look particularly good for Alphabet or inspire much confidence in its ability to churn out company-changing profits in something other than search. Amazon beat Google to market by years in smart speakers and cloud computing, GOOG's Pixel phone has thus far proven a clumsy attempt to mimic Apple's ( <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/aapl-apple-inc\">AAPL</url>) longtime strategy of elegantly marrying software and hardware, and the company even tried to copy Facebook with its ill-fated and largely ignored Google+ social network, which was finally discontinued after seven ho-hum years. </p><p>Another thing to worry about is the specter of regulation, which is suddenly less of a specter and more an inevitability. </p><p>The European Commission fined Google a record $5 billion in 2018 for using Android's dominance to stifle competition. And while the U.S. may be slow to the draw with regulation, in mid-2019 news broke that the Department of Justice had opened an antitrust inquiry into the company. </p><p>Lastly, GOOG stock certainly doesn't appear grossly overvalued for instance, but shares do trade for 25 times earnings with no obvious catalyst on the horizon other than the potential negative impact of regulation.

(ticker: <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/amzn-amazoncom-inc\">AMZN</url>) stock? It's a question many investors might be asking themselves as shares of the online retailer approach all-time highs. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">AMZN has been rocketing higher in recent years due largely to a long series of earnings beats as it quickly made the transition from an intermittently profitable company to one of the most impressive <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/large-cap-stocks-with-huge-earnings-potential\">large-cap earnings growth stocks</url> out there. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Primarily responsible for that: the growth of its cloud division Amazon Web Services (AWS). Impressive growth in Prime subscribers and blowout sales of Alexa-enabled devices haven't hurt, either. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/reasons-to-buy-amazoncom-amzn-stock-now\">AMZN stock</url> has risen 21% so far in 2019 and 457% over the last five years. </p><p>Those are clearly exceptional returns; here's a quick look at the dynamics of Amazon's business and an overview of the pros and cons to buying Amazon stock. </p><p>[<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">See:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/dividends/slideshows/best-dividend-stocks-to-buy-this-year\">10 of the Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for 2019.</url>]</p><p/><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon Stock at a Glance</emphasis></p><p>Bezos, who started the e-commerce company as an online bookseller in the 1990s, has been in aggressive growth mode ever since. He never cared much about making a profit each year but focused intensely on pleasing the customer, and in doing so, building market share. </p><p>More than 20 years later, the market share has followed, and so have profits. In 2018, Amazon reported revenue of $232.9 billion, up 31% from the year before. </p><p>The vast majority of Amazon sales are generated on its increasingly dominant eponymous online shopping platform, which currently sells almost every product you can imagine. Sellers can pay extra to use Fulfilled by Amazon (FBA) -- Amazon warehouses, packs and ships their products, which are also eligible for Prime two-day shipping. </p><p>Amazon Prime, its $119 per year subscription service with perks, including two-day shipping, an online streaming video service, photo storage and discounts on select company products, has an estimated 105 million members in the U.S. alone. </p><p>Alexa, its virtual assistant technology, comes standard in the company's Echo line of smart speakers, which have sold by the tens of millions worldwide. </p><p/><p/><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pros to Buying Amazon Stock</emphasis></p><p>Like other ridiculously successful Silicon Valley companies Facebook ( <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/fb-facebook-inc\">FB</url>), Netflix (       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/nflx-netflix-inc\">NFLX</url>) and Alphabet (       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/goog-alphabet-inc\">GOOG</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/googl-alphabet-inc\">GOOGL</url>), Amazon is a founder-run company. But even compared to the enviable track records of those names, Bezos's leadership is exceptional. </p><p>Bezos has built a culture that ignores the myopic quarter-to-quarter mindset of Wall Street, doing everything with an eye to the long term. He believes \"current\" earnings were actually earned due to decisions three to five years ago. </p><p>His obsession with customer service is now a core part of Amazon's ethos -- as is his ruthlessness. And if there were any doubt, Bezos is also the largest single owner of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/2018-03-12/amazon-com-inc-amzn-stock\">Amazon stock</url>, so his interests are clearly aligned with shareholders. </p><p>The second big advantage to owning AMZN stock is, simply put, the company's willingness, desire and ability to disrupt an extraordinarily wide range of industries. </p><p>Amazon.com started as a disruptor, forcing brick-and-mortar booksellers out of business due to its scale, lower overhead and convenience. It didn't take long for Amazon to push from hawking books to all sorts of product categories -- toys, electronics, clothes, tools, you name it. </p><p>The e-commerce giant's ambitions continued to evolve, and in 2017 it surprised Wall Street by acquiring organic foods grocer Whole Foods for $13.4 billion. It offers its own branded credit card and is considering moving seriously into retail banking. </p><p>Amazon is also building out its own delivery service and working on drone technology that could one day rival UPS ( <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/ups-united-parcel-service-inc\">UPS</url>) and FedEx (       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/fdx-fedex-corp\">FDX</url>). A partnership with       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/the-complete-berkshire-hathaway-portfolio\">Berkshire Hathaway</url> (       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/brka-berkshire-hathaway-inc-ordinary-shares-class-a\">BRK.A</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/brkb-berkshire-hathaway-inc-ordinary-shares-class-b\">BRK.B</url>) and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/jpm-jpmorgan-chase-co\">JPM</url>) aims to disrupt health care, though it's not clear exactly how yet. </p><p>The third and final \"pro\" to buying AMZN stock -- aside from all the implied pros that come from the dominant company and ruthless culture Bezos has built -- is AWS, Amazon's cloud computing business. </p><p>Yet another one of the company's bold ventures into new frontiers, Amazon shares owe a huge debt to AWS for their otherworldly performance in recent years. </p><p>Think about it this way: It wasn't until 2018, a full 24 years after its inception, that Amazon's retail operations reached the margins and scale needed to consistently turn a profit. But AMZN had been able to break even or turn a modest profit for years by then, and for one reason: AWS. </p><p>In 2017, Amazon's global retail revenue was $160.4 billion, on which it generated and operating loss of $225 million. But Amazon actually boasted more than $4 billion in operating profits that year. How? AWS, which generated operating profits of $4.3 billion on just $17.5 billion in revenue. </p><p>That fast growing and high margin segment of Amazon allows the company to invest so heavily in logistics, smart speakers, e-readers, original content for its streaming video service, and so on. And it's pretty helpful when it comes to competing on price, too. </p><p>AWS is also expected to be the testing grounds for future huge opportunities for growth, particularly <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/artificial-intelligence-stocks-the-10-best-ai-companies\">artificial intelligence</url> and machine learning. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cons to Buying Amazon Stock</emphasis></p><p>Sometimes there's a problem with having a few really impressive strengths. It's the age-old concept of the double-edged sword. The Achilles' heel. </p><p>Arguably Amazon's two biggest competitive advantages are its CEO, Bezos, and its AWS division. </p><p>Bezos, 55, seems healthy and should have plenty of gas left in the tank. But the founder risk associated with Amazon shares is very much present: as much as any thriving company in the world, Amazon's success and ability to constantly stay a step ahead of competitors is a result of one person's vision and leadership. </p><p>Brilliant as Bezos is, he's not immortal. One wayward bus and shareholders could be left owning an awesome business that suddenly forgets the things that made it great. </p><p>Then there's Amazon Web Services. AWS is still tops in the cloud computing industry by a pretty large margin, but Microsoft's ( <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/msft-microsoft-corp\">MSFT</url>) Azure is routinely growing far faster than AWS, though from a smaller base. Microsoft doesn't break out revenue for Azure, just its       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/best-growth-stocks-to-buy\">growth rate</url>, but competition is clearly heating up, and it's not impossible to see AWS with stagnant or slightly declining market share in two or three years. </p><p>Adding more bells and whistles to AWS is the only way to defend against this; without differentiation cloud computing can be considered a commodity service sold on price. And Google Cloud, Alibaba ( <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/baba-alibaba-grp-shs-sponsored-american-deposit-share-repr-sh\">BABA</url>) Cloud, and competitors like IBM (       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/ibm-international-business-machines-corp\">IBM</url>) could eventually spell an end to AWS's meteoric margins. </p><p>A few other non-trivial issues that should concern the cautious investor debating whether they should invest in Amazon stock: the stock's valuation, and the increasingly likely risk of regulation. </p><p>Knowing how to properly value Amazon has always been tough, but a $900 billion company trading at 54 times forward earnings is unprecedented. And U.S. regulatory agencies recently came out and admitted they were looking at a handful of big <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/best-tech-stocks-to-buy-this-year\">tech companies</url>. Amazon was one of them. </p><p/><p/><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Bottom Line on Amazon Stock</emphasis></p><p>Amazon's one-of-a-kind CEO Jeff Bezos is in the same league as Steve Jobs. He's built a company with a culture that's so customer-centric that it practically has a mandate to be disruptive and ruthless. </p><p>And AWS, a result emblematic of the company's resolve to innovate, is a cash cow financing future innovations and investments, creating a self-perpetuating, accelerating process Bezos refers to as a \"flywheel.\" </p><p>Still, the main issue with AMZN stock in essence is this: The market seems to be pricing the company as if its current strengths won't weaken and its future execution will be perfect. The future, of course, is unpredictable. </p><p>Capitol Hill is increasingly wary of big tech, and as Amazon's size gives it monopoly-like power in certain spaces, regulators are taking notice. So are some of Amazon's most important business partners -- UPS recently announced it was going to stop delivering packages for the e-tailer.

If you've been watching television recently, you've probably heard the bad news. The Trump Administration is over, toast, cooked, done for good, and along with it any hope of the middle-class revolution that 63 million Americans voted for two years ago.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The reason for this tragedy is simple. The President has been caught committing felonies. Here's what the legal experts without law degrees are saying on television.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE O'DONNELL, THE LAST WORD WITH LAWRENCE O'DONNELL HOST, MSNBC: If precedent means anything in the Trump era, Donald Trump will be, must be, impeached because of the crimes prosecutors say he committed in the Michael Cohen case.</p><p>ROBERT E. MOOK, FORMER POLITICAL CAMPAIGN STRATEGIST AND CAMPAIGN MANAGER, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Both parties need to get on board to pass articles of impeachment.</p><p>EDDIE GLAUDE, CHAIR, CENTER FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN STUDIES: You have conspiracy, you have - you have obstruction, you have campaigns finance and you have emoluments.</p><p>If the Democrats do not pursue this vigorously, they will be, in some ways, held accountable for abdicating their responsibility.</p><p>It goes to the moral question, the ethical question. Democracy is at stake.</p><p>MAXINE MOORE WATERS, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR CALIFORNIA'S 43RD CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, DEMOCRATIC PARTY MEMBER: This criminal must be brought up by the Congress of the United States for impeachment.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: We're not even (ph) going to show you the Don Lemon tape. There's a lot of emotion there. But to sum up, they're telling us that we're staring down the barrel of a constitutional crisis. And that crisis stems from what MSNBC describes as, quote, the crimes prosecutors say the President committed in the Michael Cohen case.</p><p>Which crimes were those? We have the answer. The relevant details were spelled out in a piece that ran over the weekend in The New York Times under this headline. \"Prosecutors say Trump directed illegal payments during campaign.\"</p><p>The gist of the story is this. Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, has told federal prosecutors that he facilitated payments to two women who said they had affairs with Donald Trump. And then, well actually that's it. That's the entire story right there.</p><p>Paying these two women, say federal prosecutors and their flacks at NBC News, was a serious crime, a crime worthy of impeachment, if not, indictment. OK. But you might be wondering, how exactly is that criminal? Well, we're going to explain it to you.</p><p>We're going to start by stipulating that everything Michael Cohen has told the feds is absolutely true. Now, assuming honesty isn't usually a wise idea with Michael Cohen, but for the sake of argument, let's do it in this case, everything he says is true, why is what Cohen is alleging a criminal offense?</p><p>Remember the facts of the story. These are undisputed. Two women approached Donald Trump and threatened to ruin his career and humiliate his family if he doesn't give them money. Now, that sounds like a classic case of extortion.</p><p>Yet, for whatever reason, Trump caves to it, and he directs Michael Cohen to pay the ransom. Now, more than two years later, Trump is a felon for doing this. It doesn't seem to make any sense.</p><p>Oh, but you're not a federal prosecutor on a political mission. If you were a federal prosecutor on a political mission, you would construe those extortion payments as campaign contributions. You'd do this even though the money in question did not come from or go to Donald Trump's presidential campaign.</p><p>Then you'd claim that Trump and Michael Cohen violated campaign finance law because they didn't publicly disclose those payments despite the fact that disclosing them would nullify the reason for making them in the first place, which was to keep the whole thing secret.</p><p>That is the argument you would make, both in federal court and through your proxies on cable television. It is insultingly stupid. But because everyone in power hates the target of your investigation, nobody would question you, and that's what's happening right now.</p><p>Now, by this reasoning, any money a political candidate spends to maintain or protect his image while running for office now qualifies as a regulated campaign donation, and has to be disclosed. That would include, by the way, in addition to an infinite number of other things, buying toothpaste and getting a haircut.</p><p>It would definitely include the taxpayer-financed slush fund that Congress has set aside to pay off its own sexual harassment claims. Yes, those now qualify as campaign contributions. They must be publicly disclosed, except, of course, they're not publicly disclosed, and they never will be. Why is that?</p><p>Well that might be a question for Congressional leaders including, now that we think about it, Congressman Adam Schiff of Burbank, California. He's the incoming Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, a very powerful man in the Congress.</p><p>What does Mr. Schiff have to say about Congress not disclosing the very same payments that Democrats say Trump should be impeached for not disclosing? Let's ask him.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ADAM BENNETT SCHIFF, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR CALIFORNIA'S 28TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, DEMOCRATIC PARTY MEMBER: There's a very real prospect that on the day Donald Trump leaves office the Justice Department may indict him that he may be the first president in quite some time to face the real prospect of jail time.</p><p>NEAL KUMAR KATYAL, LAWYER, FORMER ACTING SOLICITOR GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES, LAW PROFESSOR AT GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY: Trump knows that he's facing some pretty strong criminal liability when he leaves office, one way or another. And, you know, even if a (ph) sitting president can't be indicted, he's got to know his future looks like it's behind bars unless he cuts some sort of deal with the prosecutors.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: So to translate, Trump's a criminal. He's going to jail for committing a smaller version of the same made-up crime that we in Congress have committed for years and forced you to pay for.</p><p>And, by the way, we're never apologizing for that because we don't have to and CNN isn't going to make us. Screw you, America, and your stupid election. We are in charge. That's the real message here, in case you missed it.</p><p>Chris Hahn is a radio host and former aide to Senator Chuck Schumer, and he joins us tonight.</p><p>So, Chris, I think you don't like Trump but that's fine. But speak slowly so I can understand. Explain to me why paying off someone who is extorting you, threatening to make public details of your personal life, if she doesn't get paid, why paying that person is a felony?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER HAHN, AMERICAN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, DEMOCRATIC PARTY ACTIVIST, RADIO SHOW HOST, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, first of all, we don't know that there was actual extortion here. We know that a payment was made. There was a catch and kill deal with the National Enquirer. Whether or not it was extortion, that hasn't been proven yet, nor has it even really been alleged in many cases--</p><p>CARLSON: Well, I'm--</p><p>HAHN: --by the President. He's not saying--</p><p>CARLSON: --I'm alleging, I'm - hold on, let me--</p><p>HAHN: --he's not say--</p><p>CARLSON: --let me just stop and say, I'm alleging it because it's obvious. You're not going to pay a $100,000 or a $150,000 or $200,000 to someone unless there's a threat to you and your reputation. This is extortion.</p><p>And I don't - I don't know why it's not being prosecuted. I don't know - I don't know why Trump isn't defending himself on those grounds, I would. But it clearly is extortion.</p><p>HAHN: Well--</p><p>CARLSON: But why is it a crime to pay off--</p><p>HAHN: --well sometimes people want--</p><p>CARLSON: --someone--</p><p>HAHN: --sometimes people--</p><p>CARLSON: --who you had an affair with?</p><p>HAHN: --sometimes people want to tell us - they want to tell a story that he doesn't want told. He said--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>HAHN: --hey, just tell it to me. I'll pay for it and--</p><p>CARLSON: That's extortion. It's--</p><p>HAHN: --and pay for yourselves (ph). That's what he did--</p><p>CARLSON: --that's - that's what - if I did that to you--</p><p>HAHN: --in this situation.</p><p>CARLSON: --you would call it - if I said, \"Look, I know a detail about your sex life, Chris Hahn, and I'm going to tell it on my show on TV unless you pay me,\" that would be extortion, obviously. So, this is extortion. But leaving that aside, why is it a felony to pay women you've had sexual relationships with?</p><p>HAHN: It's not a felony. It's a felony to--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh.</p><p>HAHN: --do a campaign expenditure and not - and not disclose it, and that's what this has been.</p><p>CARLSON: How is that a campaign expenditure?</p><p>HAHN: This seems to have been a campaign - he - he made this during the campaign for the purposes of the campaign. There are tape recordings of him discussing this with Michael Cohen. And that's just one--</p><p>CARLSON: Well, for the purposes of the campaign, I'm - wait--</p><p>HAHN: --look, this isn't even the - this is just a--</p><p>CARLSON: --no, but, wait, hold on, wait, hold on, I'm confused. No, it's not a small thing. It's the thing. This is the crime that The New York Time told us on Saturday, federal prosecutors are alleging the President committed, it's a felony, and Michael Cohen pled guilty--</p><p>HAHN: Well they also--</p><p>CARLSON: --to a species of this. So, I just want to get to the bottom of it. Why is that a campaign--</p><p>HAHN: Well, they're also alleging--</p><p>CARLSON: --contribution to pay off a former girlfriend? I'm honestly confused. You're a campaign guy, tell me.</p><p>HAHN: They're - look, there's also an allegation that he may have violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act when he was doing his deal in Moscow.</p><p>CARLSON: Well there are (ph) allegations that he killed Kennedy.</p><p>HAHN: There are a lot more to this than just paying off--</p><p>CARLSON: But I want - but hold on, no, no, no, no -</p><p>HAHN: --there's - there's a lot--</p><p>CARLSON: --OK--</p><p>HAHN: --there's a lot more to this than just paying off--</p><p>CARLSON: --OK, well how about one allegation--</p><p>HAHN: --porn stars who he slept with--</p><p>CARLSON: --slow down (ph), one allegation--</p><p>HAHN: --you know, a couple years ago.</p><p>CARLSON: --one allegation at a time. So, federal prosecutors--</p><p>HAHN: OK.</p><p>CARLSON: --this is not just something that dumb people on TV are talking about, though they are. This is something that--</p><p>HAHN: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --prosecutors in New York State are saying they have, apparently, evidence to indict over. So, tell me why because lot of people in - in Washington pay off their girlfriends, including lots of people in Congress, a lot of people in Congress, including I, even, guess some Democrats, just throwing that out there. So, tell me why that's a campaign--</p><p>HAHN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --contribution to pay off your girlfriend?</p><p>HAHN: Well, first of all, I think that fund that Congress was using to pay people off who were harassed needs to be disclosed and the Members who were involved with those disclosure decisions need to be removed--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, I'm sure that'll happen right away. That'll happen right away.</p><p>HAHN: --from Congress right now. OK. I--</p><p>CARLSON: I'm sure MSNBC will push--</p><p>HAHN: I agree with you - I agree with you on that.</p><p>CARLSON: --real hard for that. Right, OK so but--</p><p>HAHN: I - I agree with you on--</p><p>CARLSON: --but tell me why it's a campaign--</p><p>HAHN: --I agree with you on that point.</p><p>CARLSON: --this is central question. Why is it and for all of us--</p><p>HAHN: Well, look, well--</p><p>CARLSON: --why is that a campaign contribution?</p><p>HAHN: --well here's the thing.</p><p>CARLSON: The money didn't come from the campaign. It didn't go to the campaign. It was a threat to his reputation and his livelihood, as all extortion is, right? So, why is that a campaign--</p><p>HAHN: There's black--</p><p>CARLSON: --contribution?</p><p>HAHN: --there's black letter law. There's black letter law here, OK?</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Well what is it?</p><p>HAHN: The campaign finance law is pretty clear about what you can and cannot do with funds. And these funds were not necessarily from Trump's own pockets. There was all sorts of schemes put together by the President and Michael Cohen to move this money around, so it wasn't traced back to - to - to President Trump.</p><p>CARLSON: But - but hold on, no--</p><p>HAHN: That in and of itself should--</p><p>CARLSON: --no, no, no, no, no--</p><p>HAHN: --raise red flags. You would be--</p><p>CARLSON: --no, no, you know, wait, stop, stop, stop, stop, no, no, no, no--</p><p>HAHN: --people would be blowing their mind off right now--</p><p>CARLSON: --wait, wait, stop, stop, stop, stop--</p><p>HAHN: --if you're (ph) the President.</p><p>CARLSON: --maybe. I mean we've never had a president like Trump in a million different ways. And I'm not defending--</p><p>HAHN: No, we never have.</p><p>CARLSON: --I'm not defending his personal life. I'm merely saying--</p><p>HAHN: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --this is now being described as a felony, as a crime for which the President could be removed. So, now is the time when we need to be very specific about what the crime is because you're - you've stopped all business of government, so we can respond to this. So, let's respond right now. Tell me how and where--</p><p>HAHN: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --in campaign finance law it says, you're not allowed to use your money, there's no allegation this was campaign money, your money to pay off a former girlfriend? There isn't and that's this made-up (ph)--</p><p>HAHN: Oh, this is not--</p><p>CARLSON: --it's a lie--</p><p>HAHN: --the allegation here is not--</p><p>CARLSON: --actually.</p><p>HAHN: --the allegation here is not that it's just his money. There's allegation that he moved money around through various schemes--</p><p>CARLSON: No, but not - they're not from the campaign--</p><p>HAHN: --to pay these women off--</p><p>CARLSON: --no, but, by the way--</p><p>HAHN: --including with the (ph) man who--</p><p>CARLSON: --you're allowed to do that too.</p><p>HAHN: --hold on a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait--</p><p>CARLSON: You're allowed to hide the payments.</p><p>HAHN: --he hid the payments--</p><p>CARLSON: What, is that a crime now--</p><p>HAHN: --that was campaign in nature--</p><p>CARLSON: --if it's your money?</p><p>HAHN: --that is a violation of--</p><p>CARLSON: Why does a campaign and (ph)--</p><p>HAHN: --a clear violation of campaign finance laws.</p><p>CARLSON: --hold on till then (ph), I'm giving you a chance on TV--</p><p>HAHN: It needed to be disclosed--</p><p>CARLSON: --hold on, hold on. No, no, just I'll let you speak and I'll let you speak slowly--</p><p>HAHN: Go ahead.</p><p>CARLSON: --so our audience can understand. Where in campaign finance law does it say that taking money that's not from your political campaign to respond to an extortion attempt to pay off your girlfriend or pay the gardener, pay anybody, why is that a felony? And where does it say that?</p><p>HAHN: Camp--</p><p>CARLSON: What are you talking about?</p><p>HAHN: --campaign finance law - look, I'm not going to quote the section and verse. I don't know it off the top of my head--</p><p>CARLSON: Paraphrase it for me.</p><p>HAHN: --even though I'm a lawyer. Campaign finance - campaign finance law clearly states that any money spent for campaign purposes, specifically by people other than the candidate, must be disclosed. This is what's--</p><p>CARLSON: But why is that a campaign--</p><p>HAHN: --being alleged right here--</p><p>CARLSON: --purpose?</p><p>HAHN: --hold on, hold on, hold on--</p><p>CARLSON: What (ph)?</p><p>HAHN: --the President and Michael Cohen clearly set up a scheme so that other people could pay these women off on behalf of Donald Trump while he was running--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. OK. That--</p><p>HAHN: --for President because--</p><p>CARLSON: --that's fine but--</p><p>HAHN: --they thought that these (ph) allegations would sink his campaign and his reputation.</p><p>CARLSON: But - but maybe - maybe under--</p><p>HAHN: That's a violation.</p><p>CARLSON: --no, actually, because anybody faced, I'm not, you know, I don't know a single man who faced with that allegation, who he (ph) thought he could squelch it wouldn't pay the person off because it does incalculable damage to your reputation, whether you're running for anything or not.</p><p>And so, that's - it's so clearly not a campaign violation that I wonder if we want to set this precedent. Do you want to live in a world where people paying off extortion attempts are now campaign finance felons? I mean this is lunatic.</p><p>HAHN: This is strike--</p><p>CARLSON: And you know it.</p><p>HAHN: --this - this is strikingly similar to what happened to John Edwards.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, and it's awful. It's awful what happened to--</p><p>HAHN: I'm not saying the President will be convicted but--</p><p>CARLSON: --John Edwards--</p><p>HAHN: --this is strikingly--</p><p>CARLSON: --I thought.</p><p>HAHN: --similar--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, it is. It is.</p><p>HAHN: --situation.</p><p>CARLSON: And what happened to him was--</p><p>HAHN: And it is something, look--</p><p>CARLSON: --wrong. It was another populace--</p><p>HAHN: --well--</p><p>CARLSON: --they took out with this BS campaign finance nonsense, exactly what happened.</p><p>HAHN: --look, it is more than--</p><p>CARLSON: And, you know (ph), we're out of time.</p><p>HAHN: --campaign finance law.</p><p>CARLSON: --no.</p><p>HAHN: It's more than campaign finance law.</p><p>CARLSON: No, it's not.</p><p>HAHN: It is the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.</p><p>CARLSON: No, it's a totally separate thing.</p><p>HAHN: That in and of itself is a problem--</p><p>CARLSON: Look, if - if he violated that I will (ph) defend it.</p><p>HAHN: Well, yes. And then (ph) also alleged by Cohen is--</p><p>CARLSON: But in this case, this is made-up.</p><p>HAHN: --also part of this.</p><p>CARLSON: All right, Chris Hahn, thank you.</p><p>HAHN: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Good to see you.</p><p>One of the most hysterical reactions in the past few days came from a former Obama Administration U.S. Attorney, who says the President should be stripped of his office.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARBARA MCQUADE, FORMER UNITED STATES ATTORNEY FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF MICHIGAN, PROFESSOR OF LAW AT UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN LAW SCHOOL, LEGAL ANALYST FOR NBC NEWS AND MSNBC: It could be that President Trump procured the presidency by fraud.</p><p>When immigrants procure their citizenship by fraud, we strip them of their citizenship. When a president procures his presidency by fraud, should we consider doing the same?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Alan Dershowitz is, of course, a retired Harvard Law School professor. He's the Author of the book, The Case Against Impeaching Trump, and he joins us tonight.</p><p>Professor, I got a couple questions. But the first relates just to the sound bite we played. Is there a provision in the Constitution for stripping, whatever that means, stripping the presidency from a President who you think is illegitimate, whatever that means?</p><p>ALAN MORTON DERSHOWITZ, LAWYER, THE CASE AGAINST IMPEACHING TRUMP AUTHOR, HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR EMERITUS: Sure. It's called the 25th Amendment, but not on the grounds of illegitimacy. I want everyone out there to imagine the following scenario.</p><p>Let's assume when Bill Clinton was running for president, Paula Jones came up to him and said, \"Unless you pay me a $130,000, I'll reveal our affair.\"</p><p>And let's assume, Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, together, did exactly what it's alleged that Donald Trump and Cohen did together, I guarantee you The New York Times, NBC, MSNBC would be railing against any prosecutor who dared to suggest that this was a violation of the campaign (ph) finance law. Everybody would be on the other side of this issue.</p><p>There'd be Republicans out there saying, \"Strip him of the presidency, impeach him, indict him.\" Every Democrat would be saying this is a witch- hunt, this is terrible. We need a single standard. If you wouldn't go after Bill Clinton, don't go after Donald Trump.</p><p>If you're going after Donald Trump, then you have to go after Hillary Clinton for everything that she allegedly did. For example, one of your guests talked about a Federal Corrupt Practices Act. That applies when you bribe a foreign official.</p><p>What they're arguing is that there was a rumor that maybe somebody offered Putin a penthouse in a Tower that Trump was thinking of building in Moscow. And if that had been done, it would be a violation of the FCPA, Federal Corrupt Practices Act.</p><p>But it's all based on hypotheticals and maybes. And I just want everybody to apply the shoe on the other foot test. If Hillary Clinton were president, the Republicans were saying, \"Lock her up,\" everybody would be on the other side. They'd be screaming about how dare you expand criminal statutes, how dare you expand the criteria for impeachment?</p><p>Now, all these liberal Democrat fair-weather civil libertarians are saying, \"The hell with the Constitution, the hell with civil liberties, put all that aside, get Trump.\" That's the most important consideration. Get him by any means possible. This is such a danger to our constitutional system that I would hope that true civil libertarians would rebel against that, as I am.</p><p>CARLSON: Is - is it unfair to describe this scenario as extortion? I say I know something about your sex life. I know a secret about you that you want to keep the - that's non-criminal (ph), but that you want to keep hidden. And unless you pay me money, I'm going to reveal it. That seems like textbook extortion to me. Why is it not?</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: It is absolutely textbook extortion. And there ought to be a prosecution of any person, man or woman, who approaches any candidate or anybody else and says, \"Unless you pay me money, I'm going to reveal a sex act that occurred.\" That is absolute classic extortion.</p><p>And it's shocking that the Special Counsel looking into this, who has a broad mandate, he described it very broadly, isn't looking into the extortion committed by, at least, the porn star, whose lawyer obviously approached the candidate or the candidate's people, and threatened exposure.</p><p>Otherwise, why would you pay? Just listen to the tape. The tape makes that clear. The tape that Cohen made unwittingly of President Trump, it's clear that they were paying off an extortion--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: --in order to prevent these issues from coming out for multiple reasons, to protect his family, to protect his brand--</p><p>CARLSON: Sure.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: --possibly, to influence the campaign.</p><p>Let's remember one more thing. A President can contribute to a candidate as much as he wants. If - if Bloomberg runs for president, he could announce tomorrow, \"I'm not taking a nickel. I'm putting $1 billion of my own money into this campaign.\"</p><p>That's perfectly legitimate. As far as reporting is concerned, it's the campaign that has to report. And if these payments had to be reported, they had to be reported after the election, the reporting time was after the election so, it couldn't have impacted the election.</p><p>So, the absurd notion that he won the presidency by fraud and should be stripped of the presidency (ph) reflects incredible ignorance about the timing here, and how these statutes operate.</p><p>CARLSON: This is getting so crazy, it's - it's making my head spin. I appreciate your coming on and explaining that to us, professor. Thank you very much.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Well we've been saying it for a couple of years. Now, we have hard scientific evidence that, in fact, big tech is altering and harming the brains of children. Is it time to do something about that? What if we knew it was true? Well we do know it's true now. We've got details next.</p><p>TEXT: TECH TYRANNY.</p><p>CARLSON: Well Google collects more data than probably any other company, and probably knows more about you than you do. You think this might raise some concerns about the concentration of power.</p><p>But, for years, Congress seems to have cared not at all either because they were ideologically predisposed to Google or because they were in its pocket. Meanwhile, Google became more and more powerful, ominously powerful.</p><p>Now, finally, during the lame-duck session, Congress has summoned the CEO of Google, Sundar Pichai, to answer some questions about data transparency, coming to Capitol Hill this week. What should Congress ask him about?</p><p>Harmeet Dhillon has followed this issue maybe more closely than any other attorney in the United States, and she joins us tonight. Harmeet, thank you very much for coming on. So what--</p><p>HARMEET DHILLON, AMERICAN LAWYER, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL LAWYERS ASSOCIATION BOARD MEMBER, FORMER VICE CHAIRWOMAN OF THE CALIFORNIA REPUBLICAN PARTY, AND THE NATIONAL COMMITTEEWOMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE FOR CALIFORNIA: Hi, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: --what should be the - the list of questions?</p><p>DHILLON: Well, this is only a subset of the issues that people should be asking Google that is the subject of the testimony tomorrow. But Google, for years, as you pointed out, has been collecting data, and not disclosing to users, number one, the extent of the collection of the data or what they're doing with the data.</p><p>We have also learned of significant breaches, including today, an announcement of a major breach of 52.5 million users on the Google+ failed experiment in social media. It's not clear when that happened.</p><p>Google is not disclosing to people exactly what happened and what use has been made of it. And they, as you pointed out, they just get away with it, because we have both effete politicians in Washington, even on the Republican side, and government agencies whose tasks it is to examine these issues, and protect consumers. So, consumers are really at a complete loss.</p><p>Now, what I expect to happen on Capitol Hill tomorrow is that there'll be some posturing questions written by staffers that Members of Congress are going to read out, and you're going to have some focus group tested jargony, you know, in - incomprehensible responses from Sundar Pichai designed to placate these folks.</p><p>There'll be a little bit of a dance and everybody will go home, not understanding what the answers were, and not probably going to do anything about it. And this is a real tragedy and missed opportunity, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: What a shame? I want to (ph) ask you another story, another element of the Google story.</p><p>Newly leaked email show that several Google employees plotted to destroy the news site, Breitbart, after the 2016 election, a secret internal discussion group labeled Resist. Google employees discussed how they could use the, quote, hate speech and fake news labels to justify cutting off Breitbart's ad revenues.</p><p>Harmeet, this is kind of the stuff of Conservative fever dreams that Google would be actually doing something like this. Are you surprised by it? And what can be done, in response?</p><p>DHILLON: Well Google - A, I'm not surprised. B, Google is denying it. But there's extensive evidence that Google did this, and they did it in two ways.</p><p>One way is right after the election, as you mentioned, a number of very excitable Left-wing Google executives and employees tried to squeeze Breitbart and other Conservative outlets into this hate speech category.</p><p>They then confessed that after a lot of effort that was really tough. So, they also did a two-pronged approach, and the other side of that approach is having their ad people contact customers and tell them that it might be dangerous or a bad idea to advertise or allow their ads to be placed on Conservative news websites like Breitbart and others.</p><p>And they pointed to some outside groups like Sleeping Giant that makes it a - a business practice of defaming Conservative writers and organizations, and use that as a smear.</p><p>Google also does this in many other ways like through its YouTube. It categorizes content as sensitive, which automatically, both, makes it hard to find the content online, and also strips that content from the ability to gain advertising revenue.</p><p>So, Google is doing this systematically. Google is doing this purposefully. Google is getting away with doing this. And I think it violates not just some laws, including Communications Decency Act and others, but it - it violates state laws that have to do with fraud and transparency, unfair business practices and competition.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>DHILLON: Again, Google is able to get away with this because, you know, they - they contribute to some Conservative groups like CPAC, lot of money to show up at CPAC, and - and certainly on Capitol Hill.</p><p>They get away with it, and we see nothing done to control this - this, you know, duopoly and monopoly on advertising revenue. It's very dangerous because it's shaping what young people in America, who mainly get their news through--</p><p>CARLSON: Of course.</p><p>DHILLON: --Google see every day.</p><p>CARLSON: Looking back, the Congress allowing Google to become more powerful than the U.S. government, subverting our democracy entirely, that'll be the thing we hold Members responsible for, I think, historically.</p><p>Harmeet Dhillon, you will not be held responsible since you're a lonely voice on the right side, thank you for joining us, as always.</p><p>DHILLON: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Meanwhile, we've been saying it for years. Now, there is hard scientific evidence that big tech is, in fact, harming our children.</p><p>New 60 Minutes report this week highlighted research that shows children who use tablet smartphones and other screens more than seven hours a day, and that's a lot of kids, believe it or not, are developing different brain structures. Their brains are being damaged by this.</p><p>Tom Kersting is a psychotherapist, who's written extensively on this subject, and he joins us tonight. You must feel vindicated by this report, Tom.</p><p>TOM KERSTING, PSYCHOTHERAPIST, DISCONNECTED AUTHOR: I do. I do. I'm actually happy to see it, to be honest with you because--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --it's something I've been speaking about for so many years at lectures and in my book. And now, we could finally have some scientific preliminary evidence showing exactly what all of this tech is doing to the brain.</p><p>CARLSON: So, what is it doing?</p><p>KERSTING: Well, first of all, the area of the brain called the cortex, which is the outer layer of the brain, the preliminary study that the - the research has conducted, shows a - a premature thinning of that part of the brain, OK, which is - which is kind of frightening, considering the importance of that part of the brain, what it does, how it's very important just for human beings in terms of organizing, planning, and a host of other different things.</p><p>Another component that you don't hear much about is something called neuroplasticity, which is actually the greatest breakthrough in modern day psychology. And the term plasticity meaning that the brain, although very strong and rigid, can be molded and shaped if placed in - in the right environment for three or more hours per day.</p><p>We know that the average kid is spending nine hours a day, on average, in what I consider to be the most highly stimulating of worlds. And what happens is the brain will actually grow new neural pathways, it'll re- organize its circuitry to adapt to that cyber world.</p><p>And the problem is what I'm seeing clinically is an unadapting of - of young kids in a real world having a very difficult time coping with just the trivial nuances of life, the anxiety disorders, the depressions, and so forth.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. Well and it's all kinds of measurements are showing the horrifying results of it. How young, exactly, are kids getting addicted?</p><p>KERSTING: Well, we're seeing right now that there's some - some research that came out recently that there - there's the kids as - as young as two years old showing signs of depression. And, right now, the average age for first smartphone issuance is about age 10.</p><p>And, you know, when I give lectures, every parent knows that this is bad. But it's sort of, you know, what you talk about it you love (ph) the - the term groupthink. I - I use the term social conformity.</p><p>We tend to do what everybody else is doing. And parents, anybody listening, you have got to do what is in the best interest of your child, not - not what everybody else around you is doing.</p><p>CARLSON: So, can you just give me the 20-second answer to the question I always ask you, which is why are we so passive in the face of this? If two- year-olds were huffing on Marlboros, we'd say, \"You know what? No, not allowed.\" But we just sort of sit back and let our society collapse in the face of this, why?</p><p>KERSTING: Well, the reason, in my opinion, the reason why is - and we talk about - I always talk about common sense, all right?</p><p>It's pretty clear, if we go walk around and everybody's got their heads buried in a device all day long, you pull up to a traffic light, and they can't even contain themselves for a minute without looking at their device, it's pretty clear that it's having an impact on their behavior.</p><p>Now, the reason why nobody is--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --doing anything about it is because we're always looking for scientific evidence, all right, and now we have some of it, and we're going to start seeing a lot more of it. And--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --and we're going to start seeing some changes, as a result, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, and it's we waited too long for the studies to confirm the obvious. Tom, thank you very much.</p><p>KERSTING: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, Hollywood doesn't need to remake 1984 again, not that they would, it's probably illegal. But they already do a perfect job of replicating it in real life. They are living the plotline of George Orwell's novel. Kevin Hart is the latest person to be destroyed for statements that he made many years ago. We'll tell you his story after the break.</p><p>TEXT: AMERICA'S NEWS HQ.</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Live from America's News headquarters, I'm Trace Gallagher.</p><p>No bail decision yet for a top Chinese executive who's facing possible extradition from Canada to the U.S. The case of Meng Wanzhou has fueled U.S.-China trade tensions and rocked financial markets.</p><p>Meng is the Chief Financial Officer of telecommunications giant, Huawei. She was detained December 1st during a layover in Vancouver. She's accused of misleading banks about the company's business dealings in Iran.</p><p>There is a concerning uptick in paralyzing illness among children. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now says there have been more cases than ever. There are a 158 confirmed cases so far this year.</p><p>The illness called acute flaccid myelitis causes paralysis in the face, neck, back, arms or legs. The symptoms usually come a week following a fever and respiratory illness.</p><p>I'm Trace Gallagher, now back to Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Hollywood has issued a new decree. And, of course, everyone obeyed immediately. Kevin Hart's career must be destroyed.</p><p>Just days after the Comedian was announced as the next Host of the Oscars, the now-irrelevant awards show some people still watch, Hart was forced to step down over tweets and stand-up routines from about a decade ago that some said were anti-gay.</p><p>Now, these tweets had already come to light. Hart had already apologized for them and said he was changing his routine, but it didn't matter. In today's political environment, there is no such thing as forgiveness or mercy. What you're seeing is, instead, a particularly powerful form of bullying. Do and think exactly as we say, or else.</p><p>Larry Elder has fought the forces of conformity for a long time. He's a radio show host from Los Angeles, and he joins us tonight. We're really glad to have you, Larry Elder, thank you. So, what's the takeaway from watching what just happened to Kevin Hart?</p><p>LARRY ELDER, RADIO SHOW HOST, WRITER, ATTORNEY: The takeaway, Tucker, is what the devil are the rules. As you pointed out--</p><p>CARLSON: Right. I got it (ph).</p><p>ELDER: --Kevin Hart did these tweets some years ago and - and made anti-gay references in his stand-up some years ago. He apologized back in 2015. The Academy Award people wanted him to apologize again. He refused.</p><p>Now, the show is going to be carried by ABC. ABC parent company is Disney. Disney also owns ESPN. They've employed Keith Olbermann, who is a - a Trump hater from way back. And just last year, he tweeted that Trump was a Nazi and dropped a bunch of F-bombs in his tweet. That didn't seem to bother Disney. But Kevin Hart has to go.</p><p>The other inconsistency, of course, is that other comedians like Amy Schumer, who last year, I think it was, hosted a Democratic fundraiser, has used the - the F-word for gays in a tweet, as has Sarah Silverman, as has Chelsea Handler, all of whom have hosted shows.</p><p>And finally, you have the instance of Joy Ann Reid on MSNBC who had a blog 2007, 2008--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>ELDER: --a very anti-gay post she made, and she wasn't joking, she wasn't a comedian, including dissing the movie Brokeback Mountain, and said she hated watching men kiss. She then said she apologized.</p><p>Then, later on, she said she was hacked. NBC did a search to find out whether or not she'd been hacked. Turned out she wasn't hacked. So, she either misremembered or lied, and then apologized again. She has a show on MSNBC. So, forgive Kevin Hart for not - for not knowing what the rules are.</p><p>CARLSON: Well that's and - so, but what's the best response? I think you're absolutely right. All of us at some point are going to be accused of thoughtcrime, and the mob will come for us. It's inevitable.</p><p>ELDER: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: How do we respond? What's the best way to respond?</p><p>ELDER: You do them on a case-by-case basis. The man apologized, said he had grown. The - the most horrific tweet was saying that if he came home and saw his son playing with his daughter's dollhouse, he'd break the dollhouse over his head. He later on said, he apologized, he's grown as a man--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>ELDER: --and perhaps the tweet had to do with his own insecurities as a man. So, I think that's what you do. You apologize, be sincere, and then keep going.</p><p>But if people keep beating you over the - over the head over it over and over again, they're not going to forgive you, I'm not sure what the point is, which is why I believe that Kevin Hart was morally justified in saying, I've already apologized, I'm not going to apologize again.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>ELDER: I'm a 40-year old man. I've apologized. I've grown, let it alone.</p><p>CARLSON: I mean what happens to a society where the mob feels it has ultimate authority on judgment? No one believes in God, so they have to make their own judgments, hard and fast judgments--</p><p>ELDER: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --and no forgiveness is allowed.</p><p>ELDER: Yes. And what happens to a society that's - that's so inconsistent? For example, Kanye West--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>ELDER: --is being called an Uncle Tom and a Token, a House Negro. That doesn't seem to bother anybody.</p><p>You got a guy in like Al Sharpton, who's got a show where he's referred to gays as - as homos in the - in years past, Jews as interlopers. He - he falsely accused a White man of raping a Black teenager, he has a show on television, you know, every weekend.</p><p>So, you know, I'm not quite sure what to say, Tucker, other than it's terribly inconsistent. It seem to me there's one rule for people who are Conservative and one rule for people--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>ELDER: --who are on the Left.</p><p>CARLSON: I think it's best just to ignore the noise to the extent you can. I mean they have an awful lot of power. You know, they'll de-platform you in a second. Larry Elder--</p><p>ELDER: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --we're rooting for you.</p><p>ELDER: Thank you. I need--</p><p>CARLSON: If they ever try to leave you, you'd (ph)--</p><p>ELDER: --I could use the help.</p><p>CARLSON: --always have a home on this show. Good to see you.</p><p>ELDER: I could use the help. Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you.</p><p>Well China just launched a new persecution of the country's Christians. Will anyone in Washington care? Are they too busy taking Chinese money?</p><p>Plus, Paris continues to be convulsed by the worst riots there in 50 years. What are these riots about? You know what they're about. They're about the Paris Climate Treaty, the spirit of it, anyway. And policies they want here are being rejected by both Left and Right in France, and they're ignoring it because it's too inconvenient to pay attention. Details ahead.</p><p>TEXT: THE CHINA THREAT.</p><p>CARLSON: China has launched a new crackdown. How many news stories begin with that sentence, \"China has launched a new crackdown?\" Many. And they have, once again, launched new crackdown, this time, on their country's underground Christian community.</p><p>In a coordinated sweep of nighttime raids, police rounded up about a 100 members and the pastor of the Early Rain Covenant Church. Because the church does not submit to government control, it is illegal in China. And members have been forbidden from attending services.</p><p>It's just the latest in a persecution wave that has shut down several different churches with thousands of Christian members. This is what actual religious oppression looks like, but a ruling class that's seen (ph) people who boycott North Carolina over its bathroom laws don't care at all.</p><p>None of them are calling for boycotts or sanctions on China. There's no witch-hunt against the countless universities, businesses, and lobbyists with massive financial ties to China, and its authoritarian regime.</p><p>In fact, to our ruling class, China is the future. If anything, it's a country we ought to emulate. So remember that, next time they try to lecture you about how their values are better than yours.</p><p>The war in Afghanistan, as you well know, has continued for 17 years. It's the longest war in the history of this country. We're still spending billions there. American soldiers are still dying there. It might all be worth it if we were still fighting for victory. But are we fighting for victory?</p><p>In a newly leaked audiotape, former NATO Commander, Stanley McChrystal, tells Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, how the war in Afghanistan should be fought.</p><p>It's not exactly the opening speech from Patton. \"My best suggestion,\" he says, \"Is to keep a limited number of forces there and just kind of muddle along, and see what we can do.\"</p><p>Now, muddle along is not a strategy for anything, much less a victory. It's a strategy to waste American money and lives for no reason at all. If U.S. troops are going to muddle along in a war, maybe it's a sign that's a war we shouldn't be fighting in the first place.</p><p>Well, if you can remember back a year-and-a-half, on June 1st, 2017, the President announced he was pulling this country out of the Paris Climate Accords. To hear the politicians and television news chintuggers (ph) react, you'd think it was the worst natural catastrophe, well, ever.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NANCY PELOSI, MINORITY LEADER OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA: What happened yesterday on the climate issue is an embarrassment to our country and it should be an embarrassment to him personally for how he answers to his grandchildren.</p><p>GOV. JERRY BROWN (D), CALIFORNIA: People are going to die. Habitat will be destroyed. Seas will rise. Insects will spread.</p><p>FAREED RAFIQ ZAKARIA, CNN'S FAREED ZAKARIA GPS HOST, POLITICAL SCIENTIST, AUTHOR, COLUMNIST: This will be the day that the United States resigned as the leader of the free world.</p><p>JOHN KERRY, FORMER UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE: He is not helping the forgotten American. He is hurting them. Their kids will have worse asthma in the summer.</p><p>The President who talked about putting America first has now put America last.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: These people are so stupid. It's amazing they have jobs. The economy must be pretty strong, in fact, if those people have health insurance. One thing they said though is true.</p><p>People were hurt, but not because we pulled out, but because other countries kept to the terms of the Paris Climate Accord, including France.</p><p>This fall, France began to implement a gas tax to fight climate change inspired by that agreement. Now, for the fourth weekend in a row, the city of Paris has been rocked by riots and mass protests. The city is burning and shows no signs of stopping.</p><p>What did this? Progressive climate policy. Will the people who formulated it ever admit it? Of course, not. They're too invested.</p><p>Well the press, all of a sudden, doing everything it can to kill Elizabeth Warren's presidential campaign before it even begins. That's kind of interesting. Is this a mercy killing or something else going on?</p><p>Mark Steyn joins us to unravel a delightful mystery, after the break.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ELIZABETH ANN WARREN, SENIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, MASSACHUSETTS: Now, the President likes to call my mom a liar. What do the facts say?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The facts suggest that you absolutely have a Native American ancestor in your pedigree.</p><p>WARREN: OK.</p><p>And Trump can say whatever he wants about me, but mocking Native Americans or any group in order to try to get at me? That's not what America stands for.</p><p>I'm not enrolled in a tribe and only tribes determine tribal citizenship. I understand and respect that distinction. But my family history is my family history.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: I mean (ph) you really just can't watch that enough. It really should be a screensaver. This hasn't, understatement of the day, been the fall Elizabeth Warren had hoped for.</p><p>She thought that releasing a DNA test showing that she might have had a lone American Indian ancestor, not necessarily from this continent, a few hundred years ago would silence the President and give her momentum going into the primaries next year.</p><p>Instead, even the Left is turning on her. Two pieces in the Washington Post and The New York Times in the past week suggests that Warren's campaign has been deeply, maybe even fatally, wounded by the blunder of the DNA test.</p><p>Looks almost like an effort to kill Elizabeth Warren's campaign before she can embarrass her party, the one to which everyone in the media belongs, before she actually runs.</p><p>Mark Steyn is an Author and Columnist. Not a conspiracy not, I'll run this by him anyway. So, what is going on?</p><p>So, obviously, she is a media creation, not a genius, but she has been the subject of endless fawning profiles in the press, particularly from the Boston Globe, which has promoted her for years, and now they're attacking her, why?</p><p>MARK STEYN, AUTHOR, COLUMNIST, STEYNONLINE.COM: Yes. That's - that's interesting. The Boston Globe is saying you - to Elizabeth Warren, you have to know when not to run. And this is the paper that's wanted her to run until she took--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --until she got head-faked into taking this DNA test that showed she was 1/1024th Native American, which is less Native American than the average.</p><p>I mean you could test Kim Jong-un, Vladimir Putin, and they would - they would be more than 1/1024th Native American just because some Cherokee happened to change trains in Odessa in - in 1852, and got lucky with one of the porters.</p><p>I mean any - every - anyone's more Native American. And what's fascinating- -</p><p>CARLSON: Ha-ha.</p><p>STEYN: --what's fascinating about this is that this - Elizabeth Warren was a test on the limits of Democrat identity politics because their recent presidential candidates have been sold on identity politics, but in rather strange ways.</p><p>So, Barack Obama is an African-American. But he has nothing to do with the Black slave experience or Civil Rights.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>STEYN: He's - he's Black just because his father happened to be a British subject born in Colonial Kenya. Barack Obama was actually the first child of British subjects to be President, I believe, since Andrew Jackson. So, he tried to get himself in on the colonial thing.</p><p>Obama said his step-grandfather in Indonesia had died fighting Dutch soldiers in the struggle for independence. In fact, it turned out his step- grandfather died when he fell off a chair while changing the drapes. That's not a joke. That's actually true. That's how his step-grandfather died.</p><p>Then you have Hillary Clinton, who's running as a feminist icon and is, in fact, only the candidate because she's the wife of the previous guy, and she was given a Senate seat as a reward for standing by him, when his intern's dress wound up in the FBI crime analysis lab - lab.</p><p>So, we have very--</p><p>CARLSON: Ha-ha.</p><p>STEYN: --so in such a world, you can't blame Elizabeth Warren for saying, \"Well, if Hillary could be a feminist icon, why can't I be the first Native American President?\"</p><p>She was Harvard Law School's first woman of color. That's why it's not a family law thing. She actually was promoted as Harvard Law School's first woman of color. Why shouldn't she be America's first - first Native American President?</p><p>CARLSON: Such a good (ph)--</p><p>STEYN: Since this is (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --such a good example (ph).</p><p>STEYN: --none - none of this identity politics. Joe Biden should run as the first transgender woman candidate and dare the Democrat electorate to call him on it.</p><p>CARLSON: That was my plan.</p><p>STEYN: I mean this is this (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: I hope he doesn't get there first.</p><p>STEYN: --no don't (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: I'm doing that (ph). You're the best.</p><p>STEYN: Yes (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: Mark Steyn, we're out of time.</p><p>STEYN: Thanks a lot, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: I loved it. Thank you.</p><p>STEYN: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: We'll be right back.</p><p>CARLSON: Man that was fun. Back tomorrow, 8 P.M., show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and, especially, groupthink. Good night from Washington. Sean Hannity.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2018121001cb260</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TY0-F851-JB20-G383-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8099\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 10, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0002JR3</classCode><className>NBC UNIVERSAL INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

If you've been watching television recently, you've probably heard the bad  news. The Trump Administration is over, toast, cooked, done for good, and  along with it any hope of the middle-class revolution that 63 million  Americans voted for two years ago.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The reason for this tragedy is simple. The President has been caught  committing felonies. Here's what the legal experts without law degrees are  saying on television.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LAWRENCE O'DONNELL, THE LAST WORD WITH LAWRENCE O'DONNELL HOST, MSNBC: If  precedent means anything in the Trump era, Donald Trump will be, must be,  impeached because of the crimes prosecutors say he committed in the Michael  Cohen case.</p><p>ROBERT E. MOOK, FORMER POLITICAL CAMPAIGN STRATEGIST AND CAMPAIGN  MANAGER,  CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Both parties need to get on board to pass  articles of impeachment.</p><p>EDDIE GLAUDE, CHAIR, CENTER FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN STUDIES: You have  conspiracy, you have - you have obstruction, you have campaigns finance and  you have emoluments. </p><p>If the Democrats do not pursue this vigorously, they will be, in some ways,  held accountable for abdicating their responsibility.</p><p>It goes to the moral question, the ethical question. Democracy is at stake.</p><p>MAXINE MOORE WATERS, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR CALIFORNIA'S 43RD  CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, DEMOCRATIC PARTY MEMBER: This criminal must be  brought up by the Congress of the United States for impeachment.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CARLSON: We're not even (ph) going to show you the Don Lemon tape. There's  a lot of emotion there. But to sum up, they're telling us that we're  staring down the barrel of a constitutional crisis. And that crisis stems  from what MSNBC describes as, quote, the crimes prosecutors say the  President committed in the Michael Cohen case.</p><p>Which crimes were those? We have the answer. The relevant details were  spelled out in a piece that ran over the weekend in The New York Times  under this headline. \"Prosecutors say Trump directed illegal payments  during campaign.\"</p><p>The gist of the story is this. Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, has  told federal prosecutors that he facilitated payments to two women who said  they had affairs with Donald Trump. And then, well actually that's it.  That's the entire story right there.</p><p>Paying these two women, say federal prosecutors and their flacks at NBC  News, was a serious crime, a crime worthy of impeachment, if not,  indictment. OK. But you might be wondering, how exactly is that criminal?  Well, we're going to explain it to you.</p><p>We're going to start by stipulating that everything Michael Cohen has told  the feds is absolutely true. Now, assuming honesty isn't usually a wise  idea with Michael Cohen, but for the sake of argument, let's do it in this  case, everything he says is true, why is what Cohen is alleging a criminal  offense?</p><p>Remember the facts of the story. These are undisputed. Two women approached  Donald Trump and threatened to ruin his career and humiliate his family if  he doesn't give them money. Now, that sounds like a classic case of  extortion.</p><p>Yet, for whatever reason, Trump caves to it, and he directs Michael Cohen  to pay the ransom. Now, more than two years later, Trump is a felon for  doing this. It doesn't seem to make any sense.</p><p>Oh, but you're not a federal prosecutor on a political mission. If you were  a federal prosecutor on a political mission, you would construe those  extortion payments as campaign contributions. You'd do this even though the  money in question did not come from or go to Donald Trump's presidential  campaign.</p><p>Then you'd claim that Trump and Michael Cohen violated campaign finance law  because they didn't publicly disclose those payments despite the fact that  disclosing them would nullify the reason for making them in the first  place, which was to keep the whole thing secret.</p><p>That is the argument you would make, both in federal court and through your  proxies on cable television. It is insultingly stupid. But because everyone  in power hates the target of your investigation, nobody would question you,  and that's what's happening right now.</p><p>Now, by this reasoning, any money a political candidate spends to maintain  or protect his image while running for office now qualifies as a regulated  campaign donation, and has to be disclosed. That would include, by the way,  in addition to an infinite number of other things, buying toothpaste and  getting a haircut.</p><p>It would definitely include the taxpayer-financed slush fund that Congress  has set aside to pay off its own sexual harassment claims. Yes, those now  qualify as campaign contributions. They must be publicly disclosed, except,  of course, they're not publicly disclosed, and they never will be. Why is  that?</p><p>Well that might be a question for Congressional leaders including, now that  we think about it, Congressman Adam Schiff of Burbank, California. He's the  incoming Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, a very powerful man  in the Congress. </p><p>What does Mr. Schiff have to say about Congress not disclosing the very  same payments that Democrats say Trump should be impeached for not  disclosing? Let's ask him.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ADAM BENNETT SCHIFF, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR CALIFORNIA'S 28TH  CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, DEMOCRATIC PARTY MEMBER: There's a very real  prospect that on the day Donald Trump leaves office the Justice Department  may indict him that he may be the first president in quite some time to  face the real prospect of jail time.</p><p>NEAL KUMAR KATYAL, LAWYER, FORMER ACTING SOLICITOR GENERAL OF THE UNITED  STATES, LAW PROFESSOR AT GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY: Trump knows that he's  facing some pretty strong criminal liability when he leaves office, one way  or another. And, you know, even if a (ph) sitting president can't be  indicted, he's got to know his future looks like it's behind bars unless he  cuts some sort of deal with the prosecutors.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: So to translate, Trump's a criminal. He's going to jail for  committing a smaller version of the same made-up crime that we in Congress  have committed for years and forced you to pay for. </p><p>And, by the way, we're never apologizing for that because we don't have to  and CNN isn't going to make us. Screw you, America, and your stupid  election. We are in charge. That's the real message here, in case you  missed it.</p><p>Chris Hahn is a radio host and former aide to Senator Chuck Schumer, and he  joins us tonight. </p><p>So, Chris, I think you don't like Trump but that's fine. But speak slowly  so I can understand. Explain to me why paying off someone who is extorting  you, threatening to make public details of your personal life, if she  doesn't get paid, why paying that person is a felony?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER HAHN, AMERICAN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, DEMOCRATIC PARTY  ACTIVIST, RADIO SHOW HOST, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, first of all, we  don't know that there was actual extortion here. We know that a payment was  made. There was a catch and kill deal with the National Enquirer. Whether  or not it was extortion, that hasn't been proven yet, nor has it even  really been alleged in many cases--</p><p>CARLSON: Well, I'm--</p><p>HAHN: --by the President. He's not saying--</p><p>CARLSON: --I'm alleging, I'm - hold on, let me--</p><p>HAHN: --he's not say--</p><p>CARLSON: --let me just stop and say, I'm alleging it because it's obvious.  You're not going to pay a $100,000 or a $150,000 or $200,000 to someone  unless there's a threat to you and your reputation. This is extortion. </p><p>And I don't - I don't know why it's not being prosecuted. I don't know - I  don't know why Trump isn't defending himself on those grounds, I would. But  it clearly is extortion.</p><p>HAHN: Well--</p><p>CARLSON: But why is it a crime to pay off--</p><p>HAHN: --well sometimes people want--</p><p>CARLSON: --someone-- </p><p>HAHN: --sometimes people--</p><p>CARLSON: --who you had an affair with?</p><p>HAHN: --sometimes people want to tell us - they want to tell a story that  he doesn't want told. He said--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>HAHN: --hey, just tell it to me. I'll pay for it and--</p><p>CARLSON: That's extortion. It's--</p><p>HAHN: --and pay for yourselves (ph). That's what he did--</p><p>CARLSON: --that's - that's what - if I did that to you-- </p><p>HAHN: --in this situation.</p><p>CARLSON: --you would call it - if I said, \"Look, I know a detail about your  sex life, Chris Hahn, and I'm going to tell it on my show on TV unless you  pay me,\" that would be extortion, obviously. So, this is extortion. But  leaving that aside, why is it a felony to pay women you've had sexual  relationships with?</p><p>HAHN: It's not a felony. It's a felony to--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh.</p><p>HAHN: --do a campaign expenditure and not - and not disclose it, and that's  what this has been.</p><p>CARLSON: How is that a campaign expenditure?</p><p>HAHN: This seems to have been a campaign - he - he made this during the  campaign for the purposes of the campaign. There are tape recordings of him  discussing this with Michael Cohen. And that's just one--</p><p>CARLSON: Well, for the purposes of the campaign, I'm - wait--</p><p>HAHN: --look, this isn't even the - this is just a--</p><p>CARLSON: --no, but, wait, hold on, wait, hold on, I'm confused. No, it's  not a small thing. It's the thing. This is the crime that The New York Time  told us on Saturday, federal prosecutors are alleging the President  committed, it's a felony, and Michael Cohen pled guilty--</p><p>HAHN: Well they also--</p><p>CARLSON: --to a species of this. So, I just want to get to the bottom of  it. Why is that a campaign--</p><p>HAHN: Well, they're also alleging--</p><p>CARLSON: --contribution to pay off a former girlfriend? I'm honestly  confused. You're a campaign guy, tell me.</p><p>HAHN: They're - look, there's also an allegation that he may have violated  the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act when he was doing his deal in Moscow.</p><p>CARLSON: Well there are (ph) allegations that he killed Kennedy.</p><p>HAHN: There are a lot more to this than just paying off--</p><p>CARLSON: But I want - but hold on, no, no, no, no - </p><p>HAHN: --there's - there's a lot--</p><p>CARLSON: --OK--</p><p>HAHN: --there's a lot more to this than just paying off--</p><p>CARLSON: --OK, well how about one allegation--</p><p>HAHN: --porn stars who he slept with--</p><p>CARLSON: --slow down (ph), one allegation--</p><p>HAHN: --you know, a couple years ago.</p><p>CARLSON: --one allegation at a time. So, federal prosecutors--</p><p>HAHN: OK.</p><p>CARLSON: --this is not just something that dumb people on TV are talking  about, though they are. This is something that--</p><p>HAHN: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --prosecutors in New York State are saying they have, apparently,  evidence to indict over. So, tell me why because lot of people in - in  Washington pay off their girlfriends, including lots of people in Congress,  a lot of people in Congress, including I, even, guess some Democrats, just  throwing that out there. So, tell me why that's a campaign--</p><p>HAHN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --contribution to pay off your girlfriend?</p><p>HAHN: Well, first of all, I think that fund that Congress was using to pay  people off who were harassed needs to be disclosed and the Members who were  involved with those disclosure decisions need to be removed--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, I'm sure that'll happen right away. That'll happen right away.</p><p>HAHN: --from Congress right now. OK. I--</p><p>CARLSON: I'm sure MSNBC will push--</p><p>HAHN: I agree with you - I agree with you on that.</p><p>CARLSON: --real hard for that. Right, OK so but--</p><p>HAHN: I - I agree with you on--</p><p>CARLSON: --but tell me why it's a campaign--</p><p>HAHN: --I agree with you on that point.</p><p>CARLSON: --this is central question. Why is it and for all of us--</p><p>HAHN: Well, look, well--</p><p>CARLSON: --why is that a campaign contribution?</p><p>HAHN: --well here's the thing.</p><p>CARLSON: The money didn't come from the campaign. It didn't go to the  campaign. It was a threat to his reputation and his livelihood, as all  extortion is, right? So, why is that a campaign--</p><p>HAHN: There's black--</p><p>CARLSON: --contribution?</p><p>HAHN: --there's black letter law. There's black letter law here, OK?</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Well what is it?</p><p>HAHN: The campaign finance law is pretty clear about what you can and  cannot do with funds. And these funds were not necessarily from Trump's own  pockets. There was all sorts of schemes put together by the President and  Michael Cohen to move this money around, so it wasn't traced back to - to -  to President Trump.</p><p>CARLSON: But - but hold on, no--</p><p>HAHN: That in and of itself should--</p><p>CARLSON: --no, no, no, no, no--</p><p>HAHN: --raise red flags. You would be--</p><p>CARLSON: --no, no, you know, wait, stop, stop, stop, stop, no, no, no, no--</p><p>HAHN: --people would be blowing their mind off right now--</p><p>CARLSON: --wait, wait, stop, stop, stop, stop--</p><p>HAHN: --if you're (ph) the President.</p><p>CARLSON: --maybe. I mean we've never had a president like Trump in a  million different ways. And I'm not defending--</p><p>HAHN: No, we never have.</p><p>CARLSON: --I'm not defending his personal life. I'm merely saying--</p><p>HAHN: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --this is now being described as a felony, as a crime for which  the President could be removed. So, now is the time when we need to be very  specific about what the crime is because you're - you've stopped all  business of government, so we can respond to this. So, let's respond right  now. Tell me how and where--</p><p>HAHN: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --in campaign finance law it says, you're not allowed to use your  money, there's no allegation this was campaign money, your money to pay off  a former girlfriend? There isn't and that's this made-up (ph)--</p><p>HAHN: Oh, this is not--</p><p>CARLSON: --it's a lie--</p><p>HAHN: --the allegation here is not--</p><p>CARLSON: --actually.</p><p>HAHN: --the allegation here is not that it's just his money. There's  allegation that he moved money around through various schemes--</p><p>CARLSON: No, but not - they're not from the campaign--</p><p>HAHN: --to pay these women off--</p><p>CARLSON: --no, but, by the way--</p><p>HAHN: --including with the (ph) man who--</p><p>CARLSON: --you're allowed to do that too.</p><p>HAHN: --hold on a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait--</p><p>CARLSON: You're allowed to hide the payments.</p><p>HAHN: --he hid the payments--</p><p>CARLSON: What, is that a crime now--</p><p>HAHN: --that was campaign in nature--</p><p>CARLSON: --if it's your money?</p><p>HAHN: --that is a violation of--</p><p>CARLSON: Why does a campaign and (ph)--</p><p>HAHN: --a clear violation of campaign finance laws.</p><p>CARLSON: --hold on till then (ph), I'm giving you a chance on TV--</p><p>HAHN: It needed to be disclosed--</p><p>CARLSON: --hold on, hold on. No, no, just I'll let you speak and I'll let  you speak slowly--</p><p>HAHN: Go ahead.</p><p>CARLSON: --so our audience can understand. Where in campaign finance law  does it say that taking money that's not from your political campaign to  respond to an extortion attempt to pay off your girlfriend or pay the  gardener, pay anybody, why is that a felony? And where does it say that?</p><p>HAHN: Camp--</p><p>CARLSON: What are you talking about?</p><p>HAHN: --campaign finance law - look, I'm not going to quote the section and  verse. I don't know it off the top of my head--</p><p>CARLSON: Paraphrase it for me.</p><p>HAHN: --even though I'm a lawyer. Campaign finance - campaign finance law  clearly states that any money spent for campaign purposes, specifically by  people other than the candidate, must be disclosed. This is what's--</p><p>CARLSON: But why is that a campaign--</p><p>HAHN: --being alleged right here--</p><p>CARLSON: --purpose?</p><p>HAHN: --hold on, hold on, hold on--</p><p>CARLSON: What (ph)?</p><p>HAHN: --the President and Michael Cohen clearly set up a scheme so that  other people could pay these women off on behalf of Donald Trump while he  was running--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. OK. That--</p><p>HAHN: --for President because--</p><p>CARLSON: --that's fine but--</p><p>HAHN: --they thought that these (ph) allegations would sink his campaign  and his reputation.</p><p>CARLSON: But - but maybe - maybe under--</p><p>HAHN: That's a violation.</p><p>CARLSON: --no, actually, because anybody faced, I'm not, you know, I don't  know a single man who faced with that allegation, who he (ph) thought he  could squelch it wouldn't pay the person off because it does incalculable  damage to your reputation, whether you're running for anything or not. </p><p>And so, that's - it's so clearly not a campaign violation that I wonder if  we want to set this precedent. Do you want to live in a world where people  paying off extortion attempts are now campaign finance felons? I mean this  is lunatic.</p><p>HAHN: This is strike--</p><p>CARLSON: And you know it.</p><p>HAHN: --this - this is strikingly similar to what happened to John Edwards.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, and it's awful. It's awful what happened to--</p><p>HAHN: I'm not saying the President will be convicted but--</p><p>CARLSON: --John Edwards--</p><p>HAHN: --this is strikingly--</p><p>CARLSON: --I thought.</p><p>HAHN: --similar--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, it is. It is.</p><p>HAHN: --situation.</p><p>CARLSON: And what happened to him was--</p><p>HAHN: And it is something, look--</p><p>CARLSON: --wrong. It was another populace--</p><p>HAHN: --well--</p><p>CARLSON: --they took out with this BS campaign finance nonsense, exactly  what happened.</p><p>HAHN: --look, it is more than--</p><p>CARLSON: And, you know (ph), we're out of time.</p><p>HAHN: --campaign finance law.</p><p>CARLSON: --no.</p><p>HAHN: It's more than campaign finance law.</p><p>CARLSON: No, it's not.</p><p>HAHN: It is the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.</p><p>CARLSON: No, it's a totally separate thing.</p><p>HAHN: That in and of itself is a problem-- </p><p>CARLSON: Look, if - if he violated that I will (ph) defend it.</p><p>HAHN: Well, yes. And then (ph) also alleged by Cohen is--</p><p>CARLSON: But in this case, this is made-up.</p><p>HAHN: --also part of this.</p><p>CARLSON: All right, Chris Hahn, thank you.</p><p>HAHN: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Good to see you.</p><p>One of the most hysterical reactions in the past few days came from a  former Obama Administration U.S. Attorney, who says the President should be  stripped of his office.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARBARA MCQUADE, FORMER UNITED STATES ATTORNEY FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT  OF  MICHIGAN, PROFESSOR OF LAW AT UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN LAW SCHOOL, LEGAL  ANALYST FOR NBC NEWS AND MSNBC: It could be that President Trump procured  the presidency by fraud. </p><p>When immigrants procure their citizenship by fraud, we strip them of their  citizenship. When a president procures his presidency by fraud, should we  consider doing the same?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Alan Dershowitz is, of course, a retired Harvard Law School  professor. He's the Author of the book, The Case Against Impeaching Trump,  and he joins us tonight.</p><p>Professor, I got a couple questions. But the first relates just to the  sound bite we played. Is there a provision in the Constitution for  stripping, whatever that means, stripping the presidency from a President  who you think is illegitimate, whatever that means?</p><p>ALAN MORTON DERSHOWITZ, LAWYER, THE CASE AGAINST IMPEACHING TRUMP  AUTHOR,  HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR EMERITUS: Sure. It's called the 25th Amendment, but  not on the grounds of illegitimacy. I want everyone out there to imagine  the following scenario. </p><p>Let's assume when Bill Clinton was running for president, Paula Jones came  up to him and said, \"Unless you pay me a $130,000, I'll reveal our affair.\" </p><p>And let's assume, Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, together, did exactly  what it's alleged that Donald Trump and Cohen did together, I guarantee you  The New York Times, NBC, MSNBC would be railing against any prosecutor who  dared to suggest that this was a violation of the campaign (ph) finance  law. Everybody would be on the other side of this issue. </p><p>There'd be Republicans out there saying, \"Strip him of the presidency,  impeach him, indict him.\" Every Democrat would be saying this is a witch- hunt, this is terrible. We need a single standard. If you wouldn't go after  Bill Clinton, don't go after Donald Trump. </p><p>If you're going after Donald Trump, then you have to go after Hillary  Clinton for everything that she allegedly did. For example, one of your  guests talked about a Federal Corrupt Practices Act. That applies when you  bribe a foreign official.</p><p>What they're arguing is that there was a rumor that maybe somebody offered  Putin a penthouse in a Tower that Trump was thinking of building in Moscow.  And if that had been done, it would be a violation of the FCPA, Federal  Corrupt Practices Act. </p><p>But it's all based on hypotheticals and maybes. And I just want everybody  to apply the shoe on the other foot test. If Hillary Clinton were  president, the Republicans were saying, \"Lock her up,\" everybody would be  on the other side. They'd be screaming about how dare you expand criminal  statutes, how dare you expand the criteria for impeachment? </p><p>Now, all these liberal Democrat fair-weather civil libertarians are saying,  \"The hell with the Constitution, the hell with civil liberties, put all  that aside, get Trump.\" That's the most important consideration. Get him by  any means possible. This is such a danger to our constitutional system that  I would hope that true civil libertarians would rebel against that, as I  am.</p><p>CARLSON: Is - is it unfair to describe this scenario as extortion? I say I  know something about your sex life. I know a secret about you that you want  to keep the - that's non-criminal (ph), but that you want to keep hidden.  And unless you pay me money, I'm going to reveal it. That seems like  textbook extortion to me. Why is it not?</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: It is absolutely textbook extortion. And there ought to be a  prosecution of any person, man or woman, who approaches any candidate or  anybody else and says, \"Unless you pay me money, I'm going to reveal a sex  act that occurred.\" That is absolute classic extortion. </p><p>And it's shocking that the Special Counsel looking into this, who has a  broad mandate, he described it very broadly, isn't looking into the  extortion committed by, at least, the porn star, whose lawyer obviously  approached the candidate or the candidate's people, and threatened  exposure.</p><p>Otherwise, why would you pay? Just listen to the tape. The tape makes that  clear. The tape that Cohen made unwittingly of President Trump, it's clear  that they were paying off an extortion--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: --in order to prevent these issues from coming out for multiple  reasons, to protect his family, to protect his brand--</p><p>CARLSON: Sure.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: --possibly, to influence the campaign. </p><p>Let's remember one more thing. A President can contribute to a candidate as  much as he wants. If - if Bloomberg runs for president, he could announce  tomorrow, \"I'm not taking a nickel. I'm putting $1 billion of my own money  into this campaign.\" </p><p>That's perfectly legitimate. As far as reporting is concerned, it's the  campaign that has to report. And if these payments had to be reported, they  had to be reported after the election, the reporting time was after the  election so, it couldn't have impacted the election.</p><p>So, the absurd notion that he won the presidency by fraud and should be  stripped of the presidency (ph) reflects incredible ignorance about the  timing here, and how these statutes operate.</p><p>CARLSON: This is getting so crazy, it's - it's making my head spin. I  appreciate your coming on and explaining that to us, professor. Thank you  very much.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Well we've been saying it for a couple of years. Now, we have hard  scientific evidence that, in fact, big tech is altering and harming the  brains of children. Is it time to do something about that? What if we knew  it was true? Well we do know it's true now. We've got details next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TEXT: TECH TYRANNY.</p><p>CARLSON: Well Google collects more data than probably any other company,  and probably knows more about you than you do. You think this might raise  some concerns about the concentration of power. </p><p>But, for years, Congress seems to have cared not at all either because they  were ideologically predisposed to Google or because they were in its  pocket. Meanwhile, Google became more and more powerful, ominously  powerful. </p><p>Now, finally, during the lame-duck session, Congress has summoned the CEO  of Google, Sundar Pichai, to answer some questions about data transparency,  coming to Capitol Hill this week. What should Congress ask him about?</p><p>Harmeet Dhillon has followed this issue maybe more closely than any other  attorney in the United States, and she joins us tonight. Harmeet, thank you  very much for coming on. So what--</p><p>HARMEET DHILLON, AMERICAN LAWYER, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL LAWYERS  ASSOCIATION  BOARD MEMBER, FORMER VICE CHAIRWOMAN OF THE CALIFORNIA REPUBLICAN PARTY,  AND THE NATIONAL COMMITTEEWOMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE  FOR  CALIFORNIA: Hi, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: --what should be the - the list of questions?</p><p>DHILLON: Well, this is only a subset of the issues that people should be  asking Google that is the subject of the testimony tomorrow. But Google,  for years, as you pointed out, has been collecting data, and not disclosing  to users, number one, the extent of the collection of the data or what  they're doing with the data.</p><p>We have also learned of significant breaches, including today, an  announcement of a major breach of 52.5 million users on the Google+ failed  experiment in social media. It's not clear when that happened. </p><p>Google is not disclosing to people exactly what happened and what use has  been made of it. And they, as you pointed out, they just get away with it,  because we have both effete politicians in Washington, even on the  Republican side, and government agencies whose tasks it is to examine these  issues, and protect consumers. So, consumers are really at a complete loss. </p><p>Now, what I expect to happen on Capitol Hill tomorrow is that there'll be  some posturing questions written by staffers that Members of Congress are  going to read out, and you're going to have some focus group tested  jargony, you know, in - incomprehensible responses from Sundar Pichai  designed to placate these folks.</p><p>There'll be a little bit of a dance and everybody will go home, not  understanding what the answers were, and not probably going to do anything  about it. And this is a real tragedy and missed opportunity, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: What a shame? I want to (ph) ask you another story, another  element of the Google story. </p><p>Newly leaked email show that several Google employees plotted to destroy  the news site, Breitbart, after the 2016 election, a secret internal  discussion group labeled Resist. Google employees discussed how they could  use the, quote, hate speech and fake news labels to justify cutting off  Breitbart's ad revenues.</p><p>Harmeet, this is kind of the stuff of Conservative fever dreams that Google  would be actually doing something like this. Are you surprised by it? And  what can be done, in response?</p><p>DHILLON: Well Google - A, I'm not surprised. B, Google is denying it. But  there's extensive evidence that Google did this, and they did it in two  ways. </p><p>One way is right after the election, as you mentioned, a number of very  excitable Left-wing Google executives and employees tried to squeeze  Breitbart and other Conservative outlets into this hate speech category.</p><p>They then confessed that after a lot of effort that was really tough. So,  they also did a two-pronged approach, and the other side of that approach  is having their ad people contact customers and tell them that it might be  dangerous or a bad idea to advertise or allow their ads to be placed on  Conservative news websites like Breitbart and others.</p><p>And they pointed to some outside groups like Sleeping Giant that makes it a  - a business practice of defaming Conservative writers and organizations,  and use that as a smear. </p><p>Google also does this in many other ways like through its YouTube. It  categorizes content as sensitive, which automatically, both, makes it hard  to find the content online, and also strips that content from the ability  to gain advertising revenue.</p><p>So, Google is doing this systematically. Google is doing this purposefully.  Google is getting away with doing this. And I think it violates not just  some laws, including Communications Decency Act and others, but it - it  violates state laws that have to do with fraud and transparency, unfair  business practices and competition.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>DHILLON: Again, Google is able to get away with this because, you know,  they - they contribute to some Conservative groups like CPAC, lot of money  to show up at CPAC, and - and certainly on Capitol Hill. </p><p>They get away with it, and we see nothing done to control this - this, you  know, duopoly and monopoly on advertising revenue. It's very dangerous  because it's shaping what young people in America, who mainly get their  news through--</p><p>CARLSON: Of course.</p><p>DHILLON: --Google see every day.</p><p>CARLSON: Looking back, the Congress allowing Google to become more powerful  than the U.S. government, subverting our democracy entirely, that'll be the  thing we hold Members responsible for, I think, historically. </p><p>Harmeet Dhillon, you will not be held responsible since you're a lonely  voice on the right side, thank you for joining us, as always.</p><p>DHILLON: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Meanwhile, we've been saying it for years. Now, there is hard  scientific evidence that big tech is, in fact, harming our children. </p><p>New 60 Minutes report this week highlighted research that shows children  who use tablet smartphones and other screens more than seven hours a day,  and that's a lot of kids, believe it or not, are developing different brain  structures. Their brains are being damaged by this. </p><p>Tom Kersting is a psychotherapist, who's written extensively on this  subject, and he joins us tonight. You must feel vindicated by this report,  Tom.</p><p>TOM KERSTING, PSYCHOTHERAPIST, DISCONNECTED AUTHOR: I do. I do. I'm  actually happy to see it, to be honest with you because--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --it's something I've been speaking about for so many years at  lectures and in my book. And now, we could finally have some scientific  preliminary evidence showing exactly what all of this tech is doing to the  brain.</p><p>CARLSON: So, what is it doing?</p><p>KERSTING: Well, first of all, the area of the brain called the cortex,  which is the outer layer of the brain, the preliminary study that the - the  research has conducted, shows a - a premature thinning of that part of the  brain, OK, which is - which is kind of frightening, considering the  importance of that part of the brain, what it does, how it's very important  just for human beings in terms of organizing, planning, and a host of other  different things.</p><p>Another component that you don't hear much about is something called  neuroplasticity, which is actually the greatest breakthrough in modern day  psychology. And the term plasticity meaning that the brain, although very  strong and rigid, can be molded and shaped if placed in - in the right  environment for three or more hours per day. </p><p>We know that the average kid is spending nine hours a day, on average, in  what I consider to be the most highly stimulating of worlds. And what  happens is the brain will actually grow new neural pathways, it'll re- organize its circuitry to adapt to that cyber world.</p><p>And the problem is what I'm seeing clinically is an unadapting of - of  young kids in a real world having a very difficult time coping with just  the trivial nuances of life, the anxiety disorders, the depressions, and so  forth.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. Well and it's all kinds of measurements are showing the  horrifying results of it. How young, exactly, are kids getting addicted?</p><p>KERSTING: Well, we're seeing right now that there's some - some research  that came out recently that there - there's the kids as - as young as two  years old showing signs of depression. And, right now, the average age for  first smartphone issuance is about age 10.</p><p>And, you know, when I give lectures, every parent knows that this is bad.  But it's sort of, you know, what you talk about it you love (ph) the - the  term groupthink. I - I use the term social conformity. </p><p>We tend to do what everybody else is doing. And parents, anybody listening,  you have got to do what is in the best interest of your child, not - not  what everybody else around you is doing.</p><p>CARLSON: So, can you just give me the 20-second answer to the question I  always ask you, which is why are we so passive in the face of this? If two- year-olds were huffing on Marlboros, we'd say, \"You know what? No, not  allowed.\" But we just sort of sit back and let our society collapse in the  face of this, why?</p><p>KERSTING: Well, the reason, in my opinion, the reason why is - and we talk  about - I always talk about common sense, all right? </p><p>It's pretty clear, if we go walk around and everybody's got their heads  buried in a device all day long, you pull up to a traffic light, and they  can't even contain themselves for a minute without looking at their device,  it's pretty clear that it's having an impact on their behavior.</p><p>Now, the reason why nobody is--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --doing anything about it is because we're always looking for  scientific evidence, all right, and now we have some of it, and we're going  to start seeing a lot more of it. And--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --and we're going to start seeing some changes, as a result,  Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, and it's we waited too long for the studies to confirm the  obvious. Tom, thank you very much.</p><p>KERSTING: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, Hollywood doesn't need to remake 1984 again, not that they  would, it's probably illegal. But they already do a perfect job of  replicating it in real life. They are living the plotline of George  Orwell's novel. Kevin Hart is the latest person to be destroyed for  statements that he made many years ago. We'll tell you his story after the  break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TEXT: AMERICA'S NEWS HQ.</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Live from America's News  headquarters, I'm Trace Gallagher.</p><p>No bail decision yet for a top Chinese executive who's facing possible  extradition from Canada to the U.S. The case of Meng Wanzhou has fueled  U.S.-China trade tensions and rocked financial markets.</p><p>Meng is the Chief Financial Officer of telecommunications giant, Huawei.  She was detained December 1st during a layover in Vancouver. She's accused  of misleading banks about the company's business dealings in Iran. </p><p>There is a concerning uptick in paralyzing illness among children. The  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now says there have been more  cases than ever. There are a 158 confirmed cases so far this year. </p><p>The illness called acute flaccid myelitis causes paralysis in the face,  neck, back, arms or legs. The symptoms usually come a week following a  fever and respiratory illness. </p><p>I'm Trace Gallagher, now back to Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Hollywood has issued a new decree. And, of course, everyone obeyed  immediately. Kevin Hart's career must be destroyed. </p><p>Just days after the Comedian was announced as the next Host of the Oscars,  the now-irrelevant awards show some people still watch, Hart was forced to  step down over tweets and stand-up routines from about a decade ago that  some said were anti-gay.</p><p>Now, these tweets had already come to light. Hart had already apologized  for them and said he was changing his routine, but it didn't matter. In  today's political environment, there is no such thing as forgiveness or  mercy. What you're seeing is, instead, a particularly powerful form of  bullying. Do and think exactly as we say, or else.</p><p>Larry Elder has fought the forces of conformity for a long time. He's a  radio show host from Los Angeles, and he joins us tonight. We're really  glad to have you, Larry Elder, thank you. So, what's the takeaway from  watching what just happened to Kevin Hart?</p><p>LARRY ELDER, RADIO SHOW HOST, WRITER, ATTORNEY: The takeaway, Tucker, is  what the devil are the rules. As you pointed out--</p><p>CARLSON: Right. I got it (ph).</p><p>ELDER: --Kevin Hart did these tweets some years ago and - and made anti-gay  references in his stand-up some years ago. He apologized back in 2015. The  Academy Award people wanted him to apologize again. He refused.</p><p>Now, the show is going to be carried by ABC. ABC parent company is Disney.  Disney also owns ESPN. They've employed Keith Olbermann, who is a - a Trump  hater from way back. And just last year, he tweeted that Trump was a Nazi  and dropped a bunch of F-bombs in his tweet. That didn't seem to bother  Disney. But Kevin Hart has to go.</p><p>The other inconsistency, of course, is that other comedians like Amy  Schumer, who last year, I think it was, hosted a Democratic fundraiser, has  used the - the F-word for gays in a tweet, as has Sarah Silverman, as has  Chelsea Handler, all of whom have hosted shows.</p><p>And finally, you have the instance of Joy Ann Reid on MSNBC who had a blog  2007, 2008--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>ELDER: --a very anti-gay post she made, and she wasn't joking, she wasn't a  comedian, including dissing the movie Brokeback Mountain, and said she  hated watching men kiss. She then said she apologized. </p><p>Then, later on, she said she was hacked. NBC did a search to find out  whether or not she'd been hacked. Turned out she wasn't hacked. So, she  either misremembered or lied, and then apologized again. She has a show on  MSNBC. So, forgive Kevin Hart for not - for not knowing what the rules are.</p><p>CARLSON: Well that's and - so, but what's the best response? I think you're  absolutely right. All of us at some point are going to be accused of  thoughtcrime, and the mob will come for us. It's inevitable.</p><p>ELDER: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: How do we respond? What's the best way to respond?</p><p>ELDER: You do them on a case-by-case basis. The man apologized, said he had  grown. The - the most horrific tweet was saying that if he came home and  saw his son playing with his daughter's dollhouse, he'd break the dollhouse  over his head. He later on said, he apologized, he's grown as a man--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>ELDER: --and perhaps the tweet had to do with his own insecurities as a  man. So, I think that's what you do. You apologize, be sincere, and then  keep going. </p><p>But if people keep beating you over the - over the head over it over and  over again, they're not going to forgive you, I'm not sure what the point  is, which is why I believe that Kevin Hart was morally justified in saying,  I've already apologized, I'm not going to apologize again.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>ELDER: I'm a 40-year old man. I've apologized. I've grown, let it alone.</p><p>CARLSON: I mean what happens to a society where the mob feels it has  ultimate authority on judgment? No one believes in God, so they have to  make their own judgments, hard and fast judgments--</p><p>ELDER: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --and no forgiveness is allowed.</p><p>ELDER: Yes. And what happens to a society that's - that's so inconsistent?  For example, Kanye West--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>ELDER: --is being called an Uncle Tom and a Token, a House Negro. That  doesn't seem to bother anybody. </p><p>You got a guy in like Al Sharpton, who's got a show where he's referred to  gays as - as homos in the - in years past, Jews as interlopers. He - he  falsely accused a White man of raping a Black teenager, he has a show on  television, you know, every weekend.</p><p>So, you know, I'm not quite sure what to say, Tucker, other than it's  terribly inconsistent. It seem to me there's one rule for people who are  Conservative and one rule for people--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>ELDER: --who are on the Left.</p><p>CARLSON: I think it's best just to ignore the noise to the extent you can.  I mean they have an awful lot of power. You know, they'll de-platform you  in a second. Larry Elder--</p><p>ELDER: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --we're rooting for you.</p><p>ELDER: Thank you. I need--</p><p>CARLSON: If they ever try to leave you, you'd (ph)--</p><p>ELDER: --I could use the help.</p><p>CARLSON: --always have a home on this show. Good to see you.</p><p>ELDER: I could use the help. Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you.</p><p>Well China just launched a new persecution of the country's Christians.  Will anyone in Washington care? Are they too busy taking Chinese money?</p><p>Plus, Paris continues to be convulsed by the worst riots there in 50 years.  What are these riots about? You know what they're about. They're about the  Paris Climate Treaty, the spirit of it, anyway. And policies they want here  are being rejected by both Left and Right in France, and they're ignoring  it because it's too inconvenient to pay attention. Details ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TEXT: THE CHINA THREAT.</p><p>CARLSON: China has launched a new crackdown. How many news stories begin  with that sentence, \"China has launched a new crackdown?\" Many. And they  have, once again, launched new crackdown, this time, on their country's  underground Christian community.</p><p>In a coordinated sweep of nighttime raids, police rounded up about a 100  members and the pastor of the Early Rain Covenant Church. Because the  church does not submit to government control, it is illegal in China. And  members have been forbidden from attending services.</p><p>It's just the latest in a persecution wave that has shut down several  different churches with thousands of Christian members. This is what actual  religious oppression looks like, but a ruling class that's seen (ph) people  who boycott North Carolina over its bathroom laws don't care at all. </p><p>None of them are calling for boycotts or sanctions on China. There's no  witch-hunt against the countless universities, businesses, and lobbyists  with massive financial ties to China, and its authoritarian regime.</p><p>In fact, to our ruling class, China is the future. If anything, it's a  country we ought to emulate. So remember that, next time they try to  lecture you about how their values are better than yours.</p><p>The war in Afghanistan, as you well know, has continued for 17 years. It's  the longest war in the history of this country. We're still spending  billions there. American soldiers are still dying there. It might all be  worth it if we were still fighting for victory. But are we fighting for  victory?</p><p>In a newly leaked audiotape, former NATO Commander, Stanley McChrystal,  tells Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, how the war in Afghanistan should be  fought. </p><p>It's not exactly the opening speech from Patton. \"My best suggestion,\" he  says, \"Is to keep a limited number of forces there and just kind of muddle  along, and see what we can do.\"</p><p>Now, muddle along is not a strategy for anything, much less a victory. It's  a strategy to waste American money and lives for no reason at all. If U.S.  troops are going to muddle along in a war, maybe it's a sign that's a war  we shouldn't be fighting in the first place.</p><p>Well, if you can remember back a year-and-a-half, on June 1st, 2017, the  President announced he was pulling this country out of the Paris Climate  Accords. To hear the politicians and television news chintuggers (ph)  react, you'd think it was the worst natural catastrophe, well, ever.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NANCY PELOSI, MINORITY LEADER OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF  REPRESENTATIVES, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA: What happened yesterday on the  climate issue is an embarrassment to our country and it should be an  embarrassment to him personally for how he answers to his grandchildren.</p><p>GOV.

It's amazing they have jobs. The  economy must be pretty strong, in fact, if those people have health  insurance. One thing they said though is true. </p><p>People were hurt, but not because we pulled out, but because other  countries kept to the terms of the Paris Climate Accord, including France. </p><p>This fall, France began to implement a gas tax to fight climate change  inspired by that agreement. Now, for the fourth weekend in a row, the city  of Paris has been rocked by riots and mass protests. The city is burning  and shows no signs of stopping. </p><p>What did this? Progressive climate policy. Will the people who formulated  it ever admit it? Of course, not. They're too invested.</p><p>Well the press, all of a sudden, doing everything it can to kill Elizabeth  Warren's presidential campaign before it even begins. That's kind of  interesting. Is this a mercy killing or something else going on?</p><p>Mark Steyn joins us to unravel a delightful mystery, after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ELIZABETH ANN WARREN, SENIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, MASSACHUSETTS: Now, the  President likes to call my mom a liar. What do the facts say?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The facts suggest that you absolutely have a Native  American ancestor in your pedigree.</p><p>WARREN: OK.</p><p>And Trump can say whatever he wants about me, but mocking Native Americans  or any group in order to try to get at me? That's not what America stands  for.</p><p>I'm not enrolled in a tribe and only tribes determine tribal citizenship. I  understand and respect that distinction. But my family history is my family  history.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: I mean (ph) you really just can't watch that enough. It really  should be a screensaver. This hasn't, understatement of the day, been the  fall Elizabeth Warren had hoped for. </p><p>She thought that releasing a DNA test showing that she might have had a  lone American Indian ancestor, not necessarily from this continent, a few  hundred years ago would silence the President and give her momentum going  into the primaries next year.</p><p>Instead, even the Left is turning on her. Two pieces in the Washington Post  and The New York Times in the past week suggests that Warren's campaign has  been deeply, maybe even fatally, wounded by the blunder of the DNA test. </p><p>Looks almost like an effort to kill Elizabeth Warren's campaign before she  can embarrass her party, the one to which everyone in the media belongs,  before she actually runs.</p><p>Mark Steyn is an Author and Columnist. Not a conspiracy not, I'll run this  by him anyway. So, what is going on? </p><p>So, obviously, she is a media creation, not a genius, but she has been the  subject of endless fawning profiles in the press, particularly from the  Boston Globe, which has promoted her for years, and now they're attacking  her, why?</p><p>MARK STEYN, AUTHOR, COLUMNIST, STEYNONLINE.COM: Yes. That's - that's  interesting. The Boston Globe is saying you - to Elizabeth Warren, you have  to know when not to run. And this is the paper that's wanted her to run  until she took--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --until she got head-faked into taking this DNA test that showed she  was 1/1024th Native American, which is less Native American than the  average. </p><p>I mean you could test Kim Jong-un, Vladimir Putin, and they would - they  would be more than 1/1024th Native American just because some Cherokee  happened to change trains in Odessa in - in 1852, and got lucky with one of  the porters. </p><p>I mean any - every - anyone's more Native American. And what's fascinating- -</p><p>CARLSON: Ha-ha.</p><p>STEYN: --what's fascinating about this is that this - Elizabeth Warren was  a test on the limits of Democrat identity politics because their recent  presidential candidates have been sold on identity politics, but in rather  strange ways. </p><p>So, Barack Obama is an African-American. But he has nothing to do with the  Black slave experience or Civil Rights.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>STEYN: He's - he's Black just because his father happened to be a British  subject born in Colonial Kenya. Barack Obama was actually the first child  of British subjects to be President, I believe, since Andrew Jackson. So,  he tried to get himself in on the colonial thing. </p><p>Obama said his step-grandfather in Indonesia had died fighting Dutch  soldiers in the struggle for independence. In fact, it turned out his step- grandfather died when he fell off a chair while changing the drapes. That's  not a joke. That's actually true. That's how his step-grandfather died.</p><p>Then you have Hillary Clinton, who's running as a feminist icon and is, in  fact, only the candidate because she's the wife of the previous guy, and  she was given a Senate seat as a reward for standing by him, when his  intern's dress wound up in the FBI crime analysis lab - lab.</p><p>So, we have very--</p><p>CARLSON: Ha-ha.</p><p>STEYN: --so in such a world, you can't blame Elizabeth Warren for saying,  \"Well, if Hillary could be a feminist icon, why can't I be the first Native  American President?\" </p><p>She was Harvard Law School's first woman of color. That's why it's not a  family law thing. She actually was promoted as Harvard Law School's first  woman of color. Why shouldn't she be America's first - first Native  American President?</p><p>CARLSON: Such a good (ph)--</p><p>STEYN: Since this is (ph)-- </p><p>CARLSON: --such a good example (ph).</p><p>STEYN: --none - none of this identity politics. Joe Biden should run as the  first transgender woman candidate and dare the Democrat electorate to call  him on it.</p><p>CARLSON: That was my plan.</p><p>STEYN: I mean this is this (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: I hope he doesn't get there first.</p><p>STEYN: --no don't (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: I'm doing that (ph).

The Trump Administration is over, toast, cooked, done for good, and  along with it any hope of the middle-class revolution that 63 million  Americans voted for two years ago.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The reason for this tragedy is simple. The President has been caught  committing felonies. Here's what the legal experts without law degrees are  saying on television.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> LAWRENCE O'DONNELL, THE LAST WORD WITH LAWRENCE O'DONNELL HOST, MSNBC: If  precedent means anything in the Trump era, Donald Trump will be, must be,  impeached because of the crimes prosecutors say he committed in the Michael  Cohen case.</p><p> ROBERT E. MOOK, FORMER POLITICAL CAMPAIGN STRATEGIST AND CAMPAIGN MANAGER,  CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Both parties need to get on board to pass  articles of impeachment.</p><p> EDDIE GLAUDE, CHAIR, CENTER FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN STUDIES: You have  conspiracy, you have - you have obstruction, you have campaigns finance and  you have emoluments. </p><p> If the Democrats do not pursue this vigorously, they will be, in some ways,  held accountable for abdicating their responsibility.</p><p> It goes to the moral question, the ethical question. Democracy is at stake.</p><p> MAXINE MOORE WATERS, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR CALIFORNIA'S 43RD  CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, DEMOCRATIC PARTY MEMBER: This criminal must be  brought up by the Congress of the United States for impeachment.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CARLSON: We're not even (ph) going to show you the Don Lemon tape. There's  a lot of emotion there. But to sum up, they're telling us that we're  staring down the barrel of a constitutional crisis. And that crisis stems  from what MSNBC describes as, quote, the crimes prosecutors say the  President committed in the Michael Cohen case.</p><p> Which crimes were those? We have the answer. The relevant details were  spelled out in a piece that ran over the weekend in The New York Times  under this headline. \"Prosecutors say Trump directed illegal payments  during campaign.\"</p><p> The gist of the story is this. Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, has  told federal prosecutors that he facilitated payments to two women who said  they had affairs with Donald Trump. And then, well actually that's it.  That's the entire story right there.</p><p> Paying these two women, say federal prosecutors and their flacks at NBC  News, was a serious crime, a crime worthy of impeachment, if not,  indictment. OK. But you might be wondering, how exactly is that criminal?  Well, we're going to explain it to you.</p><p> We're going to start by stipulating that everything Michael Cohen has told  the feds is absolutely true. Now, assuming honesty isn't usually a wise  idea with Michael Cohen, but for the sake of argument, let's do it in this  case, everything he says is true, why is what Cohen is alleging a criminal  offense?</p><p> Remember the facts of the story. These are undisputed. Two women approached  Donald Trump and threatened to ruin his career and humiliate his family if  he doesn't give them money. Now, that sounds like a classic case of  extortion.</p><p> Yet, for whatever reason, Trump caves to it, and he directs Michael Cohen  to pay the ransom. Now, more than two years later, Trump is a felon for  doing this. It doesn't seem to make any sense.</p><p> Oh, but you're not a federal prosecutor on a political mission. If you were  a federal prosecutor on a political mission, you would construe those  extortion payments as campaign contributions. You'd do this even though the  money in question did not come from or go to Donald Trump's presidential  campaign.</p><p> Then you'd claim that Trump and Michael Cohen violated campaign finance law  because they didn't publicly disclose those payments despite the fact that  disclosing them would nullify the reason for making them in the first  place, which was to keep the whole thing secret.</p><p> That is the argument you would make, both in federal court and through your  proxies on cable television. It is insultingly stupid. But because everyone  in power hates the target of your investigation, nobody would question you,  and that's what's happening right now.</p><p> Now, by this reasoning, any money a political candidate spends to maintain  or protect his image while running for office now qualifies as a regulated  campaign donation, and has to be disclosed. That would include, by the way,  in addition to an infinite number of other things, buying toothpaste and  getting a haircut.</p><p> It would definitely include the taxpayer-financed slush fund that Congress  has set aside to pay off its own sexual harassment claims. Yes, those now  qualify as campaign contributions. They must be publicly disclosed, except,  of course, they're not publicly disclosed, and they never will be. Why is  that?</p><p> Well that might be a question for Congressional leaders including, now that  we think about it, Congressman Adam Schiff of Burbank, California. He's the  incoming Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, a very powerful man  in the Congress. </p><p> What does Mr. Schiff have to say about Congress not disclosing the very  same payments that Democrats say Trump should be impeached for not  disclosing? Let's ask him.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ADAM BENNETT SCHIFF, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR CALIFORNIA'S 28TH  CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, DEMOCRATIC PARTY MEMBER: There's a very real  prospect that on the day Donald Trump leaves office the Justice Department  may indict him that he may be the first president in quite some time to  face the real prospect of jail time.</p><p>NEAL KUMAR KATYAL, LAWYER, FORMER ACTING SOLICITOR GENERAL OF THE UNITED  STATES, LAW PROFESSOR AT GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY: Trump knows that he's  facing some pretty strong criminal liability when he leaves office, one way  or another. And, you know, even if a (ph) sitting president can't be  indicted, he's got to know his future looks like it's behind bars unless he  cuts some sort of deal with the prosecutors.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: So to translate, Trump's a criminal. He's going to jail for  committing a smaller version of the same made-up crime that we in Congress  have committed for years and forced you to pay for. </p><p> And, by the way, we're never apologizing for that because we don't have to  and CNN isn't going to make us. Screw you, America, and your stupid  election. We are in charge. That's the real message here, in case you  missed it.</p><p> Chris Hahn is a radio host and former aide to Senator Chuck Schumer, and he  joins us tonight. </p><p> So, Chris, I think you don't like Trump but that's fine. But speak slowly  so I can understand. Explain to me why paying off someone who is extorting  you, threatening to make public details of your personal life, if she  doesn't get paid, why paying that person is a felony?</p><p> CHRISTOPHER HAHN, AMERICAN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, DEMOCRATIC PARTY  ACTIVIST, RADIO SHOW HOST, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, first of all, we  don't know that there was actual extortion here. We know that a payment was  made. There was a catch and kill deal with the National Enquirer. Whether  or not it was extortion, that hasn't been proven yet, nor has it even  really been alleged in many cases--</p><p> CARLSON: Well, I'm--</p><p> HAHN: --by the President. He's not saying--</p><p> CARLSON: --I'm alleging, I'm - hold on, let me--</p><p> HAHN: --he's not say--</p><p> CARLSON: --let me just stop and say, I'm alleging it because it's obvious.  You're not going to pay a $100,000 or a $150,000 or $200,000 to someone  unless there's a threat to you and your reputation. This is extortion. </p><p> And I don't - I don't know why it's not being prosecuted. I don't know - I  don't know why Trump isn't defending himself on those grounds, I would. But  it clearly is extortion.</p><p> HAHN: Well--</p><p> CARLSON: But why is it a crime to pay off--</p><p> HAHN: --well sometimes people want--</p><p> CARLSON: --someone-- </p><p> HAHN: --sometimes people--</p><p> CARLSON: --who you had an affair with?</p><p> HAHN: --sometimes people want to tell us - they want to tell a story that  he doesn't want told. He said--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> HAHN: --hey, just tell it to me. I'll pay for it and--</p><p> CARLSON: That's extortion. It's--</p><p> HAHN: --and pay for yourselves (ph). That's what he did--</p><p> CARLSON: --that's - that's what - if I did that to you-- </p><p> HAHN: --in this situation.</p><p> CARLSON: --you would call it - if I said, \"Look, I know a detail about your  sex life, Chris Hahn, and I'm going to tell it on my show on TV unless you  pay me,\" that would be extortion, obviously. So, this is extortion. But  leaving that aside, why is it a felony to pay women you've had sexual  relationships with?</p><p> HAHN: It's not a felony. It's a felony to--</p><p> CARLSON: Oh.</p><p> HAHN: --do a campaign expenditure and not - and not disclose it, and that's  what this has been.</p><p> CARLSON: How is that a campaign expenditure?</p><p> HAHN: This seems to have been a campaign - he - he made this during the  campaign for the purposes of the campaign. There are tape recordings of him  discussing this with Michael Cohen. And that's just one--</p><p> CARLSON: Well, for the purposes of the campaign, I'm - wait--</p><p> HAHN: --look, this isn't even the - this is just a--</p><p> CARLSON: --no, but, wait, hold on, wait, hold on, I'm confused. No, it's  not a small thing. It's the thing. This is the crime that The New York Time  told us on Saturday, federal prosecutors are alleging the President  committed, it's a felony, and Michael Cohen pled guilty--</p><p> HAHN: Well they also--</p><p> CARLSON: --to a species of this. So, I just want to get to the bottom of  it. Why is that a campaign--</p><p> HAHN: Well, they're also alleging--</p><p> CARLSON: --contribution to pay off a former girlfriend? I'm honestly  confused. You're a campaign guy, tell me.</p><p> HAHN: They're - look, there's also an allegation that he may have violated  the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act when he was doing his deal in Moscow.</p><p> CARLSON: Well there are (ph) allegations that he killed Kennedy.</p><p> HAHN: There are a lot more to this than just paying off--</p><p> CARLSON: But I want - but hold on, no, no, no, no - </p><p> HAHN: --there's - there's a lot--</p><p> CARLSON: --OK--</p><p> HAHN: --there's a lot more to this than just paying off--</p><p> CARLSON: --OK, well how about one allegation--</p><p> HAHN: --porn stars who he slept with--</p><p> CARLSON: --slow down (ph), one allegation--</p><p> HAHN: --you know, a couple years ago.</p><p> CARLSON: --one allegation at a time. So, federal prosecutors--</p><p> HAHN: OK.</p><p> CARLSON: --this is not just something that dumb people on TV are talking  about, though they are. This is something that--</p><p> HAHN: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: --prosecutors in New York State are saying they have, apparently,  evidence to indict over. So, tell me why because lot of people in - in  Washington pay off their girlfriends, including lots of people in Congress,  a lot of people in Congress, including I, even, guess some Democrats, just  throwing that out there. So, tell me why that's a campaign--</p><p> HAHN: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: --contribution to pay off your girlfriend?</p><p> HAHN: Well, first of all, I think that fund that Congress was using to pay  people off who were harassed needs to be disclosed and the Members who were  involved with those disclosure decisions need to be removed--</p><p> CARLSON: Oh, I'm sure that'll happen right away. That'll happen right away.</p><p> HAHN: --from Congress right now. OK. I--</p><p> CARLSON: I'm sure MSNBC will push--</p><p> HAHN: I agree with you - I agree with you on that.</p><p> CARLSON: --real hard for that. Right, OK so but--</p><p> HAHN: I - I agree with you on--</p><p> CARLSON: --but tell me why it's a campaign--</p><p> HAHN: --I agree with you on that point.</p><p> CARLSON: --this is central question. Why is it and for all of us--</p><p> HAHN: Well, look, well--</p><p> CARLSON: --why is that a campaign contribution?</p><p> HAHN: --well here's the thing.</p><p> CARLSON: The money didn't come from the campaign. It didn't go to the  campaign. It was a threat to his reputation and his livelihood, as all  extortion is, right? So, why is that a campaign--</p><p> HAHN: There's black--</p><p> CARLSON: --contribution?</p><p> HAHN: --there's black letter law. There's black letter law here, OK?</p><p> CARLSON: OK. Well what is it?</p><p> HAHN: The campaign finance law is pretty clear about what you can and  cannot do with funds. And these funds were not necessarily from Trump's own  pockets. There was all sorts of schemes put together by the President and  Michael Cohen to move this money around, so it wasn't traced back to - to -  to President Trump.</p><p> CARLSON: But - but hold on, no--</p><p> HAHN: That in and of itself should--</p><p> CARLSON: --no, no, no, no, no--</p><p> HAHN: --raise red flags. You would be--</p><p> CARLSON: --no, no, you know, wait, stop, stop, stop, stop, no, no, no, no--</p><p> HAHN: --people would be blowing their mind off right now--</p><p> CARLSON: --wait, wait, stop, stop, stop, stop--</p><p> HAHN: --if you're (ph) the President.</p><p> CARLSON: --maybe. I mean we've never had a president like Trump in a  million different ways. And I'm not defending--</p><p> HAHN: No, we never have.</p><p> CARLSON: --I'm not defending his personal life. I'm merely saying--</p><p> HAHN: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: --this is now being described as a felony, as a crime for which  the President could be removed. So, now is the time when we need to be very  specific about what the crime is because you're - you've stopped all  business of government, so we can respond to this. So, let's respond right  now. Tell me how and where--</p><p> HAHN: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: --in campaign finance law it says, you're not allowed to use your  money, there's no allegation this was campaign money, your money to pay off  a former girlfriend? There isn't and that's this made-up (ph)--</p><p> HAHN: Oh, this is not--</p><p> CARLSON: --it's a lie--</p><p> HAHN: --the allegation here is not--</p><p> CARLSON: --actually.</p><p> HAHN: --the allegation here is not that it's just his money. There's  allegation that he moved money around through various schemes--</p><p> CARLSON: No, but not - they're not from the campaign--</p><p> HAHN: --to pay these women off--</p><p> CARLSON: --no, but, by the way--</p><p> HAHN: --including with the (ph) man who--</p><p> CARLSON: --you're allowed to do that too.</p><p> HAHN: --hold on a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait--</p><p> CARLSON: You're allowed to hide the payments.</p><p> HAHN: --he hid the payments--</p><p> CARLSON: What, is that a crime now--</p><p> HAHN: --that was campaign in nature--</p><p> CARLSON: --if it's your money?</p><p> HAHN: --that is a violation of--</p><p> CARLSON: Why does a campaign and (ph)--</p><p> HAHN: --a clear violation of campaign finance laws.</p><p> CARLSON: --hold on till then (ph), I'm giving you a chance on TV--</p><p> HAHN: It needed to be disclosed--</p><p> CARLSON: --hold on, hold on. No, no, just I'll let you speak and I'll let  you speak slowly--</p><p> HAHN: Go ahead.</p><p> CARLSON: --so our audience can understand. Where in campaign finance law  does it say that taking money that's not from your political campaign to  respond to an extortion attempt to pay off your girlfriend or pay the  gardener, pay anybody, why is that a felony? And where does it say that?</p><p> HAHN: Camp--</p><p> CARLSON: What are you talking about?</p><p> HAHN: --campaign finance law - look, I'm not going to quote the section and  verse. I don't know it off the top of my head--</p><p> CARLSON: Paraphrase it for me.</p><p> HAHN: --even though I'm a lawyer. Campaign finance - campaign finance law  clearly states that any money spent for campaign purposes, specifically by  people other than the candidate, must be disclosed. This is what's--</p><p> CARLSON: But why is that a campaign--</p><p> HAHN: --being alleged right here--</p><p> CARLSON: --purpose?</p><p> HAHN: --hold on, hold on, hold on--</p><p> CARLSON: What (ph)?</p><p> HAHN: --the President and Michael Cohen clearly set up a scheme so that  other people could pay these women off on behalf of Donald Trump while he  was running--</p><p> CARLSON: OK. OK. That--</p><p> HAHN: --for President because--</p><p> CARLSON: --that's fine but--</p><p> HAHN: --they thought that these (ph) allegations would sink his campaign  and his reputation.</p><p> CARLSON: But - but maybe - maybe under--</p><p> HAHN: That's a violation.</p><p> CARLSON: --no, actually, because anybody faced, I'm not, you know, I don't  know a single man who faced with that allegation, who he (ph) thought he  could squelch it wouldn't pay the person off because it does incalculable  damage to your reputation, whether you're running for anything or not. </p><p> And so, that's - it's so clearly not a campaign violation that I wonder if  we want to set this precedent. Do you want to live in a world where people  paying off extortion attempts are now campaign finance felons? I mean this  is lunatic.</p><p> HAHN: This is strike--</p><p> CARLSON: And you know it.</p><p> HAHN: --this - this is strikingly similar to what happened to John Edwards.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes, and it's awful. It's awful what happened to--</p><p> HAHN: I'm not saying the President will be convicted but--</p><p> CARLSON: --John Edwards--</p><p> HAHN: --this is strikingly--</p><p> CARLSON: --I thought.</p><p> HAHN: --similar--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes, it is. It is.</p><p> HAHN: --situation.</p><p> CARLSON: And what happened to him was--</p><p> HAHN: And it is something, look--</p><p> CARLSON: --wrong. It was another populace--</p><p> HAHN: --well--</p><p> CARLSON: --they took out with this BS campaign finance nonsense, exactly  what happened.</p><p> HAHN: --look, it is more than--</p><p> CARLSON: And, you know (ph), we're out of time.</p><p> HAHN: --campaign finance law.</p><p> CARLSON: --no.</p><p> HAHN: It's more than campaign finance law.</p><p> CARLSON: No, it's not.</p><p> HAHN: It is the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.</p><p> CARLSON: No, it's a totally separate thing.</p><p> HAHN: That in and of itself is a problem-- </p><p> CARLSON: Look, if - if he violated that I will (ph) defend it.</p><p> HAHN: Well, yes. And then (ph) also alleged by Cohen is--</p><p> CARLSON: But in this case, this is made-up.</p><p> HAHN: --also part of this.</p><p> CARLSON: All right, Chris Hahn, thank you.</p><p> HAHN: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: Good to see you.</p><p> One of the most hysterical reactions in the past few days came from a  former Obama Administration U.S. Attorney, who says the President should be  stripped of his office.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARBARA MCQUADE, FORMER UNITED STATES ATTORNEY FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF  MICHIGAN, PROFESSOR OF LAW AT UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN LAW SCHOOL, LEGAL  ANALYST FOR NBC NEWS AND MSNBC: It could be that President Trump procured  the presidency by fraud. </p><p> When immigrants procure their citizenship by fraud, we strip them of their  citizenship. When a president procures his presidency by fraud, should we  consider doing the same?</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Alan Dershowitz is, of course, a retired Harvard Law School  professor. He's the Author of the book, The Case Against Impeaching Trump,  and he joins us tonight.</p><p> Professor, I got a couple questions. But the first relates just to the  sound bite we played. Is there a provision in the Constitution for  stripping, whatever that means, stripping the presidency from a President  who you think is illegitimate, whatever that means?</p><p>ALAN MORTON DERSHOWITZ, LAWYER, THE CASE AGAINST IMPEACHING TRUMP AUTHOR,  HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR EMERITUS: Sure. It's called the 25th Amendment, but  not on the grounds of illegitimacy. I want everyone out there to imagine  the following scenario. </p><p> Let's assume when Bill Clinton was running for president, Paula Jones came  up to him and said, \"Unless you pay me a $130,000, I'll reveal our affair.\" </p><p> And let's assume, Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, together, did exactly  what it's alleged that Donald Trump and Cohen did together, I guarantee you  The New York Times, NBC, MSNBC would be railing against any prosecutor who  dared to suggest that this was a violation of the campaign (ph) finance  law. Everybody would be on the other side of this issue. </p><p> There'd be Republicans out there saying, \"Strip him of the presidency,  impeach him, indict him.\" Every Democrat would be saying this is a witch- hunt, this is terrible. We need a single standard. If you wouldn't go after  Bill Clinton, don't go after Donald Trump. </p><p> If you're going after Donald Trump, then you have to go after Hillary  Clinton for everything that she allegedly did. For example, one of your  guests talked about a Federal Corrupt Practices Act. That applies when you  bribe a foreign official.</p><p> What they're arguing is that there was a rumor that maybe somebody offered  Putin a penthouse in a Tower that Trump was thinking of building in Moscow.  And if that had been done, it would be a violation of the FCPA, Federal  Corrupt Practices Act. </p><p> But it's all based on hypotheticals and maybes. And I just want everybody  to apply the shoe on the other foot test. If Hillary Clinton were  president, the Republicans were saying, \"Lock her up,\" everybody would be  on the other side. They'd be screaming about how dare you expand criminal  statutes, how dare you expand the criteria for impeachment? </p><p> Now, all these liberal Democrat fair-weather civil libertarians are saying,  \"The hell with the Constitution, the hell with civil liberties, put all  that aside, get Trump.\" That's the most important consideration. Get him by  any means possible. This is such a danger to our constitutional system that  I would hope that true civil libertarians would rebel against that, as I  am.</p><p> CARLSON: Is - is it unfair to describe this scenario as extortion? I say I  know something about your sex life. I know a secret about you that you want  to keep the - that's non-criminal (ph), but that you want to keep hidden.  And unless you pay me money, I'm going to reveal it. That seems like  textbook extortion to me. Why is it not?</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: It is absolutely textbook extortion. And there ought to be a  prosecution of any person, man or woman, who approaches any candidate or  anybody else and says, \"Unless you pay me money, I'm going to reveal a sex  act that occurred.\" That is absolute classic extortion. </p><p> And it's shocking that the Special Counsel looking into this, who has a  broad mandate, he described it very broadly, isn't looking into the  extortion committed by, at least, the porn star, whose lawyer obviously  approached the candidate or the candidate's people, and threatened  exposure.</p><p> Otherwise, why would you pay? Just listen to the tape. The tape makes that  clear. The tape that Cohen made unwittingly of President Trump, it's clear  that they were paying off an extortion--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: --in order to prevent these issues from coming out for multiple  reasons, to protect his family, to protect his brand--</p><p> CARLSON: Sure.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: --possibly, to influence the campaign. </p><p> Let's remember one more thing. A President can contribute to a candidate as  much as he wants. If - if Bloomberg runs for president, he could announce  tomorrow, \"I'm not taking a nickel. I'm putting $1 billion of my own money  into this campaign.\" </p><p> That's perfectly legitimate. As far as reporting is concerned, it's the  campaign that has to report. And if these payments had to be reported, they  had to be reported after the election, the reporting time was after the  election so, it couldn't have impacted the election.</p><p> So, the absurd notion that he won the presidency by fraud and should be  stripped of the presidency (ph) reflects incredible ignorance about the  timing here, and how these statutes operate.</p><p> CARLSON: This is getting so crazy, it's - it's making my head spin. I  appreciate your coming on and explaining that to us, professor. Thank you  very much.</p><p> DERSHOWITZ: Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: Well we've been saying it for a couple of years. Now, we have hard  scientific evidence that, in fact, big tech is altering and harming the  brains of children. Is it time to do something about that? What if we knew  it was true? Well we do know it's true now. We've got details next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> TEXT: TECH TYRANNY.</p><p> CARLSON: Well Google collects more data than probably any other company,  and probably knows more about you than you do. You think this might raise  some concerns about the concentration of power. </p><p> But, for years, Congress seems to have cared not at all either because they  were ideologically predisposed to Google or because they were in its  pocket. Meanwhile, Google became more and more powerful, ominously  powerful. </p><p> Now, finally, during the lame-duck session, Congress has summoned the CEO  of Google, Sundar Pichai, to answer some questions about data transparency,  coming to Capitol Hill this week. What should Congress ask him about?</p><p> Harmeet Dhillon has followed this issue maybe more closely than any other  attorney in the United States, and she joins us tonight. Harmeet, thank you  very much for coming on. So what--</p><p> HARMEET DHILLON, AMERICAN LAWYER, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL LAWYERS ASSOCIATION  BOARD MEMBER, FORMER VICE CHAIRWOMAN OF THE CALIFORNIA REPUBLICAN PARTY,  AND THE NATIONAL COMMITTEEWOMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE FOR  CALIFORNIA: Hi, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: --what should be the - the list of questions?</p><p> DHILLON: Well, this is only a subset of the issues that people should be  asking Google that is the subject of the testimony tomorrow. But Google,  for years, as you pointed out, has been collecting data, and not disclosing  to users, number one, the extent of the collection of the data or what  they're doing with the data.</p><p> We have also learned of significant breaches, including today, an  announcement of a major breach of 52.5 million users on the Google+ failed  experiment in social media. It's not clear when that happened. </p><p>Google is not disclosing to people exactly what happened and what use has  been made of it. And they, as you pointed out, they just get away with it,  because we have both effete politicians in Washington, even on the  Republican side, and government agencies whose tasks it is to examine these  issues, and protect consumers. So, consumers are really at a complete loss. </p><p> Now, what I expect to happen on Capitol Hill tomorrow is that there'll be  some posturing questions written by staffers that Members of Congress are  going to read out, and you're going to have some focus group tested  jargony, you know, in - incomprehensible responses from Sundar Pichai  designed to placate these folks.</p><p> There'll be a little bit of a dance and everybody will go home, not  understanding what the answers were, and not probably going to do anything  about it. And this is a real tragedy and missed opportunity, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: What a shame? I want to (ph) ask you another story, another  element of the Google story. </p><p> Newly leaked email show that several Google employees plotted to destroy  the news site, Breitbart, after the 2016 election, a secret internal  discussion group labeled Resist. Google employees discussed how they could  use the, quote, hate speech and fake news labels to justify cutting off  Breitbart's ad revenues.</p><p> Harmeet, this is kind of the stuff of Conservative fever dreams that Google  would be actually doing something like this. Are you surprised by it? And  what can be done, in response?</p><p> DHILLON: Well Google - A, I'm not surprised. B, Google is denying it. But  there's extensive evidence that Google did this, and they did it in two  ways. </p><p> One way is right after the election, as you mentioned, a number of very  excitable Left-wing Google executives and employees tried to squeeze  Breitbart and other Conservative outlets into this hate speech category.</p><p> They then confessed that after a lot of effort that was really tough. So,  they also did a two-pronged approach, and the other side of that approach  is having their ad people contact customers and tell them that it might be  dangerous or a bad idea to advertise or allow their ads to be placed on  Conservative news websites like Breitbart and others.</p><p> And they pointed to some outside groups like Sleeping Giant that makes it a  - a business practice of defaming Conservative writers and organizations,  and use that as a smear. </p><p>Google also does this in many other ways like through its YouTube. It  categorizes content as sensitive, which automatically, both, makes it hard  to find the content online, and also strips that content from the ability  to gain advertising revenue.</p><p> So, Google is doing this systematically. Google is doing this purposefully.  Google is getting away with doing this. And I think it violates not just  some laws, including Communications Decency Act and others, but it - it  violates state laws that have to do with fraud and transparency, unfair  business practices and competition.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> DHILLON: Again, Google is able to get away with this because, you know,  they - they contribute to some Conservative groups like CPAC, lot of money  to show up at CPAC, and - and certainly on Capitol Hill. </p><p> They get away with it, and we see nothing done to control this - this, you  know, duopoly and monopoly on advertising revenue. It's very dangerous  because it's shaping what young people in America, who mainly get their  news through--</p><p> CARLSON: Of course.</p><p> DHILLON: --Google see every day.</p><p> CARLSON: Looking back, the Congress allowing Google to become more powerful  than the U.S. government, subverting our democracy entirely, that'll be the  thing we hold Members responsible for, I think, historically. </p><p> Harmeet Dhillon, you will not be held responsible since you're a lonely  voice on the right side, thank you for joining us, as always.</p><p> DHILLON: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: Meanwhile, we've been saying it for years. Now, there is hard  scientific evidence that big tech is, in fact, harming our children. </p><p> New 60 Minutes report this week highlighted research that shows children  who use tablet smartphones and other screens more than seven hours a day,  and that's a lot of kids, believe it or not, are developing different brain  structures. Their brains are being damaged by this. </p><p> Tom Kersting is a psychotherapist, who's written extensively on this  subject, and he joins us tonight. You must feel vindicated by this report,  Tom.</p><p> TOM KERSTING, PSYCHOTHERAPIST, DISCONNECTED AUTHOR: I do. I do. I'm  actually happy to see it, to be honest with you because--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> KERSTING: --it's something I've been speaking about for so many years at  lectures and in my book. And now, we could finally have some scientific  preliminary evidence showing exactly what all of this tech is doing to the  brain.</p><p> CARLSON: So, what is it doing?</p><p> KERSTING: Well, first of all, the area of the brain called the cortex,  which is the outer layer of the brain, the preliminary study that the - the  research has conducted, shows a - a premature thinning of that part of the  brain, OK, which is - which is kind of frightening, considering the  importance of that part of the brain, what it does, how it's very important  just for human beings in terms of organizing, planning, and a host of other  different things.</p><p> Another component that you don't hear much about is something called  neuroplasticity, which is actually the greatest breakthrough in modern day  psychology. And the term plasticity meaning that the brain, although very  strong and rigid, can be molded and shaped if placed in - in the right  environment for three or more hours per day. </p><p> We know that the average kid is spending nine hours a day, on average, in  what I consider to be the most highly stimulating of worlds. And what  happens is the brain will actually grow new neural pathways, it'll re- organize its circuitry to adapt to that cyber world.</p><p> And the problem is what I'm seeing clinically is an unadapting of - of  young kids in a real world having a very difficult time coping with just  the trivial nuances of life, the anxiety disorders, the depressions, and so  forth.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes. Well and it's all kinds of measurements are showing the  horrifying results of it. How young, exactly, are kids getting addicted?</p><p> KERSTING: Well, we're seeing right now that there's some - some research  that came out recently that there - there's the kids as - as young as two  years old showing signs of depression. And, right now, the average age for  first smartphone issuance is about age 10.</p><p> And, you know, when I give lectures, every parent knows that this is bad.  But it's sort of, you know, what you talk about it you love (ph) the - the  term groupthink. I - I use the term social conformity. </p><p> We tend to do what everybody else is doing. And parents, anybody listening,  you have got to do what is in the best interest of your child, not - not  what everybody else around you is doing.</p><p> CARLSON: So, can you just give me the 20-second answer to the question I  always ask you, which is why are we so passive in the face of this? If two- year-olds were huffing on Marlboros, we'd say, \"You know what? No, not  allowed.\" But we just sort of sit back and let our society collapse in the  face of this, why?</p><p> KERSTING: Well, the reason, in my opinion, the reason why is - and we talk  about - I always talk about common sense, all right? </p><p> It's pretty clear, if we go walk around and everybody's got their heads  buried in a device all day long, you pull up to a traffic light, and they  can't even contain themselves for a minute without looking at their device,  it's pretty clear that it's having an impact on their behavior.</p><p> Now, the reason why nobody is--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> KERSTING: --doing anything about it is because we're always looking for  scientific evidence, all right, and now we have some of it, and we're going  to start seeing a lot more of it. And--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> KERSTING: --and we're going to start seeing some changes, as a result,  Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes, and it's we waited too long for the studies to confirm the  obvious. Tom, thank you very much.</p><p> KERSTING: Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: Well, Hollywood doesn't need to remake 1984 again, not that they  would, it's probably illegal. But they already do a perfect job of  replicating it in real life. They are living the plotline of George  Orwell's novel. Kevin Hart is the latest person to be destroyed for  statements that he made many years ago. We'll tell you his story after the  break.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> TEXT: AMERICA'S NEWS HQ.</p><p> TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Live from America's News  headquarters, I'm Trace Gallagher.</p><p> No bail decision yet for a top Chinese executive who's facing possible  extradition from Canada to the U.S. The case of Meng Wanzhou has fueled  U.S.-China trade tensions and rocked financial markets.</p><p> Meng is the Chief Financial Officer of telecommunications giant, Huawei.  She was detained December 1st during a layover in Vancouver. She's accused  of misleading banks about the company's business dealings in Iran. </p><p> There is a concerning uptick in paralyzing illness among children. The  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now says there have been more  cases than ever. There are a 158 confirmed cases so far this year. </p><p> The illness called acute flaccid myelitis causes paralysis in the face,  neck, back, arms or legs. The symptoms usually come a week following a  fever and respiratory illness. </p><p> I'm Trace Gallagher, now back to Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: Hollywood has issued a new decree. And, of course, everyone obeyed  immediately. Kevin Hart's career must be destroyed. </p><p> Just days after the Comedian was announced as the next Host of the Oscars,  the now-irrelevant awards show some people still watch, Hart was forced to  step down over tweets and stand-up routines from about a decade ago that  some said were anti-gay.</p><p> Now, these tweets had already come to light. Hart had already apologized  for them and said he was changing his routine, but it didn't matter. In  today's political environment, there is no such thing as forgiveness or  mercy. What you're seeing is, instead, a particularly powerful form of  bullying. Do and think exactly as we say, or else.</p><p> Larry Elder has fought the forces of conformity for a long time. He's a  radio show host from Los Angeles, and he joins us tonight. We're really  glad to have you, Larry Elder, thank you. So, what's the takeaway from  watching what just happened to Kevin Hart?</p><p> LARRY ELDER, RADIO SHOW HOST, WRITER, ATTORNEY: The takeaway, Tucker, is  what the devil are the rules. As you pointed out--</p><p> CARLSON: Right. I got it (ph).</p><p> ELDER: --Kevin Hart did these tweets some years ago and - and made anti-gay  references in his stand-up some years ago. He apologized back in 2015. The  Academy Award people wanted him to apologize again. He refused.</p><p> Now, the show is going to be carried by ABC. ABC parent company is Disney.  Disney also owns ESPN. They've employed Keith Olbermann, who is a - a Trump  hater from way back. And just last year, he tweeted that Trump was a Nazi  and dropped a bunch of F-bombs in his tweet. That didn't seem to bother  Disney. But Kevin Hart has to go.</p><p> The other inconsistency, of course, is that other comedians like Amy  Schumer, who last year, I think it was, hosted a Democratic fundraiser, has  used the - the F-word for gays in a tweet, as has Sarah Silverman, as has  Chelsea Handler, all of whom have hosted shows.</p><p> And finally, you have the instance of Joy Ann Reid on MSNBC who had a blog  2007, 2008--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> ELDER: --a very anti-gay post she made, and she wasn't joking, she wasn't a  comedian, including dissing the movie Brokeback Mountain, and said she  hated watching men kiss. She then said she apologized. </p><p> Then, later on, she said she was hacked. NBC did a search to find out  whether or not she'd been hacked. Turned out she wasn't hacked. So, she  either misremembered or lied, and then apologized again. She has a show on  MSNBC. So, forgive Kevin Hart for not - for not knowing what the rules are.</p><p> CARLSON: Well that's and - so, but what's the best response? I think you're  absolutely right. All of us at some point are going to be accused of  thoughtcrime, and the mob will come for us. It's inevitable.</p><p> ELDER: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: How do we respond? What's the best way to respond?</p><p> ELDER: You do them on a case-by-case basis. The man apologized, said he had  grown. The - the most horrific tweet was saying that if he came home and  saw his son playing with his daughter's dollhouse, he'd break the dollhouse  over his head. He later on said, he apologized, he's grown as a man--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> ELDER: --and perhaps the tweet had to do with his own insecurities as a  man. So, I think that's what you do. You apologize, be sincere, and then  keep going. </p><p> But if people keep beating you over the - over the head over it over and  over again, they're not going to forgive you, I'm not sure what the point  is, which is why I believe that Kevin Hart was morally justified in saying,  I've already apologized, I'm not going to apologize again.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> ELDER: I'm a 40-year old man. I've apologized. I've grown, let it alone.</p><p> CARLSON: I mean what happens to a society where the mob feels it has  ultimate authority on judgment? No one believes in God, so they have to  make their own judgments, hard and fast judgments--</p><p> ELDER: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: --and no forgiveness is allowed.</p><p> ELDER: Yes. And what happens to a society that's - that's so inconsistent?  For example, Kanye West--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> ELDER: --is being called an Uncle Tom and a Token, a House Negro. That  doesn't seem to bother anybody. </p><p> You got a guy in like Al Sharpton, who's got a show where he's referred to  gays as - as homos in the - in years past, Jews as interlopers. He - he  falsely accused a White man of raping a Black teenager, he has a show on  television, you know, every weekend.</p><p> So, you know, I'm not quite sure what to say, Tucker, other than it's  terribly inconsistent. It seem to me there's one rule for people who are  Conservative and one rule for people--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> ELDER: --who are on the Left.</p><p> CARLSON: I think it's best just to ignore the noise to the extent you can.  I mean they have an awful lot of power. You know, they'll de-platform you  in a second. Larry Elder--</p><p> ELDER: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: --we're rooting for you.</p><p> ELDER: Thank you. I need--</p><p> CARLSON: If they ever try to leave you, you'd (ph)--</p><p> ELDER: --I could use the help.</p><p> CARLSON: --always have a home on this show. Good to see you.</p><p> ELDER: I could use the help. Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: Thank you.</p><p> Well China just launched a new persecution of the country's Christians.  Will anyone in Washington care? Are they too busy taking Chinese money?</p><p> Plus, Paris continues to be convulsed by the worst riots there in 50 years.  What are these riots about? You know what they're about. They're about the  Paris Climate Treaty, the spirit of it, anyway. And policies they want here  are being rejected by both Left and Right in France, and they're ignoring  it because it's too inconvenient to pay attention. Details ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> TEXT: THE CHINA THREAT.</p><p> CARLSON: China has launched a new crackdown. How many news stories begin  with that sentence, \"China has launched a new crackdown?\" Many. And they  have, once again, launched new crackdown, this time, on their country's  underground Christian community.</p><p> In a coordinated sweep of nighttime raids, police rounded up about a 100  members and the pastor of the Early Rain Covenant Church. Because the  church does not submit to government control, it is illegal in China. And  members have been forbidden from attending services.</p><p> It's just the latest in a persecution wave that has shut down several  different churches with thousands of Christian members. This is what actual  religious oppression looks like, but a ruling class that's seen (ph) people  who boycott North Carolina over its bathroom laws don't care at all. </p><p> None of them are calling for boycotts or sanctions on China. There's no  witch-hunt against the countless universities, businesses, and lobbyists  with massive financial ties to China, and its authoritarian regime.</p><p> In fact, to our ruling class, China is the future. If anything, it's a  country we ought to emulate. So remember that, next time they try to  lecture you about how their values are better than yours.</p><p> The war in Afghanistan, as you well know, has continued for 17 years. It's  the longest war in the history of this country. We're still spending  billions there. American soldiers are still dying there. It might all be  worth it if we were still fighting for victory. But are we fighting for  victory?</p><p> In a newly leaked audiotape, former NATO Commander, Stanley McChrystal,  tells Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, how the war in Afghanistan should be  fought. </p><p> It's not exactly the opening speech from Patton. \"My best suggestion,\" he  says, \"Is to keep a limited number of forces there and just kind of muddle  along, and see what we can do.\"</p><p> Now, muddle along is not a strategy for anything, much less a victory. It's  a strategy to waste American money and lives for no reason at all. If U.S.  troops are going to muddle along in a war, maybe it's a sign that's a war  we shouldn't be fighting in the first place.</p><p> Well, if you can remember back a year-and-a-half, on June 1st, 2017, the  President announced he was pulling this country out of the Paris Climate  Accords. To hear the politicians and television news chintuggers (ph)  react, you'd think it was the worst natural catastrophe, well, ever.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> NANCY PELOSI, MINORITY LEADER OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF  REPRESENTATIVES, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA: What happened yesterday on the  climate issue is an embarrassment to our country and it should be an  embarrassment to him personally for how he answers to his grandchildren.</p><p> GOV. JERRY BROWN (D), CALIFORNIA: People are going to die. Habitat will be  destroyed. Seas will rise. Insects will spread.</p><p> FAREED RAFIQ ZAKARIA, CNN'S FAREED ZAKARIA GPS HOST, POLITICAL SCIENTIST,  AUTHOR, COLUMNIST: This will be the day that the United States resigned as  the leader of the free world.</p><p> JOHN KERRY, FORMER UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE: He is not helping the  forgotten American. He is hurting them. Their kids will have worse asthma  in the summer.</p><p> The President who talked about putting America first has now put America  last.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: These people are so stupid. It's amazing they have jobs. The  economy must be pretty strong, in fact, if those people have health  insurance. One thing they said though is true. </p><p> People were hurt, but not because we pulled out, but because other  countries kept to the terms of the Paris Climate Accord, including France. </p><p> This fall, France began to implement a gas tax to fight climate change  inspired by that agreement. Now, for the fourth weekend in a row, the city  of Paris has been rocked by riots and mass protests. The city is burning  and shows no signs of stopping. </p><p> What did this? Progressive climate policy. Will the people who formulated  it ever admit it? Of course, not. They're too invested.</p><p> Well the press, all of a sudden, doing everything it can to kill Elizabeth  Warren's presidential campaign before it even begins. That's kind of  interesting. Is this a mercy killing or something else going on?</p><p> Mark Steyn joins us to unravel a delightful mystery, after the break.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ELIZABETH ANN WARREN, SENIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, MASSACHUSETTS: Now, the  President likes to call my mom a liar. What do the facts say?</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The facts suggest that you absolutely have a Native  American ancestor in your pedigree.</p><p> WARREN: OK.</p><p> And Trump can say whatever he wants about me, but mocking Native Americans  or any group in order to try to get at me? That's not what America stands  for.</p><p> I'm not enrolled in a tribe and only tribes determine tribal citizenship. I  understand and respect that distinction. But my family history is my family  history.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: I mean (ph) you really just can't watch that enough. It really  should be a screensaver. This hasn't, understatement of the day, been the  fall Elizabeth Warren had hoped for. </p><p> She thought that releasing a DNA test showing that she might have had a  lone American Indian ancestor, not necessarily from this continent, a few  hundred years ago would silence the President and give her momentum going  into the primaries next year.</p><p> Instead, even the Left is turning on her. Two pieces in the Washington Post  and The New York Times in the past week suggests that Warren's campaign has  been deeply, maybe even fatally, wounded by the blunder of the DNA test. </p><p> Looks almost like an effort to kill Elizabeth Warren's campaign before she  can embarrass her party, the one to which everyone in the media belongs,  before she actually runs.</p><p> Mark Steyn is an Author and Columnist. Not a conspiracy not, I'll run this  by him anyway. So, what is going on? </p><p> So, obviously, she is a media creation, not a genius, but she has been the  subject of endless fawning profiles in the press, particularly from the  Boston Globe, which has promoted her for years, and now they're attacking  her, why?</p><p> MARK STEYN, AUTHOR, COLUMNIST, STEYNONLINE.COM: Yes. That's - that's  interesting. The Boston Globe is saying you - to Elizabeth Warren, you have  to know when not to run. And this is the paper that's wanted her to run  until she took--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: --until she got head-faked into taking this DNA test that showed she  was 1/1024th Native American, which is less Native American than the  average. </p><p> I mean you could test Kim Jong-un, Vladimir Putin, and they would - they  would be more than 1/1024th Native American just because some Cherokee  happened to change trains in Odessa in - in 1852, and got lucky with one of  the porters. </p><p> I mean any - every - anyone's more Native American. And what's fascinating- -</p><p> CARLSON: Ha-ha.</p><p> STEYN: --what's fascinating about this is that this - Elizabeth Warren was  a test on the limits of Democrat identity politics because their recent  presidential candidates have been sold on identity politics, but in rather  strange ways. </p><p> So, Barack Obama is an African-American. But he has nothing to do with the  Black slave experience or Civil Rights.</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> STEYN: He's - he's Black just because his father happened to be a British  subject born in Colonial Kenya. Barack Obama was actually the first child  of British subjects to be President, I believe, since Andrew Jackson. So,  he tried to get himself in on the colonial thing. </p><p> Obama said his step-grandfather in Indonesia had died fighting Dutch  soldiers in the struggle for independence. In fact, it turned out his step- grandfather died when he fell off a chair while changing the drapes. That's  not a joke. That's actually true. That's how his step-grandfather died.</p><p> Then you have Hillary Clinton, who's running as a feminist icon and is, in  fact, only the candidate because she's the wife of the previous guy, and  she was given a Senate seat as a reward for standing by him, when his  intern's dress wound up in the FBI crime analysis lab - lab.</p><p> So, we have very--</p><p> CARLSON: Ha-ha.</p><p> STEYN: --so in such a world, you can't blame Elizabeth Warren for saying,  \"Well, if Hillary could be a feminist icon, why can't I be the first Native  American President?\" </p><p> She was Harvard Law School's first woman of color. That's why it's not a  family law thing. She actually was promoted as Harvard Law School's first  woman of color. Why shouldn't she be America's first - first Native  American President?</p><p> CARLSON: Such a good (ph)--</p><p> STEYN: Since this is (ph)-- </p><p> CARLSON: --such a good example (ph).</p><p> STEYN: --none - none of this identity politics. Joe Biden should run as the  first transgender woman candidate and dare the Democrat electorate to call  him on it.</p><p> CARLSON: That was my plan.</p><p> STEYN: I mean this is this (ph)--</p><p> CARLSON: I hope he doesn't get there first.</p><p> STEYN: --no don't (ph)--</p><p> CARLSON: I'm doing that (ph). You're the best.</p><p> STEYN: Yes (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: Mark Steyn, we're out of time.</p><p> STEYN: Thanks a lot, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: I loved it. Thank you.</p><p> STEYN: Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: Man that was fun. Back tomorrow, 8 P.M., show that is the sworn  enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and, especially, groupthink. Good night  from Washington.

If you've been watching television recently, you've probably heard the bad  news. The Trump Administration is over, toast, cooked, done for good, and  along with it any hope of the middle-class revolution that 63 million  Americans voted for two years ago.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The reason for this tragedy is simple. The President has been caught  committing felonies. Here's what the legal experts without law degrees are  saying on television.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LAWRENCE O'DONNELL, THE LAST WORD WITH LAWRENCE O'DONNELL HOST, MSNBC: If  precedent means anything in the Trump era, Donald Trump will be, must be,  impeached because of the crimes prosecutors say he committed in the Michael  Cohen case.</p><p>ROBERT E. MOOK, FORMER POLITICAL CAMPAIGN STRATEGIST AND CAMPAIGN MANAGER,  CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Both parties need to get on board to pass  articles of impeachment.</p><p>EDDIE GLAUDE, CHAIR, CENTER FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN STUDIES: You have  conspiracy, you have - you have obstruction, you have campaigns finance and  you have emoluments. </p><p>If the Democrats do not pursue this vigorously, they will be, in some ways,  held accountable for abdicating their responsibility.</p><p>It goes to the moral question, the ethical question. Democracy is at stake.</p><p>MAXINE MOORE WATERS, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR CALIFORNIA'S 43RD  CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, DEMOCRATIC PARTY MEMBER: This criminal must be  brought up by the Congress of the United States for impeachment.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CARLSON: We're not even (ph) going to show you the Don Lemon tape. There's  a lot of emotion there. But to sum up, they're telling us that we're  staring down the barrel of a constitutional crisis. And that crisis stems  from what MSNBC describes as, quote, the crimes prosecutors say the  President committed in the Michael Cohen case.</p><p>Which crimes were those? We have the answer. The relevant details were  spelled out in a piece that ran over the weekend in The New York Times  under this headline. \"Prosecutors say Trump directed illegal payments  during campaign.\"</p><p>The gist of the story is this. Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, has  told federal prosecutors that he facilitated payments to two women who said  they had affairs with Donald Trump. And then, well actually that's it.  That's the entire story right there.</p><p>Paying these two women, say federal prosecutors and their flacks at NBC  News, was a serious crime, a crime worthy of impeachment, if not,  indictment. OK. But you might be wondering, how exactly is that criminal?  Well, we're going to explain it to you.</p><p>We're going to start by stipulating that everything Michael Cohen has told  the feds is absolutely true. Now, assuming honesty isn't usually a wise  idea with Michael Cohen, but for the sake of argument, let's do it in this  case, everything he says is true, why is what Cohen is alleging a criminal  offense?</p><p>Remember the facts of the story. These are undisputed. Two women approached  Donald Trump and threatened to ruin his career and humiliate his family if  he doesn't give them money. Now, that sounds like a classic case of  extortion.</p><p>Yet, for whatever reason, Trump caves to it, and he directs Michael Cohen  to pay the ransom. Now, more than two years later, Trump is a felon for  doing this. It doesn't seem to make any sense.</p><p>Oh, but you're not a federal prosecutor on a political mission. If you were  a federal prosecutor on a political mission, you would construe those  extortion payments as campaign contributions. You'd do this even though the  money in question did not come from or go to Donald Trump's presidential  campaign.</p><p>Then you'd claim that Trump and Michael Cohen violated campaign finance law  because they didn't publicly disclose those payments despite the fact that  disclosing them would nullify the reason for making them in the first  place, which was to keep the whole thing secret.</p><p>That is the argument you would make, both in federal court and through your  proxies on cable television. It is insultingly stupid. But because everyone  in power hates the target of your investigation, nobody would question you,  and that's what's happening right now.</p><p>Now, by this reasoning, any money a political candidate spends to maintain  or protect his image while running for office now qualifies as a regulated  campaign donation, and has to be disclosed. That would include, by the way,  in addition to an infinite number of other things, buying toothpaste and  getting a haircut.</p><p>It would definitely include the taxpayer-financed slush fund that Congress  has set aside to pay off its own sexual harassment claims. Yes, those now  qualify as campaign contributions. They must be publicly disclosed, except,  of course, they're not publicly disclosed, and they never will be. Why is  that?</p><p>Well that might be a question for Congressional leaders including, now that  we think about it, Congressman Adam Schiff of Burbank, California. He's the  incoming Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, a very powerful man  in the Congress. </p><p>What does Mr. Schiff have to say about Congress not disclosing the very  same payments that Democrats say Trump should be impeached for not  disclosing? Let's ask him.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ADAM BENNETT SCHIFF, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR CALIFORNIA'S 28TH  CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, DEMOCRATIC PARTY MEMBER: There's a very real  prospect that on the day Donald Trump leaves office the Justice Department  may indict him that he may be the first president in quite some time to  face the real prospect of jail time.</p><p>NEAL KUMAR KATYAL, LAWYER, FORMER ACTING SOLICITOR GENERAL OF THE UNITED  STATES, LAW PROFESSOR AT GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY: Trump knows that he's  facing some pretty strong criminal liability when he leaves office, one way  or another. And, you know, even if a (ph) sitting president can't be  indicted, he's got to know his future looks like it's behind bars unless he  cuts some sort of deal with the prosecutors.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: So to translate, Trump's a criminal. He's going to jail for  committing a smaller version of the same made-up crime that we in Congress  have committed for years and forced you to pay for. </p><p>And, by the way, we're never apologizing for that because we don't have to  and CNN isn't going to make us. Screw you, America, and your stupid  election. We are in charge. That's the real message here, in case you  missed it.</p><p>Chris Hahn is a radio host and former aide to Senator Chuck Schumer, and he  joins us tonight. </p><p>So, Chris, I think you don't like Trump but that's fine. But speak slowly  so I can understand. Explain to me why paying off someone who is extorting  you, threatening to make public details of your personal life, if she  doesn't get paid, why paying that person is a felony?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER HAHN, AMERICAN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, DEMOCRATIC PARTY  ACTIVIST, RADIO SHOW HOST, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, first of all, we  don't know that there was actual extortion here. We know that a payment was  made. There was a catch and kill deal with the National Enquirer. Whether  or not it was extortion, that hasn't been proven yet, nor has it even  really been alleged in many cases--</p><p>CARLSON: Well, I'm--</p><p>HAHN: --by the President. He's not saying--</p><p>CARLSON: --I'm alleging, I'm - hold on, let me--</p><p>HAHN: --he's not say--</p><p>CARLSON: --let me just stop and say, I'm alleging it because it's obvious.  You're not going to pay a $100,000 or a $150,000 or $200,000 to someone  unless there's a threat to you and your reputation. This is extortion. </p><p>And I don't - I don't know why it's not being prosecuted. I don't know - I  don't know why Trump isn't defending himself on those grounds, I would. But  it clearly is extortion.</p><p>HAHN: Well--</p><p>CARLSON: But why is it a crime to pay off--</p><p>HAHN: --well sometimes people want--</p><p>CARLSON: --someone-- </p><p>HAHN: --sometimes people--</p><p>CARLSON: --who you had an affair with?</p><p>HAHN: --sometimes people want to tell us - they want to tell a story that  he doesn't want told. He said--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>HAHN: --hey, just tell it to me. I'll pay for it and--</p><p>CARLSON: That's extortion. It's--</p><p>HAHN: --and pay for yourselves (ph). That's what he did--</p><p>CARLSON: --that's - that's what - if I did that to you-- </p><p>HAHN: --in this situation.</p><p>CARLSON: --you would call it - if I said, \"Look, I know a detail about your  sex life, Chris Hahn, and I'm going to tell it on my show on TV unless you  pay me,\" that would be extortion, obviously. So, this is extortion. But  leaving that aside, why is it a felony to pay women you've had sexual  relationships with?</p><p>HAHN: It's not a felony. It's a felony to--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh.</p><p>HAHN: --do a campaign expenditure and not - and not disclose it, and that's  what this has been.</p><p>CARLSON: How is that a campaign expenditure?</p><p>HAHN: This seems to have been a campaign - he - he made this during the  campaign for the purposes of the campaign. There are tape recordings of him  discussing this with Michael Cohen. And that's just one--</p><p>CARLSON: Well, for the purposes of the campaign, I'm - wait--</p><p>HAHN: --look, this isn't even the - this is just a--</p><p>CARLSON: --no, but, wait, hold on, wait, hold on, I'm confused. No, it's  not a small thing. It's the thing. This is the crime that The New York Time  told us on Saturday, federal prosecutors are alleging the President  committed, it's a felony, and Michael Cohen pled guilty--</p><p>HAHN: Well they also--</p><p>CARLSON: --to a species of this. So, I just want to get to the bottom of  it. Why is that a campaign--</p><p>HAHN: Well, they're also alleging--</p><p>CARLSON: --contribution to pay off a former girlfriend? I'm honestly  confused. You're a campaign guy, tell me.</p><p>HAHN: They're - look, there's also an allegation that he may have violated  the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act when he was doing his deal in Moscow.</p><p>CARLSON: Well there are (ph) allegations that he killed Kennedy.</p><p>HAHN: There are a lot more to this than just paying off--</p><p>CARLSON: But I want - but hold on, no, no, no, no - </p><p>HAHN: --there's - there's a lot--</p><p>CARLSON: --OK--</p><p>HAHN: --there's a lot more to this than just paying off--</p><p>CARLSON: --OK, well how about one allegation--</p><p>HAHN: --porn stars who he slept with--</p><p>CARLSON: --slow down (ph), one allegation--</p><p>HAHN: --you know, a couple years ago.</p><p>CARLSON: --one allegation at a time. So, federal prosecutors--</p><p>HAHN: OK.</p><p>CARLSON: --this is not just something that dumb people on TV are talking  about, though they are. This is something that--</p><p>HAHN: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --prosecutors in New York State are saying they have, apparently,  evidence to indict over. So, tell me why because lot of people in - in  Washington pay off their girlfriends, including lots of people in Congress,  a lot of people in Congress, including I, even, guess some Democrats, just  throwing that out there. So, tell me why that's a campaign--</p><p>HAHN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --contribution to pay off your girlfriend?</p><p>HAHN: Well, first of all, I think that fund that Congress was using to pay  people off who were harassed needs to be disclosed and the Members who were  involved with those disclosure decisions need to be removed--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, I'm sure that'll happen right away. That'll happen right away.</p><p>HAHN: --from Congress right now. OK. I--</p><p>CARLSON: I'm sure MSNBC will push--</p><p>HAHN: I agree with you - I agree with you on that.</p><p>CARLSON: --real hard for that. Right, OK so but--</p><p>HAHN: I - I agree with you on--</p><p>CARLSON: --but tell me why it's a campaign--</p><p>HAHN: --I agree with you on that point.</p><p>CARLSON: --this is central question. Why is it and for all of us--</p><p>HAHN: Well, look, well--</p><p>CARLSON: --why is that a campaign contribution?</p><p>HAHN: --well here's the thing.</p><p>CARLSON: The money didn't come from the campaign. It didn't go to the  campaign. It was a threat to his reputation and his livelihood, as all  extortion is, right? So, why is that a campaign--</p><p>HAHN: There's black--</p><p>CARLSON: --contribution?</p><p>HAHN: --there's black letter law. There's black letter law here, OK?</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Well what is it?</p><p>HAHN: The campaign finance law is pretty clear about what you can and  cannot do with funds. And these funds were not necessarily from Trump's own  pockets. There was all sorts of schemes put together by the President and  Michael Cohen to move this money around, so it wasn't traced back to - to -  to President Trump.</p><p>CARLSON: But - but hold on, no--</p><p>HAHN: That in and of itself should--</p><p>CARLSON: --no, no, no, no, no--</p><p>HAHN: --raise red flags. You would be--</p><p>CARLSON: --no, no, you know, wait, stop, stop, stop, stop, no, no, no, no--</p><p>HAHN: --people would be blowing their mind off right now--</p><p>CARLSON: --wait, wait, stop, stop, stop, stop--</p><p>HAHN: --if you're (ph) the President.</p><p>CARLSON: --maybe. I mean we've never had a president like Trump in a  million different ways. And I'm not defending--</p><p>HAHN: No, we never have.</p><p>CARLSON: --I'm not defending his personal life. I'm merely saying--</p><p>HAHN: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --this is now being described as a felony, as a crime for which  the President could be removed. So, now is the time when we need to be very  specific about what the crime is because you're - you've stopped all  business of government, so we can respond to this. So, let's respond right  now. Tell me how and where--</p><p>HAHN: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --in campaign finance law it says, you're not allowed to use your  money, there's no allegation this was campaign money, your money to pay off  a former girlfriend? There isn't and that's this made-up (ph)--</p><p>HAHN: Oh, this is not--</p><p>CARLSON: --it's a lie--</p><p>HAHN: --the allegation here is not--</p><p>CARLSON: --actually.</p><p>HAHN: --the allegation here is not that it's just his money. There's  allegation that he moved money around through various schemes--</p><p>CARLSON: No, but not - they're not from the campaign--</p><p>HAHN: --to pay these women off--</p><p>CARLSON: --no, but, by the way--</p><p>HAHN: --including with the (ph) man who--</p><p>CARLSON: --you're allowed to do that too.</p><p>HAHN: --hold on a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait--</p><p>CARLSON: You're allowed to hide the payments.</p><p>HAHN: --he hid the payments--</p><p>CARLSON: What, is that a crime now--</p><p>HAHN: --that was campaign in nature--</p><p>CARLSON: --if it's your money?</p><p>HAHN: --that is a violation of--</p><p>CARLSON: Why does a campaign and (ph)--</p><p>HAHN: --a clear violation of campaign finance laws.</p><p>CARLSON: --hold on till then (ph), I'm giving you a chance on TV--</p><p>HAHN: It needed to be disclosed--</p><p>CARLSON: --hold on, hold on. No, no, just I'll let you speak and I'll let  you speak slowly--</p><p>HAHN: Go ahead.</p><p>CARLSON: --so our audience can understand. Where in campaign finance law  does it say that taking money that's not from your political campaign to  respond to an extortion attempt to pay off your girlfriend or pay the  gardener, pay anybody, why is that a felony? And where does it say that?</p><p>HAHN: Camp--</p><p>CARLSON: What are you talking about?</p><p>HAHN: --campaign finance law - look, I'm not going to quote the section and  verse. I don't know it off the top of my head--</p><p>CARLSON: Paraphrase it for me.</p><p>HAHN: --even though I'm a lawyer. Campaign finance - campaign finance law  clearly states that any money spent for campaign purposes, specifically by  people other than the candidate, must be disclosed. This is what's--</p><p>CARLSON: But why is that a campaign--</p><p>HAHN: --being alleged right here--</p><p>CARLSON: --purpose?</p><p>HAHN: --hold on, hold on, hold on--</p><p>CARLSON: What (ph)?</p><p>HAHN: --the President and Michael Cohen clearly set up a scheme so that  other people could pay these women off on behalf of Donald Trump while he  was running--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. OK. That--</p><p>HAHN: --for President because--</p><p>CARLSON: --that's fine but--</p><p>HAHN: --they thought that these (ph) allegations would sink his campaign  and his reputation.</p><p>CARLSON: But - but maybe - maybe under--</p><p>HAHN: That's a violation.</p><p>CARLSON: --no, actually, because anybody faced, I'm not, you know, I don't  know a single man who faced with that allegation, who he (ph) thought he  could squelch it wouldn't pay the person off because it does incalculable  damage to your reputation, whether you're running for anything or not. </p><p>And so, that's - it's so clearly not a campaign violation that I wonder if  we want to set this precedent. Do you want to live in a world where people  paying off extortion attempts are now campaign finance felons? I mean this  is lunatic.</p><p>HAHN: This is strike--</p><p>CARLSON: And you know it.</p><p>HAHN: --this - this is strikingly similar to what happened to John Edwards.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, and it's awful. It's awful what happened to--</p><p>HAHN: I'm not saying the President will be convicted but--</p><p>CARLSON: --John Edwards--</p><p>HAHN: --this is strikingly--</p><p>CARLSON: --I thought.</p><p>HAHN: --similar--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, it is. It is.</p><p>HAHN: --situation.</p><p>CARLSON: And what happened to him was--</p><p>HAHN: And it is something, look--</p><p>CARLSON: --wrong. It was another populace--</p><p>HAHN: --well--</p><p>CARLSON: --they took out with this BS campaign finance nonsense, exactly  what happened.</p><p>HAHN: --look, it is more than--</p><p>CARLSON: And, you know (ph), we're out of time.</p><p>HAHN: --campaign finance law.</p><p>CARLSON: --no.</p><p>HAHN: It's more than campaign finance law.</p><p>CARLSON: No, it's not.</p><p>HAHN: It is the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.</p><p>CARLSON: No, it's a totally separate thing.</p><p>HAHN: That in and of itself is a problem-- </p><p>CARLSON: Look, if - if he violated that I will (ph) defend it.</p><p>HAHN: Well, yes. And then (ph) also alleged by Cohen is--</p><p>CARLSON: But in this case, this is made-up.</p><p>HAHN: --also part of this.</p><p>CARLSON: All right, Chris Hahn, thank you.</p><p>HAHN: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Good to see you.</p><p>One of the most hysterical reactions in the past few days came from a  former Obama Administration U.S. Attorney, who says the President should be  stripped of his office.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARBARA MCQUADE, FORMER UNITED STATES ATTORNEY FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF  MICHIGAN, PROFESSOR OF LAW AT UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN LAW SCHOOL, LEGAL  ANALYST FOR NBC NEWS AND MSNBC: It could be that President Trump procured  the presidency by fraud. </p><p>When immigrants procure their citizenship by fraud, we strip them of their  citizenship. When a president procures his presidency by fraud, should we  consider doing the same?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Alan Dershowitz is, of course, a retired Harvard Law School  professor. He's the Author of the book, The Case Against Impeaching Trump,  and he joins us tonight.</p><p>Professor, I got a couple questions. But the first relates just to the  sound bite we played. Is there a provision in the Constitution for  stripping, whatever that means, stripping the presidency from a President  who you think is illegitimate, whatever that means?</p><p>ALAN MORTON DERSHOWITZ, LAWYER, THE CASE AGAINST IMPEACHING TRUMP AUTHOR,  HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR EMERITUS: Sure. It's called the 25th Amendment, but  not on the grounds of illegitimacy. I want everyone out there to imagine  the following scenario. </p><p>Let's assume when Bill Clinton was running for president, Paula Jones came  up to him and said, \"Unless you pay me a $130,000, I'll reveal our affair.\" </p><p>And let's assume, Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, together, did exactly  what it's alleged that Donald Trump and Cohen did together, I guarantee you  The New York Times, NBC, MSNBC would be railing against any prosecutor who  dared to suggest that this was a violation of the campaign (ph) finance  law. Everybody would be on the other side of this issue. </p><p>There'd be Republicans out there saying, \"Strip him of the presidency,  impeach him, indict him.\" Every Democrat would be saying this is a witch- hunt, this is terrible. We need a single standard. If you wouldn't go after  Bill Clinton, don't go after Donald Trump. </p><p>If you're going after Donald Trump, then you have to go after Hillary  Clinton for everything that she allegedly did. For example, one of your  guests talked about a Federal Corrupt Practices Act. That applies when you  bribe a foreign official.</p><p>What they're arguing is that there was a rumor that maybe somebody offered  Putin a penthouse in a Tower that Trump was thinking of building in Moscow.  And if that had been done, it would be a violation of the FCPA, Federal  Corrupt Practices Act. </p><p>But it's all based on hypotheticals and maybes. And I just want everybody  to apply the shoe on the other foot test. If Hillary Clinton were  president, the Republicans were saying, \"Lock her up,\" everybody would be  on the other side. They'd be screaming about how dare you expand criminal  statutes, how dare you expand the criteria for impeachment? </p><p>Now, all these liberal Democrat fair-weather civil libertarians are saying,  \"The hell with the Constitution, the hell with civil liberties, put all  that aside, get Trump.\" That's the most important consideration. Get him by  any means possible. This is such a danger to our constitutional system that  I would hope that true civil libertarians would rebel against that, as I  am.</p><p>CARLSON: Is - is it unfair to describe this scenario as extortion? I say I  know something about your sex life. I know a secret about you that you want  to keep the - that's non-criminal (ph), but that you want to keep hidden.  And unless you pay me money, I'm going to reveal it. That seems like  textbook extortion to me. Why is it not?</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: It is absolutely textbook extortion. And there ought to be a  prosecution of any person, man or woman, who approaches any candidate or  anybody else and says, \"Unless you pay me money, I'm going to reveal a sex  act that occurred.\" That is absolute classic extortion. </p><p>And it's shocking that the Special Counsel looking into this, who has a  broad mandate, he described it very broadly, isn't looking into the  extortion committed by, at least, the porn star, whose lawyer obviously  approached the candidate or the candidate's people, and threatened  exposure.</p><p>Otherwise, why would you pay? Just listen to the tape. The tape makes that  clear. The tape that Cohen made unwittingly of President Trump, it's clear  that they were paying off an extortion--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: --in order to prevent these issues from coming out for multiple  reasons, to protect his family, to protect his brand--</p><p>CARLSON: Sure.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: --possibly, to influence the campaign. </p><p>Let's remember one more thing. A President can contribute to a candidate as  much as he wants. If - if Bloomberg runs for president, he could announce  tomorrow, \"I'm not taking a nickel. I'm putting $1 billion of my own money  into this campaign.\" </p><p>That's perfectly legitimate. As far as reporting is concerned, it's the  campaign that has to report. And if these payments had to be reported, they  had to be reported after the election, the reporting time was after the  election so, it couldn't have impacted the election.</p><p>So, the absurd notion that he won the presidency by fraud and should be  stripped of the presidency (ph) reflects incredible ignorance about the  timing here, and how these statutes operate.</p><p>CARLSON: This is getting so crazy, it's - it's making my head spin. I  appreciate your coming on and explaining that to us, professor. Thank you  very much.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Well we've been saying it for a couple of years. Now, we have hard  scientific evidence that, in fact, big tech is altering and harming the  brains of children. Is it time to do something about that? What if we knew  it was true? Well we do know it's true now. We've got details next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TEXT: TECH TYRANNY.</p><p>CARLSON: Well Google collects more data than probably any other company,  and probably knows more about you than you do. You think this might raise  some concerns about the concentration of power. </p><p>But, for years, Congress seems to have cared not at all either because they  were ideologically predisposed to Google or because they were in its  pocket. Meanwhile, Google became more and more powerful, ominously  powerful. </p><p>Now, finally, during the lame-duck session, Congress has summoned the CEO  of Google, Sundar Pichai, to answer some questions about data transparency,  coming to Capitol Hill this week. What should Congress ask him about?</p><p>Harmeet Dhillon has followed this issue maybe more closely than any other  attorney in the United States, and she joins us tonight. Harmeet, thank you  very much for coming on. So what--</p><p>HARMEET DHILLON, AMERICAN LAWYER, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL LAWYERS ASSOCIATION  BOARD MEMBER, FORMER VICE CHAIRWOMAN OF THE CALIFORNIA REPUBLICAN PARTY,  AND THE NATIONAL COMMITTEEWOMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE FOR  CALIFORNIA: Hi, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: --what should be the - the list of questions?</p><p>DHILLON: Well, this is only a subset of the issues that people should be  asking Google that is the subject of the testimony tomorrow. But Google,  for years, as you pointed out, has been collecting data, and not disclosing  to users, number one, the extent of the collection of the data or what  they're doing with the data.</p><p>We have also learned of significant breaches, including today, an  announcement of a major breach of 52.5 million users on the Google+ failed  experiment in social media. It's not clear when that happened. </p><p>Google is not disclosing to people exactly what happened and what use has  been made of it. And they, as you pointed out, they just get away with it,  because we have both effete politicians in Washington, even on the  Republican side, and government agencies whose tasks it is to examine these  issues, and protect consumers. So, consumers are really at a complete loss. </p><p>Now, what I expect to happen on Capitol Hill tomorrow is that there'll be  some posturing questions written by staffers that Members of Congress are  going to read out, and you're going to have some focus group tested  jargony, you know, in - incomprehensible responses from Sundar Pichai  designed to placate these folks.</p><p>There'll be a little bit of a dance and everybody will go home, not  understanding what the answers were, and not probably going to do anything  about it. And this is a real tragedy and missed opportunity, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: What a shame? I want to (ph) ask you another story, another  element of the Google story. </p><p>Newly leaked email show that several Google employees plotted to destroy  the news site, Breitbart, after the 2016 election, a secret internal  discussion group labeled Resist. Google employees discussed how they could  use the, quote, hate speech and fake news labels to justify cutting off  Breitbart's ad revenues.</p><p>Harmeet, this is kind of the stuff of Conservative fever dreams that Google  would be actually doing something like this. Are you surprised by it? And  what can be done, in response?</p><p>DHILLON: Well Google - A, I'm not surprised. B, Google is denying it. But  there's extensive evidence that Google did this, and they did it in two  ways. </p><p>One way is right after the election, as you mentioned, a number of very  excitable Left-wing Google executives and employees tried to squeeze  Breitbart and other Conservative outlets into this hate speech category.</p><p>They then confessed that after a lot of effort that was really tough. So,  they also did a two-pronged approach, and the other side of that approach  is having their ad people contact customers and tell them that it might be  dangerous or a bad idea to advertise or allow their ads to be placed on  Conservative news websites like Breitbart and others.</p><p>And they pointed to some outside groups like Sleeping Giant that makes it a  - a business practice of defaming Conservative writers and organizations,  and use that as a smear. </p><p>Google also does this in many other ways like through its YouTube. It  categorizes content as sensitive, which automatically, both, makes it hard  to find the content online, and also strips that content from the ability  to gain advertising revenue.</p><p>So, Google is doing this systematically. Google is doing this purposefully.  Google is getting away with doing this. And I think it violates not just  some laws, including Communications Decency Act and others, but it - it  violates state laws that have to do with fraud and transparency, unfair  business practices and competition.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>DHILLON: Again, Google is able to get away with this because, you know,  they - they contribute to some Conservative groups like CPAC, lot of money  to show up at CPAC, and - and certainly on Capitol Hill. </p><p>They get away with it, and we see nothing done to control this - this, you  know, duopoly and monopoly on advertising revenue. It's very dangerous  because it's shaping what young people in America, who mainly get their  news through--</p><p>CARLSON: Of course.</p><p>DHILLON: --Google see every day.</p><p>CARLSON: Looking back, the Congress allowing Google to become more powerful  than the U.S. government, subverting our democracy entirely, that'll be the  thing we hold Members responsible for, I think, historically. </p><p>Harmeet Dhillon, you will not be held responsible since you're a lonely  voice on the right side, thank you for joining us, as always.</p><p>DHILLON: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Meanwhile, we've been saying it for years. Now, there is hard  scientific evidence that big tech is, in fact, harming our children. </p><p>New 60 Minutes report this week highlighted research that shows children  who use tablet smartphones and other screens more than seven hours a day,  and that's a lot of kids, believe it or not, are developing different brain  structures. Their brains are being damaged by this. </p><p>Tom Kersting is a psychotherapist, who's written extensively on this  subject, and he joins us tonight. You must feel vindicated by this report,  Tom.</p><p>TOM KERSTING, PSYCHOTHERAPIST, DISCONNECTED AUTHOR: I do. I do. I'm  actually happy to see it, to be honest with you because--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --it's something I've been speaking about for so many years at  lectures and in my book. And now, we could finally have some scientific  preliminary evidence showing exactly what all of this tech is doing to the  brain.</p><p>CARLSON: So, what is it doing?</p><p>KERSTING: Well, first of all, the area of the brain called the cortex,  which is the outer layer of the brain, the preliminary study that the - the  research has conducted, shows a - a premature thinning of that part of the  brain, OK, which is - which is kind of frightening, considering the  importance of that part of the brain, what it does, how it's very important  just for human beings in terms of organizing, planning, and a host of other  different things.</p><p>Another component that you don't hear much about is something called  neuroplasticity, which is actually the greatest breakthrough in modern day  psychology. And the term plasticity meaning that the brain, although very  strong and rigid, can be molded and shaped if placed in - in the right  environment for three or more hours per day. </p><p>We know that the average kid is spending nine hours a day, on average, in  what I consider to be the most highly stimulating of worlds. And what  happens is the brain will actually grow new neural pathways, it'll re- organize its circuitry to adapt to that cyber world.</p><p>And the problem is what I'm seeing clinically is an unadapting of - of  young kids in a real world having a very difficult time coping with just  the trivial nuances of life, the anxiety disorders, the depressions, and so  forth.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. Well and it's all kinds of measurements are showing the  horrifying results of it. How young, exactly, are kids getting addicted?</p><p>KERSTING: Well, we're seeing right now that there's some - some research  that came out recently that there - there's the kids as - as young as two  years old showing signs of depression. And, right now, the average age for  first smartphone issuance is about age 10.</p><p>And, you know, when I give lectures, every parent knows that this is bad.  But it's sort of, you know, what you talk about it you love (ph) the - the  term groupthink. I - I use the term social conformity. </p><p>We tend to do what everybody else is doing. And parents, anybody listening,  you have got to do what is in the best interest of your child, not - not  what everybody else around you is doing.</p><p>CARLSON: So, can you just give me the 20-second answer to the question I  always ask you, which is why are we so passive in the face of this? If two- year-olds were huffing on Marlboros, we'd say, \"You know what? No, not  allowed.\" But we just sort of sit back and let our society collapse in the  face of this, why?</p><p>KERSTING: Well, the reason, in my opinion, the reason why is - and we talk  about - I always talk about common sense, all right? </p><p>It's pretty clear, if we go walk around and everybody's got their heads  buried in a device all day long, you pull up to a traffic light, and they  can't even contain themselves for a minute without looking at their device,  it's pretty clear that it's having an impact on their behavior.</p><p>Now, the reason why nobody is--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --doing anything about it is because we're always looking for  scientific evidence, all right, and now we have some of it, and we're going  to start seeing a lot more of it. And--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --and we're going to start seeing some changes, as a result,  Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, and it's we waited too long for the studies to confirm the  obvious. Tom, thank you very much.</p><p>KERSTING: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, Hollywood doesn't need to remake 1984 again, not that they  would, it's probably illegal. But they already do a perfect job of  replicating it in real life. They are living the plotline of George  Orwell's novel. Kevin Hart is the latest person to be destroyed for  statements that he made many years ago. We'll tell you his story after the  break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TEXT: AMERICA'S NEWS HQ.</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Live from America's News  headquarters, I'm Trace Gallagher.</p><p>No bail decision yet for a top Chinese executive who's facing possible  extradition from Canada to the U.S. The case of Meng Wanzhou has fueled  U.S.-China trade tensions and rocked financial markets.</p><p>Meng is the Chief Financial Officer of telecommunications giant, Huawei.  She was detained December 1st during a layover in Vancouver. She's accused  of misleading banks about the company's business dealings in Iran. </p><p>There is a concerning uptick in paralyzing illness among children. The  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now says there have been more  cases than ever. There are a 158 confirmed cases so far this year. </p><p>The illness called acute flaccid myelitis causes paralysis in the face,  neck, back, arms or legs. The symptoms usually come a week following a  fever and respiratory illness. </p><p>I'm Trace Gallagher, now back to Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Hollywood has issued a new decree. And, of course, everyone obeyed  immediately. Kevin Hart's career must be destroyed. </p><p>Just days after the Comedian was announced as the next Host of the Oscars,  the now-irrelevant awards show some people still watch, Hart was forced to  step down over tweets and stand-up routines from about a decade ago that  some said were anti-gay.</p><p>Now, these tweets had already come to light. Hart had already apologized  for them and said he was changing his routine, but it didn't matter. In  today's political environment, there is no such thing as forgiveness or  mercy. What you're seeing is, instead, a particularly powerful form of  bullying. Do and think exactly as we say, or else.</p><p>Larry Elder has fought the forces of conformity for a long time. He's a  radio show host from Los Angeles, and he joins us tonight. We're really  glad to have you, Larry Elder, thank you. So, what's the takeaway from  watching what just happened to Kevin Hart?</p><p>LARRY ELDER, RADIO SHOW HOST, WRITER, ATTORNEY: The takeaway, Tucker, is  what the devil are the rules. As you pointed out--</p><p>CARLSON: Right. I got it (ph).</p><p>ELDER: --Kevin Hart did these tweets some years ago and - and made anti-gay  references in his stand-up some years ago. He apologized back in 2015. The  Academy Award people wanted him to apologize again. He refused.</p><p>Now, the show is going to be carried by ABC. ABC parent company is Disney.  Disney also owns ESPN. They've employed Keith Olbermann, who is a - a Trump  hater from way back. And just last year, he tweeted that Trump was a Nazi  and dropped a bunch of F-bombs in his tweet. That didn't seem to bother  Disney. But Kevin Hart has to go.</p><p>The other inconsistency, of course, is that other comedians like Amy  Schumer, who last year, I think it was, hosted a Democratic fundraiser, has  used the - the F-word for gays in a tweet, as has Sarah Silverman, as has  Chelsea Handler, all of whom have hosted shows.</p><p>And finally, you have the instance of Joy Ann Reid on MSNBC who had a blog  2007, 2008--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>ELDER: --a very anti-gay post she made, and she wasn't joking, she wasn't a  comedian, including dissing the movie Brokeback Mountain, and said she  hated watching men kiss. She then said she apologized. </p><p>Then, later on, she said she was hacked. NBC did a search to find out  whether or not she'd been hacked. Turned out she wasn't hacked. So, she  either misremembered or lied, and then apologized again. She has a show on  MSNBC. So, forgive Kevin Hart for not - for not knowing what the rules are.</p><p>CARLSON: Well that's and - so, but what's the best response? I think you're  absolutely right. All of us at some point are going to be accused of  thoughtcrime, and the mob will come for us. It's inevitable.</p><p>ELDER: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: How do we respond? What's the best way to respond?</p><p>ELDER: You do them on a case-by-case basis. The man apologized, said he had  grown. The - the most horrific tweet was saying that if he came home and  saw his son playing with his daughter's dollhouse, he'd break the dollhouse  over his head. He later on said, he apologized, he's grown as a man--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>ELDER: --and perhaps the tweet had to do with his own insecurities as a  man. So, I think that's what you do. You apologize, be sincere, and then  keep going. </p><p>But if people keep beating you over the - over the head over it over and  over again, they're not going to forgive you, I'm not sure what the point  is, which is why I believe that Kevin Hart was morally justified in saying,  I've already apologized, I'm not going to apologize again.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>ELDER: I'm a 40-year old man. I've apologized. I've grown, let it alone.</p><p>CARLSON: I mean what happens to a society where the mob feels it has  ultimate authority on judgment? No one believes in God, so they have to  make their own judgments, hard and fast judgments--</p><p>ELDER: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --and no forgiveness is allowed.</p><p>ELDER: Yes. And what happens to a society that's - that's so inconsistent?  For example, Kanye West--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>ELDER: --is being called an Uncle Tom and a Token, a House Negro. That  doesn't seem to bother anybody. </p><p>You got a guy in like Al Sharpton, who's got a show where he's referred to  gays as - as homos in the - in years past, Jews as interlopers. He - he  falsely accused a White man of raping a Black teenager, he has a show on  television, you know, every weekend.</p><p>So, you know, I'm not quite sure what to say, Tucker, other than it's  terribly inconsistent. It seem to me there's one rule for people who are  Conservative and one rule for people--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>ELDER: --who are on the Left.</p><p>CARLSON: I think it's best just to ignore the noise to the extent you can.  I mean they have an awful lot of power. You know, they'll de-platform you  in a second. Larry Elder--</p><p>ELDER: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --we're rooting for you.</p><p>ELDER: Thank you. I need--</p><p>CARLSON: If they ever try to leave you, you'd (ph)--</p><p>ELDER: --I could use the help.</p><p>CARLSON: --always have a home on this show. Good to see you.</p><p>ELDER: I could use the help. Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you.</p><p>Well China just launched a new persecution of the country's Christians.  Will anyone in Washington care? Are they too busy taking Chinese money?</p><p>Plus, Paris continues to be convulsed by the worst riots there in 50 years.  What are these riots about? You know what they're about. They're about the  Paris Climate Treaty, the spirit of it, anyway. And policies they want here  are being rejected by both Left and Right in France, and they're ignoring  it because it's too inconvenient to pay attention. Details ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TEXT: THE CHINA THREAT.</p><p>CARLSON: China has launched a new crackdown. How many news stories begin  with that sentence, \"China has launched a new crackdown?\" Many. And they  have, once again, launched new crackdown, this time, on their country's  underground Christian community.</p><p>In a coordinated sweep of nighttime raids, police rounded up about a 100  members and the pastor of the Early Rain Covenant Church. Because the  church does not submit to government control, it is illegal in China. And  members have been forbidden from attending services.</p><p>It's just the latest in a persecution wave that has shut down several  different churches with thousands of Christian members. This is what actual  religious oppression looks like, but a ruling class that's seen (ph) people  who boycott North Carolina over its bathroom laws don't care at all. </p><p>None of them are calling for boycotts or sanctions on China. There's no  witch-hunt against the countless universities, businesses, and lobbyists  with massive financial ties to China, and its authoritarian regime.</p><p>In fact, to our ruling class, China is the future. If anything, it's a  country we ought to emulate. So remember that, next time they try to  lecture you about how their values are better than yours.</p><p>The war in Afghanistan, as you well know, has continued for 17 years. It's  the longest war in the history of this country. We're still spending  billions there. American soldiers are still dying there. It might all be  worth it if we were still fighting for victory. But are we fighting for  victory?</p><p>In a newly leaked audiotape, former NATO Commander, Stanley McChrystal,  tells Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, how the war in Afghanistan should be  fought. </p><p>It's not exactly the opening speech from Patton. \"My best suggestion,\" he  says, \"Is to keep a limited number of forces there and just kind of muddle  along, and see what we can do.\"</p><p>Now, muddle along is not a strategy for anything, much less a victory. It's  a strategy to waste American money and lives for no reason at all. If U.S.  troops are going to muddle along in a war, maybe it's a sign that's a war  we shouldn't be fighting in the first place.</p><p>Well, if you can remember back a year-and-a-half, on June 1st, 2017, the  President announced he was pulling this country out of the Paris Climate  Accords. To hear the politicians and television news chintuggers (ph)  react, you'd think it was the worst natural catastrophe, well, ever.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NANCY PELOSI, MINORITY LEADER OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF  REPRESENTATIVES, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA: What happened yesterday on the  climate issue is an embarrassment to our country and it should be an  embarrassment to him personally for how he answers to his grandchildren.</p><p>GOV. JERRY BROWN (D), CALIFORNIA: People are going to die. Habitat will be  destroyed. Seas will rise. Insects will spread.</p><p>FAREED RAFIQ ZAKARIA, CNN'S FAREED ZAKARIA GPS HOST, POLITICAL SCIENTIST,  AUTHOR, COLUMNIST: This will be the day that the United States resigned as  the leader of the free world.</p><p>JOHN KERRY, FORMER UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE: He is not helping the  forgotten American. He is hurting them. Their kids will have worse asthma  in the summer.</p><p>The President who talked about putting America first has now put America  last.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: These people are so stupid. It's amazing they have jobs. The  economy must be pretty strong, in fact, if those people have health  insurance. One thing they said though is true. </p><p>People were hurt, but not because we pulled out, but because other  countries kept to the terms of the Paris Climate Accord, including France. </p><p>This fall, France began to implement a gas tax to fight climate change  inspired by that agreement. Now, for the fourth weekend in a row, the city  of Paris has been rocked by riots and mass protests. The city is burning  and shows no signs of stopping. </p><p>What did this? Progressive climate policy. Will the people who formulated  it ever admit it? Of course, not. They're too invested.</p><p>Well the press, all of a sudden, doing everything it can to kill Elizabeth  Warren's presidential campaign before it even begins. That's kind of  interesting. Is this a mercy killing or something else going on?</p><p>Mark Steyn joins us to unravel a delightful mystery, after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ELIZABETH ANN WARREN, SENIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, MASSACHUSETTS: Now, the  President likes to call my mom a liar. What do the facts say?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The facts suggest that you absolutely have a Native  American ancestor in your pedigree.</p><p>WARREN: OK.</p><p>And Trump can say whatever he wants about me, but mocking Native Americans  or any group in order to try to get at me? That's not what America stands  for.</p><p>I'm not enrolled in a tribe and only tribes determine tribal citizenship. I  understand and respect that distinction. But my family history is my family  history.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: I mean (ph) you really just can't watch that enough. It really  should be a screensaver. This hasn't, understatement of the day, been the  fall Elizabeth Warren had hoped for. </p><p>She thought that releasing a DNA test showing that she might have had a  lone American Indian ancestor, not necessarily from this continent, a few  hundred years ago would silence the President and give her momentum going  into the primaries next year.</p><p>Instead, even the Left is turning on her. Two pieces in the Washington Post  and The New York Times in the past week suggests that Warren's campaign has  been deeply, maybe even fatally, wounded by the blunder of the DNA test. </p><p>Looks almost like an effort to kill Elizabeth Warren's campaign before she  can embarrass her party, the one to which everyone in the media belongs,  before she actually runs.</p><p>Mark Steyn is an Author and Columnist. Not a conspiracy not, I'll run this  by him anyway. So, what is going on? </p><p>So, obviously, she is a media creation, not a genius, but she has been the  subject of endless fawning profiles in the press, particularly from the  Boston Globe, which has promoted her for years, and now they're attacking  her, why?</p><p>MARK STEYN, AUTHOR, COLUMNIST, STEYNONLINE.COM: Yes. That's - that's  interesting. The Boston Globe is saying you - to Elizabeth Warren, you have  to know when not to run. And this is the paper that's wanted her to run  until she took--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --until she got head-faked into taking this DNA test that showed she  was 1/1024th Native American, which is less Native American than the  average. </p><p>I mean you could test Kim Jong-un, Vladimir Putin, and they would - they  would be more than 1/1024th Native American just because some Cherokee  happened to change trains in Odessa in - in 1852, and got lucky with one of  the porters. </p><p>I mean any - every - anyone's more Native American. And what's fascinating- -</p><p>CARLSON: Ha-ha.</p><p>STEYN: --what's fascinating about this is that this - Elizabeth Warren was  a test on the limits of Democrat identity politics because their recent  presidential candidates have been sold on identity politics, but in rather  strange ways. </p><p>So, Barack Obama is an African-American. But he has nothing to do with the  Black slave experience or Civil Rights.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>STEYN: He's - he's Black just because his father happened to be a British  subject born in Colonial Kenya. Barack Obama was actually the first child  of British subjects to be President, I believe, since Andrew Jackson. So,  he tried to get himself in on the colonial thing. </p><p>Obama said his step-grandfather in Indonesia had died fighting Dutch  soldiers in the struggle for independence. In fact, it turned out his step- grandfather died when he fell off a chair while changing the drapes. That's  not a joke. That's actually true. That's how his step-grandfather died.</p><p>Then you have Hillary Clinton, who's running as a feminist icon and is, in  fact, only the candidate because she's the wife of the previous guy, and  she was given a Senate seat as a reward for standing by him, when his  intern's dress wound up in the FBI crime analysis lab - lab.</p><p>So, we have very--</p><p>CARLSON: Ha-ha.</p><p>STEYN: --so in such a world, you can't blame Elizabeth Warren for saying,  \"Well, if Hillary could be a feminist icon, why can't I be the first Native  American President?\" </p><p>She was Harvard Law School's first woman of color. That's why it's not a  family law thing. She actually was promoted as Harvard Law School's first  woman of color. Why shouldn't she be America's first - first Native  American President?</p><p>CARLSON: Such a good (ph)--</p><p>STEYN: Since this is (ph)-- </p><p>CARLSON: --such a good example (ph).</p><p>STEYN: --none - none of this identity politics. Joe Biden should run as the  first transgender woman candidate and dare the Democrat electorate to call  him on it.</p><p>CARLSON: That was my plan.</p><p>STEYN: I mean this is this (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: I hope he doesn't get there first.</p><p>STEYN: --no don't (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: I'm doing that (ph). You're the best.</p><p>STEYN: Yes (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: Mark Steyn, we're out of time.</p><p>STEYN: Thanks a lot, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: I loved it. Thank you.</p><p>STEYN: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Man that was fun. Back tomorrow, 8 P.M., show that is the sworn  enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and, especially, groupthink. Good night  from Washington.

If you've been watching television recently, you've probably heard the bad  news. The Trump Administration is over, toast, cooked, done for good, and  along with it any hope of the middle-class revolution that 63 million  Americans voted for two years ago.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The reason for this tragedy is simple. The President has been caught  committing felonies. Here's what the legal experts without law degrees are  saying on television.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> LAWRENCE O'DONNELL, THE LAST WORD WITH LAWRENCE O'DONNELL HOST, MSNBC: If  precedent means anything in the Trump era, Donald Trump will be, must be,  impeached because of the crimes prosecutors say he committed in the Michael  Cohen case.</p><p> ROBERT E. MOOK, FORMER POLITICAL CAMPAIGN STRATEGIST AND CAMPAIGN  MANAGER,  CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Both parties need to get on board to pass  articles of impeachment.</p><p> EDDIE GLAUDE, CHAIR, CENTER FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN STUDIES: You have  conspiracy, you have - you have obstruction, you have campaigns finance and  you have emoluments. </p><p> If the Democrats do not pursue this vigorously, they will be, in some ways,  held accountable for abdicating their responsibility.</p><p> It goes to the moral question, the ethical question. Democracy is at stake.</p><p> MAXINE MOORE WATERS, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR CALIFORNIA'S 43RD  CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, DEMOCRATIC PARTY MEMBER: This criminal must be  brought up by the Congress of the United States for impeachment.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CARLSON: We're not even (ph) going to show you the Don Lemon tape. There's  a lot of emotion there. But to sum up, they're telling us that we're  staring down the barrel of a constitutional crisis. And that crisis stems  from what MSNBC describes as, quote, the crimes prosecutors say the  President committed in the Michael Cohen case.</p><p> Which crimes were those? We have the answer. The relevant details were  spelled out in a piece that ran over the weekend in The New York Times  under this headline. \"Prosecutors say Trump directed illegal payments  during campaign.\"</p><p> The gist of the story is this. Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, has  told federal prosecutors that he facilitated payments to two women who said  they had affairs with Donald Trump. And then, well actually that's it.  That's the entire story right there.</p><p> Paying these two women, say federal prosecutors and their flacks at NBC  News, was a serious crime, a crime worthy of impeachment, if not,  indictment. OK. But you might be wondering, how exactly is that criminal?  Well, we're going to explain it to you.</p><p> We're going to start by stipulating that everything Michael Cohen has told  the feds is absolutely true. Now, assuming honesty isn't usually a wise  idea with Michael Cohen, but for the sake of argument, let's do it in this  case, everything he says is true, why is what Cohen is alleging a criminal  offense?</p><p> Remember the facts of the story. These are undisputed. Two women approached  Donald Trump and threatened to ruin his career and humiliate his family if  he doesn't give them money. Now, that sounds like a classic case of  extortion.</p><p> Yet, for whatever reason, Trump caves to it, and he directs Michael Cohen  to pay the ransom. Now, more than two years later, Trump is a felon for  doing this. It doesn't seem to make any sense.</p><p> Oh, but you're not a federal prosecutor on a political mission. If you were  a federal prosecutor on a political mission, you would construe those  extortion payments as campaign contributions. You'd do this even though the  money in question did not come from or go to Donald Trump's presidential  campaign.</p><p> Then you'd claim that Trump and Michael Cohen violated campaign finance law  because they didn't publicly disclose those payments despite the fact that  disclosing them would nullify the reason for making them in the first  place, which was to keep the whole thing secret.</p><p> That is the argument you would make, both in federal court and through your  proxies on cable television. It is insultingly stupid. But because everyone  in power hates the target of your investigation, nobody would question you,  and that's what's happening right now.</p><p> Now, by this reasoning, any money a political candidate spends to maintain  or protect his image while running for office now qualifies as a regulated  campaign donation, and has to be disclosed. That would include, by the way,  in addition to an infinite number of other things, buying toothpaste and  getting a haircut.</p><p> It would definitely include the taxpayer-financed slush fund that Congress  has set aside to pay off its own sexual harassment claims. Yes, those now  qualify as campaign contributions. They must be publicly disclosed, except,  of course, they're not publicly disclosed, and they never will be. Why is  that?</p><p> Well that might be a question for Congressional leaders including, now that  we think about it, Congressman Adam Schiff of Burbank, California. He's the  incoming Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, a very powerful man  in the Congress. </p><p> What does Mr. Schiff have to say about Congress not disclosing the very  same payments that Democrats say Trump should be impeached for not  disclosing? Let's ask him.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ADAM BENNETT SCHIFF, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR CALIFORNIA'S 28TH  CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, DEMOCRATIC PARTY MEMBER: There's a very real  prospect that on the day Donald Trump leaves office the Justice Department  may indict him that he may be the first president in quite some time to  face the real prospect of jail time.</p><p>NEAL KUMAR KATYAL, LAWYER, FORMER ACTING SOLICITOR GENERAL OF THE UNITED  STATES, LAW PROFESSOR AT GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY: Trump knows that he's  facing some pretty strong criminal liability when he leaves office, one way  or another. And, you know, even if a (ph) sitting president can't be  indicted, he's got to know his future looks like it's behind bars unless he  cuts some sort of deal with the prosecutors.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: So to translate, Trump's a criminal. He's going to jail for  committing a smaller version of the same made-up crime that we in Congress  have committed for years and forced you to pay for. </p><p> And, by the way, we're never apologizing for that because we don't have to  and CNN isn't going to make us. Screw you, America, and your stupid  election. We are in charge. That's the real message here, in case you  missed it.</p><p> Chris Hahn is a radio host and former aide to Senator Chuck Schumer, and he  joins us tonight. </p><p> So, Chris, I think you don't like Trump but that's fine. But speak slowly  so I can understand. Explain to me why paying off someone who is extorting  you, threatening to make public details of your personal life, if she  doesn't get paid, why paying that person is a felony?</p><p> CHRISTOPHER HAHN, AMERICAN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, DEMOCRATIC PARTY  ACTIVIST, RADIO SHOW HOST, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, first of all, we  don't know that there was actual extortion here. We know that a payment was  made. There was a catch and kill deal with the National Enquirer. Whether  or not it was extortion, that hasn't been proven yet, nor has it even  really been alleged in many cases--</p><p> CARLSON: Well, I'm--</p><p> HAHN: --by the President. He's not saying--</p><p> CARLSON: --I'm alleging, I'm - hold on, let me--</p><p> HAHN: --he's not say--</p><p> CARLSON: --let me just stop and say, I'm alleging it because it's obvious.  You're not going to pay a $100,000 or a $150,000 or $200,000 to someone  unless there's a threat to you and your reputation. This is extortion. </p><p> And I don't - I don't know why it's not being prosecuted. I don't know - I  don't know why Trump isn't defending himself on those grounds, I would. But  it clearly is extortion.</p><p> HAHN: Well--</p><p> CARLSON: But why is it a crime to pay off--</p><p> HAHN: --well sometimes people want--</p><p> CARLSON: --someone-- </p><p> HAHN: --sometimes people--</p><p> CARLSON: --who you had an affair with?</p><p> HAHN: --sometimes people want to tell us - they want to tell a story that  he doesn't want told. He said--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> HAHN: --hey, just tell it to me. I'll pay for it and--</p><p> CARLSON: That's extortion. It's--</p><p> HAHN: --and pay for yourselves (ph). That's what he did--</p><p> CARLSON: --that's - that's what - if I did that to you-- </p><p> HAHN: --in this situation.</p><p> CARLSON: --you would call it - if I said, \"Look, I know a detail about your  sex life, Chris Hahn, and I'm going to tell it on my show on TV unless you  pay me,\" that would be extortion, obviously. So, this is extortion. But  leaving that aside, why is it a felony to pay women you've had sexual  relationships with?</p><p> HAHN: It's not a felony. It's a felony to--</p><p> CARLSON: Oh.</p><p> HAHN: --do a campaign expenditure and not - and not disclose it, and that's  what this has been.</p><p> CARLSON: How is that a campaign expenditure?</p><p> HAHN: This seems to have been a campaign - he - he made this during the  campaign for the purposes of the campaign. There are tape recordings of him  discussing this with Michael Cohen. And that's just one--</p><p> CARLSON: Well, for the purposes of the campaign, I'm - wait--</p><p> HAHN: --look, this isn't even the - this is just a--</p><p> CARLSON: --no, but, wait, hold on, wait, hold on, I'm confused. No, it's  not a small thing. It's the thing. This is the crime that The New York Time  told us on Saturday, federal prosecutors are alleging the President  committed, it's a felony, and Michael Cohen pled guilty--</p><p> HAHN: Well they also--</p><p> CARLSON: --to a species of this. So, I just want to get to the bottom of  it. Why is that a campaign--</p><p> HAHN: Well, they're also alleging--</p><p> CARLSON: --contribution to pay off a former girlfriend? I'm honestly  confused. You're a campaign guy, tell me.</p><p> HAHN: They're - look, there's also an allegation that he may have violated  the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act when he was doing his deal in Moscow.</p><p> CARLSON: Well there are (ph) allegations that he killed Kennedy.</p><p> HAHN: There are a lot more to this than just paying off--</p><p> CARLSON: But I want - but hold on, no, no, no, no - </p><p> HAHN: --there's - there's a lot--</p><p> CARLSON: --OK--</p><p> HAHN: --there's a lot more to this than just paying off--</p><p> CARLSON: --OK, well how about one allegation--</p><p> HAHN: --porn stars who he slept with--</p><p> CARLSON: --slow down (ph), one allegation--</p><p> HAHN: --you know, a couple years ago.</p><p> CARLSON: --one allegation at a time. So, federal prosecutors--</p><p> HAHN: OK.</p><p> CARLSON: --this is not just something that dumb people on TV are talking  about, though they are. This is something that--</p><p> HAHN: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: --prosecutors in New York State are saying they have, apparently,  evidence to indict over. So, tell me why because lot of people in - in  Washington pay off their girlfriends, including lots of people in Congress,  a lot of people in Congress, including I, even, guess some Democrats, just  throwing that out there. So, tell me why that's a campaign--</p><p> HAHN: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: --contribution to pay off your girlfriend?</p><p> HAHN: Well, first of all, I think that fund that Congress was using to pay  people off who were harassed needs to be disclosed and the Members who were  involved with those disclosure decisions need to be removed--</p><p> CARLSON: Oh, I'm sure that'll happen right away. That'll happen right away.</p><p> HAHN: --from Congress right now. OK. I--</p><p> CARLSON: I'm sure MSNBC will push--</p><p> HAHN: I agree with you - I agree with you on that.</p><p> CARLSON: --real hard for that. Right, OK so but--</p><p> HAHN: I - I agree with you on--</p><p> CARLSON: --but tell me why it's a campaign--</p><p> HAHN: --I agree with you on that point.</p><p> CARLSON: --this is central question. Why is it and for all of us--</p><p> HAHN: Well, look, well--</p><p> CARLSON: --why is that a campaign contribution?</p><p> HAHN: --well here's the thing.</p><p> CARLSON: The money didn't come from the campaign. It didn't go to the  campaign. It was a threat to his reputation and his livelihood, as all  extortion is, right? So, why is that a campaign--</p><p> HAHN: There's black--</p><p> CARLSON: --contribution?</p><p> HAHN: --there's black letter law. There's black letter law here, OK?</p><p> CARLSON: OK. Well what is it?</p><p> HAHN: The campaign finance law is pretty clear about what you can and  cannot do with funds. And these funds were not necessarily from Trump's own  pockets. There was all sorts of schemes put together by the President and  Michael Cohen to move this money around, so it wasn't traced back to - to -  to President Trump.</p><p> CARLSON: But - but hold on, no--</p><p> HAHN: That in and of itself should--</p><p> CARLSON: --no, no, no, no, no--</p><p> HAHN: --raise red flags. You would be--</p><p> CARLSON: --no, no, you know, wait, stop, stop, stop, stop, no, no, no, no--</p><p> HAHN: --people would be blowing their mind off right now--</p><p> CARLSON: --wait, wait, stop, stop, stop, stop--</p><p> HAHN: --if you're (ph) the President.</p><p> CARLSON: --maybe. I mean we've never had a president like Trump in a  million different ways. And I'm not defending--</p><p> HAHN: No, we never have.</p><p> CARLSON: --I'm not defending his personal life. I'm merely saying--</p><p> HAHN: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: --this is now being described as a felony, as a crime for which  the President could be removed. So, now is the time when we need to be very  specific about what the crime is because you're - you've stopped all  business of government, so we can respond to this. So, let's respond right  now. Tell me how and where--</p><p> HAHN: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: --in campaign finance law it says, you're not allowed to use your  money, there's no allegation this was campaign money, your money to pay off  a former girlfriend? There isn't and that's this made-up (ph)--</p><p> HAHN: Oh, this is not--</p><p> CARLSON: --it's a lie--</p><p> HAHN: --the allegation here is not--</p><p> CARLSON: --actually.</p><p> HAHN: --the allegation here is not that it's just his money. There's  allegation that he moved money around through various schemes--</p><p> CARLSON: No, but not - they're not from the campaign--</p><p> HAHN: --to pay these women off--</p><p> CARLSON: --no, but, by the way--</p><p> HAHN: --including with the (ph) man who--</p><p> CARLSON: --you're allowed to do that too.</p><p> HAHN: --hold on a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait--</p><p> CARLSON: You're allowed to hide the payments.</p><p> HAHN: --he hid the payments--</p><p> CARLSON: What, is that a crime now--</p><p> HAHN: --that was campaign in nature--</p><p> CARLSON: --if it's your money?</p><p> HAHN: --that is a violation of--</p><p> CARLSON: Why does a campaign and (ph)--</p><p> HAHN: --a clear violation of campaign finance laws.</p><p> CARLSON: --hold on till then (ph), I'm giving you a chance on TV--</p><p> HAHN: It needed to be disclosed--</p><p> CARLSON: --hold on, hold on. No, no, just I'll let you speak and I'll let  you speak slowly--</p><p> HAHN: Go ahead.</p><p> CARLSON: --so our audience can understand. Where in campaign finance law  does it say that taking money that's not from your political campaign to  respond to an extortion attempt to pay off your girlfriend or pay the  gardener, pay anybody, why is that a felony? And where does it say that?</p><p> HAHN: Camp--</p><p> CARLSON: What are you talking about?</p><p> HAHN: --campaign finance law - look, I'm not going to quote the section and  verse. I don't know it off the top of my head--</p><p> CARLSON: Paraphrase it for me.</p><p> HAHN: --even though I'm a lawyer. Campaign finance - campaign finance law  clearly states that any money spent for campaign purposes, specifically by  people other than the candidate, must be disclosed. This is what's--</p><p> CARLSON: But why is that a campaign--</p><p> HAHN: --being alleged right here--</p><p> CARLSON: --purpose?</p><p> HAHN: --hold on, hold on, hold on--</p><p> CARLSON: What (ph)?</p><p> HAHN: --the President and Michael Cohen clearly set up a scheme so that  other people could pay these women off on behalf of Donald Trump while he  was running--</p><p> CARLSON: OK. OK. That--</p><p> HAHN: --for President because--</p><p> CARLSON: --that's fine but--</p><p> HAHN: --they thought that these (ph) allegations would sink his campaign  and his reputation.</p><p> CARLSON: But - but maybe - maybe under--</p><p> HAHN: That's a violation.</p><p> CARLSON: --no, actually, because anybody faced, I'm not, you know, I don't  know a single man who faced with that allegation, who he (ph) thought he  could squelch it wouldn't pay the person off because it does incalculable  damage to your reputation, whether you're running for anything or not. </p><p> And so, that's - it's so clearly not a campaign violation that I wonder if  we want to set this precedent. Do you want to live in a world where people  paying off extortion attempts are now campaign finance felons? I mean this  is lunatic.</p><p> HAHN: This is strike--</p><p> CARLSON: And you know it.</p><p> HAHN: --this - this is strikingly similar to what happened to John Edwards.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes, and it's awful. It's awful what happened to--</p><p> HAHN: I'm not saying the President will be convicted but--</p><p> CARLSON: --John Edwards--</p><p> HAHN: --this is strikingly--</p><p> CARLSON: --I thought.</p><p> HAHN: --similar--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes, it is. It is.</p><p> HAHN: --situation.</p><p> CARLSON: And what happened to him was--</p><p> HAHN: And it is something, look--</p><p> CARLSON: --wrong. It was another populace--</p><p> HAHN: --well--</p><p> CARLSON: --they took out with this BS campaign finance nonsense, exactly  what happened.</p><p> HAHN: --look, it is more than--</p><p> CARLSON: And, you know (ph), we're out of time.</p><p> HAHN: --campaign finance law.</p><p> CARLSON: --no.</p><p> HAHN: It's more than campaign finance law.</p><p> CARLSON: No, it's not.</p><p> HAHN: It is the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.</p><p> CARLSON: No, it's a totally separate thing.</p><p> HAHN: That in and of itself is a problem-- </p><p> CARLSON: Look, if - if he violated that I will (ph) defend it.</p><p> HAHN: Well, yes. And then (ph) also alleged by Cohen is--</p><p> CARLSON: But in this case, this is made-up.</p><p> HAHN: --also part of this.</p><p> CARLSON: All right, Chris Hahn, thank you.</p><p> HAHN: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: Good to see you.</p><p> One of the most hysterical reactions in the past few days came from a  former Obama Administration U.S. Attorney, who says the President should be  stripped of his office.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARBARA MCQUADE, FORMER UNITED STATES ATTORNEY FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT  OF  MICHIGAN, PROFESSOR OF LAW AT UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN LAW SCHOOL, LEGAL  ANALYST FOR NBC NEWS AND MSNBC: It could be that President Trump procured  the presidency by fraud. </p><p> When immigrants procure their citizenship by fraud, we strip them of their  citizenship. When a president procures his presidency by fraud, should we  consider doing the same?</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Alan Dershowitz is, of course, a retired Harvard Law School  professor. He's the Author of the book, The Case Against Impeaching Trump,  and he joins us tonight.</p><p> Professor, I got a couple questions. But the first relates just to the  sound bite we played. Is there a provision in the Constitution for  stripping, whatever that means, stripping the presidency from a President  who you think is illegitimate, whatever that means?</p><p>ALAN MORTON DERSHOWITZ, LAWYER, THE CASE AGAINST IMPEACHING TRUMP  AUTHOR,  HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR EMERITUS: Sure. It's called the 25th Amendment, but  not on the grounds of illegitimacy. I want everyone out there to imagine  the following scenario. </p><p> Let's assume when Bill Clinton was running for president, Paula Jones came  up to him and said, \"Unless you pay me a $130,000, I'll reveal our affair.\" </p><p> And let's assume, Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, together, did exactly  what it's alleged that Donald Trump and Cohen did together, I guarantee you  The New York Times, NBC, MSNBC would be railing against any prosecutor who  dared to suggest that this was a violation of the campaign (ph) finance  law. Everybody would be on the other side of this issue. </p><p> There'd be Republicans out there saying, \"Strip him of the presidency,  impeach him, indict him.\" Every Democrat would be saying this is a witch- hunt, this is terrible. We need a single standard. If you wouldn't go after  Bill Clinton, don't go after Donald Trump. </p><p> If you're going after Donald Trump, then you have to go after Hillary  Clinton for everything that she allegedly did. For example, one of your  guests talked about a Federal Corrupt Practices Act. That applies when you  bribe a foreign official.</p><p> What they're arguing is that there was a rumor that maybe somebody offered  Putin a penthouse in a Tower that Trump was thinking of building in Moscow.  And if that had been done, it would be a violation of the FCPA, Federal  Corrupt Practices Act. </p><p> But it's all based on hypotheticals and maybes. And I just want everybody  to apply the shoe on the other foot test. If Hillary Clinton were  president, the Republicans were saying, \"Lock her up,\" everybody would be  on the other side. They'd be screaming about how dare you expand criminal  statutes, how dare you expand the criteria for impeachment? </p><p> Now, all these liberal Democrat fair-weather civil libertarians are saying,  \"The hell with the Constitution, the hell with civil liberties, put all  that aside, get Trump.\" That's the most important consideration. Get him by  any means possible. This is such a danger to our constitutional system that  I would hope that true civil libertarians would rebel against that, as I  am.</p><p> CARLSON: Is - is it unfair to describe this scenario as extortion? I say I  know something about your sex life. I know a secret about you that you want  to keep the - that's non-criminal (ph), but that you want to keep hidden.  And unless you pay me money, I'm going to reveal it. That seems like  textbook extortion to me. Why is it not?</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: It is absolutely textbook extortion. And there ought to be a  prosecution of any person, man or woman, who approaches any candidate or  anybody else and says, \"Unless you pay me money, I'm going to reveal a sex  act that occurred.\" That is absolute classic extortion. </p><p> And it's shocking that the Special Counsel looking into this, who has a  broad mandate, he described it very broadly, isn't looking into the  extortion committed by, at least, the porn star, whose lawyer obviously  approached the candidate or the candidate's people, and threatened  exposure.</p><p> Otherwise, why would you pay? Just listen to the tape. The tape makes that  clear. The tape that Cohen made unwittingly of President Trump, it's clear  that they were paying off an extortion--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: --in order to prevent these issues from coming out for multiple  reasons, to protect his family, to protect his brand--</p><p> CARLSON: Sure.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: --possibly, to influence the campaign. </p><p> Let's remember one more thing. A President can contribute to a candidate as  much as he wants. If - if Bloomberg runs for president, he could announce  tomorrow, \"I'm not taking a nickel. I'm putting $1 billion of my own money  into this campaign.\" </p><p> That's perfectly legitimate. As far as reporting is concerned, it's the  campaign that has to report. And if these payments had to be reported, they  had to be reported after the election, the reporting time was after the  election so, it couldn't have impacted the election.</p><p> So, the absurd notion that he won the presidency by fraud and should be  stripped of the presidency (ph) reflects incredible ignorance about the  timing here, and how these statutes operate.</p><p> CARLSON: This is getting so crazy, it's - it's making my head spin. I  appreciate your coming on and explaining that to us, professor. Thank you  very much.</p><p> DERSHOWITZ: Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: Well we've been saying it for a couple of years. Now, we have hard  scientific evidence that, in fact, big tech is altering and harming the  brains of children. Is it time to do something about that? What if we knew  it was true? Well we do know it's true now. We've got details next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> TEXT: TECH TYRANNY.</p><p> CARLSON: Well Google collects more data than probably any other company,  and probably knows more about you than you do. You think this might raise  some concerns about the concentration of power. </p><p> But, for years, Congress seems to have cared not at all either because they  were ideologically predisposed to Google or because they were in its  pocket. Meanwhile, Google became more and more powerful, ominously  powerful. </p><p> Now, finally, during the lame-duck session, Congress has summoned the CEO  of Google, Sundar Pichai, to answer some questions about data transparency,  coming to Capitol Hill this week. What should Congress ask him about?</p><p> Harmeet Dhillon has followed this issue maybe more closely than any other  attorney in the United States, and she joins us tonight. Harmeet, thank you  very much for coming on. So what--</p><p> HARMEET DHILLON, AMERICAN LAWYER, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL LAWYERS  ASSOCIATION  BOARD MEMBER, FORMER VICE CHAIRWOMAN OF THE CALIFORNIA REPUBLICAN PARTY,  AND THE NATIONAL COMMITTEEWOMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE  FOR  CALIFORNIA: Hi, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: --what should be the - the list of questions?</p><p> DHILLON: Well, this is only a subset of the issues that people should be  asking Google that is the subject of the testimony tomorrow. But Google,  for years, as you pointed out, has been collecting data, and not disclosing  to users, number one, the extent of the collection of the data or what  they're doing with the data.</p><p> We have also learned of significant breaches, including today, an  announcement of a major breach of 52.5 million users on the Google+ failed  experiment in social media. It's not clear when that happened. </p><p>Google is not disclosing to people exactly what happened and what use has  been made of it. And they, as you pointed out, they just get away with it,  because we have both effete politicians in Washington, even on the  Republican side, and government agencies whose tasks it is to examine these  issues, and protect consumers. So, consumers are really at a complete loss. </p><p> Now, what I expect to happen on Capitol Hill tomorrow is that there'll be  some posturing questions written by staffers that Members of Congress are  going to read out, and you're going to have some focus group tested  jargony, you know, in - incomprehensible responses from Sundar Pichai  designed to placate these folks.</p><p> There'll be a little bit of a dance and everybody will go home, not  understanding what the answers were, and not probably going to do anything  about it. And this is a real tragedy and missed opportunity, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: What a shame? I want to (ph) ask you another story, another  element of the Google story. </p><p> Newly leaked email show that several Google employees plotted to destroy  the news site, Breitbart, after the 2016 election, a secret internal  discussion group labeled Resist. Google employees discussed how they could  use the, quote, hate speech and fake news labels to justify cutting off  Breitbart's ad revenues.</p><p> Harmeet, this is kind of the stuff of Conservative fever dreams that Google  would be actually doing something like this. Are you surprised by it? And  what can be done, in response?</p><p> DHILLON: Well Google - A, I'm not surprised. B, Google is denying it. But  there's extensive evidence that Google did this, and they did it in two  ways. </p><p> One way is right after the election, as you mentioned, a number of very  excitable Left-wing Google executives and employees tried to squeeze  Breitbart and other Conservative outlets into this hate speech category.</p><p> They then confessed that after a lot of effort that was really tough. So,  they also did a two-pronged approach, and the other side of that approach  is having their ad people contact customers and tell them that it might be  dangerous or a bad idea to advertise or allow their ads to be placed on  Conservative news websites like Breitbart and others.</p><p> And they pointed to some outside groups like Sleeping Giant that makes it a  - a business practice of defaming Conservative writers and organizations,  and use that as a smear. </p><p>Google also does this in many other ways like through its YouTube. It  categorizes content as sensitive, which automatically, both, makes it hard  to find the content online, and also strips that content from the ability  to gain advertising revenue.</p><p> So, Google is doing this systematically. Google is doing this purposefully.  Google is getting away with doing this. And I think it violates not just  some laws, including Communications Decency Act and others, but it - it  violates state laws that have to do with fraud and transparency, unfair  business practices and competition.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> DHILLON: Again, Google is able to get away with this because, you know,  they - they contribute to some Conservative groups like CPAC, lot of money  to show up at CPAC, and - and certainly on Capitol Hill. </p><p> They get away with it, and we see nothing done to control this - this, you  know, duopoly and monopoly on advertising revenue. It's very dangerous  because it's shaping what young people in America, who mainly get their  news through--</p><p> CARLSON: Of course.</p><p> DHILLON: --Google see every day.</p><p> CARLSON: Looking back, the Congress allowing Google to become more powerful  than the U.S. government, subverting our democracy entirely, that'll be the  thing we hold Members responsible for, I think, historically. </p><p> Harmeet Dhillon, you will not be held responsible since you're a lonely  voice on the right side, thank you for joining us, as always.</p><p> DHILLON: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: Meanwhile, we've been saying it for years. Now, there is hard  scientific evidence that big tech is, in fact, harming our children. </p><p> New 60 Minutes report this week highlighted research that shows children  who use tablet smartphones and other screens more than seven hours a day,  and that's a lot of kids, believe it or not, are developing different brain  structures. Their brains are being damaged by this. </p><p> Tom Kersting is a psychotherapist, who's written extensively on this  subject, and he joins us tonight. You must feel vindicated by this report,  Tom.</p><p> TOM KERSTING, PSYCHOTHERAPIST, DISCONNECTED AUTHOR: I do. I do. I'm  actually happy to see it, to be honest with you because--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> KERSTING: --it's something I've been speaking about for so many years at  lectures and in my book. And now, we could finally have some scientific  preliminary evidence showing exactly what all of this tech is doing to the  brain.</p><p> CARLSON: So, what is it doing?</p><p> KERSTING: Well, first of all, the area of the brain called the cortex,  which is the outer layer of the brain, the preliminary study that the - the  research has conducted, shows a - a premature thinning of that part of the  brain, OK, which is - which is kind of frightening, considering the  importance of that part of the brain, what it does, how it's very important  just for human beings in terms of organizing, planning, and a host of other  different things.</p><p> Another component that you don't hear much about is something called  neuroplasticity, which is actually the greatest breakthrough in modern day  psychology. And the term plasticity meaning that the brain, although very  strong and rigid, can be molded and shaped if placed in - in the right  environment for three or more hours per day. </p><p> We know that the average kid is spending nine hours a day, on average, in  what I consider to be the most highly stimulating of worlds. And what  happens is the brain will actually grow new neural pathways, it'll re- organize its circuitry to adapt to that cyber world.</p><p> And the problem is what I'm seeing clinically is an unadapting of - of  young kids in a real world having a very difficult time coping with just  the trivial nuances of life, the anxiety disorders, the depressions, and so  forth.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes. Well and it's all kinds of measurements are showing the  horrifying results of it. How young, exactly, are kids getting addicted?</p><p> KERSTING: Well, we're seeing right now that there's some - some research  that came out recently that there - there's the kids as - as young as two  years old showing signs of depression. And, right now, the average age for  first smartphone issuance is about age 10.</p><p> And, you know, when I give lectures, every parent knows that this is bad.  But it's sort of, you know, what you talk about it you love (ph) the - the  term groupthink. I - I use the term social conformity. </p><p> We tend to do what everybody else is doing. And parents, anybody listening,  you have got to do what is in the best interest of your child, not - not  what everybody else around you is doing.</p><p> CARLSON: So, can you just give me the 20-second answer to the question I  always ask you, which is why are we so passive in the face of this? If two- year-olds were huffing on Marlboros, we'd say, \"You know what? No, not  allowed.\" But we just sort of sit back and let our society collapse in the  face of this, why?</p><p> KERSTING: Well, the reason, in my opinion, the reason why is - and we talk  about - I always talk about common sense, all right? </p><p> It's pretty clear, if we go walk around and everybody's got their heads  buried in a device all day long, you pull up to a traffic light, and they  can't even contain themselves for a minute without looking at their device,  it's pretty clear that it's having an impact on their behavior.</p><p> Now, the reason why nobody is--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> KERSTING: --doing anything about it is because we're always looking for  scientific evidence, all right, and now we have some of it, and we're going  to start seeing a lot more of it. And--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> KERSTING: --and we're going to start seeing some changes, as a result,  Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes, and it's we waited too long for the studies to confirm the  obvious. Tom, thank you very much.</p><p> KERSTING: Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: Well, Hollywood doesn't need to remake 1984 again, not that they  would, it's probably illegal. But they already do a perfect job of  replicating it in real life. They are living the plotline of George  Orwell's novel. Kevin Hart is the latest person to be destroyed for  statements that he made many years ago. We'll tell you his story after the  break.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> TEXT: AMERICA'S NEWS HQ.</p><p> TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Live from America's News  headquarters, I'm Trace Gallagher.</p><p> No bail decision yet for a top Chinese executive who's facing possible  extradition from Canada to the U.S. The case of Meng Wanzhou has fueled  U.S.-China trade tensions and rocked financial markets.</p><p> Meng is the Chief Financial Officer of telecommunications giant, Huawei.

She's accused  of misleading banks about the company's business dealings in Iran. </p><p> There is a concerning uptick in paralyzing illness among children. The  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now says there have been more  cases than ever. There are a 158 confirmed cases so far this year. </p><p> The illness called acute flaccid myelitis causes paralysis in the face,  neck, back, arms or legs. The symptoms usually come a week following a  fever and respiratory illness. </p><p> I'm Trace Gallagher, now back to Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: Hollywood has issued a new decree. And, of course, everyone obeyed  immediately. Kevin Hart's career must be destroyed. </p><p> Just days after the Comedian was announced as the next Host of the Oscars,  the now-irrelevant awards show some people still watch, Hart was forced to  step down over tweets and stand-up routines from about a decade ago that  some said were anti-gay.</p><p> Now, these tweets had already come to light. Hart had already apologized  for them and said he was changing his routine, but it didn't matter. In  today's political environment, there is no such thing as forgiveness or  mercy. What you're seeing is, instead, a particularly powerful form of  bullying. Do and think exactly as we say, or else.</p><p> Larry Elder has fought the forces of conformity for a long time. He's a  radio show host from Los Angeles, and he joins us tonight. We're really  glad to have you, Larry Elder, thank you. So, what's the takeaway from  watching what just happened to Kevin Hart?</p><p> LARRY ELDER, RADIO SHOW HOST, WRITER, ATTORNEY: The takeaway, Tucker, is  what the devil are the rules. As you pointed out--</p><p> CARLSON: Right. I got it (ph).</p><p> ELDER: --Kevin Hart did these tweets some years ago and - and made anti-gay  references in his stand-up some years ago. He apologized back in 2015. The  Academy Award people wanted him to apologize again. He refused.</p><p> Now, the show is going to be carried by ABC. ABC parent company is Disney.  Disney also owns ESPN. They've employed Keith Olbermann, who is a - a Trump  hater from way back. And just last year, he tweeted that Trump was a Nazi  and dropped a bunch of F-bombs in his tweet. That didn't seem to bother  Disney. But Kevin Hart has to go.</p><p> The other inconsistency, of course, is that other comedians like Amy  Schumer, who last year, I think it was, hosted a Democratic fundraiser, has  used the - the F-word for gays in a tweet, as has Sarah Silverman, as has  Chelsea Handler, all of whom have hosted shows.</p><p> And finally, you have the instance of Joy Ann Reid on MSNBC who had a blog  2007, 2008--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> ELDER: --a very anti-gay post she made, and she wasn't joking, she wasn't a  comedian, including dissing the movie Brokeback Mountain, and said she  hated watching men kiss. She then said she apologized. </p><p> Then, later on, she said she was hacked. NBC did a search to find out  whether or not she'd been hacked. Turned out she wasn't hacked. So, she  either misremembered or lied, and then apologized again. She has a show on  MSNBC. So, forgive Kevin Hart for not - for not knowing what the rules are.</p><p> CARLSON: Well that's and - so, but what's the best response? I think you're  absolutely right. All of us at some point are going to be accused of  thoughtcrime, and the mob will come for us. It's inevitable.</p><p> ELDER: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: How do we respond? What's the best way to respond?</p><p> ELDER: You do them on a case-by-case basis. The man apologized, said he had  grown. The - the most horrific tweet was saying that if he came home and  saw his son playing with his daughter's dollhouse, he'd break the dollhouse  over his head. He later on said, he apologized, he's grown as a man--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> ELDER: --and perhaps the tweet had to do with his own insecurities as a  man. So, I think that's what you do. You apologize, be sincere, and then  keep going. </p><p> But if people keep beating you over the - over the head over it over and  over again, they're not going to forgive you, I'm not sure what the point  is, which is why I believe that Kevin Hart was morally justified in saying,  I've already apologized, I'm not going to apologize again.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> ELDER: I'm a 40-year old man. I've apologized. I've grown, let it alone.</p><p> CARLSON: I mean what happens to a society where the mob feels it has  ultimate authority on judgment? No one believes in God, so they have to  make their own judgments, hard and fast judgments--</p><p> ELDER: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: --and no forgiveness is allowed.</p><p> ELDER: Yes. And what happens to a society that's - that's so inconsistent?  For example, Kanye West--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> ELDER: --is being called an Uncle Tom and a Token, a House Negro. That  doesn't seem to bother anybody. </p><p> You got a guy in like Al Sharpton, who's got a show where he's referred to  gays as - as homos in the - in years past, Jews as interlopers. He - he  falsely accused a White man of raping a Black teenager, he has a show on  television, you know, every weekend.</p><p> So, you know, I'm not quite sure what to say, Tucker, other than it's  terribly inconsistent. It seem to me there's one rule for people who are  Conservative and one rule for people--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> ELDER: --who are on the Left.</p><p> CARLSON: I think it's best just to ignore the noise to the extent you can.  I mean they have an awful lot of power. You know, they'll de-platform you  in a second. Larry Elder--</p><p> ELDER: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: --we're rooting for you.</p><p> ELDER: Thank you. I need--</p><p> CARLSON: If they ever try to leave you, you'd (ph)--</p><p> ELDER: --I could use the help.</p><p> CARLSON: --always have a home on this show. Good to see you.</p><p> ELDER: I could use the help. Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: Thank you.</p><p> Well China just launched a new persecution of the country's Christians.  Will anyone in Washington care? Are they too busy taking Chinese money?</p><p> Plus, Paris continues to be convulsed by the worst riots there in 50 years.  What are these riots about? You know what they're about. They're about the  Paris Climate Treaty, the spirit of it, anyway. And policies they want here  are being rejected by both Left and Right in France, and they're ignoring  it because it's too inconvenient to pay attention. Details ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> TEXT: THE CHINA THREAT.</p><p> CARLSON: China has launched a new crackdown. How many news stories begin  with that sentence, \"China has launched a new crackdown?\" Many. And they  have, once again, launched new crackdown, this time, on their country's  underground Christian community.</p><p> In a coordinated sweep of nighttime raids, police rounded up about a 100  members and the pastor of the Early Rain Covenant Church. Because the  church does not submit to government control, it is illegal in China. And  members have been forbidden from attending services.</p><p> It's just the latest in a persecution wave that has shut down several  different churches with thousands of Christian members. This is what actual  religious oppression looks like, but a ruling class that's seen (ph) people  who boycott North Carolina over its bathroom laws don't care at all. </p><p> None of them are calling for boycotts or sanctions on China. There's no  witch-hunt against the countless universities, businesses, and lobbyists  with massive financial ties to China, and its authoritarian regime.</p><p> In fact, to our ruling class, China is the future. If anything, it's a  country we ought to emulate. So remember that, next time they try to  lecture you about how their values are better than yours.</p><p> The war in Afghanistan, as you well know, has continued for 17 years. It's  the longest war in the history of this country. We're still spending  billions there. American soldiers are still dying there. It might all be  worth it if we were still fighting for victory. But are we fighting for  victory?</p><p> In a newly leaked audiotape, former NATO Commander, Stanley McChrystal,  tells Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, how the war in Afghanistan should be  fought. </p><p> It's not exactly the opening speech from Patton. \"My best suggestion,\" he  says, \"Is to keep a limited number of forces there and just kind of muddle  along, and see what we can do.\"</p><p> Now, muddle along is not a strategy for anything, much less a victory. It's  a strategy to waste American money and lives for no reason at all. If U.S.  troops are going to muddle along in a war, maybe it's a sign that's a war  we shouldn't be fighting in the first place.</p><p> Well, if you can remember back a year-and-a-half, on June 1st, 2017, the  President announced he was pulling this country out of the Paris Climate  Accords. To hear the politicians and television news chintuggers (ph)  react, you'd think it was the worst natural catastrophe, well, ever.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> NANCY PELOSI, MINORITY LEADER OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF  REPRESENTATIVES, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA: What happened yesterday on the  climate issue is an embarrassment to our country and it should be an  embarrassment to him personally for how he answers to his grandchildren.</p><p> GOV. JERRY BROWN (D), CALIFORNIA: People are going to die. Habitat will be  destroyed. Seas will rise. Insects will spread.</p><p> FAREED RAFIQ ZAKARIA, CNN'S FAREED ZAKARIA GPS HOST, POLITICAL SCIENTIST,  AUTHOR, COLUMNIST: This will be the day that the United States resigned as  the leader of the free world.</p><p> JOHN KERRY, FORMER UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE: He is not helping the  forgotten American. He is hurting them. Their kids will have worse asthma  in the summer.</p><p> The President who talked about putting America first has now put America  last.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: These people are so stupid. It's amazing they have jobs. The  economy must be pretty strong, in fact, if those people have health  insurance. One thing they said though is true. </p><p> People were hurt, but not because we pulled out, but because other  countries kept to the terms of the Paris Climate Accord, including France. </p><p> This fall, France began to implement a gas tax to fight climate change  inspired by that agreement. Now, for the fourth weekend in a row, the city  of Paris has been rocked by riots and mass protests. The city is burning  and shows no signs of stopping. </p><p> What did this? Progressive climate policy. Will the people who formulated  it ever admit it? Of course, not. They're too invested.</p><p> Well the press, all of a sudden, doing everything it can to kill Elizabeth  Warren's presidential campaign before it even begins. That's kind of  interesting. Is this a mercy killing or something else going on?</p><p> Mark Steyn joins us to unravel a delightful mystery, after the break.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ELIZABETH ANN WARREN, SENIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, MASSACHUSETTS: Now, the  President likes to call my mom a liar. What do the facts say?</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The facts suggest that you absolutely have a Native  American ancestor in your pedigree.</p><p> WARREN: OK.</p><p> And Trump can say whatever he wants about me, but mocking Native Americans  or any group in order to try to get at me? That's not what America stands  for.</p><p> I'm not enrolled in a tribe and only tribes determine tribal citizenship. I  understand and respect that distinction. But my family history is my family  history.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: I mean (ph) you really just can't watch that enough. It really  should be a screensaver. This hasn't, understatement of the day, been the  fall Elizabeth Warren had hoped for. </p><p> She thought that releasing a DNA test showing that she might have had a  lone American Indian ancestor, not necessarily from this continent, a few  hundred years ago would silence the President and give her momentum going  into the primaries next year.</p><p> Instead, even the Left is turning on her. Two pieces in the Washington Post  and The New York Times in the past week suggests that Warren's campaign has  been deeply, maybe even fatally, wounded by the blunder of the DNA test. </p><p> Looks almost like an effort to kill Elizabeth Warren's campaign before she  can embarrass her party, the one to which everyone in the media belongs,  before she actually runs.</p><p> Mark Steyn is an Author and Columnist. Not a conspiracy not, I'll run this  by him anyway. So, what is going on? </p><p> So, obviously, she is a media creation, not a genius, but she has been the  subject of endless fawning profiles in the press, particularly from the  Boston Globe, which has promoted her for years, and now they're attacking  her, why?</p><p> MARK STEYN, AUTHOR, COLUMNIST, STEYNONLINE.COM: Yes. That's - that's  interesting. The Boston Globe is saying you - to Elizabeth Warren, you have  to know when not to run. And this is the paper that's wanted her to run  until she took--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: --until she got head-faked into taking this DNA test that showed she  was 1/1024th Native American, which is less Native American than the  average. </p><p> I mean you could test Kim Jong-un, Vladimir Putin, and they would - they  would be more than 1/1024th Native American just because some Cherokee  happened to change trains in Odessa in - in 1852, and got lucky with one of  the porters. </p><p> I mean any - every - anyone's more Native American. And what's fascinating- -</p><p> CARLSON: Ha-ha.</p><p> STEYN: --what's fascinating about this is that this - Elizabeth Warren was  a test on the limits of Democrat identity politics because their recent  presidential candidates have been sold on identity politics, but in rather  strange ways. </p><p> So, Barack Obama is an African-American. But he has nothing to do with the  Black slave experience or Civil Rights.</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> STEYN: He's - he's Black just because his father happened to be a British  subject born in Colonial Kenya. Barack Obama was actually the first child  of British subjects to be President, I believe, since Andrew Jackson. So,  he tried to get himself in on the colonial thing. </p><p> Obama said his step-grandfather in Indonesia had died fighting Dutch  soldiers in the struggle for independence. In fact, it turned out his step- grandfather died when he fell off a chair while changing the drapes. That's  not a joke. That's actually true. That's how his step-grandfather died.</p><p> Then you have Hillary Clinton, who's running as a feminist icon and is, in  fact, only the candidate because she's the wife of the previous guy, and  she was given a Senate seat as a reward for standing by him, when his  intern's dress wound up in the FBI crime analysis lab - lab.</p><p> So, we have very--</p><p> CARLSON: Ha-ha.</p><p> STEYN: --so in such a world, you can't blame Elizabeth Warren for saying,  \"Well, if Hillary could be a feminist icon, why can't I be the first Native  American President?\" </p><p> She was Harvard Law School's first woman of color. That's why it's not a  family law thing. She actually was promoted as Harvard Law School's first  woman of color. Why shouldn't she be America's first - first Native  American President?</p><p> CARLSON: Such a good (ph)--</p><p> STEYN: Since this is (ph)-- </p><p> CARLSON: --such a good example (ph).</p><p> STEYN: --none - none of this identity politics. Joe Biden should run as the  first transgender woman candidate and dare the Democrat electorate to call  him on it.</p><p> CARLSON: That was my plan.</p><p> STEYN: I mean this is this (ph)--</p><p> CARLSON: I hope he doesn't get there first.</p><p> STEYN: --no don't (ph)--</p><p> CARLSON: I'm doing that (ph). You're the best.</p><p> STEYN: Yes (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: Mark Steyn, we're out of time.</p><p> STEYN: Thanks a lot, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: I loved it. Thank you.</p><p> STEYN: Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: Man that was fun. Back tomorrow, 8 P.M., show that is the sworn  enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and, especially, groupthink. Good night  from Washington. Sean Hannity.</p><p> END </p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

If you've been watching television recently, you've probably heard the bad  news. The Trump Administration is over, toast, cooked, done for good, and  along with it any hope of the middle-class revolution that 63 million  Americans voted for two years ago.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The reason for this tragedy is simple. The President has been caught  committing felonies. Here's what the legal experts without law degrees are  saying on television.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LAWRENCE O'DONNELL, THE LAST WORD WITH LAWRENCE O'DONNELL HOST, MSNBC: If  precedent means anything in the Trump era, Donald Trump will be, must be,  impeached because of the crimes prosecutors say he committed in the Michael  Cohen case.</p><p>ROBERT E. MOOK, FORMER POLITICAL CAMPAIGN STRATEGIST AND CAMPAIGN MANAGER,  CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Both parties need to get on board to pass  articles of impeachment.</p><p>EDDIE GLAUDE, CHAIR, CENTER FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN STUDIES: You have  conspiracy, you have - you have obstruction, you have campaigns finance and  you have emoluments. </p><p>If the Democrats do not pursue this vigorously, they will be, in some ways,  held accountable for abdicating their responsibility.</p><p>It goes to the moral question, the ethical question. Democracy is at stake.</p><p>MAXINE MOORE WATERS, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR CALIFORNIA'S 43RD  CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, DEMOCRATIC PARTY MEMBER: This criminal must be  brought up by the Congress of the United States for impeachment.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CARLSON: We're not even (ph) going to show you the Don Lemon tape. There's  a lot of emotion there. But to sum up, they're telling us that we're  staring down the barrel of a constitutional crisis. And that crisis stems  from what MSNBC describes as, quote, the crimes prosecutors say the  President committed in the Michael Cohen case.</p><p>Which crimes were those? We have the answer. The relevant details were  spelled out in a piece that ran over the weekend in The New York Times  under this headline. \"Prosecutors say Trump directed illegal payments  during campaign.\"</p><p>The gist of the story is this. Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, has  told federal prosecutors that he facilitated payments to two women who said  they had affairs with Donald Trump. And then, well actually that's it.  That's the entire story right there.</p><p>Paying these two women, say federal prosecutors and their flacks at NBC  News, was a serious crime, a crime worthy of impeachment, if not,  indictment. OK. But you might be wondering, how exactly is that criminal?  Well, we're going to explain it to you.</p><p>We're going to start by stipulating that everything Michael Cohen has told  the feds is absolutely true. Now, assuming honesty isn't usually a wise  idea with Michael Cohen, but for the sake of argument, let's do it in this  case, everything he says is true, why is what Cohen is alleging a criminal  offense?</p><p>Remember the facts of the story. These are undisputed. Two women approached  Donald Trump and threatened to ruin his career and humiliate his family if  he doesn't give them money. Now, that sounds like a classic case of  extortion.</p><p>Yet, for whatever reason, Trump caves to it, and he directs Michael Cohen  to pay the ransom. Now, more than two years later, Trump is a felon for  doing this. It doesn't seem to make any sense.</p><p>Oh, but you're not a federal prosecutor on a political mission. If you were  a federal prosecutor on a political mission, you would construe those  extortion payments as campaign contributions. You'd do this even though the  money in question did not come from or go to Donald Trump's presidential  campaign.</p><p>Then you'd claim that Trump and Michael Cohen violated campaign finance law  because they didn't publicly disclose those payments despite the fact that  disclosing them would nullify the reason for making them in the first  place, which was to keep the whole thing secret.</p><p>That is the argument you would make, both in federal court and through your  proxies on cable television. It is insultingly stupid. But because everyone  in power hates the target of your investigation, nobody would question you,  and that's what's happening right now.</p><p>Now, by this reasoning, any money a political candidate spends to maintain  or protect his image while running for office now qualifies as a regulated  campaign donation, and has to be disclosed. That would include, by the way,  in addition to an infinite number of other things, buying toothpaste and  getting a haircut.</p><p>It would definitely include the taxpayer-financed slush fund that Congress  has set aside to pay off its own sexual harassment claims. Yes, those now  qualify as campaign contributions. They must be publicly disclosed, except,  of course, they're not publicly disclosed, and they never will be. Why is  that?</p><p>Well that might be a question for Congressional leaders including, now that  we think about it, Congressman Adam Schiff of Burbank, California. He's the  incoming Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, a very powerful man  in the Congress. </p><p>What does Mr. Schiff have to say about Congress not disclosing the very  same payments that Democrats say Trump should be impeached for not  disclosing? Let's ask him.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ADAM BENNETT SCHIFF, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR CALIFORNIA'S 28TH  CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, DEMOCRATIC PARTY MEMBER: There's a very real  prospect that on the day Donald Trump leaves office the Justice Department  may indict him that he may be the first president in quite some time to  face the real prospect of jail time.</p><p>NEAL KUMAR KATYAL, LAWYER, FORMER ACTING SOLICITOR GENERAL OF THE UNITED  STATES, LAW PROFESSOR AT GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY: Trump knows that he's  facing some pretty strong criminal liability when he leaves office, one way  or another. And, you know, even if a (ph) sitting president can't be  indicted, he's got to know his future looks like it's behind bars unless he  cuts some sort of deal with the prosecutors.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: So to translate, Trump's a criminal. He's going to jail for  committing a smaller version of the same made-up crime that we in Congress  have committed for years and forced you to pay for. </p><p>And, by the way, we're never apologizing for that because we don't have to  and CNN isn't going to make us. Screw you, America, and your stupid  election. We are in charge. That's the real message here, in case you  missed it.</p><p>Chris Hahn is a radio host and former aide to Senator Chuck Schumer, and he  joins us tonight. </p><p>So, Chris, I think you don't like Trump but that's fine. But speak slowly  so I can understand. Explain to me why paying off someone who is extorting  you, threatening to make public details of your personal life, if she  doesn't get paid, why paying that person is a felony?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER HAHN, AMERICAN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, DEMOCRATIC PARTY  ACTIVIST, RADIO SHOW HOST, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, first of all, we  don't know that there was actual extortion here. We know that a payment was  made. There was a catch and kill deal with the National Enquirer. Whether  or not it was extortion, that hasn't been proven yet, nor has it even  really been alleged in many cases--</p><p>CARLSON: Well, I'm--</p><p>HAHN: --by the President. He's not saying--</p><p>CARLSON: --I'm alleging, I'm - hold on, let me--</p><p>HAHN: --he's not say--</p><p>CARLSON: --let me just stop and say, I'm alleging it because it's obvious.  You're not going to pay a $100,000 or a $150,000 or $200,000 to someone  unless there's a threat to you and your reputation. This is extortion. </p><p>And I don't - I don't know why it's not being prosecuted. I don't know - I  don't know why Trump isn't defending himself on those grounds, I would. But  it clearly is extortion.</p><p>HAHN: Well--</p><p>CARLSON: But why is it a crime to pay off--</p><p>HAHN: --well sometimes people want--</p><p>CARLSON: --someone-- </p><p>HAHN: --sometimes people--</p><p>CARLSON: --who you had an affair with?</p><p>HAHN: --sometimes people want to tell us - they want to tell a story that  he doesn't want told. He said--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>HAHN: --hey, just tell it to me. I'll pay for it and--</p><p>CARLSON: That's extortion. It's--</p><p>HAHN: --and pay for yourselves (ph). That's what he did--</p><p>CARLSON: --that's - that's what - if I did that to you-- </p><p>HAHN: --in this situation.</p><p>CARLSON: --you would call it - if I said, \"Look, I know a detail about your  sex life, Chris Hahn, and I'm going to tell it on my show on TV unless you  pay me,\" that would be extortion, obviously. So, this is extortion. But  leaving that aside, why is it a felony to pay women you've had sexual  relationships with?</p><p>HAHN: It's not a felony. It's a felony to--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh.</p><p>HAHN: --do a campaign expenditure and not - and not disclose it, and that's  what this has been.</p><p>CARLSON: How is that a campaign expenditure?</p><p>HAHN: This seems to have been a campaign - he - he made this during the  campaign for the purposes of the campaign. There are tape recordings of him  discussing this with Michael Cohen. And that's just one--</p><p>CARLSON: Well, for the purposes of the campaign, I'm - wait--</p><p>HAHN: --look, this isn't even the - this is just a--</p><p>CARLSON: --no, but, wait, hold on, wait, hold on, I'm confused. No, it's  not a small thing. It's the thing. This is the crime that The New York Time  told us on Saturday, federal prosecutors are alleging the President  committed, it's a felony, and Michael Cohen pled guilty--</p><p>HAHN: Well they also--</p><p>CARLSON: --to a species of this. So, I just want to get to the bottom of  it. Why is that a campaign--</p><p>HAHN: Well, they're also alleging--</p><p>CARLSON: --contribution to pay off a former girlfriend? I'm honestly  confused. You're a campaign guy, tell me.</p><p>HAHN: They're - look, there's also an allegation that he may have violated  the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act when he was doing his deal in Moscow.</p><p>CARLSON: Well there are (ph) allegations that he killed Kennedy.</p><p>HAHN: There are a lot more to this than just paying off--</p><p>CARLSON: But I want - but hold on, no, no, no, no - </p><p>HAHN: --there's - there's a lot--</p><p>CARLSON: --OK--</p><p>HAHN: --there's a lot more to this than just paying off--</p><p>CARLSON: --OK, well how about one allegation--</p><p>HAHN: --porn stars who he slept with--</p><p>CARLSON: --slow down (ph), one allegation--</p><p>HAHN: --you know, a couple years ago.</p><p>CARLSON: --one allegation at a time. So, federal prosecutors--</p><p>HAHN: OK.</p><p>CARLSON: --this is not just something that dumb people on TV are talking  about, though they are. This is something that--</p><p>HAHN: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --prosecutors in New York State are saying they have, apparently,  evidence to indict over. So, tell me why because lot of people in - in  Washington pay off their girlfriends, including lots of people in Congress,  a lot of people in Congress, including I, even, guess some Democrats, just  throwing that out there. So, tell me why that's a campaign--</p><p>HAHN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --contribution to pay off your girlfriend?</p><p>HAHN: Well, first of all, I think that fund that Congress was using to pay  people off who were harassed needs to be disclosed and the Members who were  involved with those disclosure decisions need to be removed--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, I'm sure that'll happen right away. That'll happen right away.</p><p>HAHN: --from Congress right now. OK. I--</p><p>CARLSON: I'm sure MSNBC will push--</p><p>HAHN: I agree with you - I agree with you on that.</p><p>CARLSON: --real hard for that. Right, OK so but--</p><p>HAHN: I - I agree with you on--</p><p>CARLSON: --but tell me why it's a campaign--</p><p>HAHN: --I agree with you on that point.</p><p>CARLSON: --this is central question. Why is it and for all of us--</p><p>HAHN: Well, look, well--</p><p>CARLSON: --why is that a campaign contribution?</p><p>HAHN: --well here's the thing.</p><p>CARLSON: The money didn't come from the campaign. It didn't go to the  campaign. It was a threat to his reputation and his livelihood, as all  extortion is, right? So, why is that a campaign--</p><p>HAHN: There's black--</p><p>CARLSON: --contribution?</p><p>HAHN: --there's black letter law. There's black letter law here, OK?</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Well what is it?</p><p>HAHN: The campaign finance law is pretty clear about what you can and  cannot do with funds. And these funds were not necessarily from Trump's own  pockets. There was all sorts of schemes put together by the President and  Michael Cohen to move this money around, so it wasn't traced back to - to -  to President Trump.</p><p>CARLSON: But - but hold on, no--</p><p>HAHN: That in and of itself should--</p><p>CARLSON: --no, no, no, no, no--</p><p>HAHN: --raise red flags. You would be--</p><p>CARLSON: --no, no, you know, wait, stop, stop, stop, stop, no, no, no, no--</p><p>HAHN: --people would be blowing their mind off right now--</p><p>CARLSON: --wait, wait, stop, stop, stop, stop--</p><p>HAHN: --if you're (ph) the President.</p><p>CARLSON: --maybe. I mean we've never had a president like Trump in a  million different ways. And I'm not defending--</p><p>HAHN: No, we never have.</p><p>CARLSON: --I'm not defending his personal life. I'm merely saying--</p><p>HAHN: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --this is now being described as a felony, as a crime for which  the President could be removed. So, now is the time when we need to be very  specific about what the crime is because you're - you've stopped all  business of government, so we can respond to this. So, let's respond right  now. Tell me how and where--</p><p>HAHN: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --in campaign finance law it says, you're not allowed to use your  money, there's no allegation this was campaign money, your money to pay off  a former girlfriend? There isn't and that's this made-up (ph)--</p><p>HAHN: Oh, this is not--</p><p>CARLSON: --it's a lie--</p><p>HAHN: --the allegation here is not--</p><p>CARLSON: --actually.</p><p>HAHN: --the allegation here is not that it's just his money. There's  allegation that he moved money around through various schemes--</p><p>CARLSON: No, but not - they're not from the campaign--</p><p>HAHN: --to pay these women off--</p><p>CARLSON: --no, but, by the way--</p><p>HAHN: --including with the (ph) man who--</p><p>CARLSON: --you're allowed to do that too.</p><p>HAHN: --hold on a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait--</p><p>CARLSON: You're allowed to hide the payments.</p><p>HAHN: --he hid the payments--</p><p>CARLSON: What, is that a crime now--</p><p>HAHN: --that was campaign in nature--</p><p>CARLSON: --if it's your money?</p><p>HAHN: --that is a violation of--</p><p>CARLSON: Why does a campaign and (ph)--</p><p>HAHN: --a clear violation of campaign finance laws.</p><p>CARLSON: --hold on till then (ph), I'm giving you a chance on TV--</p><p>HAHN: It needed to be disclosed--</p><p>CARLSON: --hold on, hold on. No, no, just I'll let you speak and I'll let  you speak slowly--</p><p>HAHN: Go ahead.</p><p>CARLSON: --so our audience can understand. Where in campaign finance law  does it say that taking money that's not from your political campaign to  respond to an extortion attempt to pay off your girlfriend or pay the  gardener, pay anybody, why is that a felony? And where does it say that?</p><p>HAHN: Camp--</p><p>CARLSON: What are you talking about?</p><p>HAHN: --campaign finance law - look, I'm not going to quote the section and  verse. I don't know it off the top of my head--</p><p>CARLSON: Paraphrase it for me.</p><p>HAHN: --even though I'm a lawyer. Campaign finance - campaign finance law  clearly states that any money spent for campaign purposes, specifically by  people other than the candidate, must be disclosed. This is what's--</p><p>CARLSON: But why is that a campaign--</p><p>HAHN: --being alleged right here--</p><p>CARLSON: --purpose?</p><p>HAHN: --hold on, hold on, hold on--</p><p>CARLSON: What (ph)?</p><p>HAHN: --the President and Michael Cohen clearly set up a scheme so that  other people could pay these women off on behalf of Donald Trump while he  was running--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. OK. That--</p><p>HAHN: --for President because--</p><p>CARLSON: --that's fine but--</p><p>HAHN: --they thought that these (ph) allegations would sink his campaign  and his reputation.</p><p>CARLSON: But - but maybe - maybe under--</p><p>HAHN: That's a violation.</p><p>CARLSON: --no, actually, because anybody faced, I'm not, you know, I don't  know a single man who faced with that allegation, who he (ph) thought he  could squelch it wouldn't pay the person off because it does incalculable  damage to your reputation, whether you're running for anything or not. </p><p>And so, that's - it's so clearly not a campaign violation that I wonder if  we want to set this precedent. Do you want to live in a world where people  paying off extortion attempts are now campaign finance felons? I mean this  is lunatic.</p><p>HAHN: This is strike--</p><p>CARLSON: And you know it.</p><p>HAHN: --this - this is strikingly similar to what happened to John Edwards.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, and it's awful. It's awful what happened to--</p><p>HAHN: I'm not saying the President will be convicted but--</p><p>CARLSON: --John Edwards--</p><p>HAHN: --this is strikingly--</p><p>CARLSON: --I thought.</p><p>HAHN: --similar--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, it is. It is.</p><p>HAHN: --situation.</p><p>CARLSON: And what happened to him was--</p><p>HAHN: And it is something, look--</p><p>CARLSON: --wrong. It was another populace--</p><p>HAHN: --well--</p><p>CARLSON: --they took out with this BS campaign finance nonsense, exactly  what happened.</p><p>HAHN: --look, it is more than--</p><p>CARLSON: And, you know (ph), we're out of time.</p><p>HAHN: --campaign finance law.</p><p>CARLSON: --no.</p><p>HAHN: It's more than campaign finance law.</p><p>CARLSON: No, it's not.</p><p>HAHN: It is the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.</p><p>CARLSON: No, it's a totally separate thing.</p><p>HAHN: That in and of itself is a problem-- </p><p>CARLSON: Look, if - if he violated that I will (ph) defend it.</p><p>HAHN: Well, yes. And then (ph) also alleged by Cohen is--</p><p>CARLSON: But in this case, this is made-up.</p><p>HAHN: --also part of this.</p><p>CARLSON: All right, Chris Hahn, thank you.</p><p>HAHN: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Good to see you.</p><p>One of the most hysterical reactions in the past few days came from a  former Obama Administration U.S. Attorney, who says the President should be  stripped of his office.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARBARA MCQUADE, FORMER UNITED STATES ATTORNEY FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF  MICHIGAN, PROFESSOR OF LAW AT UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN LAW SCHOOL, LEGAL  ANALYST FOR NBC NEWS AND MSNBC: It could be that President Trump procured  the presidency by fraud. </p><p>When immigrants procure their citizenship by fraud, we strip them of their  citizenship. When a president procures his presidency by fraud, should we  consider doing the same?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Alan Dershowitz is, of course, a retired Harvard Law School  professor. He's the Author of the book, The Case Against Impeaching Trump,  and he joins us tonight.</p><p>Professor, I got a couple questions. But the first relates just to the  sound bite we played. Is there a provision in the Constitution for  stripping, whatever that means, stripping the presidency from a President  who you think is illegitimate, whatever that means?</p><p>ALAN MORTON DERSHOWITZ, LAWYER, THE CASE AGAINST IMPEACHING TRUMP AUTHOR,  HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR EMERITUS: Sure. It's called the 25th Amendment, but  not on the grounds of illegitimacy. I want everyone out there to imagine  the following scenario. </p><p>Let's assume when Bill Clinton was running for president, Paula Jones came  up to him and said, \"Unless you pay me a $130,000, I'll reveal our affair.\" </p><p>And let's assume, Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, together, did exactly  what it's alleged that Donald Trump and Cohen did together, I guarantee you  The New York Times, NBC, MSNBC would be railing against any prosecutor who  dared to suggest that this was a violation of the campaign (ph) finance  law. Everybody would be on the other side of this issue. </p><p>There'd be Republicans out there saying, \"Strip him of the presidency,  impeach him, indict him.\" Every Democrat would be saying this is a witch- hunt, this is terrible. We need a single standard. If you wouldn't go after  Bill Clinton, don't go after Donald Trump. </p><p>If you're going after Donald Trump, then you have to go after Hillary  Clinton for everything that she allegedly did. For example, one of your  guests talked about a Federal Corrupt Practices Act. That applies when you  bribe a foreign official.</p><p>What they're arguing is that there was a rumor that maybe somebody offered  Putin a penthouse in a Tower that Trump was thinking of building in Moscow.  And if that had been done, it would be a violation of the FCPA, Federal  Corrupt Practices Act. </p><p>But it's all based on hypotheticals and maybes. And I just want everybody  to apply the shoe on the other foot test. If Hillary Clinton were  president, the Republicans were saying, \"Lock her up,\" everybody would be  on the other side. They'd be screaming about how dare you expand criminal  statutes, how dare you expand the criteria for impeachment? </p><p>Now, all these liberal Democrat fair-weather civil libertarians are saying,  \"The hell with the Constitution, the hell with civil liberties, put all  that aside, get Trump.\" That's the most important consideration. Get him by  any means possible. This is such a danger to our constitutional system that  I would hope that true civil libertarians would rebel against that, as I  am.</p><p>CARLSON: Is - is it unfair to describe this scenario as extortion? I say I  know something about your sex life. I know a secret about you that you want  to keep the - that's non-criminal (ph), but that you want to keep hidden.  And unless you pay me money, I'm going to reveal it. That seems like  textbook extortion to me. Why is it not?</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: It is absolutely textbook extortion. And there ought to be a  prosecution of any person, man or woman, who approaches any candidate or  anybody else and says, \"Unless you pay me money, I'm going to reveal a sex  act that occurred.\" That is absolute classic extortion. </p><p>And it's shocking that the Special Counsel looking into this, who has a  broad mandate, he described it very broadly, isn't looking into the  extortion committed by, at least, the porn star, whose lawyer obviously  approached the candidate or the candidate's people, and threatened  exposure.</p><p>Otherwise, why would you pay? Just listen to the tape. The tape makes that  clear. The tape that Cohen made unwittingly of President Trump, it's clear  that they were paying off an extortion--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: --in order to prevent these issues from coming out for multiple  reasons, to protect his family, to protect his brand--</p><p>CARLSON: Sure.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: --possibly, to influence the campaign. </p><p>Let's remember one more thing. A President can contribute to a candidate as  much as he wants. If - if Bloomberg runs for president, he could announce  tomorrow, \"I'm not taking a nickel. I'm putting $1 billion of my own money  into this campaign.\" </p><p>That's perfectly legitimate. As far as reporting is concerned, it's the  campaign that has to report. And if these payments had to be reported, they  had to be reported after the election, the reporting time was after the  election so, it couldn't have impacted the election.</p><p>So, the absurd notion that he won the presidency by fraud and should be  stripped of the presidency (ph) reflects incredible ignorance about the  timing here, and how these statutes operate.</p><p>CARLSON: This is getting so crazy, it's - it's making my head spin. I  appreciate your coming on and explaining that to us, professor. Thank you  very much.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Well we've been saying it for a couple of years. Now, we have hard  scientific evidence that, in fact, big tech is altering and harming the  brains of children. Is it time to do something about that? What if we knew  it was true? Well we do know it's true now. We've got details next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TEXT: TECH TYRANNY.</p><p>CARLSON: Well Google collects more data than probably any other company,  and probably knows more about you than you do. You think this might raise  some concerns about the concentration of power. </p><p>But, for years, Congress seems to have cared not at all either because they  were ideologically predisposed to Google or because they were in its  pocket. Meanwhile, Google became more and more powerful, ominously  powerful. </p><p>Now, finally, during the lame-duck session, Congress has summoned the CEO  of Google, Sundar Pichai, to answer some questions about data transparency,  coming to Capitol Hill this week. What should Congress ask him about?</p><p>Harmeet Dhillon has followed this issue maybe more closely than any other  attorney in the United States, and she joins us tonight. Harmeet, thank you  very much for coming on. So what--</p><p>HARMEET DHILLON, AMERICAN LAWYER, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL LAWYERS ASSOCIATION  BOARD MEMBER, FORMER VICE CHAIRWOMAN OF THE CALIFORNIA REPUBLICAN PARTY,  AND THE NATIONAL COMMITTEEWOMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE FOR  CALIFORNIA: Hi, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: --what should be the - the list of questions?</p><p>DHILLON: Well, this is only a subset of the issues that people should be  asking Google that is the subject of the testimony tomorrow. But Google,  for years, as you pointed out, has been collecting data, and not disclosing  to users, number one, the extent of the collection of the data or what  they're doing with the data.</p><p>We have also learned of significant breaches, including today, an  announcement of a major breach of 52.5 million users on the Google+ failed  experiment in social media. It's not clear when that happened. </p><p>Google is not disclosing to people exactly what happened and what use has  been made of it. And they, as you pointed out, they just get away with it,  because we have both effete politicians in Washington, even on the  Republican side, and government agencies whose tasks it is to examine these  issues, and protect consumers. So, consumers are really at a complete loss. </p><p>Now, what I expect to happen on Capitol Hill tomorrow is that there'll be  some posturing questions written by staffers that Members of Congress are  going to read out, and you're going to have some focus group tested  jargony, you know, in - incomprehensible responses from Sundar Pichai  designed to placate these folks.</p><p>There'll be a little bit of a dance and everybody will go home, not  understanding what the answers were, and not probably going to do anything  about it. And this is a real tragedy and missed opportunity, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: What a shame? I want to (ph) ask you another story, another  element of the Google story. </p><p>Newly leaked email show that several Google employees plotted to destroy  the news site, Breitbart, after the 2016 election, a secret internal  discussion group labeled Resist. Google employees discussed how they could  use the, quote, hate speech and fake news labels to justify cutting off  Breitbart's ad revenues.</p><p>Harmeet, this is kind of the stuff of Conservative fever dreams that Google  would be actually doing something like this. Are you surprised by it? And  what can be done, in response?</p><p>DHILLON: Well Google - A, I'm not surprised. B, Google is denying it. But  there's extensive evidence that Google did this, and they did it in two  ways. </p><p>One way is right after the election, as you mentioned, a number of very  excitable Left-wing Google executives and employees tried to squeeze  Breitbart and other Conservative outlets into this hate speech category.</p><p>They then confessed that after a lot of effort that was really tough. So,  they also did a two-pronged approach, and the other side of that approach  is having their ad people contact customers and tell them that it might be  dangerous or a bad idea to advertise or allow their ads to be placed on  Conservative news websites like Breitbart and others.</p><p>And they pointed to some outside groups like Sleeping Giant that makes it a  - a business practice of defaming Conservative writers and organizations,  and use that as a smear. </p><p>Google also does this in many other ways like through its YouTube. It  categorizes content as sensitive, which automatically, both, makes it hard  to find the content online, and also strips that content from the ability  to gain advertising revenue.</p><p>So, Google is doing this systematically. Google is doing this purposefully.  Google is getting away with doing this. And I think it violates not just  some laws, including Communications Decency Act and others, but it - it  violates state laws that have to do with fraud and transparency, unfair  business practices and competition.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>DHILLON: Again, Google is able to get away with this because, you know,  they - they contribute to some Conservative groups like CPAC, lot of money  to show up at CPAC, and - and certainly on Capitol Hill. </p><p>They get away with it, and we see nothing done to control this - this, you  know, duopoly and monopoly on advertising revenue. It's very dangerous  because it's shaping what young people in America, who mainly get their  news through--</p><p>CARLSON: Of course.</p><p>DHILLON: --Google see every day.</p><p>CARLSON: Looking back, the Congress allowing Google to become more powerful  than the U.S. government, subverting our democracy entirely, that'll be the  thing we hold Members responsible for, I think, historically. </p><p>Harmeet Dhillon, you will not be held responsible since you're a lonely  voice on the right side, thank you for joining us, as always.</p><p>DHILLON: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Meanwhile, we've been saying it for years. Now, there is hard  scientific evidence that big tech is, in fact, harming our children. </p><p>New 60 Minutes report this week highlighted research that shows children  who use tablet smartphones and other screens more than seven hours a day,  and that's a lot of kids, believe it or not, are developing different brain  structures. Their brains are being damaged by this. </p><p>Tom Kersting is a psychotherapist, who's written extensively on this  subject, and he joins us tonight. You must feel vindicated by this report,  Tom.</p><p>TOM KERSTING, PSYCHOTHERAPIST, DISCONNECTED AUTHOR: I do. I do. I'm  actually happy to see it, to be honest with you because--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --it's something I've been speaking about for so many years at  lectures and in my book. And now, we could finally have some scientific  preliminary evidence showing exactly what all of this tech is doing to the  brain.</p><p>CARLSON: So, what is it doing?</p><p>KERSTING: Well, first of all, the area of the brain called the cortex,  which is the outer layer of the brain, the preliminary study that the - the  research has conducted, shows a - a premature thinning of that part of the  brain, OK, which is - which is kind of frightening, considering the  importance of that part of the brain, what it does, how it's very important  just for human beings in terms of organizing, planning, and a host of other  different things.</p><p>Another component that you don't hear much about is something called  neuroplasticity, which is actually the greatest breakthrough in modern day  psychology. And the term plasticity meaning that the brain, although very  strong and rigid, can be molded and shaped if placed in - in the right  environment for three or more hours per day. </p><p>We know that the average kid is spending nine hours a day, on average, in  what I consider to be the most highly stimulating of worlds. And what  happens is the brain will actually grow new neural pathways, it'll re- organize its circuitry to adapt to that cyber world.</p><p>And the problem is what I'm seeing clinically is an unadapting of - of  young kids in a real world having a very difficult time coping with just  the trivial nuances of life, the anxiety disorders, the depressions, and so  forth.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. Well and it's all kinds of measurements are showing the  horrifying results of it. How young, exactly, are kids getting addicted?</p><p>KERSTING: Well, we're seeing right now that there's some - some research  that came out recently that there - there's the kids as - as young as two  years old showing signs of depression. And, right now, the average age for  first smartphone issuance is about age 10.</p><p>And, you know, when I give lectures, every parent knows that this is bad.  But it's sort of, you know, what you talk about it you love (ph) the - the  term groupthink. I - I use the term social conformity. </p><p>We tend to do what everybody else is doing. And parents, anybody listening,  you have got to do what is in the best interest of your child, not - not  what everybody else around you is doing.</p><p>CARLSON: So, can you just give me the 20-second answer to the question I  always ask you, which is why are we so passive in the face of this? If two- year-olds were huffing on Marlboros, we'd say, \"You know what? No, not  allowed.\" But we just sort of sit back and let our society collapse in the  face of this, why?</p><p>KERSTING: Well, the reason, in my opinion, the reason why is - and we talk  about - I always talk about common sense, all right? </p><p>It's pretty clear, if we go walk around and everybody's got their heads  buried in a device all day long, you pull up to a traffic light, and they  can't even contain themselves for a minute without looking at their device,  it's pretty clear that it's having an impact on their behavior.</p><p>Now, the reason why nobody is--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --doing anything about it is because we're always looking for  scientific evidence, all right, and now we have some of it, and we're going  to start seeing a lot more of it. And--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --and we're going to start seeing some changes, as a result,  Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, and it's we waited too long for the studies to confirm the  obvious. Tom, thank you very much.</p><p>KERSTING: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, Hollywood doesn't need to remake 1984 again, not that they  would, it's probably illegal. But they already do a perfect job of  replicating it in real life. They are living the plotline of George  Orwell's novel. Kevin Hart is the latest person to be destroyed for  statements that he made many years ago. We'll tell you his story after the  break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TEXT: AMERICA'S NEWS HQ.</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Live from America's News  headquarters, I'm Trace Gallagher.</p><p>No bail decision yet for a top Chinese executive who's facing possible  extradition from Canada to the U.S. The case of Meng Wanzhou has fueled  U.S.-China trade tensions and rocked financial markets.</p><p>Meng is the Chief Financial Officer of telecommunications giant, Huawei.  She was detained December 1st during a layover in Vancouver. She's accused  of misleading banks about the company's business dealings in Iran. </p><p>There is a concerning uptick in paralyzing illness among children. The  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now says there have been more  cases than ever. There are a 158 confirmed cases so far this year. </p><p>The illness called acute flaccid myelitis causes paralysis in the face,  neck, back, arms or legs. The symptoms usually come a week following a  fever and respiratory illness. </p><p>I'm Trace Gallagher, now back to Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Hollywood has issued a new decree. And, of course, everyone obeyed  immediately. Kevin Hart's career must be destroyed. </p><p>Just days after the Comedian was announced as the next Host of the Oscars,  the now-irrelevant awards show some people still watch, Hart was forced to  step down over tweets and stand-up routines from about a decade ago that  some said were anti-gay.</p><p>Now, these tweets had already come to light. Hart had already apologized  for them and said he was changing his routine, but it didn't matter. In  today's political environment, there is no such thing as forgiveness or  mercy. What you're seeing is, instead, a particularly powerful form of  bullying. Do and think exactly as we say, or else.</p><p>Larry Elder has fought the forces of conformity for a long time. He's a  radio show host from Los Angeles, and he joins us tonight. We're really  glad to have you, Larry Elder, thank you. So, what's the takeaway from  watching what just happened to Kevin Hart?</p><p>LARRY ELDER, RADIO SHOW HOST, WRITER, ATTORNEY: The takeaway, Tucker, is  what the devil are the rules. As you pointed out--</p><p>CARLSON: Right. I got it (ph).</p><p>ELDER: --Kevin Hart did these tweets some years ago and - and made anti-gay  references in his stand-up some years ago. He apologized back in 2015. The  Academy Award people wanted him to apologize again. He refused.</p><p>Now, the show is going to be carried by ABC. ABC parent company is Disney.  Disney also owns ESPN. They've employed Keith Olbermann, who is a - a Trump  hater from way back. And just last year, he tweeted that Trump was a Nazi  and dropped a bunch of F-bombs in his tweet. That didn't seem to bother  Disney. But Kevin Hart has to go.</p><p>The other inconsistency, of course, is that other comedians like Amy  Schumer, who last year, I think it was, hosted a Democratic fundraiser, has  used the - the F-word for gays in a tweet, as has Sarah Silverman, as has  Chelsea Handler, all of whom have hosted shows.</p><p>And finally, you have the instance of Joy Ann Reid on MSNBC who had a blog  2007, 2008--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>ELDER: --a very anti-gay post she made, and she wasn't joking, she wasn't a  comedian, including dissing the movie Brokeback Mountain, and said she  hated watching men kiss. She then said she apologized. </p><p>Then, later on, she said she was hacked. NBC did a search to find out  whether or not she'd been hacked. Turned out she wasn't hacked. So, she  either misremembered or lied, and then apologized again. She has a show on  MSNBC. So, forgive Kevin Hart for not - for not knowing what the rules are.</p><p>CARLSON: Well that's and - so, but what's the best response? I think you're  absolutely right. All of us at some point are going to be accused of  thoughtcrime, and the mob will come for us. It's inevitable.</p><p>ELDER: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: How do we respond? What's the best way to respond?</p><p>ELDER: You do them on a case-by-case basis. The man apologized, said he had  grown. The - the most horrific tweet was saying that if he came home and  saw his son playing with his daughter's dollhouse, he'd break the dollhouse  over his head. He later on said, he apologized, he's grown as a man--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>ELDER: --and perhaps the tweet had to do with his own insecurities as a  man. So, I think that's what you do. You apologize, be sincere, and then  keep going. </p><p>But if people keep beating you over the - over the head over it over and  over again, they're not going to forgive you, I'm not sure what the point  is, which is why I believe that Kevin Hart was morally justified in saying,  I've already apologized, I'm not going to apologize again.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>ELDER: I'm a 40-year old man. I've apologized. I've grown, let it alone.</p><p>CARLSON: I mean what happens to a society where the mob feels it has  ultimate authority on judgment? No one believes in God, so they have to  make their own judgments, hard and fast judgments--</p><p>ELDER: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --and no forgiveness is allowed.</p><p>ELDER: Yes. And what happens to a society that's - that's so inconsistent?  For example, Kanye West--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>ELDER: --is being called an Uncle Tom and a Token, a House Negro. That  doesn't seem to bother anybody. </p><p>You got a guy in like Al Sharpton, who's got a show where he's referred to  gays as - as homos in the - in years past, Jews as interlopers. He - he  falsely accused a White man of raping a Black teenager, he has a show on  television, you know, every weekend.</p><p>So, you know, I'm not quite sure what to say, Tucker, other than it's  terribly inconsistent. It seem to me there's one rule for people who are  Conservative and one rule for people--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>ELDER: --who are on the Left.</p><p>CARLSON: I think it's best just to ignore the noise to the extent you can.  I mean they have an awful lot of power. You know, they'll de-platform you  in a second. Larry Elder--</p><p>ELDER: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --we're rooting for you.</p><p>ELDER: Thank you. I need--</p><p>CARLSON: If they ever try to leave you, you'd (ph)--</p><p>ELDER: --I could use the help.</p><p>CARLSON: --always have a home on this show. Good to see you.</p><p>ELDER: I could use the help. Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you.</p><p>Well China just launched a new persecution of the country's Christians.  Will anyone in Washington care?

How many news stories begin  with that sentence, \"China has launched a new crackdown?\" Many. And they  have, once again, launched new crackdown, this time, on their country's  underground Christian community.</p><p>In a coordinated sweep of nighttime raids, police rounded up about a 100  members and the pastor of the Early Rain Covenant Church. Because the  church does not submit to government control, it is illegal in China. And  members have been forbidden from attending services.</p><p>It's just the latest in a persecution wave that has shut down several  different churches with thousands of Christian members. This is what actual  religious oppression looks like, but a ruling class that's seen (ph) people  who boycott North Carolina over its bathroom laws don't care at all. </p><p>None of them are calling for boycotts or sanctions on China. There's no  witch-hunt against the countless universities, businesses, and lobbyists  with massive financial ties to China, and its authoritarian regime.</p><p>In fact, to our ruling class, China is the future. If anything, it's a  country we ought to emulate. So remember that, next time they try to  lecture you about how their values are better than yours.</p><p>The war in Afghanistan, as you well know, has continued for 17 years. It's  the longest war in the history of this country. We're still spending  billions there. American soldiers are still dying there. It might all be  worth it if we were still fighting for victory. But are we fighting for  victory?</p><p>In a newly leaked audiotape, former NATO Commander, Stanley McChrystal,  tells Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, how the war in Afghanistan should be  fought. </p><p>It's not exactly the opening speech from Patton. \"My best suggestion,\" he  says, \"Is to keep a limited number of forces there and just kind of muddle  along, and see what we can do.\"</p><p>Now, muddle along is not a strategy for anything, much less a victory. It's  a strategy to waste American money and lives for no reason at all. If U.S.  troops are going to muddle along in a war, maybe it's a sign that's a war  we shouldn't be fighting in the first place.</p><p>Well, if you can remember back a year-and-a-half, on June 1st, 2017, the  President announced he was pulling this country out of the Paris Climate  Accords. To hear the politicians and television news chintuggers (ph)  react, you'd think it was the worst natural catastrophe, well, ever.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NANCY PELOSI, MINORITY LEADER OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF  REPRESENTATIVES, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA: What happened yesterday on the  climate issue is an embarrassment to our country and it should be an  embarrassment to him personally for how he answers to his grandchildren.</p><p>GOV. JERRY BROWN (D), CALIFORNIA: People are going to die. Habitat will be  destroyed. Seas will rise. Insects will spread.</p><p>FAREED RAFIQ ZAKARIA, CNN'S FAREED ZAKARIA GPS HOST, POLITICAL SCIENTIST,  AUTHOR, COLUMNIST: This will be the day that the United States resigned as  the leader of the free world.</p><p>JOHN KERRY, FORMER UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE: He is not helping the  forgotten American. He is hurting them. Their kids will have worse asthma  in the summer.</p><p>The President who talked about putting America first has now put America  last.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: These people are so stupid. It's amazing they have jobs. The  economy must be pretty strong, in fact, if those people have health  insurance. One thing they said though is true. </p><p>People were hurt, but not because we pulled out, but because other  countries kept to the terms of the Paris Climate Accord, including France. </p><p>This fall, France began to implement a gas tax to fight climate change  inspired by that agreement. Now, for the fourth weekend in a row, the city  of Paris has been rocked by riots and mass protests. The city is burning  and shows no signs of stopping. </p><p>What did this? Progressive climate policy. Will the people who formulated  it ever admit it? Of course, not. They're too invested.</p><p>Well the press, all of a sudden, doing everything it can to kill Elizabeth  Warren's presidential campaign before it even begins. That's kind of  interesting. Is this a mercy killing or something else going on?</p><p>Mark Steyn joins us to unravel a delightful mystery, after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ELIZABETH ANN WARREN, SENIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, MASSACHUSETTS: Now, the  President likes to call my mom a liar. What do the facts say?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The facts suggest that you absolutely have a Native  American ancestor in your pedigree.</p><p>WARREN: OK.</p><p>And Trump can say whatever he wants about me, but mocking Native Americans  or any group in order to try to get at me? That's not what America stands  for.</p><p>I'm not enrolled in a tribe and only tribes determine tribal citizenship. I  understand and respect that distinction. But my family history is my family  history.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: I mean (ph) you really just can't watch that enough. It really  should be a screensaver. This hasn't, understatement of the day, been the  fall Elizabeth Warren had hoped for. </p><p>She thought that releasing a DNA test showing that she might have had a  lone American Indian ancestor, not necessarily from this continent, a few  hundred years ago would silence the President and give her momentum going  into the primaries next year.</p><p>Instead, even the Left is turning on her. Two pieces in the Washington Post  and The New York Times in the past week suggests that Warren's campaign has  been deeply, maybe even fatally, wounded by the blunder of the DNA test. </p><p>Looks almost like an effort to kill Elizabeth Warren's campaign before she  can embarrass her party, the one to which everyone in the media belongs,  before she actually runs.</p><p>Mark Steyn is an Author and Columnist. Not a conspiracy not, I'll run this  by him anyway. So, what is going on? </p><p>So, obviously, she is a media creation, not a genius, but she has been the  subject of endless fawning profiles in the press, particularly from the  Boston Globe, which has promoted her for years, and now they're attacking  her, why?</p><p>MARK STEYN, AUTHOR, COLUMNIST, STEYNONLINE.COM: Yes. That's - that's  interesting. The Boston Globe is saying you - to Elizabeth Warren, you have  to know when not to run. And this is the paper that's wanted her to run  until she took--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --until she got head-faked into taking this DNA test that showed she  was 1/1024th Native American, which is less Native American than the  average. </p><p>I mean you could test Kim Jong-un, Vladimir Putin, and they would - they  would be more than 1/1024th Native American just because some Cherokee  happened to change trains in Odessa in - in 1852, and got lucky with one of  the porters. </p><p>I mean any - every - anyone's more Native American. And what's fascinating- -</p><p>CARLSON: Ha-ha.</p><p>STEYN: --what's fascinating about this is that this - Elizabeth Warren was  a test on the limits of Democrat identity politics because their recent  presidential candidates have been sold on identity politics, but in rather  strange ways. </p><p>So, Barack Obama is an African-American. But he has nothing to do with the  Black slave experience or Civil Rights.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>STEYN: He's - he's Black just because his father happened to be a British  subject born in Colonial Kenya. Barack Obama was actually the first child  of British subjects to be President, I believe, since Andrew Jackson. So,  he tried to get himself in on the colonial thing. </p><p>Obama said his step-grandfather in Indonesia had died fighting Dutch  soldiers in the struggle for independence. In fact, it turned out his step- grandfather died when he fell off a chair while changing the drapes. That's  not a joke. That's actually true. That's how his step-grandfather died.</p><p>Then you have Hillary Clinton, who's running as a feminist icon and is, in  fact, only the candidate because she's the wife of the previous guy, and  she was given a Senate seat as a reward for standing by him, when his  intern's dress wound up in the FBI crime analysis lab - lab.</p><p>So, we have very--</p><p>CARLSON: Ha-ha.</p><p>STEYN: --so in such a world, you can't blame Elizabeth Warren for saying,  \"Well, if Hillary could be a feminist icon, why can't I be the first Native  American President?\" </p><p>She was Harvard Law School's first woman of color. That's why it's not a  family law thing. She actually was promoted as Harvard Law School's first  woman of color. Why shouldn't she be America's first - first Native  American President?</p><p>CARLSON: Such a good (ph)--</p><p>STEYN: Since this is (ph)-- </p><p>CARLSON: --such a good example (ph).</p><p>STEYN: --none - none of this identity politics. Joe Biden should run as the  first transgender woman candidate and dare the Democrat electorate to call  him on it.</p><p>CARLSON: That was my plan.</p><p>STEYN: I mean this is this (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: I hope he doesn't get there first.</p><p>STEYN: --no don't (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: I'm doing that (ph). You're the best.</p><p>STEYN: Yes (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: Mark Steyn, we're out of time.</p><p>STEYN: Thanks a lot, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: I loved it. Thank you.</p><p>STEYN: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Man that was fun. Back tomorrow, 8 P.M., show that is the sworn  enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and, especially, groupthink. Good night  from Washington. Sean Hannity.</p><p>END </p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

If you've been watching television recently, you've probably heard the bad  news. The Trump Administration is over, toast, cooked, done for good, and  along with it any hope of the middle-class revolution that 63 million  Americans voted for two years ago.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The reason for this tragedy is simple. The President has been caught  committing felonies. Here's what the legal experts without law degrees are  saying on television.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> LAWRENCE O'DONNELL, THE LAST WORD WITH LAWRENCE O'DONNELL HOST, MSNBC: If  precedent means anything in the Trump era, Donald Trump will be, must be,  impeached because of the crimes prosecutors say he committed in the Michael  Cohen case.</p><p> ROBERT E. MOOK, FORMER POLITICAL CAMPAIGN STRATEGIST AND CAMPAIGN  MANAGER,  CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Both parties need to get on board to pass  articles of impeachment.</p><p> EDDIE GLAUDE, CHAIR, CENTER FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN STUDIES: You have  conspiracy, you have - you have obstruction, you have campaigns finance and  you have emoluments. </p><p> If the Democrats do not pursue this vigorously, they will be, in some ways,  held accountable for abdicating their responsibility.</p><p> It goes to the moral question, the ethical question. Democracy is at stake.</p><p> MAXINE MOORE WATERS, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR CALIFORNIA'S 43RD  CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, DEMOCRATIC PARTY MEMBER: This criminal must be  brought up by the Congress of the United States for impeachment.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CARLSON: We're not even (ph) going to show you the Don Lemon tape. There's  a lot of emotion there. But to sum up, they're telling us that we're  staring down the barrel of a constitutional crisis. And that crisis stems  from what MSNBC describes as, quote, the crimes prosecutors say the  President committed in the Michael Cohen case.</p><p> Which crimes were those? We have the answer. The relevant details were  spelled out in a piece that ran over the weekend in The New York Times  under this headline. \"Prosecutors say Trump directed illegal payments  during campaign.\"</p><p> The gist of the story is this. Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, has  told federal prosecutors that he facilitated payments to two women who said  they had affairs with Donald Trump. And then, well actually that's it.  That's the entire story right there.</p><p> Paying these two women, say federal prosecutors and their flacks at NBC  News, was a serious crime, a crime worthy of impeachment, if not,  indictment. OK. But you might be wondering, how exactly is that criminal?  Well, we're going to explain it to you.</p><p> We're going to start by stipulating that everything Michael Cohen has told  the feds is absolutely true. Now, assuming honesty isn't usually a wise  idea with Michael Cohen, but for the sake of argument, let's do it in this  case, everything he says is true, why is what Cohen is alleging a criminal  offense?</p><p> Remember the facts of the story. These are undisputed. Two women approached  Donald Trump and threatened to ruin his career and humiliate his family if  he doesn't give them money. Now, that sounds like a classic case of  extortion.</p><p> Yet, for whatever reason, Trump caves to it, and he directs Michael Cohen  to pay the ransom. Now, more than two years later, Trump is a felon for  doing this. It doesn't seem to make any sense.</p><p> Oh, but you're not a federal prosecutor on a political mission. If you were  a federal prosecutor on a political mission, you would construe those  extortion payments as campaign contributions. You'd do this even though the  money in question did not come from or go to Donald Trump's presidential  campaign.</p><p> Then you'd claim that Trump and Michael Cohen violated campaign finance law  because they didn't publicly disclose those payments despite the fact that  disclosing them would nullify the reason for making them in the first  place, which was to keep the whole thing secret.</p><p> That is the argument you would make, both in federal court and through your  proxies on cable television. It is insultingly stupid. But because everyone  in power hates the target of your investigation, nobody would question you,  and that's what's happening right now.</p><p> Now, by this reasoning, any money a political candidate spends to maintain  or protect his image while running for office now qualifies as a regulated  campaign donation, and has to be disclosed. That would include, by the way,  in addition to an infinite number of other things, buying toothpaste and  getting a haircut.</p><p> It would definitely include the taxpayer-financed slush fund that Congress  has set aside to pay off its own sexual harassment claims. Yes, those now  qualify as campaign contributions. They must be publicly disclosed, except,  of course, they're not publicly disclosed, and they never will be. Why is  that?</p><p> Well that might be a question for Congressional leaders including, now that  we think about it, Congressman Adam Schiff of Burbank, California. He's the  incoming Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, a very powerful man  in the Congress. </p><p> What does Mr. Schiff have to say about Congress not disclosing the very  same payments that Democrats say Trump should be impeached for not  disclosing? Let's ask him.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ADAM BENNETT SCHIFF, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR CALIFORNIA'S 28TH  CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, DEMOCRATIC PARTY MEMBER: There's a very real  prospect that on the day Donald Trump leaves office the Justice Department  may indict him that he may be the first president in quite some time to  face the real prospect of jail time.</p><p>NEAL KUMAR KATYAL, LAWYER, FORMER ACTING SOLICITOR GENERAL OF THE UNITED  STATES, LAW PROFESSOR AT GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY: Trump knows that he's  facing some pretty strong criminal liability when he leaves office, one way  or another. And, you know, even if a (ph) sitting president can't be  indicted, he's got to know his future looks like it's behind bars unless he  cuts some sort of deal with the prosecutors.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: So to translate, Trump's a criminal. He's going to jail for  committing a smaller version of the same made-up crime that we in Congress  have committed for years and forced you to pay for. </p><p> And, by the way, we're never apologizing for that because we don't have to  and CNN isn't going to make us. Screw you, America, and your stupid  election. We are in charge. That's the real message here, in case you  missed it.</p><p> Chris Hahn is a radio host and former aide to Senator Chuck Schumer, and he  joins us tonight. </p><p> So, Chris, I think you don't like Trump but that's fine. But speak slowly  so I can understand. Explain to me why paying off someone who is extorting  you, threatening to make public details of your personal life, if she  doesn't get paid, why paying that person is a felony?</p><p> CHRISTOPHER HAHN, AMERICAN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, DEMOCRATIC PARTY  ACTIVIST, RADIO SHOW HOST, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, first of all, we  don't know that there was actual extortion here. We know that a payment was  made. There was a catch and kill deal with the National Enquirer. Whether  or not it was extortion, that hasn't been proven yet, nor has it even  really been alleged in many cases--</p><p> CARLSON: Well, I'm--</p><p> HAHN: --by the President. He's not saying--</p><p> CARLSON: --I'm alleging, I'm - hold on, let me--</p><p> HAHN: --he's not say--</p><p> CARLSON: --let me just stop and say, I'm alleging it because it's obvious.  You're not going to pay a $100,000 or a $150,000 or $200,000 to someone  unless there's a threat to you and your reputation. This is extortion. </p><p> And I don't - I don't know why it's not being prosecuted. I don't know - I  don't know why Trump isn't defending himself on those grounds, I would. But  it clearly is extortion.</p><p> HAHN: Well--</p><p> CARLSON: But why is it a crime to pay off--</p><p> HAHN: --well sometimes people want--</p><p> CARLSON: --someone-- </p><p> HAHN: --sometimes people--</p><p> CARLSON: --who you had an affair with?</p><p> HAHN: --sometimes people want to tell us - they want to tell a story that  he doesn't want told. He said--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> HAHN: --hey, just tell it to me. I'll pay for it and--</p><p> CARLSON: That's extortion. It's--</p><p> HAHN: --and pay for yourselves (ph). That's what he did--</p><p> CARLSON: --that's - that's what - if I did that to you-- </p><p> HAHN: --in this situation.</p><p> CARLSON: --you would call it - if I said, \"Look, I know a detail about your  sex life, Chris Hahn, and I'm going to tell it on my show on TV unless you  pay me,\" that would be extortion, obviously. So, this is extortion. But  leaving that aside, why is it a felony to pay women you've had sexual  relationships with?</p><p> HAHN: It's not a felony. It's a felony to--</p><p> CARLSON: Oh.</p><p> HAHN: --do a campaign expenditure and not - and not disclose it, and that's  what this has been.</p><p> CARLSON: How is that a campaign expenditure?</p><p> HAHN: This seems to have been a campaign - he - he made this during the  campaign for the purposes of the campaign. There are tape recordings of him  discussing this with Michael Cohen. And that's just one--</p><p> CARLSON: Well, for the purposes of the campaign, I'm - wait--</p><p> HAHN: --look, this isn't even the - this is just a--</p><p> CARLSON: --no, but, wait, hold on, wait, hold on, I'm confused. No, it's  not a small thing. It's the thing. This is the crime that The New York Time  told us on Saturday, federal prosecutors are alleging the President  committed, it's a felony, and Michael Cohen pled guilty--</p><p> HAHN: Well they also--</p><p> CARLSON: --to a species of this. So, I just want to get to the bottom of  it. Why is that a campaign--</p><p> HAHN: Well, they're also alleging--</p><p> CARLSON: --contribution to pay off a former girlfriend? I'm honestly  confused. You're a campaign guy, tell me.</p><p> HAHN: They're - look, there's also an allegation that he may have violated  the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act when he was doing his deal in Moscow.</p><p> CARLSON: Well there are (ph) allegations that he killed Kennedy.</p><p> HAHN: There are a lot more to this than just paying off--</p><p> CARLSON: But I want - but hold on, no, no, no, no - </p><p> HAHN: --there's - there's a lot--</p><p> CARLSON: --OK--</p><p> HAHN: --there's a lot more to this than just paying off--</p><p> CARLSON: --OK, well how about one allegation--</p><p> HAHN: --porn stars who he slept with--</p><p> CARLSON: --slow down (ph), one allegation--</p><p> HAHN: --you know, a couple years ago.</p><p> CARLSON: --one allegation at a time. So, federal prosecutors--</p><p> HAHN: OK.</p><p> CARLSON: --this is not just something that dumb people on TV are talking  about, though they are. This is something that--</p><p> HAHN: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: --prosecutors in New York State are saying they have, apparently,  evidence to indict over. So, tell me why because lot of people in - in  Washington pay off their girlfriends, including lots of people in Congress,  a lot of people in Congress, including I, even, guess some Democrats, just  throwing that out there. So, tell me why that's a campaign--</p><p> HAHN: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: --contribution to pay off your girlfriend?</p><p> HAHN: Well, first of all, I think that fund that Congress was using to pay  people off who were harassed needs to be disclosed and the Members who were  involved with those disclosure decisions need to be removed--</p><p> CARLSON: Oh, I'm sure that'll happen right away. That'll happen right away.</p><p> HAHN: --from Congress right now. OK. I--</p><p> CARLSON: I'm sure MSNBC will push--</p><p> HAHN: I agree with you - I agree with you on that.</p><p> CARLSON: --real hard for that. Right, OK so but--</p><p> HAHN: I - I agree with you on--</p><p> CARLSON: --but tell me why it's a campaign--</p><p> HAHN: --I agree with you on that point.</p><p> CARLSON: --this is central question. Why is it and for all of us--</p><p> HAHN: Well, look, well--</p><p> CARLSON: --why is that a campaign contribution?</p><p> HAHN: --well here's the thing.</p><p> CARLSON: The money didn't come from the campaign. It didn't go to the  campaign. It was a threat to his reputation and his livelihood, as all  extortion is, right? So, why is that a campaign--</p><p> HAHN: There's black--</p><p> CARLSON: --contribution?</p><p> HAHN: --there's black letter law. There's black letter law here, OK?</p><p> CARLSON: OK. Well what is it?</p><p> HAHN: The campaign finance law is pretty clear about what you can and  cannot do with funds. And these funds were not necessarily from Trump's own  pockets. There was all sorts of schemes put together by the President and  Michael Cohen to move this money around, so it wasn't traced back to - to -  to President Trump.</p><p> CARLSON: But - but hold on, no--</p><p> HAHN: That in and of itself should--</p><p> CARLSON: --no, no, no, no, no--</p><p> HAHN: --raise red flags. You would be--</p><p> CARLSON: --no, no, you know, wait, stop, stop, stop, stop, no, no, no, no--</p><p> HAHN: --people would be blowing their mind off right now--</p><p> CARLSON: --wait, wait, stop, stop, stop, stop--</p><p> HAHN: --if you're (ph) the President.</p><p> CARLSON: --maybe. I mean we've never had a president like Trump in a  million different ways. And I'm not defending--</p><p> HAHN: No, we never have.</p><p> CARLSON: --I'm not defending his personal life. I'm merely saying--</p><p> HAHN: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: --this is now being described as a felony, as a crime for which  the President could be removed. So, now is the time when we need to be very  specific about what the crime is because you're - you've stopped all  business of government, so we can respond to this. So, let's respond right  now. Tell me how and where--</p><p> HAHN: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: --in campaign finance law it says, you're not allowed to use your  money, there's no allegation this was campaign money, your money to pay off  a former girlfriend? There isn't and that's this made-up (ph)--</p><p> HAHN: Oh, this is not--</p><p> CARLSON: --it's a lie--</p><p> HAHN: --the allegation here is not--</p><p> CARLSON: --actually.</p><p> HAHN: --the allegation here is not that it's just his money. There's  allegation that he moved money around through various schemes--</p><p> CARLSON: No, but not - they're not from the campaign--</p><p> HAHN: --to pay these women off--</p><p> CARLSON: --no, but, by the way--</p><p> HAHN: --including with the (ph) man who--</p><p> CARLSON: --you're allowed to do that too.</p><p> HAHN: --hold on a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait--</p><p> CARLSON: You're allowed to hide the payments.</p><p> HAHN: --he hid the payments--</p><p> CARLSON: What, is that a crime now--</p><p> HAHN: --that was campaign in nature--</p><p> CARLSON: --if it's your money?</p><p> HAHN: --that is a violation of--</p><p> CARLSON: Why does a campaign and (ph)--</p><p> HAHN: --a clear violation of campaign finance laws.</p><p> CARLSON: --hold on till then (ph), I'm giving you a chance on TV--</p><p> HAHN: It needed to be disclosed--</p><p> CARLSON: --hold on, hold on. No, no, just I'll let you speak and I'll let  you speak slowly--</p><p> HAHN: Go ahead.</p><p> CARLSON: --so our audience can understand. Where in campaign finance law  does it say that taking money that's not from your political campaign to  respond to an extortion attempt to pay off your girlfriend or pay the  gardener, pay anybody, why is that a felony? And where does it say that?</p><p> HAHN: Camp--</p><p> CARLSON: What are you talking about?</p><p> HAHN: --campaign finance law - look, I'm not going to quote the section and  verse. I don't know it off the top of my head--</p><p> CARLSON: Paraphrase it for me.</p><p> HAHN: --even though I'm a lawyer. Campaign finance - campaign finance law  clearly states that any money spent for campaign purposes, specifically by  people other than the candidate, must be disclosed. This is what's--</p><p> CARLSON: But why is that a campaign--</p><p> HAHN: --being alleged right here--</p><p> CARLSON: --purpose?</p><p> HAHN: --hold on, hold on, hold on--</p><p> CARLSON: What (ph)?</p><p> HAHN: --the President and Michael Cohen clearly set up a scheme so that  other people could pay these women off on behalf of Donald Trump while he  was running--</p><p> CARLSON: OK. OK. That--</p><p> HAHN: --for President because--</p><p> CARLSON: --that's fine but--</p><p> HAHN: --they thought that these (ph) allegations would sink his campaign  and his reputation.</p><p> CARLSON: But - but maybe - maybe under--</p><p> HAHN: That's a violation.</p><p> CARLSON: --no, actually, because anybody faced, I'm not, you know, I don't  know a single man who faced with that allegation, who he (ph) thought he  could squelch it wouldn't pay the person off because it does incalculable  damage to your reputation, whether you're running for anything or not. </p><p> And so, that's - it's so clearly not a campaign violation that I wonder if  we want to set this precedent. Do you want to live in a world where people  paying off extortion attempts are now campaign finance felons? I mean this  is lunatic.</p><p> HAHN: This is strike--</p><p> CARLSON: And you know it.</p><p> HAHN: --this - this is strikingly similar to what happened to John Edwards.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes, and it's awful. It's awful what happened to--</p><p> HAHN: I'm not saying the President will be convicted but--</p><p> CARLSON: --John Edwards--</p><p> HAHN: --this is strikingly--</p><p> CARLSON: --I thought.</p><p> HAHN: --similar--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes, it is. It is.</p><p> HAHN: --situation.</p><p> CARLSON: And what happened to him was--</p><p> HAHN: And it is something, look--</p><p> CARLSON: --wrong. It was another populace--</p><p> HAHN: --well--</p><p> CARLSON: --they took out with this BS campaign finance nonsense, exactly  what happened.</p><p> HAHN: --look, it is more than--</p><p> CARLSON: And, you know (ph), we're out of time.</p><p> HAHN: --campaign finance law.</p><p> CARLSON: --no.</p><p> HAHN: It's more than campaign finance law.</p><p> CARLSON: No, it's not.</p><p> HAHN: It is the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.</p><p> CARLSON: No, it's a totally separate thing.</p><p> HAHN: That in and of itself is a problem-- </p><p> CARLSON: Look, if - if he violated that I will (ph) defend it.</p><p> HAHN: Well, yes. And then (ph) also alleged by Cohen is--</p><p> CARLSON: But in this case, this is made-up.</p><p> HAHN: --also part of this.</p><p> CARLSON: All right, Chris Hahn, thank you.</p><p> HAHN: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: Good to see you.</p><p> One of the most hysterical reactions in the past few days came from a  former Obama Administration U.S. Attorney, who says the President should be  stripped of his office.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARBARA MCQUADE, FORMER UNITED STATES ATTORNEY FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT  OF  MICHIGAN, PROFESSOR OF LAW AT UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN LAW SCHOOL, LEGAL  ANALYST FOR NBC NEWS AND MSNBC: It could be that President Trump procured  the presidency by fraud. </p><p> When immigrants procure their citizenship by fraud, we strip them of their  citizenship. When a president procures his presidency by fraud, should we  consider doing the same?</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: Alan Dershowitz is, of course, a retired Harvard Law School  professor. He's the Author of the book, The Case Against Impeaching Trump,  and he joins us tonight.</p><p> Professor, I got a couple questions. But the first relates just to the  sound bite we played. Is there a provision in the Constitution for  stripping, whatever that means, stripping the presidency from a President  who you think is illegitimate, whatever that means?</p><p>ALAN MORTON DERSHOWITZ, LAWYER, THE CASE AGAINST IMPEACHING TRUMP  AUTHOR,  HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR EMERITUS: Sure. It's called the 25th Amendment, but  not on the grounds of illegitimacy. I want everyone out there to imagine  the following scenario. </p><p> Let's assume when Bill Clinton was running for president, Paula Jones came  up to him and said, \"Unless you pay me a $130,000, I'll reveal our affair.\" </p><p> And let's assume, Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, together, did exactly  what it's alleged that Donald Trump and Cohen did together, I guarantee you  The New York Times, NBC, MSNBC would be railing against any prosecutor who  dared to suggest that this was a violation of the campaign (ph) finance  law. Everybody would be on the other side of this issue. </p><p> There'd be Republicans out there saying, \"Strip him of the presidency,  impeach him, indict him.\" Every Democrat would be saying this is a witch- hunt, this is terrible. We need a single standard. If you wouldn't go after  Bill Clinton, don't go after Donald Trump. </p><p> If you're going after Donald Trump, then you have to go after Hillary  Clinton for everything that she allegedly did. For example, one of your  guests talked about a Federal Corrupt Practices Act. That applies when you  bribe a foreign official.</p><p> What they're arguing is that there was a rumor that maybe somebody offered  Putin a penthouse in a Tower that Trump was thinking of building in Moscow.  And if that had been done, it would be a violation of the FCPA, Federal  Corrupt Practices Act. </p><p> But it's all based on hypotheticals and maybes. And I just want everybody  to apply the shoe on the other foot test. If Hillary Clinton were  president, the Republicans were saying, \"Lock her up,\" everybody would be  on the other side. They'd be screaming about how dare you expand criminal  statutes, how dare you expand the criteria for impeachment? </p><p> Now, all these liberal Democrat fair-weather civil libertarians are saying,  \"The hell with the Constitution, the hell with civil liberties, put all  that aside, get Trump.\" That's the most important consideration. Get him by  any means possible. This is such a danger to our constitutional system that  I would hope that true civil libertarians would rebel against that, as I  am.</p><p> CARLSON: Is - is it unfair to describe this scenario as extortion? I say I  know something about your sex life. I know a secret about you that you want  to keep the - that's non-criminal (ph), but that you want to keep hidden.  And unless you pay me money, I'm going to reveal it. That seems like  textbook extortion to me. Why is it not?</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: It is absolutely textbook extortion. And there ought to be a  prosecution of any person, man or woman, who approaches any candidate or  anybody else and says, \"Unless you pay me money, I'm going to reveal a sex  act that occurred.\" That is absolute classic extortion. </p><p> And it's shocking that the Special Counsel looking into this, who has a  broad mandate, he described it very broadly, isn't looking into the  extortion committed by, at least, the porn star, whose lawyer obviously  approached the candidate or the candidate's people, and threatened  exposure.</p><p> Otherwise, why would you pay? Just listen to the tape. The tape makes that  clear. The tape that Cohen made unwittingly of President Trump, it's clear  that they were paying off an extortion--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: --in order to prevent these issues from coming out for multiple  reasons, to protect his family, to protect his brand--</p><p> CARLSON: Sure.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: --possibly, to influence the campaign. </p><p> Let's remember one more thing. A President can contribute to a candidate as  much as he wants. If - if Bloomberg runs for president, he could announce  tomorrow, \"I'm not taking a nickel. I'm putting $1 billion of my own money  into this campaign.\" </p><p> That's perfectly legitimate. As far as reporting is concerned, it's the  campaign that has to report. And if these payments had to be reported, they  had to be reported after the election, the reporting time was after the  election so, it couldn't have impacted the election.</p><p> So, the absurd notion that he won the presidency by fraud and should be  stripped of the presidency (ph) reflects incredible ignorance about the  timing here, and how these statutes operate.</p><p> CARLSON: This is getting so crazy, it's - it's making my head spin. I  appreciate your coming on and explaining that to us, professor. Thank you  very much.</p><p> DERSHOWITZ: Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: Well we've been saying it for a couple of years. Now, we have hard  scientific evidence that, in fact, big tech is altering and harming the  brains of children. Is it time to do something about that? What if we knew  it was true? Well we do know it's true now. We've got details next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> TEXT: TECH TYRANNY.</p><p> CARLSON: Well Google collects more data than probably any other company,  and probably knows more about you than you do. You think this might raise  some concerns about the concentration of power. </p><p> But, for years, Congress seems to have cared not at all either because they  were ideologically predisposed to Google or because they were in its  pocket. Meanwhile, Google became more and more powerful, ominously  powerful. </p><p> Now, finally, during the lame-duck session, Congress has summoned the CEO  of Google, Sundar Pichai, to answer some questions about data transparency,  coming to Capitol Hill this week. What should Congress ask him about?</p><p> Harmeet Dhillon has followed this issue maybe more closely than any other  attorney in the United States, and she joins us tonight. Harmeet, thank you  very much for coming on. So what--</p><p> HARMEET DHILLON, AMERICAN LAWYER, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL LAWYERS  ASSOCIATION  BOARD MEMBER, FORMER VICE CHAIRWOMAN OF THE CALIFORNIA REPUBLICAN PARTY,  AND THE NATIONAL COMMITTEEWOMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE  FOR  CALIFORNIA: Hi, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: --what should be the - the list of questions?</p><p> DHILLON: Well, this is only a subset of the issues that people should be  asking Google that is the subject of the testimony tomorrow. But Google,  for years, as you pointed out, has been collecting data, and not disclosing  to users, number one, the extent of the collection of the data or what  they're doing with the data.</p><p> We have also learned of significant breaches, including today, an  announcement of a major breach of 52.5 million users on the Google+ failed  experiment in social media. It's not clear when that happened. </p><p>Google is not disclosing to people exactly what happened and what use has  been made of it. And they, as you pointed out, they just get away with it,  because we have both effete politicians in Washington, even on the  Republican side, and government agencies whose tasks it is to examine these  issues, and protect consumers. So, consumers are really at a complete loss. </p><p> Now, what I expect to happen on Capitol Hill tomorrow is that there'll be  some posturing questions written by staffers that Members of Congress are  going to read out, and you're going to have some focus group tested  jargony, you know, in - incomprehensible responses from Sundar Pichai  designed to placate these folks.</p><p> There'll be a little bit of a dance and everybody will go home, not  understanding what the answers were, and not probably going to do anything  about it. And this is a real tragedy and missed opportunity, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: What a shame? I want to (ph) ask you another story, another  element of the Google story. </p><p> Newly leaked email show that several Google employees plotted to destroy  the news site, Breitbart, after the 2016 election, a secret internal  discussion group labeled Resist. Google employees discussed how they could  use the, quote, hate speech and fake news labels to justify cutting off  Breitbart's ad revenues.</p><p> Harmeet, this is kind of the stuff of Conservative fever dreams that Google  would be actually doing something like this. Are you surprised by it? And  what can be done, in response?</p><p> DHILLON: Well Google - A, I'm not surprised. B, Google is denying it. But  there's extensive evidence that Google did this, and they did it in two  ways. </p><p> One way is right after the election, as you mentioned, a number of very  excitable Left-wing Google executives and employees tried to squeeze  Breitbart and other Conservative outlets into this hate speech category.</p><p> They then confessed that after a lot of effort that was really tough. So,  they also did a two-pronged approach, and the other side of that approach  is having their ad people contact customers and tell them that it might be  dangerous or a bad idea to advertise or allow their ads to be placed on  Conservative news websites like Breitbart and others.</p><p> And they pointed to some outside groups like Sleeping Giant that makes it a  - a business practice of defaming Conservative writers and organizations,  and use that as a smear. </p><p>Google also does this in many other ways like through its YouTube. It  categorizes content as sensitive, which automatically, both, makes it hard  to find the content online, and also strips that content from the ability  to gain advertising revenue.</p><p> So, Google is doing this systematically. Google is doing this purposefully.  Google is getting away with doing this. And I think it violates not just  some laws, including Communications Decency Act and others, but it - it  violates state laws that have to do with fraud and transparency, unfair  business practices and competition.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> DHILLON: Again, Google is able to get away with this because, you know,  they - they contribute to some Conservative groups like CPAC, lot of money  to show up at CPAC, and - and certainly on Capitol Hill. </p><p> They get away with it, and we see nothing done to control this - this, you  know, duopoly and monopoly on advertising revenue. It's very dangerous  because it's shaping what young people in America, who mainly get their  news through--</p><p> CARLSON: Of course.</p><p> DHILLON: --Google see every day.</p><p> CARLSON: Looking back, the Congress allowing Google to become more powerful  than the U.S. government, subverting our democracy entirely, that'll be the  thing we hold Members responsible for, I think, historically. </p><p> Harmeet Dhillon, you will not be held responsible since you're a lonely  voice on the right side, thank you for joining us, as always.</p><p> DHILLON: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: Meanwhile, we've been saying it for years. Now, there is hard  scientific evidence that big tech is, in fact, harming our children. </p><p> New 60 Minutes report this week highlighted research that shows children  who use tablet smartphones and other screens more than seven hours a day,  and that's a lot of kids, believe it or not, are developing different brain  structures. Their brains are being damaged by this. </p><p> Tom Kersting is a psychotherapist, who's written extensively on this  subject, and he joins us tonight. You must feel vindicated by this report,  Tom.</p><p> TOM KERSTING, PSYCHOTHERAPIST, DISCONNECTED AUTHOR: I do. I do. I'm  actually happy to see it, to be honest with you because--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> KERSTING: --it's something I've been speaking about for so many years at  lectures and in my book. And now, we could finally have some scientific  preliminary evidence showing exactly what all of this tech is doing to the  brain.</p><p> CARLSON: So, what is it doing?</p><p> KERSTING: Well, first of all, the area of the brain called the cortex,  which is the outer layer of the brain, the preliminary study that the - the  research has conducted, shows a - a premature thinning of that part of the  brain, OK, which is - which is kind of frightening, considering the  importance of that part of the brain, what it does, how it's very important  just for human beings in terms of organizing, planning, and a host of other  different things.</p><p> Another component that you don't hear much about is something called  neuroplasticity, which is actually the greatest breakthrough in modern day  psychology. And the term plasticity meaning that the brain, although very  strong and rigid, can be molded and shaped if placed in - in the right  environment for three or more hours per day. </p><p> We know that the average kid is spending nine hours a day, on average, in  what I consider to be the most highly stimulating of worlds. And what  happens is the brain will actually grow new neural pathways, it'll re- organize its circuitry to adapt to that cyber world.</p><p> And the problem is what I'm seeing clinically is an unadapting of - of  young kids in a real world having a very difficult time coping with just  the trivial nuances of life, the anxiety disorders, the depressions, and so  forth.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes. Well and it's all kinds of measurements are showing the  horrifying results of it. How young, exactly, are kids getting addicted?</p><p> KERSTING: Well, we're seeing right now that there's some - some research  that came out recently that there - there's the kids as - as young as two  years old showing signs of depression. And, right now, the average age for  first smartphone issuance is about age 10.</p><p> And, you know, when I give lectures, every parent knows that this is bad.  But it's sort of, you know, what you talk about it you love (ph) the - the  term groupthink. I - I use the term social conformity. </p><p> We tend to do what everybody else is doing. And parents, anybody listening,  you have got to do what is in the best interest of your child, not - not  what everybody else around you is doing.</p><p> CARLSON: So, can you just give me the 20-second answer to the question I  always ask you, which is why are we so passive in the face of this? If two- year-olds were huffing on Marlboros, we'd say, \"You know what? No, not  allowed.\" But we just sort of sit back and let our society collapse in the  face of this, why?</p><p> KERSTING: Well, the reason, in my opinion, the reason why is - and we talk  about - I always talk about common sense, all right? </p><p> It's pretty clear, if we go walk around and everybody's got their heads  buried in a device all day long, you pull up to a traffic light, and they  can't even contain themselves for a minute without looking at their device,  it's pretty clear that it's having an impact on their behavior.</p><p> Now, the reason why nobody is--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> KERSTING: --doing anything about it is because we're always looking for  scientific evidence, all right, and now we have some of it, and we're going  to start seeing a lot more of it. And--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> KERSTING: --and we're going to start seeing some changes, as a result,  Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes, and it's we waited too long for the studies to confirm the  obvious. Tom, thank you very much.</p><p> KERSTING: Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: Well, Hollywood doesn't need to remake 1984 again, not that they  would, it's probably illegal. But they already do a perfect job of  replicating it in real life. They are living the plotline of George  Orwell's novel. Kevin Hart is the latest person to be destroyed for  statements that he made many years ago. We'll tell you his story after the  break.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> TEXT: AMERICA'S NEWS HQ.</p><p> TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Live from America's News  headquarters, I'm Trace Gallagher.</p><p> No bail decision yet for a top Chinese executive who's facing possible  extradition from Canada to the U.S. The case of Meng Wanzhou has fueled  U.S.-China trade tensions and rocked financial markets.</p><p> Meng is the Chief Financial Officer of telecommunications giant, Huawei.  She was detained December 1st during a layover in Vancouver. She's accused  of misleading banks about the company's business dealings in Iran. </p><p> There is a concerning uptick in paralyzing illness among children. The  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now says there have been more  cases than ever. There are a 158 confirmed cases so far this year. </p><p> The illness called acute flaccid myelitis causes paralysis in the face,  neck, back, arms or legs. The symptoms usually come a week following a  fever and respiratory illness. </p><p> I'm Trace Gallagher, now back to Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: Hollywood has issued a new decree. And, of course, everyone obeyed  immediately. Kevin Hart's career must be destroyed. </p><p> Just days after the Comedian was announced as the next Host of the Oscars,  the now-irrelevant awards show some people still watch, Hart was forced to  step down over tweets and stand-up routines from about a decade ago that  some said were anti-gay.</p><p> Now, these tweets had already come to light. Hart had already apologized  for them and said he was changing his routine, but it didn't matter. In  today's political environment, there is no such thing as forgiveness or  mercy. What you're seeing is, instead, a particularly powerful form of  bullying. Do and think exactly as we say, or else.</p><p> Larry Elder has fought the forces of conformity for a long time. He's a  radio show host from Los Angeles, and he joins us tonight. We're really  glad to have you, Larry Elder, thank you. So, what's the takeaway from  watching what just happened to Kevin Hart?</p><p> LARRY ELDER, RADIO SHOW HOST, WRITER, ATTORNEY: The takeaway, Tucker, is  what the devil are the rules. As you pointed out--</p><p> CARLSON: Right. I got it (ph).</p><p> ELDER: --Kevin Hart did these tweets some years ago and - and made anti-gay  references in his stand-up some years ago. He apologized back in 2015. The  Academy Award people wanted him to apologize again. He refused.</p><p> Now, the show is going to be carried by ABC. ABC parent company is Disney.  Disney also owns ESPN. They've employed Keith Olbermann, who is a - a Trump  hater from way back. And just last year, he tweeted that Trump was a Nazi  and dropped a bunch of F-bombs in his tweet. That didn't seem to bother  Disney. But Kevin Hart has to go.</p><p> The other inconsistency, of course, is that other comedians like Amy  Schumer, who last year, I think it was, hosted a Democratic fundraiser, has  used the - the F-word for gays in a tweet, as has Sarah Silverman, as has  Chelsea Handler, all of whom have hosted shows.</p><p> And finally, you have the instance of Joy Ann Reid on MSNBC who had a blog  2007, 2008--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> ELDER: --a very anti-gay post she made, and she wasn't joking, she wasn't a  comedian, including dissing the movie Brokeback Mountain, and said she  hated watching men kiss. She then said she apologized. </p><p> Then, later on, she said she was hacked. NBC did a search to find out  whether or not she'd been hacked. Turned out she wasn't hacked. So, she  either misremembered or lied, and then apologized again. She has a show on  MSNBC. So, forgive Kevin Hart for not - for not knowing what the rules are.</p><p> CARLSON: Well that's and - so, but what's the best response? I think you're  absolutely right. All of us at some point are going to be accused of  thoughtcrime, and the mob will come for us. It's inevitable.</p><p> ELDER: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: How do we respond? What's the best way to respond?</p><p> ELDER: You do them on a case-by-case basis. The man apologized, said he had  grown. The - the most horrific tweet was saying that if he came home and  saw his son playing with his daughter's dollhouse, he'd break the dollhouse  over his head. He later on said, he apologized, he's grown as a man--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> ELDER: --and perhaps the tweet had to do with his own insecurities as a  man. So, I think that's what you do. You apologize, be sincere, and then  keep going. </p><p> But if people keep beating you over the - over the head over it over and  over again, they're not going to forgive you, I'm not sure what the point  is, which is why I believe that Kevin Hart was morally justified in saying,  I've already apologized, I'm not going to apologize again.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> ELDER: I'm a 40-year old man. I've apologized. I've grown, let it alone.</p><p> CARLSON: I mean what happens to a society where the mob feels it has  ultimate authority on judgment? No one believes in God, so they have to  make their own judgments, hard and fast judgments--</p><p> ELDER: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: --and no forgiveness is allowed.</p><p> ELDER: Yes. And what happens to a society that's - that's so inconsistent?  For example, Kanye West--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> ELDER: --is being called an Uncle Tom and a Token, a House Negro. That  doesn't seem to bother anybody. </p><p> You got a guy in like Al Sharpton, who's got a show where he's referred to  gays as - as homos in the - in years past, Jews as interlopers. He - he  falsely accused a White man of raping a Black teenager, he has a show on  television, you know, every weekend.</p><p> So, you know, I'm not quite sure what to say, Tucker, other than it's  terribly inconsistent. It seem to me there's one rule for people who are  Conservative and one rule for people--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> ELDER: --who are on the Left.</p><p> CARLSON: I think it's best just to ignore the noise to the extent you can.  I mean they have an awful lot of power. You know, they'll de-platform you  in a second. Larry Elder--</p><p> ELDER: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: --we're rooting for you.</p><p> ELDER: Thank you. I need--</p><p> CARLSON: If they ever try to leave you, you'd (ph)--</p><p> ELDER: --I could use the help.</p><p> CARLSON: --always have a home on this show. Good to see you.</p><p> ELDER: I could use the help. Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: Thank you.</p><p> Well China just launched a new persecution of the country's Christians.  Will anyone in Washington care? Are they too busy taking Chinese money?</p><p> Plus, Paris continues to be convulsed by the worst riots there in 50 years.  What are these riots about? You know what they're about. They're about the  Paris Climate Treaty, the spirit of it, anyway. And policies they want here  are being rejected by both Left and Right in France, and they're ignoring  it because it's too inconvenient to pay attention. Details ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> TEXT: THE CHINA THREAT.</p><p> CARLSON: China has launched a new crackdown. How many news stories begin  with that sentence, \"China has launched a new crackdown?\" Many. And they  have, once again, launched new crackdown, this time, on their country's  underground Christian community.</p><p> In a coordinated sweep of nighttime raids, police rounded up about a 100  members and the pastor of the Early Rain Covenant Church. Because the  church does not submit to government control, it is illegal in China. And  members have been forbidden from attending services.</p><p> It's just the latest in a persecution wave that has shut down several  different churches with thousands of Christian members. This is what actual  religious oppression looks like, but a ruling class that's seen (ph) people  who boycott North Carolina over its bathroom laws don't care at all. </p><p> None of them are calling for boycotts or sanctions on China. There's no  witch-hunt against the countless universities, businesses, and lobbyists  with massive financial ties to China, and its authoritarian regime.</p><p> In fact, to our ruling class, China is the future. If anything, it's a  country we ought to emulate. So remember that, next time they try to  lecture you about how their values are better than yours.</p><p> The war in Afghanistan, as you well know, has continued for 17 years. It's  the longest war in the history of this country. We're still spending  billions there. American soldiers are still dying there. It might all be  worth it if we were still fighting for victory. But are we fighting for  victory?</p><p> In a newly leaked audiotape, former NATO Commander, Stanley McChrystal,  tells Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, how the war in Afghanistan should be  fought. </p><p> It's not exactly the opening speech from Patton. \"My best suggestion,\" he  says, \"Is to keep a limited number of forces there and just kind of muddle  along, and see what we can do.\"</p><p> Now, muddle along is not a strategy for anything, much less a victory. It's  a strategy to waste American money and lives for no reason at all. If U.S.  troops are going to muddle along in a war, maybe it's a sign that's a war  we shouldn't be fighting in the first place.</p><p> Well, if you can remember back a year-and-a-half, on June 1st, 2017, the  President announced he was pulling this country out of the Paris Climate  Accords. To hear the politicians and television news chintuggers (ph)  react, you'd think it was the worst natural catastrophe, well, ever.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> NANCY PELOSI, MINORITY LEADER OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF  REPRESENTATIVES, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA: What happened yesterday on the  climate issue is an embarrassment to our country and it should be an  embarrassment to him personally for how he answers to his grandchildren.</p><p> GOV.

It's amazing they have jobs. The  economy must be pretty strong, in fact, if those people have health  insurance. One thing they said though is true. </p><p> People were hurt, but not because we pulled out, but because other  countries kept to the terms of the Paris Climate Accord, including France. </p><p> This fall, France began to implement a gas tax to fight climate change  inspired by that agreement. Now, for the fourth weekend in a row, the city  of Paris has been rocked by riots and mass protests. The city is burning  and shows no signs of stopping. </p><p> What did this? Progressive climate policy. Will the people who formulated  it ever admit it? Of course, not. They're too invested.</p><p> Well the press, all of a sudden, doing everything it can to kill Elizabeth  Warren's presidential campaign before it even begins. That's kind of  interesting. Is this a mercy killing or something else going on?</p><p> Mark Steyn joins us to unravel a delightful mystery, after the break.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ELIZABETH ANN WARREN, SENIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, MASSACHUSETTS: Now, the  President likes to call my mom a liar. What do the facts say?</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The facts suggest that you absolutely have a Native  American ancestor in your pedigree.</p><p> WARREN: OK.</p><p> And Trump can say whatever he wants about me, but mocking Native Americans  or any group in order to try to get at me? That's not what America stands  for.</p><p> I'm not enrolled in a tribe and only tribes determine tribal citizenship. I  understand and respect that distinction.

This hasn't, understatement of the day, been the  fall Elizabeth Warren had hoped for. </p><p> She thought that releasing a DNA test showing that she might have had a  lone American Indian ancestor, not necessarily from this continent, a few  hundred years ago would silence the President and give her momentum going  into the primaries next year.</p><p> Instead, even the Left is turning on her. Two pieces in the Washington Post  and The New York Times in the past week suggests that Warren's campaign has  been deeply, maybe even fatally, wounded by the blunder of the DNA test. </p><p> Looks almost like an effort to kill Elizabeth Warren's campaign before she  can embarrass her party, the one to which everyone in the media belongs,  before she actually runs.</p><p> Mark Steyn is an Author and Columnist. Not a conspiracy not, I'll run this  by him anyway. So, what is going on? </p><p> So, obviously, she is a media creation, not a genius, but she has been the  subject of endless fawning profiles in the press, particularly from the  Boston Globe, which has promoted her for years, and now they're attacking  her, why?</p><p> MARK STEYN, AUTHOR, COLUMNIST, STEYNONLINE.COM: Yes. That's - that's  interesting. The Boston Globe is saying you - to Elizabeth Warren, you have  to know when not to run. And this is the paper that's wanted her to run  until she took--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: --until she got head-faked into taking this DNA test that showed she  was 1/1024th Native American, which is less Native American than the  average. </p><p> I mean you could test Kim Jong-un, Vladimir Putin, and they would - they  would be more than 1/1024th Native American just because some Cherokee  happened to change trains in Odessa in - in 1852, and got lucky with one of  the porters. </p><p> I mean any - every - anyone's more Native American. And what's fascinating- -</p><p> CARLSON: Ha-ha.</p><p> STEYN: --what's fascinating about this is that this - Elizabeth Warren was  a test on the limits of Democrat identity politics because their recent  presidential candidates have been sold on identity politics, but in rather  strange ways. </p><p> So, Barack Obama is an African-American. But he has nothing to do with the  Black slave experience or Civil Rights.</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> STEYN: He's - he's Black just because his father happened to be a British  subject born in Colonial Kenya. Barack Obama was actually the first child  of British subjects to be President, I believe, since Andrew Jackson. So,  he tried to get himself in on the colonial thing. </p><p> Obama said his step-grandfather in Indonesia had died fighting Dutch  soldiers in the struggle for independence. In fact, it turned out his step- grandfather died when he fell off a chair while changing the drapes. That's  not a joke. That's actually true. That's how his step-grandfather died.</p><p> Then you have Hillary Clinton, who's running as a feminist icon and is, in  fact, only the candidate because she's the wife of the previous guy, and  she was given a Senate seat as a reward for standing by him, when his  intern's dress wound up in the FBI crime analysis lab - lab.</p><p> So, we have very--</p><p> CARLSON: Ha-ha.</p><p> STEYN: --so in such a world, you can't blame Elizabeth Warren for saying,  \"Well, if Hillary could be a feminist icon, why can't I be the first Native  American President?\" </p><p> She was Harvard Law School's first woman of color. That's why it's not a  family law thing. She actually was promoted as Harvard Law School's first  woman of color. Why shouldn't she be America's first - first Native  American President?</p><p> CARLSON: Such a good (ph)--</p><p> STEYN: Since this is (ph)-- </p><p> CARLSON: --such a good example (ph).</p><p> STEYN: --none - none of this identity politics. Joe Biden should run as the  first transgender woman candidate and dare the Democrat electorate to call  him on it.</p><p> CARLSON: That was my plan.</p><p> STEYN: I mean this is this (ph)--</p><p> CARLSON: I hope he doesn't get there first.</p><p> STEYN: --no don't (ph)--</p><p> CARLSON: I'm doing that (ph). You're the best.</p><p> STEYN: Yes (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: Mark Steyn, we're out of time.</p><p> STEYN: Thanks a lot, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: I loved it. Thank you.</p><p> STEYN: Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: Man that was fun. Back tomorrow, 8 P.M., show that is the sworn  enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and, especially, groupthink. Good night  from Washington. Sean Hannity.</p><p> END </p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

If you've been watching television recently, you've probably heard the bad  news. The Trump Administration is over, toast, cooked, done for good, and  along with it any hope of the middle-class revolution that 63 million  Americans voted for two years ago.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The reason for this tragedy is simple. The President has been caught  committing felonies. Here's what the legal experts without law degrees are  saying on television.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LAWRENCE O'DONNELL, THE LAST WORD WITH LAWRENCE O'DONNELL HOST, MSNBC: If  precedent means anything in the Trump era, Donald Trump will be, must be,  impeached because of the crimes prosecutors say he committed in the Michael  Cohen case.</p><p>ROBERT E. MOOK, FORMER POLITICAL CAMPAIGN STRATEGIST AND CAMPAIGN  MANAGER,  CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Both parties need to get on board to pass  articles of impeachment.</p><p>EDDIE GLAUDE, CHAIR, CENTER FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN STUDIES: You have  conspiracy, you have - you have obstruction, you have campaigns finance and  you have emoluments. </p><p>If the Democrats do not pursue this vigorously, they will be, in some ways,  held accountable for abdicating their responsibility.</p><p>It goes to the moral question, the ethical question. Democracy is at stake.</p><p>MAXINE MOORE WATERS, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR CALIFORNIA'S 43RD  CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, DEMOCRATIC PARTY MEMBER: This criminal must be  brought up by the Congress of the United States for impeachment.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CARLSON: We're not even (ph) going to show you the Don Lemon tape. There's  a lot of emotion there. But to sum up, they're telling us that we're  staring down the barrel of a constitutional crisis. And that crisis stems  from what MSNBC describes as, quote, the crimes prosecutors say the  President committed in the Michael Cohen case.</p><p>Which crimes were those? We have the answer. The relevant details were  spelled out in a piece that ran over the weekend in The New York Times  under this headline. \"Prosecutors say Trump directed illegal payments  during campaign.\"</p><p>The gist of the story is this. Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, has  told federal prosecutors that he facilitated payments to two women who said  they had affairs with Donald Trump. And then, well actually that's it.  That's the entire story right there.</p><p>Paying these two women, say federal prosecutors and their flacks at NBC  News, was a serious crime, a crime worthy of impeachment, if not,  indictment. OK. But you might be wondering, how exactly is that criminal?  Well, we're going to explain it to you.</p><p>We're going to start by stipulating that everything Michael Cohen has told  the feds is absolutely true. Now, assuming honesty isn't usually a wise  idea with Michael Cohen, but for the sake of argument, let's do it in this  case, everything he says is true, why is what Cohen is alleging a criminal  offense?</p><p>Remember the facts of the story. These are undisputed. Two women approached  Donald Trump and threatened to ruin his career and humiliate his family if  he doesn't give them money. Now, that sounds like a classic case of  extortion.</p><p>Yet, for whatever reason, Trump caves to it, and he directs Michael Cohen  to pay the ransom. Now, more than two years later, Trump is a felon for  doing this. It doesn't seem to make any sense.</p><p>Oh, but you're not a federal prosecutor on a political mission. If you were  a federal prosecutor on a political mission, you would construe those  extortion payments as campaign contributions. You'd do this even though the  money in question did not come from or go to Donald Trump's presidential  campaign.</p><p>Then you'd claim that Trump and Michael Cohen violated campaign finance law  because they didn't publicly disclose those payments despite the fact that  disclosing them would nullify the reason for making them in the first  place, which was to keep the whole thing secret.</p><p>That is the argument you would make, both in federal court and through your  proxies on cable television. It is insultingly stupid. But because everyone  in power hates the target of your investigation, nobody would question you,  and that's what's happening right now.</p><p>Now, by this reasoning, any money a political candidate spends to maintain  or protect his image while running for office now qualifies as a regulated  campaign donation, and has to be disclosed. That would include, by the way,  in addition to an infinite number of other things, buying toothpaste and  getting a haircut.</p><p>It would definitely include the taxpayer-financed slush fund that Congress  has set aside to pay off its own sexual harassment claims. Yes, those now  qualify as campaign contributions. They must be publicly disclosed, except,  of course, they're not publicly disclosed, and they never will be. Why is  that?</p><p>Well that might be a question for Congressional leaders including, now that  we think about it, Congressman Adam Schiff of Burbank, California. He's the  incoming Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, a very powerful man  in the Congress. </p><p>What does Mr. Schiff have to say about Congress not disclosing the very  same payments that Democrats say Trump should be impeached for not  disclosing? Let's ask him.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ADAM BENNETT SCHIFF, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR CALIFORNIA'S 28TH  CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, DEMOCRATIC PARTY MEMBER: There's a very real  prospect that on the day Donald Trump leaves office the Justice Department  may indict him that he may be the first president in quite some time to  face the real prospect of jail time.</p><p>NEAL KUMAR KATYAL, LAWYER, FORMER ACTING SOLICITOR GENERAL OF THE UNITED  STATES, LAW PROFESSOR AT GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY: Trump knows that he's  facing some pretty strong criminal liability when he leaves office, one way  or another. And, you know, even if a (ph) sitting president can't be  indicted, he's got to know his future looks like it's behind bars unless he  cuts some sort of deal with the prosecutors.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: So to translate, Trump's a criminal. He's going to jail for  committing a smaller version of the same made-up crime that we in Congress  have committed for years and forced you to pay for. </p><p>And, by the way, we're never apologizing for that because we don't have to  and CNN isn't going to make us. Screw you, America, and your stupid  election. We are in charge. That's the real message here, in case you  missed it.</p><p>Chris Hahn is a radio host and former aide to Senator Chuck Schumer, and he  joins us tonight. </p><p>So, Chris, I think you don't like Trump but that's fine. But speak slowly  so I can understand. Explain to me why paying off someone who is extorting  you, threatening to make public details of your personal life, if she  doesn't get paid, why paying that person is a felony?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER HAHN, AMERICAN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, DEMOCRATIC PARTY  ACTIVIST, RADIO SHOW HOST, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, first of all, we  don't know that there was actual extortion here. We know that a payment was  made. There was a catch and kill deal with the National Enquirer. Whether  or not it was extortion, that hasn't been proven yet, nor has it even  really been alleged in many cases--</p><p>CARLSON: Well, I'm--</p><p>HAHN: --by the President. He's not saying--</p><p>CARLSON: --I'm alleging, I'm - hold on, let me--</p><p>HAHN: --he's not say--</p><p>CARLSON: --let me just stop and say, I'm alleging it because it's obvious.  You're not going to pay a $100,000 or a $150,000 or $200,000 to someone  unless there's a threat to you and your reputation. This is extortion. </p><p>And I don't - I don't know why it's not being prosecuted. I don't know - I  don't know why Trump isn't defending himself on those grounds, I would. But  it clearly is extortion.</p><p>HAHN: Well--</p><p>CARLSON: But why is it a crime to pay off--</p><p>HAHN: --well sometimes people want--</p><p>CARLSON: --someone-- </p><p>HAHN: --sometimes people--</p><p>CARLSON: --who you had an affair with?</p><p>HAHN: --sometimes people want to tell us - they want to tell a story that  he doesn't want told. He said--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>HAHN: --hey, just tell it to me. I'll pay for it and--</p><p>CARLSON: That's extortion. It's--</p><p>HAHN: --and pay for yourselves (ph). That's what he did--</p><p>CARLSON: --that's - that's what - if I did that to you-- </p><p>HAHN: --in this situation.</p><p>CARLSON: --you would call it - if I said, \"Look, I know a detail about your  sex life, Chris Hahn, and I'm going to tell it on my show on TV unless you  pay me,\" that would be extortion, obviously. So, this is extortion. But  leaving that aside, why is it a felony to pay women you've had sexual  relationships with?</p><p>HAHN: It's not a felony. It's a felony to--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh.</p><p>HAHN: --do a campaign expenditure and not - and not disclose it, and that's  what this has been.</p><p>CARLSON: How is that a campaign expenditure?</p><p>HAHN: This seems to have been a campaign - he - he made this during the  campaign for the purposes of the campaign. There are tape recordings of him  discussing this with Michael Cohen. And that's just one--</p><p>CARLSON: Well, for the purposes of the campaign, I'm - wait--</p><p>HAHN: --look, this isn't even the - this is just a--</p><p>CARLSON: --no, but, wait, hold on, wait, hold on, I'm confused. No, it's  not a small thing. It's the thing. This is the crime that The New York Time  told us on Saturday, federal prosecutors are alleging the President  committed, it's a felony, and Michael Cohen pled guilty--</p><p>HAHN: Well they also--</p><p>CARLSON: --to a species of this. So, I just want to get to the bottom of  it. Why is that a campaign--</p><p>HAHN: Well, they're also alleging--</p><p>CARLSON: --contribution to pay off a former girlfriend? I'm honestly  confused. You're a campaign guy, tell me.</p><p>HAHN: They're - look, there's also an allegation that he may have violated  the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act when he was doing his deal in Moscow.</p><p>CARLSON: Well there are (ph) allegations that he killed Kennedy.</p><p>HAHN: There are a lot more to this than just paying off--</p><p>CARLSON: But I want - but hold on, no, no, no, no - </p><p>HAHN: --there's - there's a lot--</p><p>CARLSON: --OK--</p><p>HAHN: --there's a lot more to this than just paying off--</p><p>CARLSON: --OK, well how about one allegation--</p><p>HAHN: --porn stars who he slept with--</p><p>CARLSON: --slow down (ph), one allegation--</p><p>HAHN: --you know, a couple years ago.</p><p>CARLSON: --one allegation at a time. So, federal prosecutors--</p><p>HAHN: OK.</p><p>CARLSON: --this is not just something that dumb people on TV are talking  about, though they are. This is something that--</p><p>HAHN: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --prosecutors in New York State are saying they have, apparently,  evidence to indict over. So, tell me why because lot of people in - in  Washington pay off their girlfriends, including lots of people in Congress,  a lot of people in Congress, including I, even, guess some Democrats, just  throwing that out there. So, tell me why that's a campaign--</p><p>HAHN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --contribution to pay off your girlfriend?</p><p>HAHN: Well, first of all, I think that fund that Congress was using to pay  people off who were harassed needs to be disclosed and the Members who were  involved with those disclosure decisions need to be removed--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, I'm sure that'll happen right away. That'll happen right away.</p><p>HAHN: --from Congress right now. OK. I--</p><p>CARLSON: I'm sure MSNBC will push--</p><p>HAHN: I agree with you - I agree with you on that.</p><p>CARLSON: --real hard for that. Right, OK so but--</p><p>HAHN: I - I agree with you on--</p><p>CARLSON: --but tell me why it's a campaign--</p><p>HAHN: --I agree with you on that point.</p><p>CARLSON: --this is central question. Why is it and for all of us--</p><p>HAHN: Well, look, well--</p><p>CARLSON: --why is that a campaign contribution?</p><p>HAHN: --well here's the thing.</p><p>CARLSON: The money didn't come from the campaign. It didn't go to the  campaign. It was a threat to his reputation and his livelihood, as all  extortion is, right? So, why is that a campaign--</p><p>HAHN: There's black--</p><p>CARLSON: --contribution?</p><p>HAHN: --there's black letter law. There's black letter law here, OK?</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Well what is it?</p><p>HAHN: The campaign finance law is pretty clear about what you can and  cannot do with funds. And these funds were not necessarily from Trump's own  pockets. There was all sorts of schemes put together by the President and  Michael Cohen to move this money around, so it wasn't traced back to - to -  to President Trump.</p><p>CARLSON: But - but hold on, no--</p><p>HAHN: That in and of itself should--</p><p>CARLSON: --no, no, no, no, no--</p><p>HAHN: --raise red flags. You would be--</p><p>CARLSON: --no, no, you know, wait, stop, stop, stop, stop, no, no, no, no--</p><p>HAHN: --people would be blowing their mind off right now--</p><p>CARLSON: --wait, wait, stop, stop, stop, stop--</p><p>HAHN: --if you're (ph) the President.</p><p>CARLSON: --maybe. I mean we've never had a president like Trump in a  million different ways. And I'm not defending--</p><p>HAHN: No, we never have.</p><p>CARLSON: --I'm not defending his personal life. I'm merely saying--</p><p>HAHN: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --this is now being described as a felony, as a crime for which  the President could be removed. So, now is the time when we need to be very  specific about what the crime is because you're - you've stopped all  business of government, so we can respond to this. So, let's respond right  now. Tell me how and where--</p><p>HAHN: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --in campaign finance law it says, you're not allowed to use your  money, there's no allegation this was campaign money, your money to pay off  a former girlfriend? There isn't and that's this made-up (ph)--</p><p>HAHN: Oh, this is not--</p><p>CARLSON: --it's a lie--</p><p>HAHN: --the allegation here is not--</p><p>CARLSON: --actually.</p><p>HAHN: --the allegation here is not that it's just his money. There's  allegation that he moved money around through various schemes--</p><p>CARLSON: No, but not - they're not from the campaign--</p><p>HAHN: --to pay these women off--</p><p>CARLSON: --no, but, by the way--</p><p>HAHN: --including with the (ph) man who--</p><p>CARLSON: --you're allowed to do that too.</p><p>HAHN: --hold on a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait--</p><p>CARLSON: You're allowed to hide the payments.</p><p>HAHN: --he hid the payments--</p><p>CARLSON: What, is that a crime now--</p><p>HAHN: --that was campaign in nature--</p><p>CARLSON: --if it's your money?</p><p>HAHN: --that is a violation of--</p><p>CARLSON: Why does a campaign and (ph)--</p><p>HAHN: --a clear violation of campaign finance laws.</p><p>CARLSON: --hold on till then (ph), I'm giving you a chance on TV--</p><p>HAHN: It needed to be disclosed--</p><p>CARLSON: --hold on, hold on. No, no, just I'll let you speak and I'll let  you speak slowly--</p><p>HAHN: Go ahead.</p><p>CARLSON: --so our audience can understand. Where in campaign finance law  does it say that taking money that's not from your political campaign to  respond to an extortion attempt to pay off your girlfriend or pay the  gardener, pay anybody, why is that a felony? And where does it say that?</p><p>HAHN: Camp--</p><p>CARLSON: What are you talking about?</p><p>HAHN: --campaign finance law - look, I'm not going to quote the section and  verse. I don't know it off the top of my head--</p><p>CARLSON: Paraphrase it for me.</p><p>HAHN: --even though I'm a lawyer. Campaign finance - campaign finance law  clearly states that any money spent for campaign purposes, specifically by  people other than the candidate, must be disclosed. This is what's--</p><p>CARLSON: But why is that a campaign--</p><p>HAHN: --being alleged right here--</p><p>CARLSON: --purpose?</p><p>HAHN: --hold on, hold on, hold on--</p><p>CARLSON: What (ph)?</p><p>HAHN: --the President and Michael Cohen clearly set up a scheme so that  other people could pay these women off on behalf of Donald Trump while he  was running--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. OK. That--</p><p>HAHN: --for President because--</p><p>CARLSON: --that's fine but--</p><p>HAHN: --they thought that these (ph) allegations would sink his campaign  and his reputation.</p><p>CARLSON: But - but maybe - maybe under--</p><p>HAHN: That's a violation.</p><p>CARLSON: --no, actually, because anybody faced, I'm not, you know, I don't  know a single man who faced with that allegation, who he (ph) thought he  could squelch it wouldn't pay the person off because it does incalculable  damage to your reputation, whether you're running for anything or not. </p><p>And so, that's - it's so clearly not a campaign violation that I wonder if  we want to set this precedent. Do you want to live in a world where people  paying off extortion attempts are now campaign finance felons? I mean this  is lunatic.</p><p>HAHN: This is strike--</p><p>CARLSON: And you know it.</p><p>HAHN: --this - this is strikingly similar to what happened to John Edwards.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, and it's awful. It's awful what happened to--</p><p>HAHN: I'm not saying the President will be convicted but--</p><p>CARLSON: --John Edwards--</p><p>HAHN: --this is strikingly--</p><p>CARLSON: --I thought.</p><p>HAHN: --similar--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, it is. It is.</p><p>HAHN: --situation.</p><p>CARLSON: And what happened to him was--</p><p>HAHN: And it is something, look--</p><p>CARLSON: --wrong. It was another populace--</p><p>HAHN: --well--</p><p>CARLSON: --they took out with this BS campaign finance nonsense, exactly  what happened.</p><p>HAHN: --look, it is more than--</p><p>CARLSON: And, you know (ph), we're out of time.</p><p>HAHN: --campaign finance law.</p><p>CARLSON: --no.</p><p>HAHN: It's more than campaign finance law.</p><p>CARLSON: No, it's not.</p><p>HAHN: It is the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.</p><p>CARLSON: No, it's a totally separate thing.</p><p>HAHN: That in and of itself is a problem-- </p><p>CARLSON: Look, if - if he violated that I will (ph) defend it.</p><p>HAHN: Well, yes. And then (ph) also alleged by Cohen is--</p><p>CARLSON: But in this case, this is made-up.</p><p>HAHN: --also part of this.</p><p>CARLSON: All right, Chris Hahn, thank you.</p><p>HAHN: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Good to see you.</p><p>One of the most hysterical reactions in the past few days came from a  former Obama Administration U.S. Attorney, who says the President should be  stripped of his office.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARBARA MCQUADE, FORMER UNITED STATES ATTORNEY FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT  OF  MICHIGAN, PROFESSOR OF LAW AT UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN LAW SCHOOL, LEGAL  ANALYST FOR NBC NEWS AND MSNBC: It could be that President Trump procured  the presidency by fraud. </p><p>When immigrants procure their citizenship by fraud, we strip them of their  citizenship. When a president procures his presidency by fraud, should we  consider doing the same?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Alan Dershowitz is, of course, a retired Harvard Law School  professor. He's the Author of the book, The Case Against Impeaching Trump,  and he joins us tonight.</p><p>Professor, I got a couple questions. But the first relates just to the  sound bite we played. Is there a provision in the Constitution for  stripping, whatever that means, stripping the presidency from a President  who you think is illegitimate, whatever that means?</p><p>ALAN MORTON DERSHOWITZ, LAWYER, THE CASE AGAINST IMPEACHING TRUMP  AUTHOR,  HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR EMERITUS: Sure. It's called the 25th Amendment, but  not on the grounds of illegitimacy. I want everyone out there to imagine  the following scenario. </p><p>Let's assume when Bill Clinton was running for president, Paula Jones came  up to him and said, \"Unless you pay me a $130,000, I'll reveal our affair.\" </p><p>And let's assume, Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, together, did exactly  what it's alleged that Donald Trump and Cohen did together, I guarantee you  The New York Times, NBC, MSNBC would be railing against any prosecutor who  dared to suggest that this was a violation of the campaign (ph) finance  law. Everybody would be on the other side of this issue. </p><p>There'd be Republicans out there saying, \"Strip him of the presidency,  impeach him, indict him.\" Every Democrat would be saying this is a witch- hunt, this is terrible. We need a single standard. If you wouldn't go after  Bill Clinton, don't go after Donald Trump. </p><p>If you're going after Donald Trump, then you have to go after Hillary  Clinton for everything that she allegedly did. For example, one of your  guests talked about a Federal Corrupt Practices Act. That applies when you  bribe a foreign official.</p><p>What they're arguing is that there was a rumor that maybe somebody offered  Putin a penthouse in a Tower that Trump was thinking of building in Moscow.  And if that had been done, it would be a violation of the FCPA, Federal  Corrupt Practices Act. </p><p>But it's all based on hypotheticals and maybes. And I just want everybody  to apply the shoe on the other foot test. If Hillary Clinton were  president, the Republicans were saying, \"Lock her up,\" everybody would be  on the other side. They'd be screaming about how dare you expand criminal  statutes, how dare you expand the criteria for impeachment? </p><p>Now, all these liberal Democrat fair-weather civil libertarians are saying,  \"The hell with the Constitution, the hell with civil liberties, put all  that aside, get Trump.\" That's the most important consideration. Get him by  any means possible. This is such a danger to our constitutional system that  I would hope that true civil libertarians would rebel against that, as I  am.</p><p>CARLSON: Is - is it unfair to describe this scenario as extortion? I say I  know something about your sex life. I know a secret about you that you want  to keep the - that's non-criminal (ph), but that you want to keep hidden.  And unless you pay me money, I'm going to reveal it. That seems like  textbook extortion to me. Why is it not?</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: It is absolutely textbook extortion. And there ought to be a  prosecution of any person, man or woman, who approaches any candidate or  anybody else and says, \"Unless you pay me money, I'm going to reveal a sex  act that occurred.\" That is absolute classic extortion. </p><p>And it's shocking that the Special Counsel looking into this, who has a  broad mandate, he described it very broadly, isn't looking into the  extortion committed by, at least, the porn star, whose lawyer obviously  approached the candidate or the candidate's people, and threatened  exposure.</p><p>Otherwise, why would you pay? Just listen to the tape. The tape makes that  clear. The tape that Cohen made unwittingly of President Trump, it's clear  that they were paying off an extortion--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: --in order to prevent these issues from coming out for multiple  reasons, to protect his family, to protect his brand--</p><p>CARLSON: Sure.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: --possibly, to influence the campaign. </p><p>Let's remember one more thing. A President can contribute to a candidate as  much as he wants. If - if Bloomberg runs for president, he could announce  tomorrow, \"I'm not taking a nickel. I'm putting $1 billion of my own money  into this campaign.\" </p><p>That's perfectly legitimate. As far as reporting is concerned, it's the  campaign that has to report. And if these payments had to be reported, they  had to be reported after the election, the reporting time was after the  election so, it couldn't have impacted the election.</p><p>So, the absurd notion that he won the presidency by fraud and should be  stripped of the presidency (ph) reflects incredible ignorance about the  timing here, and how these statutes operate.</p><p>CARLSON: This is getting so crazy, it's - it's making my head spin. I  appreciate your coming on and explaining that to us, professor. Thank you  very much.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Well we've been saying it for a couple of years. Now, we have hard  scientific evidence that, in fact, big tech is altering and harming the  brains of children. Is it time to do something about that? What if we knew  it was true? Well we do know it's true now. We've got details next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TEXT: TECH TYRANNY.</p><p>CARLSON: Well Google collects more data than probably any other company,  and probably knows more about you than you do. You think this might raise  some concerns about the concentration of power. </p><p>But, for years, Congress seems to have cared not at all either because they  were ideologically predisposed to Google or because they were in its  pocket. Meanwhile, Google became more and more powerful, ominously  powerful. </p><p>Now, finally, during the lame-duck session, Congress has summoned the CEO  of Google, Sundar Pichai, to answer some questions about data transparency,  coming to Capitol Hill this week. What should Congress ask him about?</p><p>Harmeet Dhillon has followed this issue maybe more closely than any other  attorney in the United States, and she joins us tonight. Harmeet, thank you  very much for coming on. So what--</p><p>HARMEET DHILLON, AMERICAN LAWYER, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL LAWYERS  ASSOCIATION  BOARD MEMBER, FORMER VICE CHAIRWOMAN OF THE CALIFORNIA REPUBLICAN PARTY,  AND THE NATIONAL COMMITTEEWOMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE  FOR  CALIFORNIA: Hi, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: --what should be the - the list of questions?</p><p>DHILLON: Well, this is only a subset of the issues that people should be  asking Google that is the subject of the testimony tomorrow. But Google,  for years, as you pointed out, has been collecting data, and not disclosing  to users, number one, the extent of the collection of the data or what  they're doing with the data.</p><p>We have also learned of significant breaches, including today, an  announcement of a major breach of 52.5 million users on the Google+ failed  experiment in social media. It's not clear when that happened. </p><p>Google is not disclosing to people exactly what happened and what use has  been made of it. And they, as you pointed out, they just get away with it,  because we have both effete politicians in Washington, even on the  Republican side, and government agencies whose tasks it is to examine these  issues, and protect consumers. So, consumers are really at a complete loss. </p><p>Now, what I expect to happen on Capitol Hill tomorrow is that there'll be  some posturing questions written by staffers that Members of Congress are  going to read out, and you're going to have some focus group tested  jargony, you know, in - incomprehensible responses from Sundar Pichai  designed to placate these folks.</p><p>There'll be a little bit of a dance and everybody will go home, not  understanding what the answers were, and not probably going to do anything  about it. And this is a real tragedy and missed opportunity, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: What a shame? I want to (ph) ask you another story, another  element of the Google story. </p><p>Newly leaked email show that several Google employees plotted to destroy  the news site, Breitbart, after the 2016 election, a secret internal  discussion group labeled Resist. Google employees discussed how they could  use the, quote, hate speech and fake news labels to justify cutting off  Breitbart's ad revenues.</p><p>Harmeet, this is kind of the stuff of Conservative fever dreams that Google  would be actually doing something like this. Are you surprised by it? And  what can be done, in response?</p><p>DHILLON: Well Google - A, I'm not surprised. B, Google is denying it. But  there's extensive evidence that Google did this, and they did it in two  ways. </p><p>One way is right after the election, as you mentioned, a number of very  excitable Left-wing Google executives and employees tried to squeeze  Breitbart and other Conservative outlets into this hate speech category.</p><p>They then confessed that after a lot of effort that was really tough. So,  they also did a two-pronged approach, and the other side of that approach  is having their ad people contact customers and tell them that it might be  dangerous or a bad idea to advertise or allow their ads to be placed on  Conservative news websites like Breitbart and others.</p><p>And they pointed to some outside groups like Sleeping Giant that makes it a  - a business practice of defaming Conservative writers and organizations,  and use that as a smear. </p><p>Google also does this in many other ways like through its YouTube. It  categorizes content as sensitive, which automatically, both, makes it hard  to find the content online, and also strips that content from the ability  to gain advertising revenue.</p><p>So, Google is doing this systematically. Google is doing this purposefully.  Google is getting away with doing this. And I think it violates not just  some laws, including Communications Decency Act and others, but it - it  violates state laws that have to do with fraud and transparency, unfair  business practices and competition.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>DHILLON: Again, Google is able to get away with this because, you know,  they - they contribute to some Conservative groups like CPAC, lot of money  to show up at CPAC, and - and certainly on Capitol Hill. </p><p>They get away with it, and we see nothing done to control this - this, you  know, duopoly and monopoly on advertising revenue. It's very dangerous  because it's shaping what young people in America, who mainly get their  news through--</p><p>CARLSON: Of course.</p><p>DHILLON: --Google see every day.</p><p>CARLSON: Looking back, the Congress allowing Google to become more powerful  than the U.S. government, subverting our democracy entirely, that'll be the  thing we hold Members responsible for, I think, historically. </p><p>Harmeet Dhillon, you will not be held responsible since you're a lonely  voice on the right side, thank you for joining us, as always.</p><p>DHILLON: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Meanwhile, we've been saying it for years. Now, there is hard  scientific evidence that big tech is, in fact, harming our children. </p><p>New 60 Minutes report this week highlighted research that shows children  who use tablet smartphones and other screens more than seven hours a day,  and that's a lot of kids, believe it or not, are developing different brain  structures. Their brains are being damaged by this. </p><p>Tom Kersting is a psychotherapist, who's written extensively on this  subject, and he joins us tonight. You must feel vindicated by this report,  Tom.</p><p>TOM KERSTING, PSYCHOTHERAPIST, DISCONNECTED AUTHOR: I do. I do. I'm  actually happy to see it, to be honest with you because--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --it's something I've been speaking about for so many years at  lectures and in my book. And now, we could finally have some scientific  preliminary evidence showing exactly what all of this tech is doing to the  brain.</p><p>CARLSON: So, what is it doing?</p><p>KERSTING: Well, first of all, the area of the brain called the cortex,  which is the outer layer of the brain, the preliminary study that the - the  research has conducted, shows a - a premature thinning of that part of the  brain, OK, which is - which is kind of frightening, considering the  importance of that part of the brain, what it does, how it's very important  just for human beings in terms of organizing, planning, and a host of other  different things.</p><p>Another component that you don't hear much about is something called  neuroplasticity, which is actually the greatest breakthrough in modern day  psychology. And the term plasticity meaning that the brain, although very  strong and rigid, can be molded and shaped if placed in - in the right  environment for three or more hours per day. </p><p>We know that the average kid is spending nine hours a day, on average, in  what I consider to be the most highly stimulating of worlds. And what  happens is the brain will actually grow new neural pathways, it'll re- organize its circuitry to adapt to that cyber world.</p><p>And the problem is what I'm seeing clinically is an unadapting of - of  young kids in a real world having a very difficult time coping with just  the trivial nuances of life, the anxiety disorders, the depressions, and so  forth.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. Well and it's all kinds of measurements are showing the  horrifying results of it. How young, exactly, are kids getting addicted?</p><p>KERSTING: Well, we're seeing right now that there's some - some research  that came out recently that there - there's the kids as - as young as two  years old showing signs of depression. And, right now, the average age for  first smartphone issuance is about age 10.</p><p>And, you know, when I give lectures, every parent knows that this is bad.  But it's sort of, you know, what you talk about it you love (ph) the - the  term groupthink. I - I use the term social conformity. </p><p>We tend to do what everybody else is doing. And parents, anybody listening,  you have got to do what is in the best interest of your child, not - not  what everybody else around you is doing.</p><p>CARLSON: So, can you just give me the 20-second answer to the question I  always ask you, which is why are we so passive in the face of this? If two- year-olds were huffing on Marlboros, we'd say, \"You know what? No, not  allowed.\" But we just sort of sit back and let our society collapse in the  face of this, why?</p><p>KERSTING: Well, the reason, in my opinion, the reason why is - and we talk  about - I always talk about common sense, all right? </p><p>It's pretty clear, if we go walk around and everybody's got their heads  buried in a device all day long, you pull up to a traffic light, and they  can't even contain themselves for a minute without looking at their device,  it's pretty clear that it's having an impact on their behavior.</p><p>Now, the reason why nobody is--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --doing anything about it is because we're always looking for  scientific evidence, all right, and now we have some of it, and we're going  to start seeing a lot more of it. And--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --and we're going to start seeing some changes, as a result,  Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, and it's we waited too long for the studies to confirm the  obvious. Tom, thank you very much.</p><p>KERSTING: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, Hollywood doesn't need to remake 1984 again, not that they  would, it's probably illegal. But they already do a perfect job of  replicating it in real life. They are living the plotline of George  Orwell's novel. Kevin Hart is the latest person to be destroyed for  statements that he made many years ago. We'll tell you his story after the  break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TEXT: AMERICA'S NEWS HQ.</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Live from America's News  headquarters, I'm Trace Gallagher.</p><p>No bail decision yet for a top Chinese executive who's facing possible  extradition from Canada to the U.S. The case of Meng Wanzhou has fueled  U.S.-China trade tensions and rocked financial markets.</p><p>Meng is the Chief Financial Officer of telecommunications giant, Huawei.  She was detained December 1st during a layover in Vancouver. She's accused  of misleading banks about the company's business dealings in Iran. </p><p>There is a concerning uptick in paralyzing illness among children. The  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now says there have been more  cases than ever. There are a 158 confirmed cases so far this year. </p><p>The illness called acute flaccid myelitis causes paralysis in the face,  neck, back, arms or legs. The symptoms usually come a week following a  fever and respiratory illness. </p><p>I'm Trace Gallagher, now back to Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Hollywood has issued a new decree. And, of course, everyone obeyed  immediately. Kevin Hart's career must be destroyed. </p><p>Just days after the Comedian was announced as the next Host of the Oscars,  the now-irrelevant awards show some people still watch, Hart was forced to  step down over tweets and stand-up routines from about a decade ago that  some said were anti-gay.</p><p>Now, these tweets had already come to light. Hart had already apologized  for them and said he was changing his routine, but it didn't matter. In  today's political environment, there is no such thing as forgiveness or  mercy. What you're seeing is, instead, a particularly powerful form of  bullying. Do and think exactly as we say, or else.</p><p>Larry Elder has fought the forces of conformity for a long time. He's a  radio show host from Los Angeles, and he joins us tonight. We're really  glad to have you, Larry Elder, thank you. So, what's the takeaway from  watching what just happened to Kevin Hart?</p><p>LARRY ELDER, RADIO SHOW HOST, WRITER, ATTORNEY: The takeaway, Tucker, is  what the devil are the rules. As you pointed out--</p><p>CARLSON: Right. I got it (ph).</p><p>ELDER: --Kevin Hart did these tweets some years ago and - and made anti-gay  references in his stand-up some years ago. He apologized back in 2015. The  Academy Award people wanted him to apologize again. He refused.</p><p>Now, the show is going to be carried by ABC. ABC parent company is Disney.  Disney also owns ESPN. They've employed Keith Olbermann, who is a - a Trump  hater from way back. And just last year, he tweeted that Trump was a Nazi  and dropped a bunch of F-bombs in his tweet. That didn't seem to bother  Disney. But Kevin Hart has to go.</p><p>The other inconsistency, of course, is that other comedians like Amy  Schumer, who last year, I think it was, hosted a Democratic fundraiser, has  used the - the F-word for gays in a tweet, as has Sarah Silverman, as has  Chelsea Handler, all of whom have hosted shows.</p><p>And finally, you have the instance of Joy Ann Reid on MSNBC who had a blog  2007, 2008--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>ELDER: --a very anti-gay post she made, and she wasn't joking, she wasn't a  comedian, including dissing the movie Brokeback Mountain, and said she  hated watching men kiss. She then said she apologized. </p><p>Then, later on, she said she was hacked. NBC did a search to find out  whether or not she'd been hacked. Turned out she wasn't hacked. So, she  either misremembered or lied, and then apologized again. She has a show on  MSNBC. So, forgive Kevin Hart for not - for not knowing what the rules are.</p><p>CARLSON: Well that's and - so, but what's the best response? I think you're  absolutely right. All of us at some point are going to be accused of  thoughtcrime, and the mob will come for us. It's inevitable.</p><p>ELDER: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: How do we respond? What's the best way to respond?</p><p>ELDER: You do them on a case-by-case basis. The man apologized, said he had  grown. The - the most horrific tweet was saying that if he came home and  saw his son playing with his daughter's dollhouse, he'd break the dollhouse  over his head. He later on said, he apologized, he's grown as a man--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>ELDER: --and perhaps the tweet had to do with his own insecurities as a  man. So, I think that's what you do. You apologize, be sincere, and then  keep going. </p><p>But if people keep beating you over the - over the head over it over and  over again, they're not going to forgive you, I'm not sure what the point  is, which is why I believe that Kevin Hart was morally justified in saying,  I've already apologized, I'm not going to apologize again.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>ELDER: I'm a 40-year old man. I've apologized. I've grown, let it alone.</p><p>CARLSON: I mean what happens to a society where the mob feels it has  ultimate authority on judgment? No one believes in God, so they have to  make their own judgments, hard and fast judgments--</p><p>ELDER: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --and no forgiveness is allowed.</p><p>ELDER: Yes. And what happens to a society that's - that's so inconsistent?  For example, Kanye West--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>ELDER: --is being called an Uncle Tom and a Token, a House Negro. That  doesn't seem to bother anybody. </p><p>You got a guy in like Al Sharpton, who's got a show where he's referred to  gays as - as homos in the - in years past, Jews as interlopers. He - he  falsely accused a White man of raping a Black teenager, he has a show on  television, you know, every weekend.</p><p>So, you know, I'm not quite sure what to say, Tucker, other than it's  terribly inconsistent. It seem to me there's one rule for people who are  Conservative and one rule for people--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>ELDER: --who are on the Left.</p><p>CARLSON: I think it's best just to ignore the noise to the extent you can.  I mean they have an awful lot of power. You know, they'll de-platform you  in a second. Larry Elder--</p><p>ELDER: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --we're rooting for you.</p><p>ELDER: Thank you. I need--</p><p>CARLSON: If they ever try to leave you, you'd (ph)--</p><p>ELDER: --I could use the help.</p><p>CARLSON: --always have a home on this show. Good to see you.</p><p>ELDER: I could use the help. Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you.</p><p>Well China just launched a new persecution of the country's Christians.  Will anyone in Washington care? Are they too busy taking Chinese money?</p><p>Plus, Paris continues to be convulsed by the worst riots there in 50 years.  What are these riots about? You know what they're about. They're about the  Paris Climate Treaty, the spirit of it, anyway. And policies they want here  are being rejected by both Left and Right in France, and they're ignoring  it because it's too inconvenient to pay attention. Details ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TEXT: THE CHINA THREAT.</p><p>CARLSON: China has launched a new crackdown. How many news stories begin  with that sentence, \"China has launched a new crackdown?\" Many. And they  have, once again, launched new crackdown, this time, on their country's  underground Christian community.</p><p>In a coordinated sweep of nighttime raids, police rounded up about a 100  members and the pastor of the Early Rain Covenant Church. Because the  church does not submit to government control, it is illegal in China. And  members have been forbidden from attending services.</p><p>It's just the latest in a persecution wave that has shut down several  different churches with thousands of Christian members. This is what actual  religious oppression looks like, but a ruling class that's seen (ph) people  who boycott North Carolina over its bathroom laws don't care at all. </p><p>None of them are calling for boycotts or sanctions on China. There's no  witch-hunt against the countless universities, businesses, and lobbyists  with massive financial ties to China, and its authoritarian regime.</p><p>In fact, to our ruling class, China is the future. If anything, it's a  country we ought to emulate. So remember that, next time they try to  lecture you about how their values are better than yours.</p><p>The war in Afghanistan, as you well know, has continued for 17 years. It's  the longest war in the history of this country. We're still spending  billions there. American soldiers are still dying there. It might all be  worth it if we were still fighting for victory. But are we fighting for  victory?</p><p>In a newly leaked audiotape, former NATO Commander, Stanley McChrystal,  tells Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, how the war in Afghanistan should be  fought. </p><p>It's not exactly the opening speech from Patton. \"My best suggestion,\" he  says, \"Is to keep a limited number of forces there and just kind of muddle  along, and see what we can do.\"</p><p>Now, muddle along is not a strategy for anything, much less a victory. It's  a strategy to waste American money and lives for no reason at all. If U.S.  troops are going to muddle along in a war, maybe it's a sign that's a war  we shouldn't be fighting in the first place.</p><p>Well, if you can remember back a year-and-a-half, on June 1st, 2017, the  President announced he was pulling this country out of the Paris Climate  Accords. To hear the politicians and television news chintuggers (ph)  react, you'd think it was the worst natural catastrophe, well, ever.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NANCY PELOSI, MINORITY LEADER OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF  REPRESENTATIVES, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA: What happened yesterday on the  climate issue is an embarrassment to our country and it should be an  embarrassment to him personally for how he answers to his grandchildren.</p><p>GOV. JERRY BROWN (D), CALIFORNIA: People are going to die. Habitat will be  destroyed. Seas will rise. Insects will spread.</p><p>FAREED RAFIQ ZAKARIA, CNN'S FAREED ZAKARIA GPS HOST, POLITICAL SCIENTIST,  AUTHOR, COLUMNIST: This will be the day that the United States resigned as  the leader of the free world.</p><p>JOHN KERRY, FORMER UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE: He is not helping the  forgotten American. He is hurting them. Their kids will have worse asthma  in the summer.</p><p>The President who talked about putting America first has now put America  last.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: These people are so stupid. It's amazing they have jobs. The  economy must be pretty strong, in fact, if those people have health  insurance. One thing they said though is true. </p><p>People were hurt, but not because we pulled out, but because other  countries kept to the terms of the Paris Climate Accord, including France. </p><p>This fall, France began to implement a gas tax to fight climate change  inspired by that agreement. Now, for the fourth weekend in a row, the city  of Paris has been rocked by riots and mass protests. The city is burning  and shows no signs of stopping. </p><p>What did this? Progressive climate policy. Will the people who formulated  it ever admit it? Of course, not. They're too invested.</p><p>Well the press, all of a sudden, doing everything it can to kill Elizabeth  Warren's presidential campaign before it even begins. That's kind of  interesting. Is this a mercy killing or something else going on?</p><p>Mark Steyn joins us to unravel a delightful mystery, after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ELIZABETH ANN WARREN, SENIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, MASSACHUSETTS: Now, the  President likes to call my mom a liar. What do the facts say?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The facts suggest that you absolutely have a Native  American ancestor in your pedigree.</p><p>WARREN: OK.</p><p>And Trump can say whatever he wants about me, but mocking Native Americans  or any group in order to try to get at me? That's not what America stands  for.</p><p>I'm not enrolled in a tribe and only tribes determine tribal citizenship. I  understand and respect that distinction. But my family history is my family  history.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: I mean (ph) you really just can't watch that enough. It really  should be a screensaver. This hasn't, understatement of the day, been the  fall Elizabeth Warren had hoped for. </p><p>She thought that releasing a DNA test showing that she might have had a  lone American Indian ancestor, not necessarily from this continent, a few  hundred years ago would silence the President and give her momentum going  into the primaries next year.</p><p>Instead, even the Left is turning on her. Two pieces in the Washington Post  and The New York Times in the past week suggests that Warren's campaign has  been deeply, maybe even fatally, wounded by the blunder of the DNA test. </p><p>Looks almost like an effort to kill Elizabeth Warren's campaign before she  can embarrass her party, the one to which everyone in the media belongs,  before she actually runs.</p><p>Mark Steyn is an Author and Columnist. Not a conspiracy not, I'll run this  by him anyway. So, what is going on? </p><p>So, obviously, she is a media creation, not a genius, but she has been the  subject of endless fawning profiles in the press, particularly from the  Boston Globe, which has promoted her for years, and now they're attacking  her, why?</p><p>MARK STEYN, AUTHOR, COLUMNIST, STEYNONLINE.COM: Yes. That's - that's  interesting. The Boston Globe is saying you - to Elizabeth Warren, you have  to know when not to run. And this is the paper that's wanted her to run  until she took--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --until she got head-faked into taking this DNA test that showed she  was 1/1024th Native American, which is less Native American than the  average. </p><p>I mean you could test Kim Jong-un, Vladimir Putin, and they would - they  would be more than 1/1024th Native American just because some Cherokee  happened to change trains in Odessa in - in 1852, and got lucky with one of  the porters. </p><p>I mean any - every - anyone's more Native American. And what's fascinating- -</p><p>CARLSON: Ha-ha.</p><p>STEYN: --what's fascinating about this is that this - Elizabeth Warren was  a test on the limits of Democrat identity politics because their recent  presidential candidates have been sold on identity politics, but in rather  strange ways. </p><p>So, Barack Obama is an African-American. But he has nothing to do with the  Black slave experience or Civil Rights.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>STEYN: He's - he's Black just because his father happened to be a British  subject born in Colonial Kenya. Barack Obama was actually the first child  of British subjects to be President, I believe, since Andrew Jackson. So,  he tried to get himself in on the colonial thing. </p><p>Obama said his step-grandfather in Indonesia had died fighting Dutch  soldiers in the struggle for independence. In fact, it turned out his step- grandfather died when he fell off a chair while changing the drapes. That's  not a joke. That's actually true. That's how his step-grandfather died.</p><p>Then you have Hillary Clinton, who's running as a feminist icon and is, in  fact, only the candidate because she's the wife of the previous guy, and  she was given a Senate seat as a reward for standing by him, when his  intern's dress wound up in the FBI crime analysis lab - lab.</p><p>So, we have very--</p><p>CARLSON: Ha-ha.</p><p>STEYN: --so in such a world, you can't blame Elizabeth Warren for saying,  \"Well, if Hillary could be a feminist icon, why can't I be the first Native  American President?\" </p><p>She was Harvard Law School's first woman of color. That's why it's not a  family law thing. She actually was promoted as Harvard Law School's first  woman of color. Why shouldn't she be America's first - first Native  American President?</p><p>CARLSON: Such a good (ph)--</p><p>STEYN: Since this is (ph)-- </p><p>CARLSON: --such a good example (ph).</p><p>STEYN: --none - none of this identity politics. Joe Biden should run as the  first transgender woman candidate and dare the Democrat electorate to call  him on it.</p><p>CARLSON: That was my plan.</p><p>STEYN: I mean this is this (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: I hope he doesn't get there first.</p><p>STEYN: --no don't (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: I'm doing that (ph). You're the best.</p><p>STEYN: Yes (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: Mark Steyn, we're out of time.</p><p>STEYN: Thanks a lot, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: I loved it. Thank you.</p><p>STEYN: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Man that was fun. Back tomorrow, 8 P.M., show that is the sworn  enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and, especially, groupthink. Good night  from Washington.

The Trump Administration is over, toast, cooked, done for good, and  along with it any hope of the middle-class revolution that 63 million  Americans voted for two years ago.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The reason for this tragedy is simple. The President has been caught  committing felonies. Here's what the legal experts without law degrees are  saying on television.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LAWRENCE O'DONNELL, THE LAST WORD WITH LAWRENCE O'DONNELL HOST, MSNBC: If  precedent means anything in the Trump era, Donald Trump will be, must be,  impeached because of the crimes prosecutors say he committed in the Michael  Cohen case.</p><p>ROBERT E. MOOK, FORMER POLITICAL CAMPAIGN STRATEGIST AND CAMPAIGN  MANAGER,  CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Both parties need to get on board to pass  articles of impeachment.</p><p>EDDIE GLAUDE, CHAIR, CENTER FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN STUDIES: You have  conspiracy, you have - you have obstruction, you have campaigns finance and  you have emoluments. </p><p>If the Democrats do not pursue this vigorously, they will be, in some ways,  held accountable for abdicating their responsibility.</p><p>It goes to the moral question, the ethical question. Democracy is at stake.</p><p>MAXINE MOORE WATERS, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR CALIFORNIA'S 43RD  CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, DEMOCRATIC PARTY MEMBER: This criminal must be  brought up by the Congress of the United States for impeachment.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CARLSON: We're not even (ph) going to show you the Don Lemon tape. There's  a lot of emotion there. But to sum up, they're telling us that we're  staring down the barrel of a constitutional crisis. And that crisis stems  from what MSNBC describes as, quote, the crimes prosecutors say the  President committed in the Michael Cohen case.</p><p>Which crimes were those? We have the answer. The relevant details were  spelled out in a piece that ran over the weekend in The New York Times  under this headline. \"Prosecutors say Trump directed illegal payments  during campaign.\"</p><p>The gist of the story is this. Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, has  told federal prosecutors that he facilitated payments to two women who said  they had affairs with Donald Trump. And then, well actually that's it.  That's the entire story right there.</p><p>Paying these two women, say federal prosecutors and their flacks at NBC  News, was a serious crime, a crime worthy of impeachment, if not,  indictment. OK. But you might be wondering, how exactly is that criminal?  Well, we're going to explain it to you.</p><p>We're going to start by stipulating that everything Michael Cohen has told  the feds is absolutely true. Now, assuming honesty isn't usually a wise  idea with Michael Cohen, but for the sake of argument, let's do it in this  case, everything he says is true, why is what Cohen is alleging a criminal  offense?</p><p>Remember the facts of the story. These are undisputed. Two women approached  Donald Trump and threatened to ruin his career and humiliate his family if  he doesn't give them money. Now, that sounds like a classic case of  extortion.</p><p>Yet, for whatever reason, Trump caves to it, and he directs Michael Cohen  to pay the ransom. Now, more than two years later, Trump is a felon for  doing this. It doesn't seem to make any sense.</p><p>Oh, but you're not a federal prosecutor on a political mission. If you were  a federal prosecutor on a political mission, you would construe those  extortion payments as campaign contributions. You'd do this even though the  money in question did not come from or go to Donald Trump's presidential  campaign.</p><p>Then you'd claim that Trump and Michael Cohen violated campaign finance law  because they didn't publicly disclose those payments despite the fact that  disclosing them would nullify the reason for making them in the first  place, which was to keep the whole thing secret.</p><p>That is the argument you would make, both in federal court and through your  proxies on cable television. It is insultingly stupid. But because everyone  in power hates the target of your investigation, nobody would question you,  and that's what's happening right now.</p><p>Now, by this reasoning, any money a political candidate spends to maintain  or protect his image while running for office now qualifies as a regulated  campaign donation, and has to be disclosed. That would include, by the way,  in addition to an infinite number of other things, buying toothpaste and  getting a haircut.</p><p>It would definitely include the taxpayer-financed slush fund that Congress  has set aside to pay off its own sexual harassment claims. Yes, those now  qualify as campaign contributions. They must be publicly disclosed, except,  of course, they're not publicly disclosed, and they never will be. Why is  that?</p><p>Well that might be a question for Congressional leaders including, now that  we think about it, Congressman Adam Schiff of Burbank, California. He's the  incoming Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, a very powerful man  in the Congress. </p><p>What does Mr. Schiff have to say about Congress not disclosing the very  same payments that Democrats say Trump should be impeached for not  disclosing? Let's ask him.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ADAM BENNETT SCHIFF, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR CALIFORNIA'S 28TH  CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, DEMOCRATIC PARTY MEMBER: There's a very real  prospect that on the day Donald Trump leaves office the Justice Department  may indict him that he may be the first president in quite some time to  face the real prospect of jail time.</p><p>NEAL KUMAR KATYAL, LAWYER, FORMER ACTING SOLICITOR GENERAL OF THE UNITED  STATES, LAW PROFESSOR AT GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY: Trump knows that he's  facing some pretty strong criminal liability when he leaves office, one way  or another. And, you know, even if a (ph) sitting president can't be  indicted, he's got to know his future looks like it's behind bars unless he  cuts some sort of deal with the prosecutors.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: So to translate, Trump's a criminal. He's going to jail for  committing a smaller version of the same made-up crime that we in Congress  have committed for years and forced you to pay for. </p><p>And, by the way, we're never apologizing for that because we don't have to  and CNN isn't going to make us. Screw you, America, and your stupid  election. We are in charge. That's the real message here, in case you  missed it.</p><p>Chris Hahn is a radio host and former aide to Senator Chuck Schumer, and he  joins us tonight. </p><p>So, Chris, I think you don't like Trump but that's fine. But speak slowly  so I can understand. Explain to me why paying off someone who is extorting  you, threatening to make public details of your personal life, if she  doesn't get paid, why paying that person is a felony?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER HAHN, AMERICAN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, DEMOCRATIC PARTY  ACTIVIST, RADIO SHOW HOST, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, first of all, we  don't know that there was actual extortion here. We know that a payment was  made. There was a catch and kill deal with the National Enquirer. Whether  or not it was extortion, that hasn't been proven yet, nor has it even  really been alleged in many cases--</p><p>CARLSON: Well, I'm--</p><p>HAHN: --by the President. He's not saying--</p><p>CARLSON: --I'm alleging, I'm - hold on, let me--</p><p>HAHN: --he's not say--</p><p>CARLSON: --let me just stop and say, I'm alleging it because it's obvious.  You're not going to pay a $100,000 or a $150,000 or $200,000 to someone  unless there's a threat to you and your reputation. This is extortion. </p><p>And I don't - I don't know why it's not being prosecuted. I don't know - I  don't know why Trump isn't defending himself on those grounds, I would. But  it clearly is extortion.</p><p>HAHN: Well--</p><p>CARLSON: But why is it a crime to pay off--</p><p>HAHN: --well sometimes people want--</p><p>CARLSON: --someone-- </p><p>HAHN: --sometimes people--</p><p>CARLSON: --who you had an affair with?</p><p>HAHN: --sometimes people want to tell us - they want to tell a story that  he doesn't want told. He said--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>HAHN: --hey, just tell it to me. I'll pay for it and--</p><p>CARLSON: That's extortion. It's--</p><p>HAHN: --and pay for yourselves (ph). That's what he did--</p><p>CARLSON: --that's - that's what - if I did that to you-- </p><p>HAHN: --in this situation.</p><p>CARLSON: --you would call it - if I said, \"Look, I know a detail about your  sex life, Chris Hahn, and I'm going to tell it on my show on TV unless you  pay me,\" that would be extortion, obviously. So, this is extortion. But  leaving that aside, why is it a felony to pay women you've had sexual  relationships with?</p><p>HAHN: It's not a felony. It's a felony to--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh.</p><p>HAHN: --do a campaign expenditure and not - and not disclose it, and that's  what this has been.</p><p>CARLSON: How is that a campaign expenditure?</p><p>HAHN: This seems to have been a campaign - he - he made this during the  campaign for the purposes of the campaign. There are tape recordings of him  discussing this with Michael Cohen. And that's just one--</p><p>CARLSON: Well, for the purposes of the campaign, I'm - wait--</p><p>HAHN: --look, this isn't even the - this is just a--</p><p>CARLSON: --no, but, wait, hold on, wait, hold on, I'm confused. No, it's  not a small thing. It's the thing. This is the crime that The New York Time  told us on Saturday, federal prosecutors are alleging the President  committed, it's a felony, and Michael Cohen pled guilty--</p><p>HAHN: Well they also--</p><p>CARLSON: --to a species of this. So, I just want to get to the bottom of  it. Why is that a campaign--</p><p>HAHN: Well, they're also alleging--</p><p>CARLSON: --contribution to pay off a former girlfriend? I'm honestly  confused. You're a campaign guy, tell me.</p><p>HAHN: They're - look, there's also an allegation that he may have violated  the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act when he was doing his deal in Moscow.</p><p>CARLSON: Well there are (ph) allegations that he killed Kennedy.</p><p>HAHN: There are a lot more to this than just paying off--</p><p>CARLSON: But I want - but hold on, no, no, no, no - </p><p>HAHN: --there's - there's a lot--</p><p>CARLSON: --OK--</p><p>HAHN: --there's a lot more to this than just paying off--</p><p>CARLSON: --OK, well how about one allegation--</p><p>HAHN: --porn stars who he slept with--</p><p>CARLSON: --slow down (ph), one allegation--</p><p>HAHN: --you know, a couple years ago.</p><p>CARLSON: --one allegation at a time. So, federal prosecutors--</p><p>HAHN: OK.</p><p>CARLSON: --this is not just something that dumb people on TV are talking  about, though they are. This is something that--</p><p>HAHN: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --prosecutors in New York State are saying they have, apparently,  evidence to indict over. So, tell me why because lot of people in - in  Washington pay off their girlfriends, including lots of people in Congress,  a lot of people in Congress, including I, even, guess some Democrats, just  throwing that out there. So, tell me why that's a campaign--</p><p>HAHN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --contribution to pay off your girlfriend?</p><p>HAHN: Well, first of all, I think that fund that Congress was using to pay  people off who were harassed needs to be disclosed and the Members who were  involved with those disclosure decisions need to be removed--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, I'm sure that'll happen right away. That'll happen right away.</p><p>HAHN: --from Congress right now. OK. I--</p><p>CARLSON: I'm sure MSNBC will push--</p><p>HAHN: I agree with you - I agree with you on that.</p><p>CARLSON: --real hard for that. Right, OK so but--</p><p>HAHN: I - I agree with you on--</p><p>CARLSON: --but tell me why it's a campaign--</p><p>HAHN: --I agree with you on that point.</p><p>CARLSON: --this is central question. Why is it and for all of us--</p><p>HAHN: Well, look, well--</p><p>CARLSON: --why is that a campaign contribution?</p><p>HAHN: --well here's the thing.</p><p>CARLSON: The money didn't come from the campaign. It didn't go to the  campaign. It was a threat to his reputation and his livelihood, as all  extortion is, right? So, why is that a campaign--</p><p>HAHN: There's black--</p><p>CARLSON: --contribution?</p><p>HAHN: --there's black letter law. There's black letter law here, OK?</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Well what is it?</p><p>HAHN: The campaign finance law is pretty clear about what you can and  cannot do with funds. And these funds were not necessarily from Trump's own  pockets. There was all sorts of schemes put together by the President and  Michael Cohen to move this money around, so it wasn't traced back to - to -  to President Trump.</p><p>CARLSON: But - but hold on, no--</p><p>HAHN: That in and of itself should--</p><p>CARLSON: --no, no, no, no, no--</p><p>HAHN: --raise red flags. You would be--</p><p>CARLSON: --no, no, you know, wait, stop, stop, stop, stop, no, no, no, no--</p><p>HAHN: --people would be blowing their mind off right now--</p><p>CARLSON: --wait, wait, stop, stop, stop, stop--</p><p>HAHN: --if you're (ph) the President.</p><p>CARLSON: --maybe. I mean we've never had a president like Trump in a  million different ways. And I'm not defending--</p><p>HAHN: No, we never have.</p><p>CARLSON: --I'm not defending his personal life. I'm merely saying--</p><p>HAHN: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --this is now being described as a felony, as a crime for which  the President could be removed. So, now is the time when we need to be very  specific about what the crime is because you're - you've stopped all  business of government, so we can respond to this. So, let's respond right  now. Tell me how and where--</p><p>HAHN: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --in campaign finance law it says, you're not allowed to use your  money, there's no allegation this was campaign money, your money to pay off  a former girlfriend? There isn't and that's this made-up (ph)--</p><p>HAHN: Oh, this is not--</p><p>CARLSON: --it's a lie--</p><p>HAHN: --the allegation here is not--</p><p>CARLSON: --actually.</p><p>HAHN: --the allegation here is not that it's just his money. There's  allegation that he moved money around through various schemes--</p><p>CARLSON: No, but not - they're not from the campaign--</p><p>HAHN: --to pay these women off--</p><p>CARLSON: --no, but, by the way--</p><p>HAHN: --including with the (ph) man who--</p><p>CARLSON: --you're allowed to do that too.</p><p>HAHN: --hold on a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait--</p><p>CARLSON: You're allowed to hide the payments.</p><p>HAHN: --he hid the payments--</p><p>CARLSON: What, is that a crime now--</p><p>HAHN: --that was campaign in nature--</p><p>CARLSON: --if it's your money?</p><p>HAHN: --that is a violation of--</p><p>CARLSON: Why does a campaign and (ph)--</p><p>HAHN: --a clear violation of campaign finance laws.</p><p>CARLSON: --hold on till then (ph), I'm giving you a chance on TV--</p><p>HAHN: It needed to be disclosed--</p><p>CARLSON: --hold on, hold on. No, no, just I'll let you speak and I'll let  you speak slowly--</p><p>HAHN: Go ahead.</p><p>CARLSON: --so our audience can understand. Where in campaign finance law  does it say that taking money that's not from your political campaign to  respond to an extortion attempt to pay off your girlfriend or pay the  gardener, pay anybody, why is that a felony? And where does it say that?</p><p>HAHN: Camp--</p><p>CARLSON: What are you talking about?</p><p>HAHN: --campaign finance law - look, I'm not going to quote the section and  verse. I don't know it off the top of my head--</p><p>CARLSON: Paraphrase it for me.</p><p>HAHN: --even though I'm a lawyer. Campaign finance - campaign finance law  clearly states that any money spent for campaign purposes, specifically by  people other than the candidate, must be disclosed. This is what's--</p><p>CARLSON: But why is that a campaign--</p><p>HAHN: --being alleged right here--</p><p>CARLSON: --purpose?</p><p>HAHN: --hold on, hold on, hold on--</p><p>CARLSON: What (ph)?</p><p>HAHN: --the President and Michael Cohen clearly set up a scheme so that  other people could pay these women off on behalf of Donald Trump while he  was running--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. OK. That--</p><p>HAHN: --for President because--</p><p>CARLSON: --that's fine but--</p><p>HAHN: --they thought that these (ph) allegations would sink his campaign  and his reputation.</p><p>CARLSON: But - but maybe - maybe under--</p><p>HAHN: That's a violation.</p><p>CARLSON: --no, actually, because anybody faced, I'm not, you know, I don't  know a single man who faced with that allegation, who he (ph) thought he  could squelch it wouldn't pay the person off because it does incalculable  damage to your reputation, whether you're running for anything or not. </p><p>And so, that's - it's so clearly not a campaign violation that I wonder if  we want to set this precedent. Do you want to live in a world where people  paying off extortion attempts are now campaign finance felons? I mean this  is lunatic.</p><p>HAHN: This is strike--</p><p>CARLSON: And you know it.</p><p>HAHN: --this - this is strikingly similar to what happened to John Edwards.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, and it's awful. It's awful what happened to--</p><p>HAHN: I'm not saying the President will be convicted but--</p><p>CARLSON: --John Edwards--</p><p>HAHN: --this is strikingly--</p><p>CARLSON: --I thought.</p><p>HAHN: --similar--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, it is. It is.</p><p>HAHN: --situation.</p><p>CARLSON: And what happened to him was--</p><p>HAHN: And it is something, look--</p><p>CARLSON: --wrong. It was another populace--</p><p>HAHN: --well--</p><p>CARLSON: --they took out with this BS campaign finance nonsense, exactly  what happened.</p><p>HAHN: --look, it is more than--</p><p>CARLSON: And, you know (ph), we're out of time.</p><p>HAHN: --campaign finance law.</p><p>CARLSON: --no.</p><p>HAHN: It's more than campaign finance law.</p><p>CARLSON: No, it's not.</p><p>HAHN: It is the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.</p><p>CARLSON: No, it's a totally separate thing.</p><p>HAHN: That in and of itself is a problem-- </p><p>CARLSON: Look, if - if he violated that I will (ph) defend it.</p><p>HAHN: Well, yes. And then (ph) also alleged by Cohen is--</p><p>CARLSON: But in this case, this is made-up.</p><p>HAHN: --also part of this.</p><p>CARLSON: All right, Chris Hahn, thank you.</p><p>HAHN: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Good to see you.</p><p>One of the most hysterical reactions in the past few days came from a  former Obama Administration U.S. Attorney, who says the President should be  stripped of his office.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARBARA MCQUADE, FORMER UNITED STATES ATTORNEY FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT  OF  MICHIGAN, PROFESSOR OF LAW AT UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN LAW SCHOOL, LEGAL  ANALYST FOR NBC NEWS AND MSNBC: It could be that President Trump procured  the presidency by fraud. </p><p>When immigrants procure their citizenship by fraud, we strip them of their  citizenship. When a president procures his presidency by fraud, should we  consider doing the same?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Alan Dershowitz is, of course, a retired Harvard Law School  professor. He's the Author of the book, The Case Against Impeaching Trump,  and he joins us tonight.</p><p>Professor, I got a couple questions. But the first relates just to the  sound bite we played. Is there a provision in the Constitution for  stripping, whatever that means, stripping the presidency from a President  who you think is illegitimate, whatever that means?</p><p>ALAN MORTON DERSHOWITZ, LAWYER, THE CASE AGAINST IMPEACHING TRUMP  AUTHOR,  HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR EMERITUS: Sure. It's called the 25th Amendment, but  not on the grounds of illegitimacy. I want everyone out there to imagine  the following scenario. </p><p>Let's assume when Bill Clinton was running for president, Paula Jones came  up to him and said, \"Unless you pay me a $130,000, I'll reveal our affair.\" </p><p>And let's assume, Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, together, did exactly  what it's alleged that Donald Trump and Cohen did together, I guarantee you  The New York Times, NBC, MSNBC would be railing against any prosecutor who  dared to suggest that this was a violation of the campaign (ph) finance  law. Everybody would be on the other side of this issue. </p><p>There'd be Republicans out there saying, \"Strip him of the presidency,  impeach him, indict him.\" Every Democrat would be saying this is a witch- hunt, this is terrible. We need a single standard. If you wouldn't go after  Bill Clinton, don't go after Donald Trump. </p><p>If you're going after Donald Trump, then you have to go after Hillary  Clinton for everything that she allegedly did. For example, one of your  guests talked about a Federal Corrupt Practices Act. That applies when you  bribe a foreign official.</p><p>What they're arguing is that there was a rumor that maybe somebody offered  Putin a penthouse in a Tower that Trump was thinking of building in Moscow.  And if that had been done, it would be a violation of the FCPA, Federal  Corrupt Practices Act. </p><p>But it's all based on hypotheticals and maybes. And I just want everybody  to apply the shoe on the other foot test. If Hillary Clinton were  president, the Republicans were saying, \"Lock her up,\" everybody would be  on the other side. They'd be screaming about how dare you expand criminal  statutes, how dare you expand the criteria for impeachment? </p><p>Now, all these liberal Democrat fair-weather civil libertarians are saying,  \"The hell with the Constitution, the hell with civil liberties, put all  that aside, get Trump.\" That's the most important consideration. Get him by  any means possible. This is such a danger to our constitutional system that  I would hope that true civil libertarians would rebel against that, as I  am.</p><p>CARLSON: Is - is it unfair to describe this scenario as extortion? I say I  know something about your sex life. I know a secret about you that you want  to keep the - that's non-criminal (ph), but that you want to keep hidden.  And unless you pay me money, I'm going to reveal it. That seems like  textbook extortion to me. Why is it not?</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: It is absolutely textbook extortion. And there ought to be a  prosecution of any person, man or woman, who approaches any candidate or  anybody else and says, \"Unless you pay me money, I'm going to reveal a sex  act that occurred.\" That is absolute classic extortion. </p><p>And it's shocking that the Special Counsel looking into this, who has a  broad mandate, he described it very broadly, isn't looking into the  extortion committed by, at least, the porn star, whose lawyer obviously  approached the candidate or the candidate's people, and threatened  exposure.</p><p>Otherwise, why would you pay? Just listen to the tape. The tape makes that  clear. The tape that Cohen made unwittingly of President Trump, it's clear  that they were paying off an extortion--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: --in order to prevent these issues from coming out for multiple  reasons, to protect his family, to protect his brand--</p><p>CARLSON: Sure.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: --possibly, to influence the campaign. </p><p>Let's remember one more thing. A President can contribute to a candidate as  much as he wants. If - if Bloomberg runs for president, he could announce  tomorrow, \"I'm not taking a nickel. I'm putting $1 billion of my own money  into this campaign.\" </p><p>That's perfectly legitimate. As far as reporting is concerned, it's the  campaign that has to report. And if these payments had to be reported, they  had to be reported after the election, the reporting time was after the  election so, it couldn't have impacted the election.</p><p>So, the absurd notion that he won the presidency by fraud and should be  stripped of the presidency (ph) reflects incredible ignorance about the  timing here, and how these statutes operate.</p><p>CARLSON: This is getting so crazy, it's - it's making my head spin. I  appreciate your coming on and explaining that to us, professor. Thank you  very much.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Well we've been saying it for a couple of years. Now, we have hard  scientific evidence that, in fact, big tech is altering and harming the  brains of children. Is it time to do something about that? What if we knew  it was true? Well we do know it's true now. We've got details next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TEXT: TECH TYRANNY.</p><p>CARLSON: Well Google collects more data than probably any other company,  and probably knows more about you than you do. You think this might raise  some concerns about the concentration of power. </p><p>But, for years, Congress seems to have cared not at all either because they  were ideologically predisposed to Google or because they were in its  pocket. Meanwhile, Google became more and more powerful, ominously  powerful. </p><p>Now, finally, during the lame-duck session, Congress has summoned the CEO  of Google, Sundar Pichai, to answer some questions about data transparency,  coming to Capitol Hill this week. What should Congress ask him about?</p><p>Harmeet Dhillon has followed this issue maybe more closely than any other  attorney in the United States, and she joins us tonight. Harmeet, thank you  very much for coming on. So what--</p><p>HARMEET DHILLON, AMERICAN LAWYER, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL LAWYERS  ASSOCIATION  BOARD MEMBER, FORMER VICE CHAIRWOMAN OF THE CALIFORNIA REPUBLICAN PARTY,  AND THE NATIONAL COMMITTEEWOMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE  FOR  CALIFORNIA: Hi, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: --what should be the - the list of questions?</p><p>DHILLON: Well, this is only a subset of the issues that people should be  asking Google that is the subject of the testimony tomorrow. But Google,  for years, as you pointed out, has been collecting data, and not disclosing  to users, number one, the extent of the collection of the data or what  they're doing with the data.</p><p>We have also learned of significant breaches, including today, an  announcement of a major breach of 52.5 million users on the Google+ failed  experiment in social media. It's not clear when that happened. </p><p>Google is not disclosing to people exactly what happened and what use has  been made of it. And they, as you pointed out, they just get away with it,  because we have both effete politicians in Washington, even on the  Republican side, and government agencies whose tasks it is to examine these  issues, and protect consumers. So, consumers are really at a complete loss. </p><p>Now, what I expect to happen on Capitol Hill tomorrow is that there'll be  some posturing questions written by staffers that Members of Congress are  going to read out, and you're going to have some focus group tested  jargony, you know, in - incomprehensible responses from Sundar Pichai  designed to placate these folks.</p><p>There'll be a little bit of a dance and everybody will go home, not  understanding what the answers were, and not probably going to do anything  about it. And this is a real tragedy and missed opportunity, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: What a shame? I want to (ph) ask you another story, another  element of the Google story. </p><p>Newly leaked email show that several Google employees plotted to destroy  the news site, Breitbart, after the 2016 election, a secret internal  discussion group labeled Resist. Google employees discussed how they could  use the, quote, hate speech and fake news labels to justify cutting off  Breitbart's ad revenues.</p><p>Harmeet, this is kind of the stuff of Conservative fever dreams that Google  would be actually doing something like this. Are you surprised by it? And  what can be done, in response?</p><p>DHILLON: Well Google - A, I'm not surprised. B, Google is denying it. But  there's extensive evidence that Google did this, and they did it in two  ways. </p><p>One way is right after the election, as you mentioned, a number of very  excitable Left-wing Google executives and employees tried to squeeze  Breitbart and other Conservative outlets into this hate speech category.</p><p>They then confessed that after a lot of effort that was really tough. So,  they also did a two-pronged approach, and the other side of that approach  is having their ad people contact customers and tell them that it might be  dangerous or a bad idea to advertise or allow their ads to be placed on  Conservative news websites like Breitbart and others.</p><p>And they pointed to some outside groups like Sleeping Giant that makes it a  - a business practice of defaming Conservative writers and organizations,  and use that as a smear. </p><p>Google also does this in many other ways like through its YouTube. It  categorizes content as sensitive, which automatically, both, makes it hard  to find the content online, and also strips that content from the ability  to gain advertising revenue.</p><p>So, Google is doing this systematically. Google is doing this purposefully.  Google is getting away with doing this. And I think it violates not just  some laws, including Communications Decency Act and others, but it - it  violates state laws that have to do with fraud and transparency, unfair  business practices and competition.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>DHILLON: Again, Google is able to get away with this because, you know,  they - they contribute to some Conservative groups like CPAC, lot of money  to show up at CPAC, and - and certainly on Capitol Hill. </p><p>They get away with it, and we see nothing done to control this - this, you  know, duopoly and monopoly on advertising revenue. It's very dangerous  because it's shaping what young people in America, who mainly get their  news through--</p><p>CARLSON: Of course.</p><p>DHILLON: --Google see every day.</p><p>CARLSON: Looking back, the Congress allowing Google to become more powerful  than the U.S. government, subverting our democracy entirely, that'll be the  thing we hold Members responsible for, I think, historically. </p><p>Harmeet Dhillon, you will not be held responsible since you're a lonely  voice on the right side, thank you for joining us, as always.</p><p>DHILLON: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Meanwhile, we've been saying it for years. Now, there is hard  scientific evidence that big tech is, in fact, harming our children. </p><p>New 60 Minutes report this week highlighted research that shows children  who use tablet smartphones and other screens more than seven hours a day,  and that's a lot of kids, believe it or not, are developing different brain  structures. Their brains are being damaged by this. </p><p>Tom Kersting is a psychotherapist, who's written extensively on this  subject, and he joins us tonight. You must feel vindicated by this report,  Tom.</p><p>TOM KERSTING, PSYCHOTHERAPIST, DISCONNECTED AUTHOR: I do. I do. I'm  actually happy to see it, to be honest with you because--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --it's something I've been speaking about for so many years at  lectures and in my book. And now, we could finally have some scientific  preliminary evidence showing exactly what all of this tech is doing to the  brain.</p><p>CARLSON: So, what is it doing?</p><p>KERSTING: Well, first of all, the area of the brain called the cortex,  which is the outer layer of the brain, the preliminary study that the - the  research has conducted, shows a - a premature thinning of that part of the  brain, OK, which is - which is kind of frightening, considering the  importance of that part of the brain, what it does, how it's very important  just for human beings in terms of organizing, planning, and a host of other  different things.</p><p>Another component that you don't hear much about is something called  neuroplasticity, which is actually the greatest breakthrough in modern day  psychology. And the term plasticity meaning that the brain, although very  strong and rigid, can be molded and shaped if placed in - in the right  environment for three or more hours per day. </p><p>We know that the average kid is spending nine hours a day, on average, in  what I consider to be the most highly stimulating of worlds. And what  happens is the brain will actually grow new neural pathways, it'll re- organize its circuitry to adapt to that cyber world.</p><p>And the problem is what I'm seeing clinically is an unadapting of - of  young kids in a real world having a very difficult time coping with just  the trivial nuances of life, the anxiety disorders, the depressions, and so  forth.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. Well and it's all kinds of measurements are showing the  horrifying results of it. How young, exactly, are kids getting addicted?</p><p>KERSTING: Well, we're seeing right now that there's some - some research  that came out recently that there - there's the kids as - as young as two  years old showing signs of depression. And, right now, the average age for  first smartphone issuance is about age 10.</p><p>And, you know, when I give lectures, every parent knows that this is bad.  But it's sort of, you know, what you talk about it you love (ph) the - the  term groupthink. I - I use the term social conformity. </p><p>We tend to do what everybody else is doing. And parents, anybody listening,  you have got to do what is in the best interest of your child, not - not  what everybody else around you is doing.</p><p>CARLSON: So, can you just give me the 20-second answer to the question I  always ask you, which is why are we so passive in the face of this? If two- year-olds were huffing on Marlboros, we'd say, \"You know what? No, not  allowed.\" But we just sort of sit back and let our society collapse in the  face of this, why?</p><p>KERSTING: Well, the reason, in my opinion, the reason why is - and we talk  about - I always talk about common sense, all right? </p><p>It's pretty clear, if we go walk around and everybody's got their heads  buried in a device all day long, you pull up to a traffic light, and they  can't even contain themselves for a minute without looking at their device,  it's pretty clear that it's having an impact on their behavior.</p><p>Now, the reason why nobody is--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --doing anything about it is because we're always looking for  scientific evidence, all right, and now we have some of it, and we're going  to start seeing a lot more of it. And--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --and we're going to start seeing some changes, as a result,  Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, and it's we waited too long for the studies to confirm the  obvious. Tom, thank you very much.</p><p>KERSTING: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, Hollywood doesn't need to remake 1984 again, not that they  would, it's probably illegal. But they already do a perfect job of  replicating it in real life. They are living the plotline of George  Orwell's novel. Kevin Hart is the latest person to be destroyed for  statements that he made many years ago. We'll tell you his story after the  break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TEXT: AMERICA'S NEWS HQ.</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Live from America's News  headquarters, I'm Trace Gallagher.</p><p>No bail decision yet for a top Chinese executive who's facing possible  extradition from Canada to the U.S. The case of Meng Wanzhou has fueled  U.S.-China trade tensions and rocked financial markets.</p><p>Meng is the Chief Financial Officer of telecommunications giant, Huawei.  She was detained December 1st during a layover in Vancouver. She's accused  of misleading banks about the company's business dealings in Iran. </p><p>There is a concerning uptick in paralyzing illness among children. The  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now says there have been more  cases than ever. There are a 158 confirmed cases so far this year. </p><p>The illness called acute flaccid myelitis causes paralysis in the face,  neck, back, arms or legs. The symptoms usually come a week following a  fever and respiratory illness. </p><p>I'm Trace Gallagher, now back to Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Hollywood has issued a new decree. And, of course, everyone obeyed  immediately. Kevin Hart's career must be destroyed. </p><p>Just days after the Comedian was announced as the next Host of the Oscars,  the now-irrelevant awards show some people still watch, Hart was forced to  step down over tweets and stand-up routines from about a decade ago that  some said were anti-gay.</p><p>Now, these tweets had already come to light. Hart had already apologized  for them and said he was changing his routine, but it didn't matter. In  today's political environment, there is no such thing as forgiveness or  mercy. What you're seeing is, instead, a particularly powerful form of  bullying. Do and think exactly as we say, or else.</p><p>Larry Elder has fought the forces of conformity for a long time. He's a  radio show host from Los Angeles, and he joins us tonight. We're really  glad to have you, Larry Elder, thank you. So, what's the takeaway from  watching what just happened to Kevin Hart?</p><p>LARRY ELDER, RADIO SHOW HOST, WRITER, ATTORNEY: The takeaway, Tucker, is  what the devil are the rules. As you pointed out--</p><p>CARLSON: Right. I got it (ph).</p><p>ELDER: --Kevin Hart did these tweets some years ago and - and made anti-gay  references in his stand-up some years ago. He apologized back in 2015. The  Academy Award people wanted him to apologize again. He refused.</p><p>Now, the show is going to be carried by ABC. ABC parent company is Disney.  Disney also owns ESPN. They've employed Keith Olbermann, who is a - a Trump  hater from way back. And just last year, he tweeted that Trump was a Nazi  and dropped a bunch of F-bombs in his tweet. That didn't seem to bother  Disney. But Kevin Hart has to go.</p><p>The other inconsistency, of course, is that other comedians like Amy  Schumer, who last year, I think it was, hosted a Democratic fundraiser, has  used the - the F-word for gays in a tweet, as has Sarah Silverman, as has  Chelsea Handler, all of whom have hosted shows.</p><p>And finally, you have the instance of Joy Ann Reid on MSNBC who had a blog  2007, 2008--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>ELDER: --a very anti-gay post she made, and she wasn't joking, she wasn't a  comedian, including dissing the movie Brokeback Mountain, and said she  hated watching men kiss. She then said she apologized. </p><p>Then, later on, she said she was hacked. NBC did a search to find out  whether or not she'd been hacked. Turned out she wasn't hacked. So, she  either misremembered or lied, and then apologized again. She has a show on  MSNBC. So, forgive Kevin Hart for not - for not knowing what the rules are.</p><p>CARLSON: Well that's and - so, but what's the best response? I think you're  absolutely right. All of us at some point are going to be accused of  thoughtcrime, and the mob will come for us. It's inevitable.</p><p>ELDER: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: How do we respond? What's the best way to respond?</p><p>ELDER: You do them on a case-by-case basis. The man apologized, said he had  grown. The - the most horrific tweet was saying that if he came home and  saw his son playing with his daughter's dollhouse, he'd break the dollhouse  over his head. He later on said, he apologized, he's grown as a man--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>ELDER: --and perhaps the tweet had to do with his own insecurities as a  man. So, I think that's what you do. You apologize, be sincere, and then  keep going. </p><p>But if people keep beating you over the - over the head over it over and  over again, they're not going to forgive you, I'm not sure what the point  is, which is why I believe that Kevin Hart was morally justified in saying,  I've already apologized, I'm not going to apologize again.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>ELDER: I'm a 40-year old man. I've apologized. I've grown, let it alone.</p><p>CARLSON: I mean what happens to a society where the mob feels it has  ultimate authority on judgment? No one believes in God, so they have to  make their own judgments, hard and fast judgments--</p><p>ELDER: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --and no forgiveness is allowed.</p><p>ELDER: Yes. And what happens to a society that's - that's so inconsistent?  For example, Kanye West--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>ELDER: --is being called an Uncle Tom and a Token, a House Negro. That  doesn't seem to bother anybody. </p><p>You got a guy in like Al Sharpton, who's got a show where he's referred to  gays as - as homos in the - in years past, Jews as interlopers. He - he  falsely accused a White man of raping a Black teenager, he has a show on  television, you know, every weekend.</p><p>So, you know, I'm not quite sure what to say, Tucker, other than it's  terribly inconsistent. It seem to me there's one rule for people who are  Conservative and one rule for people--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>ELDER: --who are on the Left.</p><p>CARLSON: I think it's best just to ignore the noise to the extent you can.  I mean they have an awful lot of power. You know, they'll de-platform you  in a second. Larry Elder--</p><p>ELDER: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --we're rooting for you.</p><p>ELDER: Thank you. I need--</p><p>CARLSON: If they ever try to leave you, you'd (ph)--</p><p>ELDER: --I could use the help.</p><p>CARLSON: --always have a home on this show. Good to see you.</p><p>ELDER: I could use the help. Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you.</p><p>Well China just launched a new persecution of the country's Christians.  Will anyone in Washington care? Are they too busy taking Chinese money?</p><p>Plus, Paris continues to be convulsed by the worst riots there in 50 years.  What are these riots about? You know what they're about. They're about the  Paris Climate Treaty, the spirit of it, anyway. And policies they want here  are being rejected by both Left and Right in France, and they're ignoring  it because it's too inconvenient to pay attention. Details ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TEXT: THE CHINA THREAT.</p><p>CARLSON: China has launched a new crackdown. How many news stories begin  with that sentence, \"China has launched a new crackdown?\" Many. And they  have, once again, launched new crackdown, this time, on their country's  underground Christian community.</p><p>In a coordinated sweep of nighttime raids, police rounded up about a 100  members and the pastor of the Early Rain Covenant Church. Because the  church does not submit to government control, it is illegal in China. And  members have been forbidden from attending services.</p><p>It's just the latest in a persecution wave that has shut down several  different churches with thousands of Christian members. This is what actual  religious oppression looks like, but a ruling class that's seen (ph) people  who boycott North Carolina over its bathroom laws don't care at all. </p><p>None of them are calling for boycotts or sanctions on China. There's no  witch-hunt against the countless universities, businesses, and lobbyists  with massive financial ties to China, and its authoritarian regime.</p><p>In fact, to our ruling class, China is the future. If anything, it's a  country we ought to emulate. So remember that, next time they try to  lecture you about how their values are better than yours.</p><p>The war in Afghanistan, as you well know, has continued for 17 years. It's  the longest war in the history of this country. We're still spending  billions there. American soldiers are still dying there. It might all be  worth it if we were still fighting for victory. But are we fighting for  victory?</p><p>In a newly leaked audiotape, former NATO Commander, Stanley McChrystal,  tells Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, how the war in Afghanistan should be  fought. </p><p>It's not exactly the opening speech from Patton. \"My best suggestion,\" he  says, \"Is to keep a limited number of forces there and just kind of muddle  along, and see what we can do.\"</p><p>Now, muddle along is not a strategy for anything, much less a victory. It's  a strategy to waste American money and lives for no reason at all. If U.S.  troops are going to muddle along in a war, maybe it's a sign that's a war  we shouldn't be fighting in the first place.</p><p>Well, if you can remember back a year-and-a-half, on June 1st, 2017, the  President announced he was pulling this country out of the Paris Climate  Accords. To hear the politicians and television news chintuggers (ph)  react, you'd think it was the worst natural catastrophe, well, ever.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NANCY PELOSI, MINORITY LEADER OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF  REPRESENTATIVES, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA: What happened yesterday on the  climate issue is an embarrassment to our country and it should be an  embarrassment to him personally for how he answers to his grandchildren.</p><p>GOV. JERRY BROWN (D), CALIFORNIA: People are going to die. Habitat will be  destroyed. Seas will rise. Insects will spread.</p><p>FAREED RAFIQ ZAKARIA, CNN'S FAREED ZAKARIA GPS HOST, POLITICAL SCIENTIST,  AUTHOR, COLUMNIST: This will be the day that the United States resigned as  the leader of the free world.</p><p>JOHN KERRY, FORMER UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE: He is not helping the  forgotten American. He is hurting them. Their kids will have worse asthma  in the summer.</p><p>The President who talked about putting America first has now put America  last.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: These people are so stupid. It's amazing they have jobs. The  economy must be pretty strong, in fact, if those people have health  insurance. One thing they said though is true. </p><p>People were hurt, but not because we pulled out, but because other  countries kept to the terms of the Paris Climate Accord, including France. </p><p>This fall, France began to implement a gas tax to fight climate change  inspired by that agreement. Now, for the fourth weekend in a row, the city  of Paris has been rocked by riots and mass protests. The city is burning  and shows no signs of stopping. </p><p>What did this? Progressive climate policy. Will the people who formulated  it ever admit it? Of course, not. They're too invested.</p><p>Well the press, all of a sudden, doing everything it can to kill Elizabeth  Warren's presidential campaign before it even begins. That's kind of  interesting. Is this a mercy killing or something else going on?</p><p>Mark Steyn joins us to unravel a delightful mystery, after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ELIZABETH ANN WARREN, SENIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, MASSACHUSETTS: Now, the  President likes to call my mom a liar. What do the facts say?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The facts suggest that you absolutely have a Native  American ancestor in your pedigree.</p><p>WARREN: OK.</p><p>And Trump can say whatever he wants about me, but mocking Native Americans  or any group in order to try to get at me? That's not what America stands  for.</p><p>I'm not enrolled in a tribe and only tribes determine tribal citizenship. I  understand and respect that distinction. But my family history is my family  history.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: I mean (ph) you really just can't watch that enough. It really  should be a screensaver. This hasn't, understatement of the day, been the  fall Elizabeth Warren had hoped for. </p><p>She thought that releasing a DNA test showing that she might have had a  lone American Indian ancestor, not necessarily from this continent, a few  hundred years ago would silence the President and give her momentum going  into the primaries next year.</p><p>Instead, even the Left is turning on her. Two pieces in the Washington Post  and The New York Times in the past week suggests that Warren's campaign has  been deeply, maybe even fatally, wounded by the blunder of the DNA test. </p><p>Looks almost like an effort to kill Elizabeth Warren's campaign before she  can embarrass her party, the one to which everyone in the media belongs,  before she actually runs.</p><p>Mark Steyn is an Author and Columnist. Not a conspiracy not, I'll run this  by him anyway. So, what is going on? </p><p>So, obviously, she is a media creation, not a genius, but she has been the  subject of endless fawning profiles in the press, particularly from the  Boston Globe, which has promoted her for years, and now they're attacking  her, why?</p><p>MARK STEYN, AUTHOR, COLUMNIST, STEYNONLINE.COM: Yes. That's - that's  interesting. The Boston Globe is saying you - to Elizabeth Warren, you have  to know when not to run. And this is the paper that's wanted her to run  until she took--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --until she got head-faked into taking this DNA test that showed she  was 1/1024th Native American, which is less Native American than the  average. </p><p>I mean you could test Kim Jong-un, Vladimir Putin, and they would - they  would be more than 1/1024th Native American just because some Cherokee  happened to change trains in Odessa in - in 1852, and got lucky with one of  the porters. </p><p>I mean any - every - anyone's more Native American. And what's fascinating- -</p><p>CARLSON: Ha-ha.</p><p>STEYN: --what's fascinating about this is that this - Elizabeth Warren was  a test on the limits of Democrat identity politics because their recent  presidential candidates have been sold on identity politics, but in rather  strange ways. </p><p>So, Barack Obama is an African-American. But he has nothing to do with the  Black slave experience or Civil Rights.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>STEYN: He's - he's Black just because his father happened to be a British  subject born in Colonial Kenya. Barack Obama was actually the first child  of British subjects to be President, I believe, since Andrew Jackson. So,  he tried to get himself in on the colonial thing. </p><p>Obama said his step-grandfather in Indonesia had died fighting Dutch  soldiers in the struggle for independence. In fact, it turned out his step- grandfather died when he fell off a chair while changing the drapes. That's  not a joke. That's actually true. That's how his step-grandfather died.</p><p>Then you have Hillary Clinton, who's running as a feminist icon and is, in  fact, only the candidate because she's the wife of the previous guy, and  she was given a Senate seat as a reward for standing by him, when his  intern's dress wound up in the FBI crime analysis lab - lab.</p><p>So, we have very--</p><p>CARLSON: Ha-ha.</p><p>STEYN: --so in such a world, you can't blame Elizabeth Warren for saying,  \"Well, if Hillary could be a feminist icon, why can't I be the first Native  American President?\" </p><p>She was Harvard Law School's first woman of color. That's why it's not a  family law thing. She actually was promoted as Harvard Law School's first  woman of color. Why shouldn't she be America's first - first Native  American President?</p><p>CARLSON: Such a good (ph)--</p><p>STEYN: Since this is (ph)-- </p><p>CARLSON: --such a good example (ph).</p><p>STEYN: --none - none of this identity politics. Joe Biden should run as the  first transgender woman candidate and dare the Democrat electorate to call  him on it.</p><p>CARLSON: That was my plan.</p><p>STEYN: I mean this is this (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: I hope he doesn't get there first.</p><p>STEYN: --no don't (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: I'm doing that (ph). You're the best.</p><p>STEYN: Yes (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: Mark Steyn, we're out of time.</p><p>STEYN: Thanks a lot, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: I loved it. Thank you.</p><p>STEYN: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Man that was fun. Back tomorrow, 8 P.M., show that is the sworn  enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and, especially, groupthink. Good night  from Washington.

If you've been watching television recently, you've probably heard the bad  news. The Trump Administration is over, toast, cooked, done for good, and  along with it any hope of the middle-class revolution that 63 million  Americans voted for two years ago.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The reason for this tragedy is simple. The President has been caught  committing felonies. Here's what the legal experts without law degrees are  saying on television.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LAWRENCE O'DONNELL, THE LAST WORD WITH LAWRENCE O'DONNELL HOST, MSNBC: If  precedent means anything in the Trump era, Donald Trump will be, must be,  impeached because of the crimes prosecutors say he committed in the Michael  Cohen case.</p><p>ROBERT E. MOOK, FORMER POLITICAL CAMPAIGN STRATEGIST AND CAMPAIGN  MANAGER,  CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Both parties need to get on board to pass  articles of impeachment.</p><p>EDDIE GLAUDE, CHAIR, CENTER FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN STUDIES: You have  conspiracy, you have - you have obstruction, you have campaigns finance and  you have emoluments. </p><p>If the Democrats do not pursue this vigorously, they will be, in some ways,  held accountable for abdicating their responsibility.</p><p>It goes to the moral question, the ethical question. Democracy is at stake.</p><p>MAXINE MOORE WATERS, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR CALIFORNIA'S 43RD  CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, DEMOCRATIC PARTY MEMBER: This criminal must be  brought up by the Congress of the United States for impeachment.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CARLSON: We're not even (ph) going to show you the Don Lemon tape. There's  a lot of emotion there. But to sum up, they're telling us that we're  staring down the barrel of a constitutional crisis. And that crisis stems  from what MSNBC describes as, quote, the crimes prosecutors say the  President committed in the Michael Cohen case.</p><p>Which crimes were those? We have the answer. The relevant details were  spelled out in a piece that ran over the weekend in The New York Times  under this headline. \"Prosecutors say Trump directed illegal payments  during campaign.\"</p><p>The gist of the story is this. Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, has  told federal prosecutors that he facilitated payments to two women who said  they had affairs with Donald Trump. And then, well actually that's it.  That's the entire story right there.</p><p>Paying these two women, say federal prosecutors and their flacks at NBC  News, was a serious crime, a crime worthy of impeachment, if not,  indictment. OK. But you might be wondering, how exactly is that criminal?  Well, we're going to explain it to you.</p><p>We're going to start by stipulating that everything Michael Cohen has told  the feds is absolutely true. Now, assuming honesty isn't usually a wise  idea with Michael Cohen, but for the sake of argument, let's do it in this  case, everything he says is true, why is what Cohen is alleging a criminal  offense?</p><p>Remember the facts of the story. These are undisputed. Two women approached  Donald Trump and threatened to ruin his career and humiliate his family if  he doesn't give them money. Now, that sounds like a classic case of  extortion.</p><p>Yet, for whatever reason, Trump caves to it, and he directs Michael Cohen  to pay the ransom. Now, more than two years later, Trump is a felon for  doing this. It doesn't seem to make any sense.</p><p>Oh, but you're not a federal prosecutor on a political mission. If you were  a federal prosecutor on a political mission, you would construe those  extortion payments as campaign contributions. You'd do this even though the  money in question did not come from or go to Donald Trump's presidential  campaign.</p><p>Then you'd claim that Trump and Michael Cohen violated campaign finance law  because they didn't publicly disclose those payments despite the fact that  disclosing them would nullify the reason for making them in the first  place, which was to keep the whole thing secret.</p><p>That is the argument you would make, both in federal court and through your  proxies on cable television. It is insultingly stupid. But because everyone  in power hates the target of your investigation, nobody would question you,  and that's what's happening right now.</p><p>Now, by this reasoning, any money a political candidate spends to maintain  or protect his image while running for office now qualifies as a regulated  campaign donation, and has to be disclosed. That would include, by the way,  in addition to an infinite number of other things, buying toothpaste and  getting a haircut.</p><p>It would definitely include the taxpayer-financed slush fund that Congress  has set aside to pay off its own sexual harassment claims. Yes, those now  qualify as campaign contributions. They must be publicly disclosed, except,  of course, they're not publicly disclosed, and they never will be. Why is  that?</p><p>Well that might be a question for Congressional leaders including, now that  we think about it, Congressman Adam Schiff of Burbank, California. He's the  incoming Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, a very powerful man  in the Congress. </p><p>What does Mr. Schiff have to say about Congress not disclosing the very  same payments that Democrats say Trump should be impeached for not  disclosing? Let's ask him.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ADAM BENNETT SCHIFF, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR CALIFORNIA'S 28TH  CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, DEMOCRATIC PARTY MEMBER: There's a very real  prospect that on the day Donald Trump leaves office the Justice Department  may indict him that he may be the first president in quite some time to  face the real prospect of jail time.</p><p>NEAL KUMAR KATYAL, LAWYER, FORMER ACTING SOLICITOR GENERAL OF THE UNITED  STATES, LAW PROFESSOR AT GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY: Trump knows that he's  facing some pretty strong criminal liability when he leaves office, one way  or another. And, you know, even if a (ph) sitting president can't be  indicted, he's got to know his future looks like it's behind bars unless he  cuts some sort of deal with the prosecutors.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: So to translate, Trump's a criminal. He's going to jail for  committing a smaller version of the same made-up crime that we in Congress  have committed for years and forced you to pay for. </p><p>And, by the way, we're never apologizing for that because we don't have to  and CNN isn't going to make us. Screw you, America, and your stupid  election. We are in charge. That's the real message here, in case you  missed it.</p><p>Chris Hahn is a radio host and former aide to Senator Chuck Schumer, and he  joins us tonight. </p><p>So, Chris, I think you don't like Trump but that's fine. But speak slowly  so I can understand. Explain to me why paying off someone who is extorting  you, threatening to make public details of your personal life, if she  doesn't get paid, why paying that person is a felony?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER HAHN, AMERICAN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, DEMOCRATIC PARTY  ACTIVIST, RADIO SHOW HOST, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, first of all, we  don't know that there was actual extortion here. We know that a payment was  made. There was a catch and kill deal with the National Enquirer. Whether  or not it was extortion, that hasn't been proven yet, nor has it even  really been alleged in many cases--</p><p>CARLSON: Well, I'm--</p><p>HAHN: --by the President. He's not saying--</p><p>CARLSON: --I'm alleging, I'm - hold on, let me--</p><p>HAHN: --he's not say--</p><p>CARLSON: --let me just stop and say, I'm alleging it because it's obvious.  You're not going to pay a $100,000 or a $150,000 or $200,000 to someone  unless there's a threat to you and your reputation. This is extortion. </p><p>And I don't - I don't know why it's not being prosecuted. I don't know - I  don't know why Trump isn't defending himself on those grounds, I would. But  it clearly is extortion.</p><p>HAHN: Well--</p><p>CARLSON: But why is it a crime to pay off--</p><p>HAHN: --well sometimes people want--</p><p>CARLSON: --someone-- </p><p>HAHN: --sometimes people--</p><p>CARLSON: --who you had an affair with?</p><p>HAHN: --sometimes people want to tell us - they want to tell a story that  he doesn't want told. He said--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>HAHN: --hey, just tell it to me. I'll pay for it and--</p><p>CARLSON: That's extortion. It's--</p><p>HAHN: --and pay for yourselves (ph). That's what he did--</p><p>CARLSON: --that's - that's what - if I did that to you-- </p><p>HAHN: --in this situation.</p><p>CARLSON: --you would call it - if I said, \"Look, I know a detail about your  sex life, Chris Hahn, and I'm going to tell it on my show on TV unless you  pay me,\" that would be extortion, obviously. So, this is extortion. But  leaving that aside, why is it a felony to pay women you've had sexual  relationships with?</p><p>HAHN: It's not a felony. It's a felony to--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh.</p><p>HAHN: --do a campaign expenditure and not - and not disclose it, and that's  what this has been.</p><p>CARLSON: How is that a campaign expenditure?</p><p>HAHN: This seems to have been a campaign - he - he made this during the  campaign for the purposes of the campaign. There are tape recordings of him  discussing this with Michael Cohen. And that's just one--</p><p>CARLSON: Well, for the purposes of the campaign, I'm - wait--</p><p>HAHN: --look, this isn't even the - this is just a--</p><p>CARLSON: --no, but, wait, hold on, wait, hold on, I'm confused. No, it's  not a small thing. It's the thing. This is the crime that The New York Time  told us on Saturday, federal prosecutors are alleging the President  committed, it's a felony, and Michael Cohen pled guilty--</p><p>HAHN: Well they also--</p><p>CARLSON: --to a species of this. So, I just want to get to the bottom of  it. Why is that a campaign--</p><p>HAHN: Well, they're also alleging--</p><p>CARLSON: --contribution to pay off a former girlfriend? I'm honestly  confused. You're a campaign guy, tell me.</p><p>HAHN: They're - look, there's also an allegation that he may have violated  the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act when he was doing his deal in Moscow.</p><p>CARLSON: Well there are (ph) allegations that he killed Kennedy.</p><p>HAHN: There are a lot more to this than just paying off--</p><p>CARLSON: But I want - but hold on, no, no, no, no - </p><p>HAHN: --there's - there's a lot--</p><p>CARLSON: --OK--</p><p>HAHN: --there's a lot more to this than just paying off--</p><p>CARLSON: --OK, well how about one allegation--</p><p>HAHN: --porn stars who he slept with--</p><p>CARLSON: --slow down (ph), one allegation--</p><p>HAHN: --you know, a couple years ago.</p><p>CARLSON: --one allegation at a time. So, federal prosecutors--</p><p>HAHN: OK.</p><p>CARLSON: --this is not just something that dumb people on TV are talking  about, though they are. This is something that--</p><p>HAHN: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --prosecutors in New York State are saying they have, apparently,  evidence to indict over. So, tell me why because lot of people in - in  Washington pay off their girlfriends, including lots of people in Congress,  a lot of people in Congress, including I, even, guess some Democrats, just  throwing that out there. So, tell me why that's a campaign--</p><p>HAHN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --contribution to pay off your girlfriend?</p><p>HAHN: Well, first of all, I think that fund that Congress was using to pay  people off who were harassed needs to be disclosed and the Members who were  involved with those disclosure decisions need to be removed--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, I'm sure that'll happen right away. That'll happen right away.</p><p>HAHN: --from Congress right now. OK. I--</p><p>CARLSON: I'm sure MSNBC will push--</p><p>HAHN: I agree with you - I agree with you on that.</p><p>CARLSON: --real hard for that. Right, OK so but--</p><p>HAHN: I - I agree with you on--</p><p>CARLSON: --but tell me why it's a campaign--</p><p>HAHN: --I agree with you on that point.</p><p>CARLSON: --this is central question. Why is it and for all of us--</p><p>HAHN: Well, look, well--</p><p>CARLSON: --why is that a campaign contribution?</p><p>HAHN: --well here's the thing.</p><p>CARLSON: The money didn't come from the campaign. It didn't go to the  campaign. It was a threat to his reputation and his livelihood, as all  extortion is, right? So, why is that a campaign--</p><p>HAHN: There's black--</p><p>CARLSON: --contribution?</p><p>HAHN: --there's black letter law. There's black letter law here, OK?</p><p>CARLSON: OK. Well what is it?</p><p>HAHN: The campaign finance law is pretty clear about what you can and  cannot do with funds. And these funds were not necessarily from Trump's own  pockets. There was all sorts of schemes put together by the President and  Michael Cohen to move this money around, so it wasn't traced back to - to -  to President Trump.</p><p>CARLSON: But - but hold on, no--</p><p>HAHN: That in and of itself should--</p><p>CARLSON: --no, no, no, no, no--</p><p>HAHN: --raise red flags. You would be--</p><p>CARLSON: --no, no, you know, wait, stop, stop, stop, stop, no, no, no, no--</p><p>HAHN: --people would be blowing their mind off right now--</p><p>CARLSON: --wait, wait, stop, stop, stop, stop--</p><p>HAHN: --if you're (ph) the President.</p><p>CARLSON: --maybe. I mean we've never had a president like Trump in a  million different ways. And I'm not defending--</p><p>HAHN: No, we never have.</p><p>CARLSON: --I'm not defending his personal life. I'm merely saying--</p><p>HAHN: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --this is now being described as a felony, as a crime for which  the President could be removed. So, now is the time when we need to be very  specific about what the crime is because you're - you've stopped all  business of government, so we can respond to this. So, let's respond right  now. Tell me how and where--</p><p>HAHN: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --in campaign finance law it says, you're not allowed to use your  money, there's no allegation this was campaign money, your money to pay off  a former girlfriend? There isn't and that's this made-up (ph)--</p><p>HAHN: Oh, this is not--</p><p>CARLSON: --it's a lie--</p><p>HAHN: --the allegation here is not--</p><p>CARLSON: --actually.</p><p>HAHN: --the allegation here is not that it's just his money. There's  allegation that he moved money around through various schemes--</p><p>CARLSON: No, but not - they're not from the campaign--</p><p>HAHN: --to pay these women off--</p><p>CARLSON: --no, but, by the way--</p><p>HAHN: --including with the (ph) man who--</p><p>CARLSON: --you're allowed to do that too.</p><p>HAHN: --hold on a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait--</p><p>CARLSON: You're allowed to hide the payments.</p><p>HAHN: --he hid the payments--</p><p>CARLSON: What, is that a crime now--</p><p>HAHN: --that was campaign in nature--</p><p>CARLSON: --if it's your money?</p><p>HAHN: --that is a violation of--</p><p>CARLSON: Why does a campaign and (ph)--</p><p>HAHN: --a clear violation of campaign finance laws.</p><p>CARLSON: --hold on till then (ph), I'm giving you a chance on TV--</p><p>HAHN: It needed to be disclosed--</p><p>CARLSON: --hold on, hold on. No, no, just I'll let you speak and I'll let  you speak slowly--</p><p>HAHN: Go ahead.</p><p>CARLSON: --so our audience can understand. Where in campaign finance law  does it say that taking money that's not from your political campaign to  respond to an extortion attempt to pay off your girlfriend or pay the  gardener, pay anybody, why is that a felony? And where does it say that?</p><p>HAHN: Camp--</p><p>CARLSON: What are you talking about?</p><p>HAHN: --campaign finance law - look, I'm not going to quote the section and  verse. I don't know it off the top of my head--</p><p>CARLSON: Paraphrase it for me.</p><p>HAHN: --even though I'm a lawyer. Campaign finance - campaign finance law  clearly states that any money spent for campaign purposes, specifically by  people other than the candidate, must be disclosed. This is what's--</p><p>CARLSON: But why is that a campaign--</p><p>HAHN: --being alleged right here--</p><p>CARLSON: --purpose?</p><p>HAHN: --hold on, hold on, hold on--</p><p>CARLSON: What (ph)?</p><p>HAHN: --the President and Michael Cohen clearly set up a scheme so that  other people could pay these women off on behalf of Donald Trump while he  was running--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. OK. That--</p><p>HAHN: --for President because--</p><p>CARLSON: --that's fine but--</p><p>HAHN: --they thought that these (ph) allegations would sink his campaign  and his reputation.</p><p>CARLSON: But - but maybe - maybe under--</p><p>HAHN: That's a violation.</p><p>CARLSON: --no, actually, because anybody faced, I'm not, you know, I don't  know a single man who faced with that allegation, who he (ph) thought he  could squelch it wouldn't pay the person off because it does incalculable  damage to your reputation, whether you're running for anything or not. </p><p>And so, that's - it's so clearly not a campaign violation that I wonder if  we want to set this precedent. Do you want to live in a world where people  paying off extortion attempts are now campaign finance felons? I mean this  is lunatic.</p><p>HAHN: This is strike--</p><p>CARLSON: And you know it.</p><p>HAHN: --this - this is strikingly similar to what happened to John Edwards.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, and it's awful. It's awful what happened to--</p><p>HAHN: I'm not saying the President will be convicted but--</p><p>CARLSON: --John Edwards--</p><p>HAHN: --this is strikingly--</p><p>CARLSON: --I thought.</p><p>HAHN: --similar--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, it is. It is.</p><p>HAHN: --situation.</p><p>CARLSON: And what happened to him was--</p><p>HAHN: And it is something, look--</p><p>CARLSON: --wrong. It was another populace--</p><p>HAHN: --well--</p><p>CARLSON: --they took out with this BS campaign finance nonsense, exactly  what happened.</p><p>HAHN: --look, it is more than--</p><p>CARLSON: And, you know (ph), we're out of time.</p><p>HAHN: --campaign finance law.</p><p>CARLSON: --no.</p><p>HAHN: It's more than campaign finance law.</p><p>CARLSON: No, it's not.</p><p>HAHN: It is the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.</p><p>CARLSON: No, it's a totally separate thing.</p><p>HAHN: That in and of itself is a problem-- </p><p>CARLSON: Look, if - if he violated that I will (ph) defend it.</p><p>HAHN: Well, yes. And then (ph) also alleged by Cohen is--</p><p>CARLSON: But in this case, this is made-up.</p><p>HAHN: --also part of this.</p><p>CARLSON: All right, Chris Hahn, thank you.</p><p>HAHN: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Good to see you.</p><p>One of the most hysterical reactions in the past few days came from a  former Obama Administration U.S. Attorney, who says the President should be  stripped of his office.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARBARA MCQUADE, FORMER UNITED STATES ATTORNEY FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT  OF  MICHIGAN, PROFESSOR OF LAW AT UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN LAW SCHOOL, LEGAL  ANALYST FOR NBC NEWS AND MSNBC: It could be that President Trump procured  the presidency by fraud. </p><p>When immigrants procure their citizenship by fraud, we strip them of their  citizenship. When a president procures his presidency by fraud, should we  consider doing the same?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Alan Dershowitz is, of course, a retired Harvard Law School  professor. He's the Author of the book, The Case Against Impeaching Trump,  and he joins us tonight.</p><p>Professor, I got a couple questions. But the first relates just to the  sound bite we played. Is there a provision in the Constitution for  stripping, whatever that means, stripping the presidency from a President  who you think is illegitimate, whatever that means?</p><p>ALAN MORTON DERSHOWITZ, LAWYER, THE CASE AGAINST IMPEACHING TRUMP  AUTHOR,  HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR EMERITUS: Sure. It's called the 25th Amendment, but  not on the grounds of illegitimacy. I want everyone out there to imagine  the following scenario. </p><p>Let's assume when Bill Clinton was running for president, Paula Jones came  up to him and said, \"Unless you pay me a $130,000, I'll reveal our affair.\" </p><p>And let's assume, Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, together, did exactly  what it's alleged that Donald Trump and Cohen did together, I guarantee you  The New York Times, NBC, MSNBC would be railing against any prosecutor who  dared to suggest that this was a violation of the campaign (ph) finance  law. Everybody would be on the other side of this issue. </p><p>There'd be Republicans out there saying, \"Strip him of the presidency,  impeach him, indict him.\" Every Democrat would be saying this is a witch- hunt, this is terrible. We need a single standard. If you wouldn't go after  Bill Clinton, don't go after Donald Trump. </p><p>If you're going after Donald Trump, then you have to go after Hillary  Clinton for everything that she allegedly did. For example, one of your  guests talked about a Federal Corrupt Practices Act. That applies when you  bribe a foreign official.</p><p>What they're arguing is that there was a rumor that maybe somebody offered  Putin a penthouse in a Tower that Trump was thinking of building in Moscow.  And if that had been done, it would be a violation of the FCPA, Federal  Corrupt Practices Act. </p><p>But it's all based on hypotheticals and maybes. And I just want everybody  to apply the shoe on the other foot test. If Hillary Clinton were  president, the Republicans were saying, \"Lock her up,\" everybody would be  on the other side. They'd be screaming about how dare you expand criminal  statutes, how dare you expand the criteria for impeachment? </p><p>Now, all these liberal Democrat fair-weather civil libertarians are saying,  \"The hell with the Constitution, the hell with civil liberties, put all  that aside, get Trump.\" That's the most important consideration. Get him by  any means possible. This is such a danger to our constitutional system that  I would hope that true civil libertarians would rebel against that, as I  am.</p><p>CARLSON: Is - is it unfair to describe this scenario as extortion? I say I  know something about your sex life. I know a secret about you that you want  to keep the - that's non-criminal (ph), but that you want to keep hidden.  And unless you pay me money, I'm going to reveal it. That seems like  textbook extortion to me. Why is it not?</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: It is absolutely textbook extortion. And there ought to be a  prosecution of any person, man or woman, who approaches any candidate or  anybody else and says, \"Unless you pay me money, I'm going to reveal a sex  act that occurred.\" That is absolute classic extortion. </p><p>And it's shocking that the Special Counsel looking into this, who has a  broad mandate, he described it very broadly, isn't looking into the  extortion committed by, at least, the porn star, whose lawyer obviously  approached the candidate or the candidate's people, and threatened  exposure.</p><p>Otherwise, why would you pay? Just listen to the tape. The tape makes that  clear. The tape that Cohen made unwittingly of President Trump, it's clear  that they were paying off an extortion--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: --in order to prevent these issues from coming out for multiple  reasons, to protect his family, to protect his brand--</p><p>CARLSON: Sure.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: --possibly, to influence the campaign. </p><p>Let's remember one more thing. A President can contribute to a candidate as  much as he wants. If - if Bloomberg runs for president, he could announce  tomorrow, \"I'm not taking a nickel. I'm putting $1 billion of my own money  into this campaign.\" </p><p>That's perfectly legitimate. As far as reporting is concerned, it's the  campaign that has to report. And if these payments had to be reported, they  had to be reported after the election, the reporting time was after the  election so, it couldn't have impacted the election.</p><p>So, the absurd notion that he won the presidency by fraud and should be  stripped of the presidency (ph) reflects incredible ignorance about the  timing here, and how these statutes operate.</p><p>CARLSON: This is getting so crazy, it's - it's making my head spin. I  appreciate your coming on and explaining that to us, professor. Thank you  very much.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Well we've been saying it for a couple of years. Now, we have hard  scientific evidence that, in fact, big tech is altering and harming the  brains of children. Is it time to do something about that? What if we knew  it was true? Well we do know it's true now. We've got details next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TEXT: TECH TYRANNY.</p><p>CARLSON: Well Google collects more data than probably any other company,  and probably knows more about you than you do. You think this might raise  some concerns about the concentration of power. </p><p>But, for years, Congress seems to have cared not at all either because they  were ideologically predisposed to Google or because they were in its  pocket. Meanwhile, Google became more and more powerful, ominously  powerful. </p><p>Now, finally, during the lame-duck session, Congress has summoned the CEO  of Google, Sundar Pichai, to answer some questions about data transparency,  coming to Capitol Hill this week. What should Congress ask him about?</p><p>Harmeet Dhillon has followed this issue maybe more closely than any other  attorney in the United States, and she joins us tonight. Harmeet, thank you  very much for coming on. So what--</p><p>HARMEET DHILLON, AMERICAN LAWYER, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL LAWYERS  ASSOCIATION  BOARD MEMBER, FORMER VICE CHAIRWOMAN OF THE CALIFORNIA REPUBLICAN PARTY,  AND THE NATIONAL COMMITTEEWOMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE  FOR  CALIFORNIA: Hi, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: --what should be the - the list of questions?</p><p>DHILLON: Well, this is only a subset of the issues that people should be  asking Google that is the subject of the testimony tomorrow. But Google,  for years, as you pointed out, has been collecting data, and not disclosing  to users, number one, the extent of the collection of the data or what  they're doing with the data.</p><p>We have also learned of significant breaches, including today, an  announcement of a major breach of 52.5 million users on the Google+ failed  experiment in social media. It's not clear when that happened. </p><p>Google is not disclosing to people exactly what happened and what use has  been made of it. And they, as you pointed out, they just get away with it,  because we have both effete politicians in Washington, even on the  Republican side, and government agencies whose tasks it is to examine these  issues, and protect consumers. So, consumers are really at a complete loss. </p><p>Now, what I expect to happen on Capitol Hill tomorrow is that there'll be  some posturing questions written by staffers that Members of Congress are  going to read out, and you're going to have some focus group tested  jargony, you know, in - incomprehensible responses from Sundar Pichai  designed to placate these folks.</p><p>There'll be a little bit of a dance and everybody will go home, not  understanding what the answers were, and not probably going to do anything  about it. And this is a real tragedy and missed opportunity, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: What a shame? I want to (ph) ask you another story, another  element of the Google story. </p><p>Newly leaked email show that several Google employees plotted to destroy  the news site, Breitbart, after the 2016 election, a secret internal  discussion group labeled Resist. Google employees discussed how they could  use the, quote, hate speech and fake news labels to justify cutting off  Breitbart's ad revenues.</p><p>Harmeet, this is kind of the stuff of Conservative fever dreams that Google  would be actually doing something like this. Are you surprised by it? And  what can be done, in response?</p><p>DHILLON: Well Google - A, I'm not surprised. B, Google is denying it. But  there's extensive evidence that Google did this, and they did it in two  ways. </p><p>One way is right after the election, as you mentioned, a number of very  excitable Left-wing Google executives and employees tried to squeeze  Breitbart and other Conservative outlets into this hate speech category.</p><p>They then confessed that after a lot of effort that was really tough. So,  they also did a two-pronged approach, and the other side of that approach  is having their ad people contact customers and tell them that it might be  dangerous or a bad idea to advertise or allow their ads to be placed on  Conservative news websites like Breitbart and others.</p><p>And they pointed to some outside groups like Sleeping Giant that makes it a  - a business practice of defaming Conservative writers and organizations,  and use that as a smear. </p><p>Google also does this in many other ways like through its YouTube. It  categorizes content as sensitive, which automatically, both, makes it hard  to find the content online, and also strips that content from the ability  to gain advertising revenue.</p><p>So, Google is doing this systematically. Google is doing this purposefully.  Google is getting away with doing this. And I think it violates not just  some laws, including Communications Decency Act and others, but it - it  violates state laws that have to do with fraud and transparency, unfair  business practices and competition.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>DHILLON: Again, Google is able to get away with this because, you know,  they - they contribute to some Conservative groups like CPAC, lot of money  to show up at CPAC, and - and certainly on Capitol Hill. </p><p>They get away with it, and we see nothing done to control this - this, you  know, duopoly and monopoly on advertising revenue. It's very dangerous  because it's shaping what young people in America, who mainly get their  news through--</p><p>CARLSON: Of course.</p><p>DHILLON: --Google see every day.</p><p>CARLSON: Looking back, the Congress allowing Google to become more powerful  than the U.S. government, subverting our democracy entirely, that'll be the  thing we hold Members responsible for, I think, historically. </p><p>Harmeet Dhillon, you will not be held responsible since you're a lonely  voice on the right side, thank you for joining us, as always.</p><p>DHILLON: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Meanwhile, we've been saying it for years. Now, there is hard  scientific evidence that big tech is, in fact, harming our children. </p><p>New 60 Minutes report this week highlighted research that shows children  who use tablet smartphones and other screens more than seven hours a day,  and that's a lot of kids, believe it or not, are developing different brain  structures. Their brains are being damaged by this. </p><p>Tom Kersting is a psychotherapist, who's written extensively on this  subject, and he joins us tonight. You must feel vindicated by this report,  Tom.</p><p>TOM KERSTING, PSYCHOTHERAPIST, DISCONNECTED AUTHOR: I do. I do. I'm  actually happy to see it, to be honest with you because--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --it's something I've been speaking about for so many years at  lectures and in my book. And now, we could finally have some scientific  preliminary evidence showing exactly what all of this tech is doing to the  brain.</p><p>CARLSON: So, what is it doing?</p><p>KERSTING: Well, first of all, the area of the brain called the cortex,  which is the outer layer of the brain, the preliminary study that the - the  research has conducted, shows a - a premature thinning of that part of the  brain, OK, which is - which is kind of frightening, considering the  importance of that part of the brain, what it does, how it's very important  just for human beings in terms of organizing, planning, and a host of other  different things.</p><p>Another component that you don't hear much about is something called  neuroplasticity, which is actually the greatest breakthrough in modern day  psychology. And the term plasticity meaning that the brain, although very  strong and rigid, can be molded and shaped if placed in - in the right  environment for three or more hours per day. </p><p>We know that the average kid is spending nine hours a day, on average, in  what I consider to be the most highly stimulating of worlds. And what  happens is the brain will actually grow new neural pathways, it'll re- organize its circuitry to adapt to that cyber world.</p><p>And the problem is what I'm seeing clinically is an unadapting of - of  young kids in a real world having a very difficult time coping with just  the trivial nuances of life, the anxiety disorders, the depressions, and so  forth.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. Well and it's all kinds of measurements are showing the  horrifying results of it. How young, exactly, are kids getting addicted?</p><p>KERSTING: Well, we're seeing right now that there's some - some research  that came out recently that there - there's the kids as - as young as two  years old showing signs of depression. And, right now, the average age for  first smartphone issuance is about age 10.</p><p>And, you know, when I give lectures, every parent knows that this is bad.  But it's sort of, you know, what you talk about it you love (ph) the - the  term groupthink. I - I use the term social conformity. </p><p>We tend to do what everybody else is doing. And parents, anybody listening,  you have got to do what is in the best interest of your child, not - not  what everybody else around you is doing.</p><p>CARLSON: So, can you just give me the 20-second answer to the question I  always ask you, which is why are we so passive in the face of this? If two- year-olds were huffing on Marlboros, we'd say, \"You know what? No, not  allowed.\" But we just sort of sit back and let our society collapse in the  face of this, why?</p><p>KERSTING: Well, the reason, in my opinion, the reason why is - and we talk  about - I always talk about common sense, all right? </p><p>It's pretty clear, if we go walk around and everybody's got their heads  buried in a device all day long, you pull up to a traffic light, and they  can't even contain themselves for a minute without looking at their device,  it's pretty clear that it's having an impact on their behavior.</p><p>Now, the reason why nobody is--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --doing anything about it is because we're always looking for  scientific evidence, all right, and now we have some of it, and we're going  to start seeing a lot more of it. And--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --and we're going to start seeing some changes, as a result,  Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, and it's we waited too long for the studies to confirm the  obvious. Tom, thank you very much.</p><p>KERSTING: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, Hollywood doesn't need to remake 1984 again, not that they  would, it's probably illegal.

He apologized back in 2015. The  Academy Award people wanted him to apologize again. He refused.</p><p>Now, the show is going to be carried by ABC. ABC parent company is Disney.  Disney also owns ESPN. They've employed Keith Olbermann, who is a - a Trump  hater from way back. And just last year, he tweeted that Trump was a Nazi  and dropped a bunch of F-bombs in his tweet. That didn't seem to bother  Disney. But Kevin Hart has to go.</p><p>The other inconsistency, of course, is that other comedians like Amy  Schumer, who last year, I think it was, hosted a Democratic fundraiser, has  used the - the F-word for gays in a tweet, as has Sarah Silverman, as has  Chelsea Handler, all of whom have hosted shows.</p><p>And finally, you have the instance of Joy Ann Reid on MSNBC who had a blog  2007, 2008--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>ELDER: --a very anti-gay post she made, and she wasn't joking, she wasn't a  comedian, including dissing the movie Brokeback Mountain, and said she  hated watching men kiss. She then said she apologized. </p><p>Then, later on, she said she was hacked. NBC did a search to find out  whether or not she'd been hacked. Turned out she wasn't hacked. So, she  either misremembered or lied, and then apologized again. She has a show on  MSNBC. So, forgive Kevin Hart for not - for not knowing what the rules are.</p><p>CARLSON: Well that's and - so, but what's the best response? I think you're  absolutely right. All of us at some point are going to be accused of  thoughtcrime, and the mob will come for us. It's inevitable.</p><p>ELDER: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: How do we respond? What's the best way to respond?</p><p>ELDER: You do them on a case-by-case basis. The man apologized, said he had  grown. The - the most horrific tweet was saying that if he came home and  saw his son playing with his daughter's dollhouse, he'd break the dollhouse  over his head. He later on said, he apologized, he's grown as a man--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>ELDER: --and perhaps the tweet had to do with his own insecurities as a  man. So, I think that's what you do. You apologize, be sincere, and then  keep going. </p><p>But if people keep beating you over the - over the head over it over and  over again, they're not going to forgive you, I'm not sure what the point  is, which is why I believe that Kevin Hart was morally justified in saying,  I've already apologized, I'm not going to apologize again.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>ELDER: I'm a 40-year old man. I've apologized. I've grown, let it alone.</p><p>CARLSON: I mean what happens to a society where the mob feels it has  ultimate authority on judgment? No one believes in God, so they have to  make their own judgments, hard and fast judgments--</p><p>ELDER: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --and no forgiveness is allowed.</p><p>ELDER: Yes. And what happens to a society that's - that's so inconsistent?  For example, Kanye West--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>ELDER: --is being called an Uncle Tom and a Token, a House Negro. That  doesn't seem to bother anybody. </p><p>You got a guy in like Al Sharpton, who's got a show where he's referred to  gays as - as homos in the - in years past, Jews as interlopers. He - he  falsely accused a White man of raping a Black teenager, he has a show on  television, you know, every weekend.</p><p>So, you know, I'm not quite sure what to say, Tucker, other than it's  terribly inconsistent. It seem to me there's one rule for people who are  Conservative and one rule for people--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>ELDER: --who are on the Left.</p><p>CARLSON: I think it's best just to ignore the noise to the extent you can.  I mean they have an awful lot of power. You know, they'll de-platform you  in a second. Larry Elder--</p><p>ELDER: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --we're rooting for you.</p><p>ELDER: Thank you. I need--</p><p>CARLSON: If they ever try to leave you, you'd (ph)--</p><p>ELDER: --I could use the help.</p><p>CARLSON: --always have a home on this show. Good to see you.</p><p>ELDER: I could use the help. Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you.</p><p>Well China just launched a new persecution of the country's Christians.  Will anyone in Washington care? Are they too busy taking Chinese money?</p><p>Plus, Paris continues to be convulsed by the worst riots there in 50 years.  What are these riots about? You know what they're about. They're about the  Paris Climate Treaty, the spirit of it, anyway. And policies they want here  are being rejected by both Left and Right in France, and they're ignoring  it because it's too inconvenient to pay attention. Details ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TEXT: THE CHINA THREAT.</p><p>CARLSON: China has launched a new crackdown. How many news stories begin  with that sentence, \"China has launched a new crackdown?\" Many. And they  have, once again, launched new crackdown, this time, on their country's  underground Christian community.</p><p>In a coordinated sweep of nighttime raids, police rounded up about a 100  members and the pastor of the Early Rain Covenant Church. Because the  church does not submit to government control, it is illegal in China. And  members have been forbidden from attending services.</p><p>It's just the latest in a persecution wave that has shut down several  different churches with thousands of Christian members. This is what actual  religious oppression looks like, but a ruling class that's seen (ph) people  who boycott North Carolina over its bathroom laws don't care at all. </p><p>None of them are calling for boycotts or sanctions on China. There's no  witch-hunt against the countless universities, businesses, and lobbyists  with massive financial ties to China, and its authoritarian regime.</p><p>In fact, to our ruling class, China is the future. If anything, it's a  country we ought to emulate. So remember that, next time they try to  lecture you about how their values are better than yours.</p><p>The war in Afghanistan, as you well know, has continued for 17 years. It's  the longest war in the history of this country. We're still spending  billions there. American soldiers are still dying there. It might all be  worth it if we were still fighting for victory. But are we fighting for  victory?</p><p>In a newly leaked audiotape, former NATO Commander, Stanley McChrystal,  tells Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, how the war in Afghanistan should be  fought. </p><p>It's not exactly the opening speech from Patton. \"My best suggestion,\" he  says, \"Is to keep a limited number of forces there and just kind of muddle  along, and see what we can do.\"</p><p>Now, muddle along is not a strategy for anything, much less a victory. It's  a strategy to waste American money and lives for no reason at all. If U.S.  troops are going to muddle along in a war, maybe it's a sign that's a war  we shouldn't be fighting in the first place.</p><p>Well, if you can remember back a year-and-a-half, on June 1st, 2017, the  President announced he was pulling this country out of the Paris Climate  Accords. To hear the politicians and television news chintuggers (ph)  react, you'd think it was the worst natural catastrophe, well, ever.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NANCY PELOSI, MINORITY LEADER OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF  REPRESENTATIVES, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA: What happened yesterday on the  climate issue is an embarrassment to our country and it should be an  embarrassment to him personally for how he answers to his grandchildren.</p><p>GOV. JERRY BROWN (D), CALIFORNIA: People are going to die. Habitat will be  destroyed. Seas will rise. Insects will spread.</p><p>FAREED RAFIQ ZAKARIA, CNN'S FAREED ZAKARIA GPS HOST, POLITICAL SCIENTIST,  AUTHOR, COLUMNIST: This will be the day that the United States resigned as  the leader of the free world.</p><p>JOHN KERRY, FORMER UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE: He is not helping the  forgotten American. He is hurting them. Their kids will have worse asthma  in the summer.</p><p>The President who talked about putting America first has now put America  last.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: These people are so stupid. It's amazing they have jobs. The  economy must be pretty strong, in fact, if those people have health  insurance. One thing they said though is true. </p><p>People were hurt, but not because we pulled out, but because other  countries kept to the terms of the Paris Climate Accord, including France. </p><p>This fall, France began to implement a gas tax to fight climate change  inspired by that agreement. Now, for the fourth weekend in a row, the city  of Paris has been rocked by riots and mass protests. The city is burning  and shows no signs of stopping. </p><p>What did this? Progressive climate policy. Will the people who formulated  it ever admit it? Of course, not. They're too invested.</p><p>Well the press, all of a sudden, doing everything it can to kill Elizabeth  Warren's presidential campaign before it even begins. That's kind of  interesting. Is this a mercy killing or something else going on?</p><p>Mark Steyn joins us to unravel a delightful mystery, after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ELIZABETH ANN WARREN, SENIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, MASSACHUSETTS: Now, the  President likes to call my mom a liar. What do the facts say?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The facts suggest that you absolutely have a Native  American ancestor in your pedigree.</p><p>WARREN: OK.</p><p>And Trump can say whatever he wants about me, but mocking Native Americans  or any group in order to try to get at me? That's not what America stands  for.</p><p>I'm not enrolled in a tribe and only tribes determine tribal citizenship. I  understand and respect that distinction. But my family history is my family  history.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: I mean (ph) you really just can't watch that enough. It really  should be a screensaver. This hasn't, understatement of the day, been the  fall Elizabeth Warren had hoped for. </p><p>She thought that releasing a DNA test showing that she might have had a  lone American Indian ancestor, not necessarily from this continent, a few  hundred years ago would silence the President and give her momentum going  into the primaries next year.</p><p>Instead, even the Left is turning on her. Two pieces in the Washington Post  and The New York Times in the past week suggests that Warren's campaign has  been deeply, maybe even fatally, wounded by the blunder of the DNA test. </p><p>Looks almost like an effort to kill Elizabeth Warren's campaign before she  can embarrass her party, the one to which everyone in the media belongs,  before she actually runs.</p><p>Mark Steyn is an Author and Columnist. Not a conspiracy not, I'll run this  by him anyway. So, what is going on? </p><p>So, obviously, she is a media creation, not a genius, but she has been the  subject of endless fawning profiles in the press, particularly from the  Boston Globe, which has promoted her for years, and now they're attacking  her, why?</p><p>MARK STEYN, AUTHOR, COLUMNIST, STEYNONLINE.COM: Yes. That's - that's  interesting. The Boston Globe is saying you - to Elizabeth Warren, you have  to know when not to run. And this is the paper that's wanted her to run  until she took--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --until she got head-faked into taking this DNA test that showed she  was 1/1024th Native American, which is less Native American than the  average. </p><p>I mean you could test Kim Jong-un, Vladimir Putin, and they would - they  would be more than 1/1024th Native American just because some Cherokee  happened to change trains in Odessa in - in 1852, and got lucky with one of  the porters. </p><p>I mean any - every - anyone's more Native American. And what's fascinating- -</p><p>CARLSON: Ha-ha.</p><p>STEYN: --what's fascinating about this is that this - Elizabeth Warren was  a test on the limits of Democrat identity politics because their recent  presidential candidates have been sold on identity politics, but in rather  strange ways. </p><p>So, Barack Obama is an African-American. But he has nothing to do with the  Black slave experience or Civil Rights.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>STEYN: He's - he's Black just because his father happened to be a British  subject born in Colonial Kenya. Barack Obama was actually the first child  of British subjects to be President, I believe, since Andrew Jackson. So,  he tried to get himself in on the colonial thing. </p><p>Obama said his step-grandfather in Indonesia had died fighting Dutch  soldiers in the struggle for independence. In fact, it turned out his step- grandfather died when he fell off a chair while changing the drapes. That's  not a joke. That's actually true. That's how his step-grandfather died.</p><p>Then you have Hillary Clinton, who's running as a feminist icon and is, in  fact, only the candidate because she's the wife of the previous guy, and  she was given a Senate seat as a reward for standing by him, when his  intern's dress wound up in the FBI crime analysis lab - lab.</p><p>So, we have very--</p><p>CARLSON: Ha-ha.</p><p>STEYN: --so in such a world, you can't blame Elizabeth Warren for saying,  \"Well, if Hillary could be a feminist icon, why can't I be the first Native  American President?\" </p><p>She was Harvard Law School's first woman of color. That's why it's not a  family law thing. She actually was promoted as Harvard Law School's first  woman of color. Why shouldn't she be America's first - first Native  American President?</p><p>CARLSON: Such a good (ph)--</p><p>STEYN: Since this is (ph)-- </p><p>CARLSON: --such a good example (ph).</p><p>STEYN: --none - none of this identity politics. Joe Biden should run as the  first transgender woman candidate and dare the Democrat electorate to call  him on it.</p><p>CARLSON: That was my plan.</p><p>STEYN: I mean this is this (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: I hope he doesn't get there first.</p><p>STEYN: --no don't (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: I'm doing that (ph). You're the best.</p><p>STEYN: Yes (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: Mark Steyn, we're out of time.</p><p>STEYN: Thanks a lot, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: I loved it. Thank you.</p><p>STEYN: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Man that was fun. Back tomorrow, 8 P.M., show that is the sworn  enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and, especially, groupthink. Good night  from Washington.

Companies would need permission to release such information. If it takes effect, a law would also likely shrink Big Tech's profits from its lucrative business of making personal data available to advertisers so they can pinpoint specific consumers to target.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Behind the drive for a law is rising concern over private data being compromised or distributed by Facebook, Google and other tech giants that have earned riches from collecting and distributing consumer information. The industry traditionally has been lightly regulated and has resisted closer oversight as a threat to its culture of free-wheeling innovation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Support for a privacy law is part of a broader effort by regulators and lawmakers to lessen the domination of companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon. Some, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic presidential candidate, have called for the tech giants to be split up .</p><p>The Trump White House has said in the past that it could endorse a broad data privacy law.</p><p>The big tech companies have been nervously eyeing a tough privacy law taking effect next year in California. That measure will allow Californians to see the personal data being collected on them and where it's being distributed and to forbid the sale of it. With some exceptions, consumers could also request that their personal information be deleted entirely.</p><p>Whatever federal privacy law eventually emerges is expected to be less stringent than the California measure and to supersede it. As a result, the tech industry is trying to help shape any national restrictions.</p><p>\"This is the first time ever that the industry wants legislation,\" said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a privacy advocacy group. \"The industry is terrified.\"</p><p>On Tuesday, a House committee will press Google and Facebook executives about another urgent concern involving Big Tech: Whether they're doing enough to curb the spread of hate crimes and white nationalism through online platforms. The Judiciary Committee hearing follows a series of violent incidents fueled in part by online communication.</p><p>Facebook, used by 2-billion-plus people including over 200 million in the U.S., has been a particular lightning rod for industry critics. Having had its reputation tarnished over data privacy lapses, a tide of hate speech and a spread of disinformation that allowed Russian agents to target propaganda campaigns, Facebook appears ready to embrace a national privacy law.</p><p>Facebook's founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, published a column last month in the Washington Post calling for tighter regulations to protect consumer data, control harmful content and ensure election integrity and data portability.</p><p>\"The internet,\" Zuckerberg wrote, \"needs new rules.\"</p><p>Amazon says it has built its business on protecting people's information, \"and we have been working with policymakers on how best to do that.\"</p><p>\"There is real momentum to develop baseline rules of the road for data protection,\" Google's chief privacy officer, Keith Enright, has said in a policy paper. \"Google welcomes this and supports comprehensive, baseline privacy regulation.\"</p><p>A sweeping \"privacy shield\" law in the European Union, covering how tech companies handle personal data in the 28-country bloc, should be a model, Zuckerberg wrote. EU regulators recently fined Google $1.7 billion for freezing out rivals in the online ad business - their third penalty against the search giant in two years. The EU watchdogs have also ordered Apple and Amazon to pay back taxes and fined Facebook for providing misleading information in its acquisition of WhatsApp.</p><p>On Monday, Britain unveiled plans to vastly increase government oversight of social media companies, with a watchdog that could fine executives or even ban companies that fail to block such content as terrorist propaganda and images of child abuse.</p><p>The entire debate cuts to the heart of Big Tech's hugely profitable commerce in online users' personal data. The companies gather vast data on what users read and like and leverage it to help advertisers target their messages to the individuals they want to reach. Facebook drew 99% of its revenue from advertising last year. For Google's parent Alphabet, it was 85%, according to Scott Kessler of the research firm CFRA.</p><p>Amazon, too, doesn't just sell products online; it provides ad space, too. The company doesn't say how much but has said that the \"other\" revenue in its financial reports is mainly from ads. Its \"other\" revenue topped $10 billion last year, more than double what it was in 2017.</p><p>The tech giants' problematic relationship with advertisers was spotlighted by action regulators took last month. The Department of Housing and Urban Development filed civil charges against Facebook, accusing it of allowing landlords and real estate brokers to exclude certain racial or ethnic groups from seeing ads for houses and apartments. Facebook could face penalties.</p><p>The company has separately agreed to overhaul its ad targeting system and end some of the practices noted by HUD to prevent discrimination in housing listings as well as credit and employment ads. That move was part of a settlement with the American Civil Liberties Union and other activists.</p><p>Besides crafting a bipartisan data-privacy measure in Congress, lawmakers are considering restoring Obama-era rules that formerly barred internet providers - like AT&amp;;T, Verizon and Comcast - from discriminating against certain technologies and services.</p><p>Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., has proposed fines and jail time for executives of companies guilty of data breaches.</p><p>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable, representing CEOs of major companies, have presented their own proposals to curb privacy abuses. At the same time, President Donald Trump has echoed complaints from some conservative lawmakers and commentators that the big tech platforms are politically tilted against them.</p><p>\"Facebook, Twitter and Google are so biased toward the Dems it is ridiculous!\" he has tweeted. And he told a rally crowd, \"We're not going to let them control what we can and cannot see, read and learn from.\"</p><p>Tech executives and many Democrats have rejected those assertions as themselves politically biased. Still, Trump has threatened to push regulators to investigate whether Google has abused its role as an internet gateway to stifle competition. And referring to Amazon, Facebook and Google, Trump told Bloomberg News, \"Many people think it is a very antitrust situation, the three of them.\"</p><p>Among the tech giants that are trying to shape any final restrictions is the chipmaker Intel, which has developed its own legislative proposal.</p><p>\"I think it's likely we are going to pass a national privacy law by the end of 2020,\" David Hoffman, Intel's associate general counsel and global privacy officer, said in an interview.</p><p>By then, the privacy measure emerging in California will have taken effect.</p><p>\"The California bill is responsible for 90% of the lobbying and political pressure to pass a national law,\" said Robert Atkinson of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, whose board includes tech executives.</p><p>Four senators - Republicans Roger Wicker of Mississippi and Jerry Moran of Kansas and Democrats Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Brian Schatz of Hawaii - are working on a national measure. They say it would protect consumers from the abuse of their data and provide legal certainty to ensure that tech companies continue to hire and innovate.</p><p>\"It would be nice,\" said Wicker, who leads the key Senate Commerce Committee, \"to have it on the president's desk this year.\"</p><p>--</p><p>AP Technology Writer Anick Jesdanun in New York contributed to this report. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

Companies would need permission to release such information. If it takes effect, a law would also likely shrink Big Tech's profits from its lucrative business of making personal data available to advertisers so they can pinpoint specific consumers to target.</p><p>Behind the drive for a law is rising concern over private data being compromised or distributed by Facebook, Google and other tech giants that have earned riches from collecting and distributing consumer information. The industry traditionally has been lightly regulated and has resisted closer oversight as a threat to its culture of free-wheeling innovation.</p><p>Support for a privacy law is part of a broader effort by regulators and lawmakers to lessen the domination of companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon. Some, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic presidential candidate, have called for the tech giants to be split up .</p><p>The Trump White House has said in the past that it could endorse a broad data privacy law.</p><p>The big tech companies have been nervously eyeing a tough privacy law taking effect next year in California. That measure will allow Californians to see the personal data being collected on them and where it's being distributed and to forbid the sale of it. With some exceptions, consumers could also request that their personal information be deleted entirely.</p><p>Whatever federal privacy law eventually emerges is expected to be less stringent than the California measure and to supersede it. As a result, the tech industry is trying to help shape any national restrictions.</p><p>\"This is the first time ever that the industry wants legislation,\" said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a privacy advocacy group. \"The industry is terrified.\"</p><p>On Tuesday, a House committee will press Google and Facebook executives about another urgent concern involving Big Tech: Whether they're doing enough to curb the spread of hate crimes and white nationalism through online platforms. The Judiciary Committee hearing follows a series of violent incidents fueled in part by online communication.</p><p>Facebook, used by 2-billion-plus people including over 200 million in the U.S., has been a particular lightning rod for industry critics. Having had its reputation tarnished over data privacy lapses, a tide of hate speech and a spread of disinformation that allowed Russian agents to target propaganda campaigns, Facebook appears ready to embrace a national privacy law.</p><p>Facebook's founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, published a column last month in the Washington Post calling for tighter regulations to protect consumer data, control harmful content and ensure election integrity and data portability.</p><p>\"The internet,\" Zuckerberg wrote, \"needs new rules.\"</p><p>Amazon says it has built its business on protecting people's information, \"and we have been working with policymakers on how best to do that.\"</p><p>\"There is real momentum to develop baseline rules of the road for data protection,\" Google's chief privacy officer, Keith Enright, has said in a policy paper. \"Google welcomes this and supports comprehensive, baseline privacy regulation.\"</p><p>A sweeping \"privacy shield\" law in the European Union, covering how tech companies handle personal data in the 28-country bloc, should be a model, Zuckerberg wrote. EU regulators recently fined Google $1.7 billion for freezing out rivals in the online ad business - their third penalty against the search giant in two years. The EU watchdogs have also ordered Apple and Amazon to pay back taxes and fined Facebook for providing misleading information in its acquisition of WhatsApp.</p><p>On Monday, Britain unveiled plans to vastly increase government oversight of social media companies, with a watchdog that could fine executives or even ban companies that fail to block such content as terrorist propaganda and images of child abuse.</p><p>The entire debate cuts to the heart of Big Tech's hugely profitable commerce in online users' personal data. The companies gather vast data on what users read and like and leverage it to help advertisers target their messages to the individuals they want to reach. Facebook drew 99% of its revenue from advertising last year. For Google's parent Alphabet, it was 85%, according to Scott Kessler of the research firm CFRA.</p><p>Amazon, too, doesn't just sell products online; it provides ad space, too. The company doesn't say how much but has said that the \"other\" revenue in its financial reports is mainly from ads. Its \"other\" revenue topped $10 billion last year, more than double what it was in 2017.</p><p>The tech giants' problematic relationship with advertisers was spotlighted by action regulators took last month. The Department of Housing and Urban Development filed civil charges against Facebook, accusing it of allowing landlords and real estate brokers to exclude certain racial or ethnic groups from seeing ads for houses and apartments. Facebook could face penalties.</p><p>The company has separately agreed to overhaul its ad targeting system and end some of the practices noted by HUD to prevent discrimination in housing listings as well as credit and employment ads. That move was part of a settlement with the American Civil Liberties Union and other activists.</p><p>Besides crafting a bipartisan data-privacy measure in Congress, lawmakers are considering restoring Obama-era rules that formerly barred internet providers - like AT&amp;;T, Verizon and Comcast - from discriminating against certain technologies and services.</p><p>Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., has proposed fines and jail time for executives of companies guilty of data breaches.</p><p>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable, representing CEOs of major companies, have presented their own proposals to curb privacy abuses. At the same time, President Donald Trump has echoed complaints from some conservative lawmakers and commentators that the big tech platforms are politically tilted against them.</p><p>\"Facebook, Twitter and Google are so biased toward the Dems it is ridiculous!\" he has tweeted. And he told a rally crowd, \"We're not going to let them control what we can and cannot see, read and learn from.\"</p><p>Tech executives and many Democrats have rejected those assertions as themselves politically biased. Still, Trump has threatened to push regulators to investigate whether Google has abused its role as an internet gateway to stifle competition. And referring to Amazon, Facebook and Google, Trump told Bloomberg News, \"Many people think it is a very antitrust situation, the three of them.\"</p><p>Among the tech giants that are trying to shape any final restrictions is the chipmaker Intel, which has developed its own legislative proposal.</p><p>\"I think it's likely we are going to pass a national privacy law by the end of 2020,\" David Hoffman, Intel's associate general counsel and global privacy officer, said in an interview.</p><p>By then, the privacy measure emerging in California will have taken effect.</p><p>\"The California bill is responsible for 90% of the lobbying and political pressure to pass a national law,\" said Robert Atkinson of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, whose board includes tech executives.</p><p>Four senators - Republicans Roger Wicker of Mississippi and Jerry Moran of Kansas and Democrats Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Brian Schatz of Hawaii - are working on a national measure. They say it would protect consumers from the abuse of their data and provide legal certainty to ensure that tech companies continue to hire and innovate.</p><p>\"It would be nice,\" said Wicker, who leads the key Senate Commerce Committee, \"to have it on the president's desk this year.\"</p><p>--</p><p>AP Technology Writer Anick Jesdanun in New York contributed to this report. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

Now, Congressional Democrats are offering up an Algorithmic Accountability Act of 2019, an expansive and ambitious new take on how to regulate automated decision-making. Whether or not it becomes law, it's a necessary effort to reassert human control as opaque algorithms take over bureaucratic processes.</p><p>Algorithms are being used everywhere: in credit decisions, mortgages, insurance rates, who gets a job, which kids get into college and how long criminal defendants go to prison to name a few proliferating examples. Messy, complicated human decisions are being made, typically without an explanation or a chance to appeal, by artificial intelligence systems. They provide efficiency, profitability, and, often, a sense of scientific precision and authority.</p><p>The problem is that this authority has been bestowed too hastily. Algorithms are increasingly found to be making mistakes. Whether it's a sexist hiring algorithm developed by Amazon, conspiracy theories promoted by the Google search engine or an IBM facial-recognition program that didn't work nearly as well on black women as on white men, we've seen that large companies that pride themselves on their technical prowess are having trouble navigating this terrain.</p><p>And if that's what we know about, imagine what we don't. Most of the critically important algorithms in use have not been opened up for scrutiny, in large part because of laws protecting intellectual property.</p><p>The Democratic bill, introduced in the Senate and House of Representatives last week, would give the Federal Trade Commission power to require and monitor procedures by big companies to keep track of their algorithms and audit them for fairness and accuracy. It would apply only to companies with at least $50 million in annual revenue and would pertain even if intellectual property rights are involved, although it looks like the companies would have leeway in terms of whether they make the audits publicly available.</p><p>The idea is that obvious mistakes, or indeed subtle detours around existing anti-discrimination law, should be caught before they're embedded in computer programs for deployment. (To its credit, Amazon.com Inc. didn't use its sexist hiring algorithm.) Instead of assuming the best, in other words, companies will be required to provide evidence to the FTC that they follow relevant laws against discrimination. The inquiries would be done via third party auditors. (Disclosure: I run an algorithmic auditing company.) Companies would need to provide evidence that new algorithms are fair and accurate before being allowed to use them. This would be a huge step forward in terms of accountability, and is far from the case today.</p><p>Whatever the legislative fate of the Democratic bill, it's an indication of what is to come.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IFMNGT-0000016a-3035-d445-a7fe-f3fdbc4e0000-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IFMNGT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VX8-WB41-F06X-W1XK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">436967</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"490\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SourceMedia, Inc.

The American Edge Project aims to \"tell the story about the positive impact technology and innovation have on America's economy and businesses, particularly small ones, and how they enhance freedom of expression and our nation's overall security,\" according to a description on a YouTube video of its first ad.  The campaign shows the positive impact tech companies have had for many consumers throughout the coronavirus pandemic at a time when they are under intense scrutiny for their data practices and potential competition law violations.  A Facebook -backed group created to tout the innovation of American tech companies is launching its first ad on Friday, a representative for the group told CNBC.   The American Edge Project aims to \"tell the story about the positive impact technology and innovation have on America's economy and businesses, particularly small ones, and how they enhance freedom of expression and our nation's overall security,\" according to a description on a YouTube video of its first ad.    The campaign, which will run online in large media markets throughout the U.S., shows the positive impact tech companies have had for many consumers throughout the coronavirus pandemic at a time when they are under intense scrutiny for their data practices and potential competition law violations.   While the ad features brands including Facebook, Amazon , Google and Zoom , so far, only Facebook has confirmed its involvement in the coalition, as first reported by The Washington Post in May. The ad itself does not disclose its backers and representatives from the other companies that appear in the ad did not immediately respond to requests for comment about whether they are formally funding the group. The American Edge representative declined to name other backers.   The spot, called \"Time for innovation,\" depicts empty airports, offices and classrooms and then shows people connecting with friends and family through Zoom , scrolling through Facebook and Instagram, receiving deliveries from Amazon  and googling \"how can i help\" and \"telemedicine.\"    At the end, the words, \"We're distant. But we're not alone,\" appear on the screen, followed by the American Edge logo with a tagline, \"Technology is keeping America connected.\"   The ad shares a positive message about American tech companies as lifelines during the pandemic. That could play into a different message tech companies including Facebook have repeated to those advocating for more regulation: that American tech dominance can help fend off Chinese tech dominance, which is less likely to be regulated. U.S. officials are increasingly skeptical of Chinese tech companies including Huawei, ByteDance and Tencent , citing national security concerns.    Scrutiny of Big Tech has spanned several branches of government in the U.S. and abroad. The CEOs of Amazon , Apple , Facebook and Google parent company Alphabet all appeared before the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust last month to defend their companies' competitive practices as the panel concludes an antitrust inquiry. All four have attracted antitrust scrutiny from a mix of federal, state and international regulators as well.   Lawmakers and regulators have also expressed concerns about data security at several of the companies, especially as more workers and students relied on their services under stay-at-home orders early in the pandemic. Zoom in particular found itself in hot water after several high-profile cases of \"zoombombing\" occurred, where hackers intruded on Zoom calls. Three state attorneys general announced a probe into its privacy practices . The company later struck a deal with the New York AG's office , promising heightened security measures, especially for students.   Still, officials and consumers have recognized the important role technology has played during the pandemic, from connecting people to one another to delivering essential items. With the presidential election looming, the new project appears to be a way to shift the focus to these positive aspects of the industry's impact.

The tech companies that long eschewed Washington are spending gobs of money inside the Beltway to protect themselves from real accountability. But as Big Tech\u2019s popularity sinks, lawmakers from both parties increasingly are willing to challenge their power. And an emerging coalition of consumer, privacy, civil rights and other advocates are demanding meaningful restraints on Big Tech abuses.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The internet, e-commerce and the giant tech platforms  Google, Facebook and Amazon  have grown to a vast scale with a minimum of governmental regulation. Although the internet and these and other giant corporations have unarguably enriched the lives of Americans and people around the world, the unregulated, commercialized internet has become rife with abuse.</p><p> Data breaches, privacy violations, misleading and deceptive advertising, manipulation of children, predatory marketing to vulnerable communities, discriminatory pricing, anti-competitive conduct, and more are troublingly commonplace.</p><p> Consider just a few examples:</p><p>Facebook just admitted it \u201cunintentionally\u201d and without permission uploaded 1.5 million email contacts to its site.</p><p>  The European Union in March slapped Google with a $1.7 billion fine for blocking customers from using rival search engines. The EU has hit the company with more than $9 billion in antitrust fines in recent years.</p><p>  Recently revealed court documents show that Facebook knowingly duped game-playing kids out of money, tricking kids into spending money when they didn\u2019t know they were (and their parents certainly didn\u2019t). Internally, Facebook called this \u201cfriendly fraud.\u201d</p><p> Against this backdrop, at first blush it is quite surprising that the tech platforms that dominate the internet and have long bragged that their success was enabled by a laissez-faire regulatory environment, now are affirmatively and aggressively seeking federal privacy regulation.</p><p> The mystery behind this seemingly unlikely request for regulation quickly dissolves, however; the tech companies want federal regulation because they are intent on overriding state regulation. Their hope is for federal rules that would override (\u201cpreempt\u201d) state efforts like California\u2019s new privacy bill, which is set to take effect in 2020. \u201cThe California bill is responsible for 90 percent of the lobbying and political pressure to pass a national law,\u201d Robert Atkinson of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, whose board includes tech executives, told AP.</p><p> With Google, Facebook and the rest in support, there\u2019s a real chance Congress will pass a privacy legislation this year or next  but there\u2019s absolutely no guarantee that such legislation will leave consumers better off. Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, is now the biggest corporate lobby in Washington, D.C.</p><p> The tech companies and other large players on the internet couch their advocacy for preemption on the grounds that they want to avoid a \u201cpatchwork\u201d of overlapping and even conflicting state requirements.</p><p> The real reason that tech and other companies so strongly favor preemption has nothing to do with \u201cpatchwork\u201d concerns. Rather, they are worried about state requirements that afford consumers more protection than federal rules and experiment with innovative approaches. States can also adapt more quickly to changing circumstances than can federal rules. The tech goliaths are more confident that they can capture federal regulators than state regulators.</p><p> Robert Weissman is the president of Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy organization. He wrote this for InsideSources.com.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKUT-b093314a686511e99e4100163ec2aa77</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2896FC5B07AA18 NWBKUT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W19-9231-DXVP-V3WK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"627\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cache Valley Publishing LLC.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

This interview is edited for brevity and clarity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">InsideSources: What inspired you to found TechFreedom?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Berin Szoka: I started TechFreedom because the Progress and Freedom Foundation (PFF) closed during the financial downturn. One, I wanted to continue the work PFF had been doing, and do the things PFF wasn't but should have been doing, like civil liberties and surveillance work. The reason I went to PFF in the first place is because I wanted to be a principled voice in debates over how to govern the future of technology.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I don't think the perspective we take [at TechFreedom] was or is well-represented. I think there are existing organizations that have a very strong ideological agenda. There are people that start from strong ideological premises on both sides of the debate, and that's just not really what we do.</p><p>We're really first and foremost lawyers who try to think through these hard problems and provide good analysis. We have our own philosophical approach, but that's really secondary, and my chief frustration with dealing with the people in our field across the political spectrum is there aren't that many people who are honest analysts and thinkers first -- and advocates for a political view second. We're not activists, we're not an advocacy shop, we're really a public interest law firm.</p><p>InsideSources: Tell me about some of the biggest policy issues TechFreedom is focused on right now.</p><p>Berin Szoka: As with everything we do, we ask, is this something people are looking at? Section 230 gets a lot of attention, but very few people take the time to lawyer through. A lot of people defending 230 speak in platitudes about how 230 made the internet possible. That's not what we do. What would be the practical effect of a reasonableness expectation for immunity [like Sen. Josh Hawley's (R-Mo.) bill]? The practical effect would be you as a website operator would no longer be able to get rid of lawsuits, and after all that hassle and expense, you could perhaps get the lawsuit dismissed. What could be done to open the door into that avalanche of lawsuits? There are very few people in the policy world engaged in that analysis.</p><p>The only way we're going to safeguard against future abuses of power is to have a combination of statutory protections, transparency, and tools that allow people to blow the whistle, whatever the right thing for the circumstance. For example, I am profoundly concerned about the way the administration appears to have weaponized the enforcement of antitrust laws. It appears to me they are operating to suit the political agenda of the White House. It's pretty clear Trump is trying to use antitrust laws against political rivals.</p><p>Our general theme IS about not giving too much discretion to regulators. There are some very specific changes we would like to see made. The president's war powers under the Communications Act is essentially an internet kill switch. They are very broad, there are essentially no safeguards, and if you're really concerned about someone abusing power in secret and potentially shutting down communications, those are the sorts of things that should be addressed now. So we are reaching out to people across the political spectrum to be engaged. I don't think that gets enough attention, and it's very different from what most people in this field do. People are focused on short-term partisan fights.</p><p>The next administration will have an opportunity to start implementing these kinds of reforms for all sorts of things, like how we appoint commissioners over agencies, that process is breaking down. We would really like to sit down with people and fix these problems with the regulatory state. They will really have an opportunity to step back from the normal partisan fights and institute safeguards.</p><p>InsideSources: What do you think are some of the biggest misconceptions surrounding some of these issues?</p><p>Berin Szoka: Most people think that the debate over the last few years has been about net neutrality, when really it's been about the FCC's authority over internet services. The only way we're going to resolve this issue is to distinguish those two things. Democrats still say Mike Doyle's bill will resolve this fight, well no it won't, it restores the FCC's open internet order. It restores the FCC's authority over internet services, and that's something we've always objected to, not the net neutrality principles.</p><p>The really big misunderstanding that underlies that whole debate is that people on both sides of the aisle, especially Republicans, is that they really don't understand the problem of scale. The reason Section 230 is so vital is because it's one thing for a newspaper to filter all the letters to the editor and third-party op-eds, but any website, not just Google and Facebook, there's no way you or I could manage all the comments. The problem just grows from there.</p><p>When Republicans complain about bias and social media content moderation, what they're really seeing is the result of the vast scale of these services. It's just not possible to make perfectly thoughtful decisions all the time. We can't have the courts litigating every single time someone complains about content on the internet. We have to have cruder, faster mechanisms that are imperfect and will result in a lot of absurd cases of content being taken down that shouldn't be.</p><p>The other bigger point I would make that relates to abuse of power: I'm constantly amazed at people who propose something like broad power to a regulator with open discretion and then don't think about how that power will be abused when they're not in power.</p><p>When we start thinking not from a knee-jerk ideological perspective and start practically thinking things through, how will this power be abused? What will people on the other side do with it?</p><p>InsideSources: Which issue are you most passionate about?</p><p>Berin Szoka: At the moment, I would say I'm most passionate about defending internet services against Republican hypocrisy.</p><p>Last year [when I testified at the April 26, 2018 House Judiciary Committee hearing] I naively expected I would hear some Republican attacks but at least most or some would be willing to say whatever mistakes tech companies might make in content moderation, we don't think the government should dictate what tech companies should do. But instead every single one of them took the opportunity to rave about Republicans being censored without any anecdotal examples.</p><p>InsideSources: What triggered your interest in these tech issues?</p><p>Berin Szoka: I'm essentially doing today what I wanted to do as a freshman or sophomore in college. The book \"The Future and Its Enemies\" by Virginia Postrel I've always said has been my lodestar. That's sort of generally libertarian, but you don't have to be a libertarian to feel that way about the internet and evolving services. Essentially, [it's about how] we're better off not trying to put the future in some neat and tidy box.</p><p>Beyond that, the net neutrality debate wasn't really my choice, that kind of took over the field, and it's the same for Section 230. Groups like the Media Research Center figured out that net neutrality was a great fundraising issue, and are essentially taking the playbook from Fight for the Future and doing the same thing.</p><p>InsideSources: Are there any experiences that stand out in how they influenced your political views and policy positions?</p><p>Berin Szoka: The April 26, 2018 hearing was, for me, the last straw. It was at that hearing that I realized the Republican Party is completely lost. If that hearing happened a year before, every single Republican there would have said all the same things about how terrible the Fairness Doctrine was, and now they turn around and push that exact same idea for social media. They're the ones who have rushed to say for 10 years that net neutrality is the Fairness Doctrine for the internet.</p><p>InsideSources: What politicians, economists and other influencers have influenced your views and policy positions?</p><p>Berin Szoka: Virginia Postrel and her book, which I really cannot recommend enough. In college I also read The Innovator's Dilemma by Clayton Christiansen, and its fundamental point is still quite right, that the really important thing about innovation is that Facebook isn't going to be disrupted by another Facebook, but by someone who does something completely different that disrupts their business model.</p><p>That's the heart of our work, to make sure regulation doesn't lock in a way of doing things because that will lock in our current giants and their interests. I also read an early law and economics take on internet regulation, Information Rules by Hal Varian and Carl Shapiro, that's still a great work. Also Hayek.</p><p>InsideSources: Do you have any nerdy, unique hobbies?</p><p>Berin Szoka: Well, I row. I row on the Anacostia and have the river to myself and think about things. Language -- I'm a pretty good French speaker, and I'm taking German again, but my German is pretty bad. My license plate is BAROQUE, I love baroque music. Bach is my favorite.</p><p>___ (c)2019 InsideSources.com, Washington, D.C.

Editorial content from other publications and authors is provided to give readers a sampling of regional and national opinion and does not necessarily reflect positions endorsed by the Editorial Board of The Daily News.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After years of ignoring warnings from civil rights leaders and privacy advocates about the tech industry's troubling practices, lawmakers in Washington seem to have been roused from their slumber by the public outcry responding to news of the massive Facebook/Cambridge Analytica data breach. But will they now act?</p><p> To be sure, the digital revolution has transformed America's economy and politics over the past generation, creating new pathways for economic empowerment, creative expression and civic engagement. In the 1960s, television made it impossible to turn away from Bull Connor's dogs and the horrors of Jim Crow segregation. Today, the digital revolution means that anyone can be an investigative journalist, video documentarian or advocate _ documenting ICE agents separating children from their parents or the latest assault on a motorist of color or using digital data to demonstrate the extent of persistent racial disparities.</p><p> But the dark underside of the digital revolution has been ignored too long by our nation's elected officials. Cambridge Analytica's wholesale misuse of Facebook users' data; Google ignoring users privacy settings to track users of iPhones and the Safari browser; Twitter allowing Russia use its platform to meddle in the U.S. elections; Grindr's disclosure of individuals' HIV status.</p><p> Beyond privacy, tech platforms have also given a megaphone to hate groups looking to inflame racial tensions, while allowing advertisers to discriminate against minority communities in a pernicious (and entirely illegal) new form of digital redlining.</p><p> Their platforms have repeatedly been found to exhibit racism, from deeply offensive search query suggestions to racial bias in image search results _ outcomes that, while not intentional, are perhaps not surprising given the shocking lack of diversity in the teams that actually build and deploy these products.</p><p> And for all of the tech industry's loudly-proclaimed support for \"net neutrality,\" their business practices routinely violate these core principles of openness and non-discrimination. From censoring anti-racism activists to patenting tools that prevent comparison shopping, there's a huge gap between the industry's words and actions when it comes to protecting neutrality.</p><p> Self-regulation is a fool's gold; Big Tech has had innumerable apology tours with every successive scandal, only to ignore systematic reforms once the political storm passes.</p><p> Earlier this month, 50 civil rights and advocacy organizations joined together to call on Congress to protect the internet and extend its promise to all Americans by prioritizing civil rights online. In the weeks ahead, it is vital that our elected leaders seize on the momentum generated by the recent <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>hearings and ensure that angry committee room soundbites are followed up with meaningful action.</p><p> Building upon the examples set forth by civil rights leaders in the past, our letter laid out clear principles that should form the framework for any internet protection legislation Congress may take up.</p><p> First, Congress must strengthen the privacy rights and protections of American consumers online. Consumers deserve meaningful control over how their data is used online, as well as transparency into how their private information may be used. Consumers must have reasonable means of redress when they believe their data has been compromised or improperly used.</p><p> Second, the tech sector must become accountable for policing illegal and abusive activity on their platforms. Leading platforms have been documented enabling harassment and abuse of women, people of color, LGBT communities and religious minorities, while suppressing the speech and civic participation of targeted populations _ activities that, without accountability and action, will continue to put already vulnerable communities at greater risk.</p><p> Third, consumers' rights should be protected across the entire internet ecosystem, just as entrepreneurs and innovators deserve equal opportunity in the whole sector. Rules governing privacy and data collection should be consistent regardless of who collects it and how it's collected. Furthermore, a comprehensive plan should include standardized terms of service to maintain a safe, enjoyable user experience, including enforceable consequences for hateful activity.</p><p> Lastly, we must take a hard look at the persistent and indefensible racial and gender gaps in Silicon Valley's hiring practices. Despite exposes and Department of Labor lawsuits, the problem isn't getting any better. The companies that effectively serve as gatekeepers to the entire internet look nothing like America _ and that's a problem.</p><p> Americans are speaking up in record numbers to demand Congress take action to address what ails the internet. Lawmakers have an obligation to respond seriously to this outcry, to ensure that future generations of Americans will have an opportunity to enjoy the full promise of a free, open and inclusive internet.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKWA-9a29f29addf3839f92ef08c61fe362bca80991d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289CBBEDC4A607 NWBKWA2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SC9-K0W1-DXVP-V3NG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"881\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Lee Enterprises, Inc.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

So it has proved with the EU\u2019s landmark General Data Protection Regulation, six years in the making before coming into force in May 2018.</p><p>There is no doubt that GDPR has already done a lot of good. It has shone a light on the murkier operations of surveillance capitalism and forced every company to scrutinise its own data-handling practices. The EU has also prompted other legislatures to take data protection more seriously, while GDPR has become the default regulation for many countries around the world. </p><p>But GDPR is deficient in several respects. Most companies have complied with the tick-box nature of its demands; far fewer appear to have internalised its spirit. With responsibility split between 28 national regulators, enforcement was always going to be patchy, if not ineffectual. The fact that some Big Tech companies pay more worldwide in fines than taxes seems to indicate that they regard flouting the law as simply a routine cost of doing business.</p><p>Understandably, the new EU Commission is already exploring what a post-GDPR world should look like. Its emphasis should now shift from stopping bad, or negligent, companies from doing bad things to actively encouraging good companies to do good things. The EU needs to rethink the way that data is gathered, handled and exploited. It should be looking to reshape data markets, rather than just regulate them as they are. </p><p>The GDPR\u2019s biggest drawback is that its core principle, enshrining meaningful consent, can in no sense be considered meaningful if users do not enjoy genuine choice. Accepting impenetrable legalese in return for a service does not confer any greater rights on users given the wildly lopsided nature of almost all online contracts. As <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2118688/PayPal-agreement-longer-Hamlet-iTunes-beats-Macbeth.html\"> the Consumers\u2019 Association highlighted</url> a while ago, PayPal\u2019s 36,275-word terms and conditions were longer than Hamlet.</p><p>Too much onus still rests on the individual user, or the presumed owner of that data. Indeed, the very concept of data ownership may be unhelpful. An individual\u2019s data is almost worthless in isolation and cannot be sold or traded in any serious way. Value is only derived when it is combined with others\u2019 data. It has differential value to different data companies depending on the intended use. </p><p>Moreover, an individual\u2019s data can sometimes reveal sensitive information about others, most notably in the area of health. One person\u2019s genome sequencing data, for example, will be of concern to all blood relatives. The academic debate now focuses heavily on how to protect collective, or group, privacy. Just as we do not expect individuals to be personally responsible for clean air or water, we should not expect them to ensure they have \u2018clean\u2019 data.</p><p>Happily, technology is being encouraged to move the right way. One of the positive side-effects of GDPR has been encouraging the \u201cprivacy by design\u201d movement. Recent advances in <url normalizedValue=\"https://crypto.stanford.edu/craig/easy-fhe.pdf\"> fully homomorphic encryption </url>enable data to stay encrypted during processing and manipulation, preserving privacy.</p><p>There have also been some intriguing developments in the data governance field. The EU-backed Decode project is a bold attempt to create an alternative, decentralised data ecosystem. The cities of Barcelona and Amsterdam regard their residents\u2019 data as a public good that should benefit local communities. The Open Data Institute is also pioneering the use of data trusts, creating a legal structure to provide independent stewardship of data. Even the Big Tech companies appear to accept that the wild days of data land grabs may be ending.</p><p>Eric Schmidt, Google\u2019s former chairman, recently told a McKinsey conference: \u201cThe idea that he or she who has the most data wins will be seen as a temporal phenomenon. It is the one who has the smartest engineers and algos that will win.\u201d </p><p>That may not be of much comfort to regulators given that Big Tech hires many of the smartest engineers to write the best algos. But at least the determinant of success should shift more from the exploitation of captured data to human ingenuity and machine intelligence. That would be a good thing even if, in time, it too will require regulatory rethinking.</p><p>Letter in response to this article: </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Conversation about our data must involve us all / From Emma Martins, Guernsey, CI</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-9a3bb14c225511eab8a1584213ee7b2b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XV1-KXP1-JB77-K0CM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"756\"/><timeReceived>10:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 26, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC00023HP</classCode><className>PAYPAL HOLDINGS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS522320 FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS PROCESSING, RESERVE &amp;

Making tech companies more accountable and responsible have become the subject matter of debatesHancock thinks there is a very important role here for rules, whether that is legislative rules or norms of behaviors, so that big tech companies take their responsibilities seriously. \"In the UK we are strengthening data protection rules as we speak and only this week we passed the Bill through the House of Commons and it comes into force later this month. </p><p>We are making sure that we have the structures in place to ensure appropriate data protection rights. This then is the basis on which data can flow freely. Getting these rules right at a government level is important, but it is also important when it comes to how companies can use data in innovative ways to improve lives,\" says Hancock, who was on a three-day visit to India.Hancock's views are important since he has been at the centre of the UK's response to the scandal involving Cambridge Analytica harvesting millions of user data without their consent. However, the Hancock is clear that legislation and rules cannot come at the cost of innovation.\"Take the information around health, for instance. It is very sensitive data that has to be protected very carefully. But, use properly and appropriately, you can find all sorts of improvements that can literally save lives. We have to make sure privacy is protected, but at the same time we have to make sure data is used in innovative ways,\" says Hancock. The secretary added that striking a balance between innovation, legislation and accountability is the key. The balance in this case is between having adequate protection of privacy and also the innovative use of data.\"We need a system that retains the trust amongst users and citizens, but at the same time allow for innovation. In the UK alongside implementing GDPR, we are passing a data protection bill to ensure you can have the exemptions for innovative use of data, but at the same time keep data safe. It is a difficult balance to strike, but ultimately if you get the systems and architecture right, good use of data should protect privacy and allow innovation. This is not a trade-off. It is about using data in a modern, forward-looking and well organized way,\" says Hancock.

With every major misstep from the industry's biggest companies, consumers lose trust in the Internet ecosystem. It's the new startups that don't have long standing reputations and relationships with users that consumers that abandon first. At the same time, startups don't have the seemingly endless resources of their big tech counterparts to navigate the resulting legal and regulatory landscape if privacy laws are written with only the biggest tech companies in mind. </p><p>We've already seen this happen in Europe and California. Without necessarily meaning to, those sets of privacy rules create obligations and requirements that larger companies can navigate while small companies simply cannot. One of the biggest reasons behind this disparate impact is the fact that startups almost always have to rely on a wide network of vendors to do everyday business activities, from data processing, to analytics, to cybersecurity management. Whereas the largest companies can often build these capabilities in house, startups and medium-sized companies need these third parties to keep their companies running. In Europe, two years after its General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect, startups have had to either leave or forgo European markets or shoulder the high cost of ensuring compliance. According to Google, the company spent \"hundreds of years of human time\"[1] on GDPR compliance, something a startup with a small staff and bootstrap budget can hardly afford. And the burden of GDPR compliance can fall disproportionately on smaller companies. The law distinguishes between \"processors\" and \"controllers\" and carries different responsibilities and obligations around consumer data first-party controllers and third-party processors. To comply with GDPR, companies that rely on third-party service providers, or processors, have to negotiate their contracts with those providers and put in place data protection agreements that ensure compliance as user data travels from the controller to the processor. For a small startup relying on dozens of third-party service providers for everyday business needs, that renegotiation process is incredibly costly and time consuming. And in California, the California Consumer Protection Act\u2014which went into effect in January and will be enforced next month, even though the state's Attorney General recently submitted final rules, which might not be finalized before the July 1 enforcement deadline\u2014is expected to cost businesses $55 billion[2] in total, with small businesses spending up to $50,000 each on compliance. As the cost estimate report commissioned by the California's Department of Justice notes, \"Small firms are likely to face a disproportionately higher share of compliance costs relative to larger enterprises.\" The report cites apparently \"overstated\" concerns about the impact of GDPR on large companies \"while many smaller firms have struggled to meet compliance costs.\" One of the biggest open questions about complexity in CCPA compliance, and therefore increased compliance costs, is the law's overly broad definition of \"sale,\" which some are worried could include benign and necessary data sharing. The law defines a sale as \"selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumer's personal information by the business to another business or a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration.\" Coupled with limitations on service providers and how they can use consumer data, the broad definition of \"sale\" in the law could make it more complicated for a startup to work with its many third-party vendors. These complexities get even worse for startups when the rules vary across state lines. Thanks to the Internet, a startup in one state can launch and grow in all fifty states and even abroad without having a large reserve of legal resources. That could leave, for instance, a two person startup in North Dakota on the hook for complying with different privacy laws in every state where they have users. Ideally, the varying state laws would be similar enough or build upon each other such that complying with the most stringent law for all users also satisfies a company's obligations in each state where it has users. Unfortunately, this is not the case, and even slight differences[3] in state privacy laws can lead to huge compliance costs, which will fall disproportionately on startups. For instance, some privacy rules considered by state governments cabin the standard consumer rights to access, correct, and delete data to data held by a company that is easily identified. On the other hand, some proposed laws would allow consumers to request to access, correct, and delete any data a company has on them, sparking concerns that companies that follow good data hygiene practices by stripping users' data of identifying information will be forced to re-identify users' data to comply with their requests. And even if a small startup were able to comply with the varying state laws as they're passed, the goal of privacy compliance has moving goalposts. The number of states considering enacting privacy laws is constantly growing, and even California\u2014a state that already has a comprehensive consumer privacy law on the books\u2014is just now figuring out what exactly compliance with the CCPA looks like less than a month before the state starts enforcement and as voters consider adding a second privacy law[4] in the state later this year. With a lack of federal action, it makes sense that state governments and the concerned consumers they represent want to see meaningful privacy protections, but the resulting landscape will be one that small and medium sized companies have trouble navigating. Instead, Congress should pass a federal privacy law that builds off of the goals of the efforts already in place and harmonizes obligations for companies. One set of strong, sensible, and straightforward privacy protections can protect consumers and promote competition instead of rushed, uninformed rules that will hamper competition without providing consumers with meaningful protections.

The past quarter-century has witnessed an unprecedented commodification of personal data and erosion of personal privacy. Addiction to mobile devices has exacerbated both.</p><p>In a paper he delivered at the 23rd International Database Applications and Engineering Symposium (IDEAS 2019) in Athens, Greece, Desai outlines how tech giants like Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple gained control of and profited from our data. But he also presented a way to reassert control and wrest it away from them.</p><p>\u201cHow do you fight Google? How do you fight Facebook?\u201d he asks. \u201cThey are not going to do anything about our privacy rights. So what am I going to do to protect my data? I\u2019m going to take it away from them.\u201d</p><p>Everyone is a server</p><p>He proposes a straightforward if radical solution: add an open-source functionality of an email and web server to the individual modem-wireless routers found in most homes and small offices. A simple interface would let even the least tech-savvy users manage their individual system.</p><p>Emails would originate in the users\u2019 owned system, personal web pages similar to current social media sites would be hosted on their personal servers and all data would be stored locally. Content and data would only be shared with the user\u2019s permission, and both email and web content would be encrypted to avoid electronic eavesdropping.</p><p>Connectivity long ago reached beyond individuals. It has permeated even our household infrastructure via the Internet of Things (IoT). In light of this, Desai has come up with additional steps to insulate users from data-snoopers.</p><p>He and his former master\u2019s student Ayberk Aksoy developed arouter-based system called Heimdallrthat would monitor traffic, store data and only allow verified and approved software updates. The updates would be certified by an independent agency similar to oversight organizations found in other industries.</p><p>In one stroke, he believes, this would empower individual users and restrict Big Tech from accessing personal data.</p><p>\u201cThere would no longer be the need for any tech giants to provide email or web service,\u201d he writes. \u201cTechnology has progressed to such an extent that these services could be incorporated in a device many home owners already have and its cost would be no more than that of the latest mobile device.\u201d</p><p>The personal web</p><p>Desai knows that changing the business of the web is a daunting task, especially without political leadership challenging the status quo. He says the European Union\u2019sGeneral Data Protection Regulation, which asserts that users own their data and have a right to decide who can use it and how, is a good start. However, enforcing those rules globally will not be easy.</p><p>\u201cAt this point, the way the web works is saturated in everybody\u2019s mind,\u201d he says. \u201cHow do we change our framework to bring it back down to the personal level?\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS2517398</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X9H-39F1-JDG9-Y4CB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"539\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 18, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Everyone knows it. The uncertainty and challenge are the form and extent of new privacy rules. But they must come, because Facebookhas proved time and again that the government cannot leave that task to it and others like Instagram and Twitter.</p><p> In 2011, Facebookentered into a consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission regarding charges that it deceived users by telling them their data could remain private while allowing it to be made public and shared.

Skepticism of big tech is growing. People are realizing that if they are not paying for something, they themselves are the product being sold.</p><p> The #DeleteFacebook movement includes lots of regular folks among the platform\u2019s 2.2 billion users, and tech giants like Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and Tesla/SpaceX founder <person><nameText>Elon Musk. </nameText></person>Privacy-oriented sites are seeing slow but steady increases in users.</p><p><person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>said he accepts responsibility for all the mistakes and spent lots of time Tuesday apologizing.

Some might have yet to embrace the internet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But after the tsunami of revelations about Russian infiltration of Facebook's platform in the 2016 presidential election and the misuse of user data by Cambridge Analytica, these members of Congress finally have woken up to the urgency to protect the personal information collected by giant social media platforms.</p><p> Regulation is needed. Everyone knows it. The uncertainty and challenge are the form and extent of new privacy rules. But they must come, because Facebookhas proved time and again that the government cannot leave that task to it and others like Instagram and Twitter.</p><p> In 2011, Facebookentered into a consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission regarding charges that it deceived users by telling them their data could remain private while allowing it to be made public and shared. Not much has changed. On the eve of <person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>testimony, advocacy and privacy groups accused YouTube, whose corporate parent is Google, of illegally collecting data on millions of child users.</p><p> The tipping point for this week's grilling of <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>- the House Energy and Commerce Committee took its turn Wednesday - was recent news that Cambridge, the British firm that received nearly $6 million from <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>campaign, improperly gained access to the data of 87 million Facebookusers to develop psychological profiles for targeting voters.</p><p> Regulations should reflect basic principles. Users should have to agree to allow their data, which range from biographical information to personal interests and contacts, to be collected and shared. Users should not be forced to opt out of collection. The process of granting permission should be easy to understand. There should be limits on how data are shared with companies and how they use the information. A bipartisan Senate bill to require disclosures about who paid for online campaign ads is a starting point for a different, but similarly troublesome front. Europe is ahead of us, with privacy rules set to take effect in May. Congress must decide whether it also likes the European stick - fines of up to 4 percent of global revenue for companies that misuse users' data.</p><p>America is at a turning point. Skepticism of big tech is growing. People are realizing that if they are not paying for something, they themselves are the product being sold. The #DeleteFacebook movement includes lots of regular folks among the platform's 2.2 billion users, and tech giants like Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and Tesla/ SpaceX founder <person><nameText>Elon Musk. </nameText></person>Privacy-oriented sites are seeing slow but steady increases in users.</p><p><person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>said he accepts responsibility for all the mistakes and spent lots of time Tuesday apologizing. We've seen the apology tour before. And more might be necessary. Given Facebook's recent announcement that the data of vastly more people had been breached by Cambridge than originally thought, it seems unlikely that the company knows the full extent of possible data misuse by other parties.</p><p> The law, it is said, is always behind the technology.

They told Business Insider they were protesting tech companies' using city streets to experiment and city officials' increasing use of sweeps to force homeless people off the streets. In total, a full intersection, 11 buses, and several cars were blocked for about two hours.Anti-tech demonstrators in San Francisco[1] on Thursday used piles of electric scooters to block shuttles carrying Google employees to protest what they see as the failure of the tech industry and lawmakers to address the city's income inequality and sizable homeless population. </p><p>\"What you're seeing here is that scooters have more rights than people,\" Chirag Bhakta told Business Insider. \"Our priorities shouldn't be people first, scooters second. We're tired of being seen as an experimental playground for the tech industry.\" The deluge of dockless electric scooters that have cropped up in San Francisco and other cities in recent months have drawn criticism from officials who say they were given little to no warning about their presence, as well as from activists who say the scooters are a prime example of tech companies entering public spaces without getting input[2] from residents or permission from regulators. These scooter-rental services \u2014 spearheaded by three venture-backed companies,Bird, LimeBike, and Spin [3]\u2014 allow people to reserve a nearby scooter via a smartphone app, ride around on it for a small fee, and at the end of the journey leave it anywhere to be claimed by the next rider. Within weeks of the companies' arrival in San Francisco, the city swiftly voted to regulate them. Under the new rules[4], only five companies with 500 scooters each will be allowed to operate in the city, and they must show they are making an effort to educate people on how to ride them. But to activists, the quick action from lawmakers reflects the misplaced priorities of city officials. They say the fact that a solution for scooters on sidewalks was so quickly implemented \u2014 and that they will be allowed on sidewalks \u2014 is a slap in the face to the city's homeless people who are being subjected to inhumane sweeps forcing them off the streets. \"I just want people to understand why their workday is being disrupted and why we're here,\" Bhakta said. \"We understand that it's an inconvenience, but it's not a personal attack. An inconvenience for you is an outcry from the people. I just want them to show some solidarity and empathy.\" Here's what the protest looked like. At about 8:45 a.m., protesters carried scooters to an intersection in San Francisco's Mission District with the intention of blocking shuttles carrying Google employees. Katie Canales/Business Insider Activists piled scooters in front of buses and unfurled signs that said \"Techsploitation is toxic.\" Katie Canales/Business Insider To make their point that big tech is toxic, protesters dressed in white hazmat suits and masks.

(Microsoft admitted it has never sold the tech to U.S. police.) But civil rights leaders and privacy advocates  I spoke to last week tell me that what they need is for Big Tech to stop arresting their legislative efforts to make the technology off-limits.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So far, Silicon Valley's record has mostly put it at odds with groups like Color of Change, the NAACP and the American Civil Liberties Union. In fact, a Microsoft employee in Washington state wrote a new law on facial recognition software opposed by many civil rights groups for not being tough enough.</p><p>What happens next will affect the lives of many Americans. Facial recognition technology uses photos to help computers identify people. You might have already encountered it to unlock your phone or board an airplane. It can also be used to identify people who don't even know they're being watched, like at a protest.</p><p>It's one of the most powerful surveillance tools ever invented, but even a federal government study found it to be less accurate at identifying minorities and women. Ramping up its use could, in theory, help keep criminals from escaping arrest - but it also opens a slippery slope to a world of supercharged policing that's likely to disproportionately affect people of color through misidentification or just more surveillance of minority communities.</p><p>Amazon also owns the connected doorbellmaker Ring, which privacy groups have criticized for partnering with hundreds of police forces, granting them potential access to camera footage of many American streets. Ring doesn't offer facial recognition, but its video can be shared with police who have it. (Amazon chief executive and founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>There's no evidence of police using facial recognition technology to make arrests of people protesting the death of George Floyd, though it may take time for those records to emerge. Police in dozens of U.S. cities have access to the technology and in several have explicitly asked citizens to share images of protesters.</p><p>What changed  last week is that facial recognition got linked to police racism, the issue that's gotten Americans angry enough to protest during a pandemic and made the tech politically toxic. Previously, privacy advocates (including me) had linked it to less-urgent-sounding concerns like surveillance and squashed speech.</p><p>To be clear,  last week's announcements alone won't likely do much to stop the use of this technology by law enforcement. The most important players in the murky market, such as NEC Corp., Idemia and Clearview AI, are lesser-known companies that have not joined in on the voluntary moratoriums.</p><p>\"Clearview AI is also committed to the responsible use of its powerful technology and is used only for after-the-crime investigations to help identify criminal suspects,\" the company said in a statement.</p><p>NEC said its technology could combat racism, by helping to \"correct inherent biases, protect privacy and civil liberties, and fairly and effectively conduct investigations for social justice.\" </p><p>Idemia said it \"believes that facial recognition continues to be a valuable tool to support the verification of identity across a wide range of use cases.\"</p><p>The only thing that's really going to stop police from using the technology  is new laws.</p><p>That's why the announcements by IBM, Amazon and Microsoft were a success for activists - a rare retreat by some of Silicon Valley's biggest names over a key new technology. This came from years of work by researchers including Joy Buolamwini to make the case that facial recognition software is biased. A test commissioned by the ACLU of Northern California found that  Amazon's software, called Rekognition, misidentified 28 lawmakers as people arrested in a crime. That happens in part because the systems are trained on data sets that are themselves skewed.</p><p>Yet opponents of facial recognition technology say the problems go far beyond bad software. \"Yes, accuracy disparities mean already-marginalized communities face the brunt of misidentifications,\" said Buolamwini, who founded an organization called the Algorithmic Justice League. \"But the point isn't just that facial recognition systems can misidentify faces, it's that the technology itself can be used in biased ways by governments or corporations.\"</p><p>For example, more cameras could be pointed at minority neighborhoods, used to target immigrants or even people who join protests about police brutality.</p><p>Buolamwini has asked tech companies to sign a pledge that would prohibit the use of the their technology in contexts in which lethal force may be used, including by police or the military. (So far, none of the big ones have.)</p><p>\"There are too many ways in which it can be recklessly applied, and too few examples of the ways in which it serves a fundamental public good,\" said Brandi Collins-Dexter, senior campaign director at Color of Change. </p><p>That's why she and others are calling for not just better facial recognition technology but a halt  to its use by governments.</p><p>A half-dozen cities, among them San Francisco, already have those sorts of laws. On Tuesday, Boston held a hearing about adopting a ban, during which Police Commissioner William Gross said he didn't want to use the tech because it was faulty.</p><p>The challenge, say opponents of facial recognition technology, is that tech companies want to say they support civil rights without actually putting significant limits on potential business upside. There are potential military, international and corporate contracts at stake, largely missing from  last week's promises. And weak laws could end up legitimizing police use of the technology.</p><p>Microsoft in particular has been trying to have it both ways. Last week, chief executive Satya Nadella told employees in a blog post that the company would support racial justice to honor the death of Floyd. A day earlier, the company was fighting some 65 civil rights organizations in California to push a bill to authorize police and companies to use facial recognition tech with some restrictions that fall far short of a moratorium.</p><p>Microsoft didn't get its way in California: AB 2261 failed in the state's legislature.</p><p>Microsoft was the first big tech company to call for laws on facial recognition technology back in 2018 and has been the most visible in statehouse and city hall hearings. It says it opposes use of facial recognition software for mass surveillance, racial profiling or other violations of basic human rights and freedoms.</p><p>\"We need to use this moment to pursue a strong national law to govern facial recognition that is grounded in the protection of human rights,\" Microsoft President Brad Smith said at the Post event Thursday. \"If all the responsible companies in the country cede this market to those that are not prepared to take a stand, we won't necessarily serve the national interest or the lives of the black and African American people.\"</p><p>But the company's legislative stance so far has boiled down to: Put some rules in place, sure, but not a moratorium on it.</p><p>The devil is in the details. In Washington state, Microsoft supported legislation - sponsored by state Sen. Joe Nguyen, a Microsoft employee - that outlines some of how the government can use the tech and requires agencies to produce accountability reports. It also addresses accuracy concerns by saying government agencies can only use the tech if it comes from a developer that makes its software available for testing.</p><p>But opponents said the Washington law comes with too few limits and enforcement measures. \"Agencies may use face surveillance without any restrictions to surveil entire crowds at football stadiums, places of worship, or on public street corners, chilling people's constitutionally protected rights and civil liberties,\" the ACLU of Washington said.</p><p>Microsoft's announcement this week that it wouldn't sell to police until there is a federal law \"should feel like winning, but it feels more like a thinly veiled threat,\" said Liz O'Sullivan, technology director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project. The Washington law, she said, would be a bad model for Congress.</p><p>\"They're seeding the conversations around facial recognition regulation in a number of states by lobbying for bills that might look to a lot of people like they've got really strict protections. But then, if you actually look at them, they don't really actually regulate the technology much as it's used,\" said Jameson Spivack, a policy associate at Georgetown Law's Center on Privacy and Technology. \"It's their way of getting ahead of the opposition and co-opting the movement.\"</p><p>Amazon, which didn't reply to my requests for comment, has said less in public about its legislative goals, aside from calling for federal privacy and legislation on facial recognition tech. One pressing issue for any national legislation is whether it would overrule state and local laws that might be more strict.</p><p>\"Legislatures and activists and civil rights groups are already leading on this issue,\" said Matt Cagle, technology and civil liberties attorney for the ACLU of Northern California. \"We just hope that companies like Microsoft see that and stand with us rather than against us<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">.\"</emphasis></p><p><email

(Microsoft admitted it has never sold the tech to U.S. police.) But civil rights leaders and privacy advocates  I spoke to last week tell me that what they need is for Big Tech to stop arresting their legislative efforts to make the technology off-limits.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So far, Silicon Valley's record has mostly put it at odds with groups like Color of Change, the NAACP and the American Civil Liberties Union. In fact, a Microsoft employee in Washington state wrote a new law on facial recognition software opposed by many civil rights groups for not being tough enough.</p><p>What happens next will affect the lives of many Americans. Facial recognition technology uses photos to help computers identify people. You might have already encountered it to unlock your phone or board an airplane. It can also be used to identify people who don't even know they're being watched, like at a protest.</p><p>It's one of the most powerful surveillance tools ever invented, but even a federal government study found it to be less accurate at identifying minorities and women. Ramping up its use could, in theory, help keep criminals from escaping arrest - but it also opens a slippery slope to a world of supercharged policing that's likely to disproportionately affect people of color through misidentification or just more surveillance of minority communities.</p><p>Amazon also owns the connected doorbellmaker Ring, which privacy groups have criticized for partnering with hundreds of police forces, granting them potential access to camera footage of many American streets. Ring doesn't offer facial recognition, but its video can be shared with police who have it. (Amazon chief executive and founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>There's no evidence of police using facial recognition technology to make arrests of people protesting the death of George Floyd, though it may take time for those records to emerge. Police in dozens of U.S. cities have access to the technology and in several have explicitly asked citizens to share images of protesters.</p><p>What changed  last week is that facial recognition got linked to police racism, the issue that's gotten Americans angry enough to protest during a pandemic and made the tech politically toxic. Previously, privacy advocates (including me) had linked it to less-urgent-sounding concerns like surveillance and squashed speech.</p><p>To be clear,  last week's announcements alone won't likely do much to stop the use of this technology by law enforcement. The most important players in the murky market, such as NEC Corp., Idemia and Clearview AI, are lesser-known companies that have not joined in on the voluntary moratoriums.</p><p>\"Clearview AI is also committed to the responsible use of its powerful technology and is used only for after-the-crime investigations to help identify criminal suspects,\" the company said in a statement.</p><p>NEC said its technology could combat racism, by helping to \"correct inherent biases, protect privacy and civil liberties, and fairly and effectively conduct investigations for social justice.\" </p><p>Idemia said it \"believes that facial recognition continues to be a valuable tool to support the verification of identity across a wide range of use cases.\"</p><p>The only thing that's really going to stop police from using the technology  is new laws.</p><p>That's why the announcements by IBM, Amazon and Microsoft were a success for activists - a rare retreat by some of Silicon Valley's biggest names over a key new technology. This came from years of work by researchers including Joy Buolamwini to make the case that facial recognition software is biased. A test commissioned by the ACLU of Northern California found that  Amazon's software, called Rekognition, misidentified 28 lawmakers as people arrested in a crime. That happens in part because the systems are trained on data sets that are themselves skewed.</p><p>Yet opponents of facial recognition technology say the problems go far beyond bad software. \"Yes, accuracy disparities mean already-marginalized communities face the brunt of misidentifications,\" said Buolamwini, who founded an organization called the Algorithmic Justice League. \"But the point isn't just that facial recognition systems can misidentify faces, it's that the technology itself can be used in biased ways by governments or corporations.\"</p><p>For example, more cameras could be pointed at minority neighborhoods, used to target immigrants or even people who join protests about police brutality.</p><p>Buolamwini has asked tech companies to sign a pledge that would prohibit the use of the their technology in contexts in which lethal force may be used, including by police or the military. (So far, none of the big ones have.)</p><p>\"There are too many ways in which it can be recklessly applied, and too few examples of the ways in which it serves a fundamental public good,\" said Brandi Collins-Dexter, senior campaign director at Color of Change. </p><p>That's why she and others are calling for not just better facial recognition technology but a halt  to its use by governments.</p><p>A half-dozen cities, among them San Francisco, already have those sorts of laws. On Tuesday, Boston held a hearing about adopting a ban, during which Police Commissioner William Gross said he didn't want to use the tech because it was faulty.</p><p>The challenge, say opponents of facial recognition technology, is that tech companies want to say they support civil rights without actually putting significant limits on potential business upside. There are potential military, international and corporate contracts at stake, largely missing from  last week's promises. And weak laws could end up legitimizing police use of the technology.</p><p>Microsoft in particular has been trying to have it both ways. Last week, chief executive Satya Nadella told employees in a blog post that the company would support racial justice to honor the death of Floyd. A day earlier, the company was fighting some 65 civil rights organizations in California to push a bill to authorize police and companies to use facial recognition tech with some restrictions that fall far short of a moratorium.</p><p>Microsoft didn't get its way in California: AB 2261 failed in the state's legislature.</p><p>Microsoft was the first big tech company to call for laws on facial recognition technology back in 2018 and has been the most visible in statehouse and city hall hearings. It says it opposes use of facial recognition software for mass surveillance, racial profiling or other violations of basic human rights and freedoms.</p><p>\"We need to use this moment to pursue a strong national law to govern facial recognition that is grounded in the protection of human rights,\" Microsoft President Brad Smith said at the Post event Thursday. \"If all the responsible companies in the country cede this market to those that are not prepared to take a stand, we won't necessarily serve the national interest or the lives of the black and African American people.\"</p><p>But the company's legislative stance so far has boiled down to: Put some rules in place, sure, but not a moratorium on it.</p><p>The devil is in the details. In Washington state, Microsoft supported legislation - sponsored by state Sen. Joe Nguyen, a Microsoft employee - that outlines some of how the government can use the tech and requires agencies to produce accountability reports. It also addresses accuracy concerns by saying government agencies can only use the tech if it comes from a developer that makes its software available for testing.</p><p>But opponents said the Washington law comes with too few limits and enforcement measures. \"Agencies may use face surveillance without any restrictions to surveil entire crowds at football stadiums, places of worship, or on public street corners, chilling people's constitutionally protected rights and civil liberties,\" the ACLU of Washington said.</p><p>Microsoft's announcement this week that it wouldn't sell to police until there is a federal law \"should feel like winning, but it feels more like a thinly veiled threat,\" said Liz O'Sullivan, technology director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project. The Washington law, she said, would be a bad model for Congress.</p><p>\"They're seeding the conversations around facial recognition regulation in a number of states by lobbying for bills that might look to a lot of people like they've got really strict protections.

One pressing issue for any national legislation is whether it would overrule state and local laws that might be more strict.</p><p>\"Legislatures and activists and civil rights groups are already leading on this issue,\" said Matt Cagle, technology and civil liberties attorney for the ACLU of Northern California. \"We just hope that companies like Microsoft see that and stand with us rather than against us .\"  </p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:geoffrey.fowler@washpost.com\">geoffrey.fowler@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

We always love having you on. You always have great information and insights.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That's Tom Homan there.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TOM HOMAN, FORMER ACTING DIRECTOR OF THE U.S. IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT: I love being on this show.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MACDONALD: Former top border guy. Okay. Same with us. We love having you on.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We hope you have a good weekend. Join us again on Monday. Thanks for watching. I'm Elizabeth MacDonald with \"The Evening Edit.\"</p><p>LOU DOBBS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: Good evening, everybody. Breaking News at this hour, President Trump has today terminated America's relationship with the World Health Organization as he had threatened to do if the agency did not begin immediate reforms.</p><p>Among the reforms the President sought, that the W.H.O. distance itself from the Chinese Communist Party, the President accusing the W.H.O. of being under the control of the Chinese Communist Party.</p><p>And also breaking over this past hour, Senators Chuck Grassley and Ron Johnson releasing the transcripts of phone conversations between former Trump National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and former Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.</p><p>Judicial Watch's Tom Fitton is with us tonight. He will be with us for an extended period tonight. We will be discussing, among other things, what the two men said in those calls now released to Congress and to the public.</p><p>The other top story of this evening, the local politicians in the City of Minneapolis, who are finally, finally reacting to the outrage of a citizen murdered and caught on video, and a local political community that did nothing for days.</p><p>Murder and manslaughter charges today filed against fired police officer, Derek Chauvin for the Memorial Day death of George Floyd.</p><p>We take all of this up here this evening, what turned into three days of violent demonstrations, looting and arson that ultimately, ultimately seemed necessary to convince the Mayor of Minneapolis who tried to blame everyone, but himself for the days of violence, and the local District Attorney who initially said there wasn't enough evidence when so clearly, to all of America, there certainly was clear evidence of the culpability, and at least, the basis for charges against the fired police officer.</p><p>Interestingly, Minneapolis, a community that for some strange reason did not turn first -- turn first to their Mayor, to the District Attorney, and the City Council, the local political authorities, who they seemingly forgot to include amongst those responsible for the death of this man.</p><p>The other story of the hour, President Trump today making his strongest statements to date about China. Standing in the Rose Garden, President Trump, saying directly that the Chinese Communist Party told lies, committed espionage and global expansion will no longer be tolerated by the United States.</p><p>The President announcing his administration will block Chinese nationals from entering the United States, those that the United States government deems to pose a national security risk.</p><p>He also assured that he will terminate the U.S. relationship with a World Health Organization forthwith for helping China cover up the Wuhan virus pandemic, and the deadly contagion that was unleashed on the world without so much as a slight warning by the Chinese government.</p><p>And the President promised to begin eliminating policy exemptions that give Hong Kong preferential treatment in the wake of the Chinese Communist government, effectively, effectively ending Hong Kong's autonomy and limiting the freedoms such as they are of Hong Kong residents now that they are under the power of Beijing directly.</p><p>The President's unprecedented actions following through on thoughts and feelings of the American people. Recent polling showing two-thirds of Americans now view China unfavorably, nine in 10 see Communist China as a threat to the United States and 70 percent of Americans also say they want restrictions on trade with China.</p><p>President Trump did not make any comments at the White House about new charges against the Minneapolis police officer who killed an unarmed black man kneeling on his neck for several minutes.</p><p>Fired police officer Derek Chauvin charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in the death of George Floyd. Local authorities finally bringing charges on what was a clear cut case of some form in the legal lexicon of homicide.</p><p>What specific legal charge really never in question. Everyone who saw the video knew what had happened, and exactly who was responsible.</p><p>Local authorities chose to ignore that evidence and blamed amongst others, the President of the United States, almost anyone but themselves, in avoiding their duty to their community and to their citizens.</p><p>It's more than time, if I may say at this moment, that in this country we begin to acknowledge facts and truth and acknowledge the failure of local authorities to take responsibilities for the city's -- the citizens that they have failed in so many instances.</p><p>The Third Police Precinct Headquarters, that's where the police officers involved in Floyd's death worked was torched and left to burn by Minneapolis's Mayor.</p><p>The Police Force withdrawn effectively by that same Mayor. No curfew put in place, no restrictions of any kind on demonstrators and protesters, some of whom turned into looters and arsonists.</p><p>Hennepin County District Attorney Michael Freeman triggered last night's outrage or at least much of it. He said no clear video evidence existed of Lloyd's killing, and it did not support a criminal charge.</p><p>But newly released video does show Police Officer Chauvin and two others laying on Floyd as he is helplessly -- held helplessly on the ground, another police officer standing nearby.</p><p>The District Attorney today after viewing that video says he now sees criminal activity, suggests more charges could be coming for other officers as well.</p><p>Hours before any charges were announced, President Trump tweeted a warning that he would send in the National Guard to save Minneapolis from its incompetent local officials and certainly incompetent Mayor.</p><p>The President said this quote, \"These thugs are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd and I won't let that happen. Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control, but when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you.\"</p><p>Twitter once again censored the President's tweet incredibly, claiming that the President had glorified violence. Twitter apparently underway what had preceded over the previous three days.</p><p>Twitter refusing to acknowledge that a 43-year-old man had been shot and killed as protesters looted stores Wednesday in Minneapolis, or that Democratic Mayor Jacob Frey has allowed his city to be looted, to be set aflame by so-called protesters who became arsonists and looters.</p><p>Angry, they said about the death of George Floyd in the custody of his police department, a city that is still grappling with nearly 10 percent unemployment, a poverty rate near 21 percent, and the Mayor has the temerity to blame the President of the United States.</p><p>Minnesota's governor Tim Walz has since activated the National Guard to restore order as the President intimated he should as the state is bracing for the potential of even more violence.</p><p>Fox News senior correspondent, Mike Tobin is on the ground in Minneapolis and has the latest for us -- Mike.</p><p>MICHAEL TOBIN, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Lou, I'm in Minneapolis with a dramatically different scene than yesterday with no police presence and the mob rolling the street yesterday.</p><p>Take a look behind me now, you see a row of National Guardsmen also with State Troopers behind the Guardsmen with M-16s at the ready, the State Troopers with truncheons and riot gear, beneath those padded vests are ballistic vests and you see in front of them what forms and goes away from time to time is crowds of more demonstrators.</p><p>Still dissatisfied -- dissatisfied that it took four days and tremendous social pressure to arrive at a murder charge against Derek Chauvin, the police officer. The Hennepin County Attorney saying that more charges against other officers are possible.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE FREEMAN, HENNEPIN COUNTY ATTORNEY: We felt it appropriate to focus on the most dangerous perpetrator. I'm not going to speculate today of the other officers. They are under investigation. I anticipate charges, but I'm not going to get into that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TOBIN: And last night, we saw something I've never seen in my career of TV news, police officers from the Third Precinct of Minneapolis Police Department retreating under pressure from the angry mob.</p><p>The mob had approached the Third Precinct building several times. The police officer beat them back with teargas and other non-lethal weapons. At one point, they formed up in the parking lot. They got in vehicles, they got on foot and they got out of the Third Precinct.</p><p>What followed was rioting, arson, vandalism, unabated in these neighborhoods. Police presence not to be seen at all.</p><p>Now, you have this dramatic development with the charges against the police officer, and you have the family -- the attorney, I should say for the family, Benjamin Crump saying the family is dissatisfied with these charges of third-degree murder and manslaughter. They wanted first degree murder -- Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Mike, it was an extraordinary scene that you witnessed and brought to us all. It is also extraordinary, the degree to which Mayor Frey and the other local officials, why in the world were the citizens -- why weren't they demonstrating in front of that Mayor who was absolutely in my judgment -- and I don't want you to get involved in my opinion -- but absolutely irresponsible.</p><p>This community has complete control of their lives through their local officials, and apparently this Mayor decided he didn't have to protect his police force. He didn't have to protect the Third Precinct.</p><p>I mean, this is outrageous conduct on the part of any local official or any state official for that matter, that to not have this protection from the National Guard immediately. This is just outrageous. What is the feeling there about their city government for crying out loud?</p><p>TOBIN: Well, some people clearly were dissatisfied with the absence of police presence. I talked to people as the looters were coming and going from the Target throughout the day. They were dissatisfied.</p><p>But it really seems that Mayor Frey made a decision to go 180 degrees from what we saw in Ferguson with the police in Ferguson way back when in the Michael Brown case, with a large overreaction and a big show of force that was ugly and it really ignited the crowd out there.</p><p>Here was a situation where they decided we're not going to have friction with the demonstrators. We're not going to have these conflicts that play out over the airwaves.</p><p>Anytime the teargas comes out, anytime the riot gear or the truncheons come out, it's always an ugly scene. That is the lead story and it really ignites people.</p><p>So, they went the other direction and they let the mob have the street. We got another ugly scene -- Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: And we got the same result that is looting, rioting and arson. And I -- and for the life of me, I cannot understand why the community leaders in Minneapolis were not talking to that young, inexperienced Mayor and talking to him about what was going on.</p><p>We had video evidence of a death for crying out loud, why charges would not have been brought immediately, it's incomprehensible to most Americans.</p><p>And I don't care what political part of the spectrum you're on or ideological. This was a man killed by a police officer with his knee on his neck and it was straightforwardly so.</p><p>TOBIN: Well, there's not really anyone who would disagree with you, and all I can tell you to supplement what you're saying is that the Hennepin County Attorney, Mike Freeman said, this is the fastest that charges have ever been brought against a police officer in this county.</p><p>But clearly what the demonstrators who are out here, they are absolutely dissatisfied that it took this long and the one thing I keep hearing is the hypothetical is that if that was a white person laying on the ground, the charges would have been rapid. The arrests would have been rapid.</p><p>That is their opinion out here. Very dissatisfied with the speed that things took.</p><p>But overall, with the different things that people have been calling for along the way, they wanted to see criminal charges. They wanted to see a legal process playing out.</p><p>Well the legal process is playing out. You do have criminal charges. They're still out in the street. Why are they still on the street? One word -- anger -- Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, their anger should be placed on their local leadership, their local officials, because they behaved unconscionably throughout these five days, as far as I'm concerned, until today, and they should be holding them accountable.</p><p>And by the way, Mike, as I wrap up this part of my opinion on this, I have to tell you, the idea that these folks are not in that community every day with their city council, their Mayor making certain they've got the kind of police department and city government that they want and deserve, they have got to commit that energy to avoid more scenes like this in Minneapolis.</p><p>Mike, I want to just say, thank you always for your great reporting throughout the years, and throughout this week. Thank you, sir.</p><p>Up next, we discuss the President's strong address on China. Dr. Michael Pillsbury joins me right -- well, just within a moment.</p><p>Stay with us. We'll be right back.</p><p>DOBBS: Joining us tonight is the country's leading authority on China, Dr. Michael Pillsbury. He is Director of the Center for Chinese Strategy at the Hudson Institute.</p><p>Mike, it's good to have you with us. Let's talk about first of all your thoughts about the President's statements today, first, breaking with the World Health Organization as he had said he would do if they did not begin immediate reforms.</p><p>DR. MICHAEL PILLSBURY, DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR CHINESE STRATEGY, THE HUDSON INSTITUTE: Well, Lou, I thought they were both actions that the President announced and also some really stinging allegations that will shame China, in particular, saying that China instigated the pandemic, which cost a million lives around the world.</p><p>A lot of really harsh statements in this presentation cause me to believe this is the toughest statement any President has made to China in 50 years.</p><p>You have to go back to 1970 when President Nixon deployed an ABM system against what he called a reckless China that could not be trusted.</p><p>For those 50 years, all American Presidents have spoken very positively, even cooperatively with China. This is a real historic statement today, Lou.</p><p>The actions also are powerful, but I think it's the allegations against China for treaty violations and for causing the death of a million people by using this word instigating.</p><p>He also is back to saying Wuhan virus. This remember it was ruled out as not proper. So, it's a really quite striking speech, I thought in terms of 50 years of history.</p><p>DOBBS: Everyone who is calling it anything other than the Wuhan virus is playing a politically correct cowardly, a game of mind control which the Chinese are winning. That is their insistence that it not be called the Wuhan virus. It would be as if suddenly, we were no longer to refer to the Ebola, you know, as Ebola for crying out loud.</p><p>Go through the list of pandemics and outbreaks of contagions, they are named after places, nearly all of them, most of them and why Wuhan should not have that same label is preposterous.</p><p>So, I'm like you, delighted that the President is using plain language, when particularly now that we're dealing with a country that's responsible for the infection of millions and the deaths of another million around the world.</p><p>Let's talk about where the President goes now. Hong Kong -- he was very upset as well about that, putting the blame entirely on China, of course, with the Wuhan virus and the contagion that has followed the worldwide pandemic.</p><p>He was also very strong on Hong Kong. I am pleased to say.</p><p>PILLSBURY: Yes, Lou. I think he used the magic word there, too, which is treaty that the British-Chinese Agreement or so called Joint Declaration of 1984, is in fact a treaty by our point of view, and by the British point of view, the Chinese are trying to weasel out of it and say no, that agreement is no longer active. It's just a historical relic.</p><p>So, the President is calling out the Chinese now as violating an International Treaty. Those are really stingy words in Beijing because he is laying the foundation that China is a rogue state.</p><p>I noticed he also used the word unlawful. There's a U.N. tribunal decision at The Hague in 2016 that the South China Sea does not belong to China. So President Trump used the phrase unlawful, China is making unlawful claims of the Pacific as being part of its territory.</p><p>This is another example of laying the foundation for what looks to me like a new strategy toward China that is not based on trust.</p><p>He also had Ambassador Lighthizer standing there, Lou, not a word about the Trade Agreement, but there is the 600-pound gorilla present, but no comment whether China is observing or violating the trade Phase 1 Trade Deal.</p><p>That really was the big question the President left in suspense, you might say, Lou for the future, for the next statement.</p><p>DOBBS: Let's go to a couple of the overt statements of the President, if we may, talking about what China has done, and it begins, this pandemic has underscored -- if we could roll that soundbite, please.</p><p>This pandemic has underscored the crucial importance of building up America's economic independence, if we could listen to the President.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This pandemic has underscored the crucial importance of building up America's economic independence, reassuring our critical supply chains and protecting America's scientific and technological advances.</p><p>For years, the government of China has conducted illicit espionage to steal our industrial secrets of which there are many.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: The President opining very clearly that the days of tolerating the outrages of a lawless China are over. Your thoughts.</p><p>PILLSBURY: Well, I think this is another stinging allegation, Lou, where he is essentially implying that China's growth -- China is becoming the number two power in the world and being close to surpassing us is based on unlawful conduct, stealing our industrial secrets, which as he put it, with characteristic understatement he said, of which there are not a few or a many.</p><p>This is the key to Chinese economic growth. It's why they can challenge us globally now. They've essentially stolen their way to the top in my opinion.</p><p>So, it was quite striking for me to hear the President use this kind of tough language against the Chinese. I'm thinking back to his speech when he visited Beijing, Lou, in November 2017. Very different in those days, looking forward to the U.S. and China cooperating, sort of getting rich together.</p><p>That seems to be gone. That's now a distant hope that the President will just barely mention.</p><p>DOBBS: And I think back to January 15th of this year, quite a different tone, as you say, and as I'm sure you vividly remember.</p><p>Dr. Michael Pillsbury, thanks for being with us. We appreciate it.</p><p>We'd like to hear your thoughts on all of this. Please share your comments. Follow me on Twitter @LouDobbs. Like me on Facebook and follow me on Instagram @LouDobbsTonight.</p><p>Up next, the local authorities in Minneapolis failed in their duty in seemingly every way to protect their community, their citizens and the family of a murdered citizen.</p><p>\"Fox and Friends\" Weekend co-host Minnesota, native, Pete Hegseth joins us to take all of this up right after these quick messages. Please stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: Joining us tonight is Pete Hegseth. He is co-host, of course, of \"Fox and Friends\" Weekend. He is also the author of the new book, \"American Crusade: Our Fight to Stay Free, \" now available everywhere, we are pleased to tell you.</p><p>Pete, good to have you with us. Congratulations on the book.</p><p>PETE HEGSETH, FOX NEWS HOST: Thank you, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: I want to start -- unfortunately, I want to start in Minneapolis, where we have watched this tragedy unfold over this week.</p><p>I have -- I cannot recall a time where local leadership seemed more confused, confounded, and less willing to take any responsibilities for the citizens they are supposed to be serving. Your thoughts.</p><p>HEGSETH: You're precisely correct, having been born and raised in Minnesota, I mean, Minneapolis has suffered from a generation of terrible leftwing leadership, but it's even more acute right now.</p><p>I mean, Governor Walz was effectively AWOL until today. Mayor Fred Frey who has never held a real job until becoming Mayor of a major metropolitan area, he ran on improving police community relations, which clearly he has failed at.</p><p>He has flip flopped on back and forth this entire crisis. Then you've got - - the senators for the state are completely AWOL. One was running for President, the other one is an empty suit completely.</p><p>You've got a District Attorney -- you've got the Attorney General in Keith Ellison who is completely ideological.</p><p>So, they're very -- they're completely rudderless, and you've seen it in every way this has been handled. And ultimately, you can't allow a sin -- a terrible thing that was committed to George Floyd be compounded by absolute lawlessness and the utter destruction of looters and riders who are crushing a community and businesses inside that community.</p><p>Law and order has to exist for the people who need it the most as well. So, maybe with the curfew, maybe with a direct approach, maybe with the National Guard, we'll see the situation come under control.</p><p>But because they equivocated we're not direct, we're not clear and we're not strong, this tragedy has spiraled into something much more dangerous to the community, it is terrible to see.</p><p>DOBBS: It is terrible and it is without question, a tragedy and also a needless tragedy. But also, you have to wonder, where are the leaders of the community? Where have they been during city council meetings?</p><p>Where have they been trying to counsel this inexperienced and untested mayor who is facile and unwilling to stand up like a man and take responsibility in a moment of great sorrow and pain for his community, to see this kind of ignorance unleashed on the streets of Minneapolis because a mayor doesn't have guts, because the City Council isn't engaged.</p><p>Because the community there isn't engaged with the City Council, obviously. They have the ability to control their lives with those local power centers and I don't know where the black churches are, I don't know where the black teachers and leaders are.</p><p>It is such a failure of community and local government that it's just pathetic.</p><p>HEGSETH: It's been abandoned meant more than just in the moment where you leave it to be rioted and looted. It's a generation of abandonment because of leftwing policies that have failed that community.</p><p>And you know, I want to live, Lou, in the kind of place where if someone is at my Cub Foods, which is what happened and maybe using a fraudulent $20.00 bill, that owner can call the police and the police will be there in two minutes regardless of the race or gender of who is calling and try to be the rightful arbiter.</p><p>Unfortunately, the wrong thing happened on the scene and what has unfolded since is people whose businesses are being destroyed and crushed, can't call anyone as their livelihoods are gone and that is a direct reflection of a total void of leadership as we talked about.</p><p>DOBBS: You're exactly right and to think that that police officer put his knee in that man's back, video of it, another officer also on his back, and prosecutors, the Mayor, everyone is wanting to say we need time to figure this out.</p><p>Everyone who saw that video knew that man had been killed by that police officer. The charges, the legal matters, all of that is a matter, of course, of due process, but to not even take that evidence and apply common sense to the situation and say this officer now has to be held until we can figure out the appropriateness in charges.</p><p>Everyone who sees it --</p><p>HEGSETH: And you wonder, Lou if they didn't understand the urgency, I want to think maybe it was just a burning desire to follow proper protocol, to make sure justice truly is served and there is no mistake there. In that sense, they could have been in the right.</p><p>But it doesn't mean they're not tone deaf to the reality of the moment and what people -- I mean, you don't want a rioting and looting mob to set the terms of justice.</p><p>At the same time, you only have so many levers at your disposal as a leader, and in this case, they were leading from behind.</p><p>DOBBS: Absolutely. And let me be very clear, I'm not in any way condoning looting or arson or rioting. In fact, I condemn it to hell.</p><p>HEGSETH: No way.</p><p>DOBBS: But the fact is, the sad fact is, those street demonstrations and those protests were absolutely necessary because they have fools leading that local government, led by that extraordinary incompetent, the Mayor.</p><p>HEGSETH: Yes, the protest, indeed, the looting, absolutely not. And it all reinforces what a thin line civility is and how important policing really is, when done properly, which 99 percent do as you always talk about, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: And how important just plain old decency is each and every day in this country.</p><p>HEGSETH: You're right.</p><p>DOBBS: Pete Hegseth, we thank you for being with us. And we want to remind you to grab a copy of his brand new book, \"American Crusade: Our Fight to Stay Free.\" And let me be very clear, we recommend it to you highly. Pete, thanks for being with us.</p><p>Up next, there's a conflict of truth going on right now about mail-in ballots in this country. Why should that be? We'll set the record straight. Judicial Watch's Tom Fitton joins us. He'll be here for two blocks, not one, two, maybe three, right after these quick messages. Stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: Ohio's Secretary of State, Frank LaRose warning expanded mail-in voting could lead to, quote, \"logistical and fraud problems.\" Good thing he is not tweeting that. He has reasons to be concerned.</p><p>Twitter, if you're listening.</p><p>In the past week, a former elections judge in Philadelphia admitted to ballot stuffing for Democrats, the NAACP in Paterson, New Jersey -- wants a City Council election do over because of rampant voter fraud and a West Virginia mailman stands accused of changing party affiliations on ballots.</p><p>In the past several election cycles, Heritage Foundation has documented 1,300 proven instances of voter fraud, more than 1,100 convictions.</p><p>And joining us tonight is Tom Fitton, the President of Judicial Watch and one of the most knowledgeable people in the country on the issue of voter fraud.</p><p>And I'm sure that you had to be more than a little chagrin to hear the rather pious Twitter statements about the President. I mean, I cannot even imagine what the -- what's his name -- Jack Dorsey? The precious idiot who leads that organization. Who does he think he is?</p><p>TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT, JUDICIAL WATCH: Well, Twitter came down on the side of a partisan illegal move by the Governor of California to send ballots willy-nilly to everyone, quote, \"registered to vote,\" which would include under Newsom's own rules, people who have died or moved away who are still on the registration rolls.</p><p>So, when the President raises concerns about that, he is right. And when Twitter says those concerns are unfounded, they are wrong, and they are misleading people.</p><p>And I tell you what, Lou, if the Governor of California is illegally going to be sending out ballots, those ballots may end up never getting counted under law.</p><p>So, if you want your votes to count in California, if you want the rule of law to prevail on Election Day, we want to stop dead, this plan by the Governor to blow up the elections, at least in California, which is what we're trying to do, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, and we know that this is happening all over the country.</p><p>FITTON: Well, yes, and other states are pushing harder on it. But it's a major, major issue.</p><p>DOBBS: It's stunning stuff. I just -- I cannot -- what is the President's recourse here? He's taking up the -- you know, the section of the F.C.C. regulations, trying to get responsibility rather than immunity for Big Tech and social media platforms. What more can be done?</p><p>They come right back the next day and act like they are a leftwing activist organization.</p><p>FITTON: Well, that's what they are. And Section 230, a law the President has referenced that people talk about changing Section 230. I've always been of the opinion and the President now seems to be of the opinion, too that the law didn't need to be changed, that reality needs to be recognized that these companies were acting as publishers, as opposed to neutral parties, just allowing people to post on their bulletin boards.</p><p>When you start telling people what they can and can't post outside the typical forms of unprotected activity, like violence and pornography, and you start saying politically, you can't post that, that's publishers, and publishers don't have the protections that the Twitter and Facebook and Google monopolies do.</p><p>So, the President is highlighting that that protection, they have given up their protection, and so people who are victimized, they may have cases now.</p><p>DOBBS: Right. Well, this is the time for an end to these immunities that have been created, whether it be in Civil Law or criminal. It's time for people to be held accountable for their actions and their maligned acts. This is certainly one of them against a President of the United States.</p><p>We'll be back with more from Tom Fitton. We're going to take up the latest declassification of communications between General Flynn and the Russian Ambassador. Sounds sinister, doesn't it?</p><p>Stay with us. We'll be right back.</p><p>DOBBS: We're back with Judicial Watch's Tom Fitton. Tom, I want to turn quickly to the release of these transcripts between Kislyak, the Russian Ambassador and General Michael Flynn, what do you make of them?</p><p>FITTON: Well, no wonder they've been hiding them for so long because they so show not only that Flynn didn't commit misconduct, but that he should get another medal.</p><p>They show that he was able to persuade the Russians to not escalate in a tit-for-tat fashion a battle with the Obama administration they had kicked out some Russians and Flynn's like, don't go do whatever you want to do in terms of just make it an equal one for one, but don't escalate it in a way, that's going to require us to keep on escalating it back and forth, and that's exactly what the Russians did.</p><p>And so, Flynn didn't do anything wrong in that regard. In fact, it reads like diplomatic communications between obviously the Russians and the incoming administration.</p><p>The fact they were spying on them, and the fact that transcripts exist to me are evidence of a crime. They should have turned the tapes off as they were listening to Kislyak, as soon as he started talking to Flynn.</p><p>They had no business monitoring the Communications of the Trump campaign.</p><p>And of course, they knew they had no business because on January 4th, they concluded, the F.B.I. did, there was no viable case against Flynn. And that CYA memo by Rice suggests they have no case against Flynn.</p><p>They all knew he did nothing wrong, yet, they ambushed him and they tried to put him in jail based on false pretenses.</p><p>Well, it is a scandal beyond measure.</p><p>DOBBS: A scandal beyond measure and every one of them ought to go to jail. Period. There is no question whatsoever. These people are absolutely evil to have done this to a man who stands absolutely blameless of everything, they could even conjure up fictionally to charge him with.</p><p>Let's turn also to -- speaking of conjuring -- Emmet Sullivan continuing against this -- this man who has been so wrong for three years.</p><p>Emmet Sullivan, is there going to -- can he be removed from office? Is that just simply a faint fantasy on my part? Is there any way in which the Justice Department and the Judiciary can actually bring the hammer down on a man who would be so irresponsible and ignorant from the bench?</p><p>FITTON: Well, I guess in theory, he could be impeached. That's not going to happen with a Democratic-controlled House.</p><p>The Court should order him to dismiss the case. He is playing judge and prosecutor at the same time, which is contrary to the American system of justice.</p><p>I don't understand it. I mean, we've been before Judge Sullivan more many in this town. I've been in his courtroom often.</p><p>Our lawyers have argued before him often. He brought in all these Clinton e-mail witnesses in the middle of the campaign.</p><p>Judge Sullivan's case that allow Judicial Watch to figure out the contours of the Clinton e-mail scandal, is as much a contributing factor to Hillary Clinton's loss as anything.</p><p>So, to see him go after Flynn like this with this judicial adventurism, it is difficult to explain and disappointing to say, to put it mildly.</p><p>DOBBS: Tom, as we wrap up here in about 30 seconds, Lindsey Graham thinks it would be a buff idea for all of the Republican judges who have been appointed by a Republican Presidents who are nearing retirement age to resign now and be replaced by Republicans while they still control apparently, the Senate.</p><p>Have you ever seen a more defeatist, too clever by half recommendation by anyone?</p><p>FITTON: Yes, well, you know, the Senate isn't doing much else, so they might as well just confirm judges.</p><p>The other problem in the Senate is that they have been successful in confirming judges, despite the obstacles for the Democrats.</p><p>They've got to get the appointees in the administrative agencies. That's been unconscionably slow, and the reason it's not happening is because the Senate leadership basically works two and a half days a week.</p><p>DOBBS: Tom Fitton, as always, succinct, to the point. We appreciate it. Tom Fitton, great American.</p><p>Up next, where have the religious leaders been as Minneapolis burned? We take that up and much more with Pastor Robert Jeffress here, next. Stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: Joining us tonight, Pastor Robert Jeffress, member of the White House Faith Initiative, Pastor of the First Baptist Church of Dallas, Fox Business contributor, author of the new book, \"Praying for America,\" available now for preorder. We recommend it to you highly, \"Praying for America,\" Dr. Robert Jeffress.</p><p>It comes out Tuesday, so you've still got time to order early and often. Pastor, great to have you with us. Let me -- let's start with two states.</p><p>First of all, it's great to have you here and great of you to be writing such wonderful books. Let's turn to Illinois. Governor Pritzker there, finally loosening up, but it took Justice Kavanaugh demanding he respond to lawsuits against his sanctions against religion. Your thoughts?</p><p>PASTOR ROBERT JEFFRESS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, you know, for the last few weeks Lou, Pritzker has been huffing and puffing and threatening to blow Illinois churches down. And then last night, he folds like a cheap suit and he does so for one reason, and that reason's name is Donald J. Trump.</p><p>After President Trump last week encouraged people to defy the tyranny of Pritzker and others that emboldened churches to stand up, and not only that, Pritzker did not want to face this Trump appointed Justice, Brett Kavanaugh, who is a champion of religious liberty.</p><p>And Lou, this is just one more reason that evangelicals believe President Trump is the most pro-religious liberty President in history and they're going to turn out in record number on November 3rd to reelect him.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, let's turn to now Minneapolis where the President had to tell the Governor of the State, if he didn't get in control of what the Mayor obviously could -- the Mayor was lost.</p><p>He was absolutely earlier, Pete Hegseth, saying that he was AWOL. It was worse than that. It was -- it's just disgusting what they did there.</p><p>But what I don't understand is, where are the church leaders in Minneapolis? Where are the black church leaders? Where are the evangelicals -- all faiths -- in that city grabbing that young Mayor by the collar and saying, don't be a damn fool. Get out there and work for your people and stop this silly political nonsense.</p><p>JEFFRESS: Well, that's right, Lou. It is time for religious leaders to stand up and say without stuttering or stammering God does hate racism. To hate a person because of the color of his skin is to hate the God who gave them their skin color.</p><p>But we also need to say that the answer to despicable acts and this act by that policeman was a despicable act, the answer is not more despicable acts, but it is peace.</p><p>DOBBS: Absolutely. Pastor Robert Jeffress, I wish we had time to send you to all the hot spots of the world and straighten them out.</p><p>The new book by Pastor Jeffress is \"Praying for America\" and pray we do. It's available for preorder. We urge you to buy it.</p><p>Also available, Pete Hegseth's new book, \"American Crusade: Our Fight to Stay Free.\"</p><p>Thank you very much, Pastor. Great to have you here.</p><p>Congressman Jim Banks will be with us on Monday. We will be talking China, China and China.</p><p>Good night from Sussex.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LOUDOB-2020052901cb229</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LOUDOB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6018-0MS1-JB20-G4BH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">383182</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6228\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Lou Dobbs Tonight</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 29, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Coronavirus</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>China</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Health and Medicine</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>George Floyd</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Violence</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Hong Kong</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Policies</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Election</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Espionage</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Michael Flynn</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>Mayors</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Qjc5QjBGQUU4M0Y4NDVEMEI4Njk1MUVGRjU1NzREMzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001970</classCode><className>TRENDS &amp;

But the company sells a surveillance tool to police that studies say misidentifies darker-skinned people.</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">THE COLLECTIVE OUTRAGE over the murder of George Floyd has led to nationwide protests, renewed calls for police reform, and uncharacteristically swift support for racial equity from Silicon Valley leaders.</p><p>The backlash has been swift as well. Critics are calling out many companies now pledging support for Black Lives Matter, accusing them of failing to stop racist language on their platforms and, in some cases, enabling the over-policing and surveillance that protesters now march against.</p><p>Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos took to Instagram last week to share an essay by the writer Shenequa Golding, commenting on the  long reach  of racial trauma. The next day, the official Amazon account tweeted a message  in solidarity with the black community.  Amazon Web Services CEO Andy Jassy tweeted last week,  What will it take for us to refuse to accept these unjust killings of black people? </p><p>But Amazon furnishes surveillance tools to police, including the widely criticized facial recognition product, Rekognition. The tool misidentifies darker-skinned people more often than lighter-skinned people, according to a report from AI researcher Joy Buolamwini. In 2018, the ACLU found the tool misidentified members of Congress as criminals, misidentifying black officials more often than white ones.</p><p>Amazon tweeting support of  the fight against systematic racism and injustice  is a textbook case of substituting virtue signaling for virtue,  said Evan Selinger, privacy scholar and professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology.  Not only have civil rights groups criticized Amazon for promoting a facial recognition tool to law enforcement that poses dire threats to minorities, but so have concerned shareholders. </p><p>Jassy has defended Rekognition, even as employees and numerous racial justice organizations opposed its sale to police. In an all-hands meeting in 2018, Jassy told employees,  if we find people are violating folks  constitutional rights, they won t be able to use the services any longer ... In a democracy it is also often the role and the responsibilities of the government to help specify what the guidelines and regulations should be about technology. </p><p>There are no laws against police use of these surveillance tools, but Jassy s comments speak to a flawed idea that inhibits efforts at police reform: These tools are acceptable because they aren t illegal. In the wake of the protests, Trump reportedly told law enforcement,  you have to track  rioters, renewing concerns that police would use surveillance technology as part of their response to protest.</p><p>Amazon didn t respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Similarly, Google CEO Sundar Pichai on Sunday voiced Google s  support for racial equality in solidarity with the Black community.  But, Google, too, has been criticized for supporting invasive policing tactics.</p><p>Civil rights organizations have called out Google s practice of enabling  geofencing warrants.  These warrants permit police to request from Google data on devices in the area surrounding a crime. Google initially supplies anonymous information for phones within the area specified by the warrant. After police narrow their suspects, Google supplies usernames and location data for the specific devices.</p><p>There s scant evidence that geofencing targets communities of color specifically, but many have criticized the dragnet created when devices far outside of crime scenes are included. Geofencing warrants are often written using GPS coordinates, not street names and addresses. Critics say many are overbroad and include many more people than those reasonably near the scene of a crime.</p><p>It s not clear how often police request geofencing warrants, but Google s self-reported data on government requests show a big surge in search warrants, to roughly 20,000 last year from 10,000 in 2017. Starting in January, Google has charged police up to $245 for data requests.</p><p> Because of insufficient Fourth Amendment protections, GPS, text, social media, or search data from your Android phone might end up as evidence in a court case,  said Liz O Sullivan, technology director of the privacy nonprofit Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, or STOP.  There is a lot more that big tech companies could be doing to protect the public interest, but instead we see gobs of lobbying money spent opposing legislation that might actually promote justice. </p><p>Google did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Some companies are being called out for developing products criticized for enabling over-policing and surveillance of nonwhite communities. For example, when the official accounts for Salesforce and Github tweeted support for Black Lives Matter, many people online pointed out the company s contracts with Customs and Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p><p>Nextdoor, a community-based social networking app, tweeted its support for Black Lives Matter, prompting immediate criticism. For years, Nextdoor s leadership has faced accusations that its users racially profile people of color and accuse them of crimes.</p><p>In a statement to WIRED, Nextdoor said racial profiling on the app declined after it began using algorithms to detect racist speech and required more detailed information if a user wants to report someone as suspicious.  Just one incident is too many, and we remain committed to the hard work,  the company said.</p><p>Criticism extended beyond concerns over working with police. On Monday, Reddit cofounder and CEO Steve Huffman voiced his support for Black Lives Matter in an open letter to employees. Hours later, former CEO Ellen K. Pao accused Huffman of ignoring the racist trolls on the platform and, more seriously, of profiting from white supremacy.</p><p> You don t get to say BLM when Reddit nurtures and monetizes white supremacy and hate all day long,  she tweeted. As interim CEO in 2015, Pao pushed to ban some of the most flagrant subreddits, prompting backlash from longtime users. When Huffman succeeded her as CEO, he instead opted for a more hands off approach in which  communities ... set appropriate standards around language for themselves.  A spokesperson for Reddit said the company has banned racist subreddits and that Reddit now displays a warning screen to visitors of its most infamous subreddit, r/thedonald, a pro-Trump forum.</p><p>Likewise, Facebook continued to face criticism after executives, including CEO Mark Zuckerberg, met with civil rights leaders Monday night. Zuckerberg on Monday said Facebook would donate $10 million to racial justice organizations and noted that the original video of Floyd s death was posted to Facebook. But Zuckerberg has declined to take action against President Trump s  when the looting starts, the shooting starts  message, cross-posted from Twitter, where it was flagged with a warning label. Outraged employees organized a virtual walkout and spoke publicly against the decision.</p><p>In a statement after Monday s meeting, the leaders of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, and Color of Change connected the violence against protesters and Zuckerberg s decision. The Facebook CEO  did not demonstrate understanding of historic or modern-day voter suppression, and he refuses to acknowledge how Facebook is facilitating Trump s call for violence against protesters,  the statement read.</p><p>In a statement a Facebook spokesperson said the company was  grateful that leaders in the civil rights community took the time to share candid, honest feedback with Mark and Sheryl  Sandberg, the company s chief operating officer.</p><p> I think we might look at it as what is sometimes called  performative wokeness  by these companies, and issuing a statement that they  stand with the Black community  is the absolute least they can do,  said Chris Gilliard, an independent researcher studying surveillance and racism.</p><p> Many of these companies generate profit either by the exploitation of Black labor and/or by amplifying hate and extremism that directly harms Black folks,  he says.  If Amazon truly felt that Black lives matter, they would change the way they treat their workforce, stop selling Rekognition, and discontinue selling Ring doorbells. If Facebook truly stood with the Black community, they would eradicate the rampant white supremacy on their platform. </p><p>Because there aren t robust rules governing the fair use of emerging policing tools, company policy is very important. In lieu of government regulation, how executives write and interpret their companies  relationships with law enforcement can vary widely, either to align with reform-focused civil rights movements or against them.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">See Campaign:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/story/tech-companies-denounce-racism-will-silicon-valley-change/\">https://www.wired.com/story/tech-companies-denounce-racism-will-silicon-valley-change/</url><br/>Contact Information:<br/>Sidney Fussell<br/><br/>Tags:<br/>, Wire, United States, English<br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ICRWDE-httpsicrowdnewswirecomp2580886</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ICRWDE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6028-VXR1-JCTB-F1KX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433665</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1573\"/><timeReceived>6:10 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>iCrowdNewswire (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30185\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 3, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

I first raised this idea nearly five years ago, when people were first debating[1] how internet platforms should moderate toxic speech. It came up again last summer[2] in the context of the various fights over \"deplatforming\" certain individuals. I mentioned it, yet again, earlier this year in noting that this would be the most effective way[3] to truly create competition and \"break up\" the big internet platforms. </p><p>I've hinted that I was working on a longer paper about this, and I'm happy to note that the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University has now published that essay, entitled: Protocols, Not Platforms: A Technological Approach to Free Speech[4]. It's a part of a new essay series the Institute has just published, called Free Speech Futures[5], in which various scholars and experts \"reimagine\" the 1st Amendment. The article is long, but I wanted to be fairly thorough in explaining what I'm talking about -- and highlighting what might go wrong as well. As I note early on:This article proposes an entirely different approach\u2014one that might seem counterintuitive but might actually provide for a workable plan that enables more free speech, while minimizing the impact of trolling, hateful speech, and large-scale disinformation efforts. As a bonus, it also might help the users of these platforms regain control of their privacy. And to top it all off, it could even provide an entirely new revenue stream for the platforms. That approach: build protocols, not platforms.I don't know that this is the right solution. I don't know that it will work. But I do think it makes a lot more sense than almost every other proposed idea right now, most of which seem likely to simply lock in today's dominant players under a heavily regulated regime that likely stifles many potentially more innovative services, while similarly locking in the idea that we need to let the big internet companies \"protect\" our privacy. My idea would actually take the various internet providers out of the privacy protection business altogether, and move us to a world where the ends of the network (the users) have much more power and control, protected by encryption and better tools for managing our own privacy. Indeed, it even suggests possibilities for business models that don't rely on \"surveillance\" to work. At a time when so many proposals for how to deal with the big internet companies seem focused on spite and anger at those companies, rather than thoughtful discussions of how we get to what's coming next, at the very least I'm hopeful that others can be inspired by this paper to come up with their own ideas for a better, more proactive approach to a future internet.Permalink[6] | Comments[7] | Email This Story[8] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150717/11191531671/protocols-instead-platforms-rethinking-reddit-twitter-moderation-free-speech.shtml\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150717/11191531671/protocols-instead-platforms-rethinking-reddit-twitter-moderation-free-speech.shtml</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180808/17090940397/platforms-speech-truth-policy-policing-impossible-choices.shtml\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180808/17090940397/platforms-speech-truth-policy-policing-impossible-choices.shtml</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190309/00004641769/how-to-actually-break-up-big-tech.shtml\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190309/00004641769/how-to-actually-break-up-big-tech.shtml</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://knightcolumbia.org/content/protocols-not-platforms-a-technological-approach-to-free-speech\">https://knightcolumbia.org/content/protocols-not-platforms-a-technological-approach-to-free-speech</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://knightcolumbia.org/research/free-speech-futures-reimagining-the-first-amendment-in-the-digital-age\">https://knightcolumbia.org/research/free-speech-futures-reimagining-the-first-amendment-in-the-digital-age</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190825/21540442853/protocols-not-platforms-technological-approach-to-free-speech.shtml\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190825/21540442853/protocols-not-platforms-technological-approach-to-free-speech.shtml</url> [ 7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190825/21540442853/protocols-not-platforms-technological-approach-to-free-speech.shtml#comments\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190825/21540442853/protocols-not-platforms-technological-approach-to-free-speech.shtml#comments</url> [ 8]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190825/21540442853/protocols-not-platforms-technological-approach-to-free-speech.shtml?op=sharethis\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190825/21540442853/protocols-not-platforms-technological-approach-to-free-speech.shtml?op=sharethis</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DIRT102305156701204145525176500233</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIRT-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WXG-3TN1-JCMN-Y4RH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"707\"/><timeReceived>5:07 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Techdirt</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 28, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001928</classCode><className>COMPANY ACTIVITIES &amp;
