Following are Outsell's predictions for the coming year, and market drivers that companies in these segments will need to watch:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Google, Yahoo! and others power up the industry - what's happening overall</p><p>- Solid Growth in 2006: The information industry will grow 8 percent in 2006, to $306 billion. The Search, Aggregation &amp; Syndication and Market Research sectors, pushed ahead by so-called \"disrupters\" like Googleand Yahoo!, will lead the way. A greater percentage of content used will be subsidized by ads, putting price pressure on fee-based content vendors.</p><p>- Valuations Peak: Private equity buyers will keep bidding up prices--there's more money than targets. Valuations will continue to increase and peak in 2006, and then will start to wane by the end of the year and into 2007.</p><p>- Web 2.0 and content/technology mash-ups--where users build on open technology, social publishing, and other people's content--will take off and go mainstream in 2006.</p><p>The News Segment (i.e., companies like Knight Ridder and Gannett)</p><p>- It's Local News: The battle for local news and content users will kick into higher gear, further challenging newspapers to hold on to locally oriented customers. Community blogging and other social media will help. Regional newspapers will test TimesSelect-like models of columnist content, audio/video, archives, and staff interaction, in an effort to create new significant, non-ad, online revenue sources.</p><p>- Mating Dance: Newspapers will engage in new mating dances with GYM (Google, Yahoo!, MSN), coupling anew in some areas (mainly ads) and uncoupling in others (mainly editorial) as they try to find a new co-opetition equilibrium that works.</p><p>B2B Trade &amp; Company Information (i.e., companies like Hoover's, infoUSA, TechTarget, IDG, and Reed Business Information)</p><p>- Centers of Attention: Leading B2B companies will become hot spots for audiences in target niches. As general engines cast too wide a net, knowledge workers will embrace vertical search sites. Online revenue will move from a single-digit to a double-digit percentage of total revenue, and will make up 35 percent to 50 percent of total revenue in the strongest traditional companies.</p><p>Financial Information (i.e., FactSet, Bloomberg, Standard &amp; Poor's, Interactive Data Corporation)</p><p>- Seeing the Forest: Financial institutions will make significant progress toward holistic enterprise data management. Data integration will be in; product bundling and customer segmentation will be core challenges to overcome. Requirements for meeting regulatory obligations and managing risk will be the primary drivers in non-real-time data.</p><p>Market Research, Reports &amp; Services Segment (i.e., organizations like VNU, IMS Health, IRI, TNS, Gallup, Greenfield, and Corporate Executive Board)</p><p>- Cheap, Fast, and Global: Data acquisition costs will continue to decline with the rise of online market research; real data/real time will continue to drive the next frontier of real-time analysis. Globalization of the market research industry will continue.</p><p>IT Research Segment (i.e., Gartner, Yankee, Forrester, IDC)</p><p>- No IT Boom: Users Go Peer-to-Peer and Get Tactical: There's no big tech boom in sight to drive new business. Peer-to-peer service models will proliferate, and clients will focus on tactical information, moving from \"what\" to \"how\" questions.</p><p>Scientific, Technical &amp; Medical Information (i.e., Elsevier, Thomson Scientific &amp; Healthcare, Wolters Kluwer Health, Springer Science+Business Media, etc.)</p><p>- Corporations Drive Growth: Corporations will continue to become more important customers than academia in this space, with their needs driving product development.</p><p>- EMR Gets Real: Electronic medical record vendors and hospitals will start to integrate electronic clinical information into EMR systems in 2006.</p><p>Search, Aggregation &amp; Syndication</p><p>- Good Enough: Enterprise RSS aggregation will take hold in organizations. Fee-based general aggregators will continue to progress up the value chain as cheap or free \"good enough\" content sources continue to proliferate.</p><p>Information Management</p><p>- Purchasing Power: Enterprise content buyers will continue to consolidate content purchasing and use their increased buying power to extract better deals from vendors.</p><p>- Mind the Gap: The huge gap between knowledge workers' preferences and behaviors and the services delivered by enterprise information managers will widen unless information managers make radical changes.</p><p>In September, Outsell published FutureFacts: 2006 and Beyond, the market's first-ever comprehensive forecast of the trends and drivers fueling the information industry.

The ETA is now welcoming of the large tech companies its members once considered outsiders or even competitors.\u00c2\u00a0 Though this change may be unsettling to many ETA members, it's all too familiar to Rossi.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Rossi, an executive vice president at Wells Fargo, grew up on both the issuing and acquiring side of the industry. She was influential in bringing electronic payments to the stores that clung hardest to cash, such as grocery stores and fast-food chains. And she participated in the development of an electronic payment system for eBay that set the stage for PayPal's success.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Her vision for the ETA, particularly as payments shift increasingly to digital and mobile platforms, is to steer the group - both its traditional and new constituencies -toward a more collaborative future, one in which the very definition of an acquiring company changes. \"Things evolve in payments, and you can't stay in silos because we all depend on one another,\" she said. \"The fact that an executive of a bank is heading up ETA sends the message that we're all in payments together.\"</p><p>In an interview, Rossi discussed her objectives as new head of the ETA and the challenges she anticipates as she takes the helm.</p><p>You majored in communications at Ohio University. Were you thinking then of a career in banking and payments?I had a minor in business, but my goal was not to get into banking. One of my first jobs was working in real estate at Crocker National Bank, which was acquired by Wells Fargoin 1986. It just so happened that a position on the credit card issuing side became available at Wells Fargo, and somebody reached out to me. I thought it would be a great learning experience, and the rest is history.</p><p>That was a good time to get into the card business.In the mid- to late-\"~80s, credit card issuing was just taking off. BankAmericard was evolving into Visa, and there were a lot of opportunities back then because the credit card industry was just building out. Opportunity came along, and I took it.</p><p>So you were in issuing before you got into acquiring.I was very fortunate in that I started on the issuing side of the business and in the early \"~90s I moved over to the acquiring side. There are probably not a lot of people who grew up on both sides-merchant acquiring and card issuing.</p><p>You helped pioneer card acceptance at grocery stores and quick-service restaurants.Yes. When I first got into the acquiring business, Wells Fargowas just a California and Western states bank. We were just building out our acquiring business and trying to expand into emerging markets. It came up that, \"~wouldn't it be interesting if fast food took debit cards at the point of sale?' It wasn't even credit cards. It was debit cards because a lot of that business is cash.</p><p>We worked with Carl's Jr. way back then in \"~89, and they were the first fast-food chain to accept debit cards at the point of sale. We were the ones that helped them install the terminals at the point of sale. We had public announcements about the first fast-food chain to accept cards.</p><p>Today, every single fast food chain accepts debit and credit cards, but at the time it was new. Debit cards, we felt, were no different from cash - except it was a more convenient way to make payment. So it just made sense.</p><p>Carl's Jr. was in Southern California, willing to work with us and very interested in the future of payments.</p><p>What grocers were involved with the transition to cards?Around that same time we were talking with a grocery store in California. It was Lucky Stores. Its parent company, American Stores, was taken over by Albertsons. They were the first grocery in the country to accept a debit card and credit card. That grocery store was looking for a more efficient way to handle cash, which is through a debit card. They were also asking how they could expand service to their customers so that anyone could pay any way they wanted. And the credit card was born as payment for the first time at a grocery chain.</p><p>So, it was all built around convenience. Back then, there was some pushback. People said, \"~Wait a minute. You're not going to put food on a credit card?' That wasn't the premise. The goal was how do we create convenience for consumers at the point of sale for merchant segments like grocery, fast food or petroleum?</p><p>We were very much a pioneer in creating new payments.</p><p>We're talking about the late \"~80s. How much did the public use debit cards then?There was a company called Interlink, and it was owned by five big banks in California and Arizona-Security Pacific Bank, First Interstate Bancorp, Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Crocker Bank.\u00c2\u00a0 Those five banks said, \"~Today, a debit card is used to take money out of an ATM. What are other ways we could expand the use of a debit card if this is truly an alternative to cash?'</p><p>And those five banks got together and created Interlink. The Interlink mark was put on the back of the debit card. That is when we introduced it to be more than just to get cash out of an ATM. Now you could use it at the point of sale. Eventually, the five banks sold that company to Visa.</p><p>People didn't hear about it a lot because it was going on in the Western United States at that time. When we sold it to Visa, the whole premise was that it could work across the country. Today, the Interlink mark is still on the back of Visa debit cards in the United States and beyond. It is the debit card mark of Visa.</p><p>You also played a role in the early acceptance of cards on the Internet.Wells Fargohas always looked at innovation for how we can expand payment beyond traditional payments.</p><p>When the Internet was just picking up we asked, \"~How can debit and credit be used on the Internet for payment purposes so people can buy, shop and pay with a debit or credit card?' In the early \"~90s, we ran the first secure credit card transaction on the Internet with a small Internet startup company called Virtual Vineyards, which morphed into Wine.com.</p><p>We then worked with a startup that had an interesting idea. They wanted to sell Beanie Babies and other things in auctions on the Internet. In the early \"~90s when an auction was completed on the Internet they paid by sending checks to one another. The CEO of that company came to Wells Fargoand asked if there was a way to create payments on the Internet. That was a startup in the early \"~90s called eBay. We created a payment company called Billpoint that was going to become the payment engine for eBay, and that eventually [set the stage for] PayPal.</p><p>So that's how we got our start on Internet. We were focused on how commerce could be expanded to do shopping online and have a convenient way to pay - whether it be debit card or credit card - because cash and checks were not do going to do it for the Internet.</p><p>How did you become involved with the Electronic Transactions Association?I first started in about 2000 by sitting on their industry relations committee, and then I headed up that committee. It was dealing with the industry and all of the players, especially the card networks. I was also involved on the government relations committee, and then was eventually invited to sit on the board of ETA.</p><p>The ETA started as an ISO trade group, but now it's more inclusive. Do you feel it's unusual that someone from the banking side of the business is ascending to the ETA presidency?No, I really don't. As much as we all want to stay within our silos, with ISOs in theirs and banks in theirs, we all work together. We all depend upon one another. ISOs couldn't have existed without banks to sponsor them and help them with clearing and acquiring. It's kind of like Bank of America with the BankAmericard morphing into the Visa card. Things evolve in payments, and you can't stay in silos because we all depend on one another to collaborate, to work together on innovation. There've been heads of ISOs that have been president of ETA. There have been executives of processors. And the fact that an executive of a bank is heading up ETA sends the message that we're all in payments together and we collaborate to succeed in this space.</p><p>We're seeing some changes in the ETA with big tech companies joining the organization. How will that affect ISOs?You're right. There are a lot of big tech companies coming into the ETA. A lot of these companies are forming partnerships with ISOs. Some of the ISOs are becoming technology companies themselves. All of them are focused on promoting safety, security, reliability, usability. The tech companies are wonderful collaborators. They come into this space with some unique offerings and service and technology, and they're becoming wonderful partners for ISOs, banks, processors. I think they're playing a vital role in the ETA as far as the ISOs are concerned.</p><p>Do new entrants to the industry realize ISOs have a role to play in acquiring?I think they do. They understand that there is no one entity that is key to payments. It's not banks. It's not the Apples of the world. It's not technology companies. We're all working together. ISOs are very much key to the distribution of the services that are offered in payments. They play a critical role, and I do think the tech companies are aware of it. That's why a lot of them are partnering with ISOs.</p><p>ETA membership has grown quickly in the last year. Will that continue? What else do you see ahead for the association?The industry is growing, and the ETA is growing along with it. It started out to be an ISO organization, and it now has banks and processors and technology companies involved. In 2015, we're finally going to move from the discussion phase of mobile payments to real implementation, thanks to ETA member companies like Apple, Samsung, PayPal, AT&amp;T. These are the companies that are going to help ETA with the changes that we see ahead. And these are the people that are looking for distribution or looking for partners and are very focused on ISOs and banks and processors.</p><p>Will we see changes in data security this year?With the ETA, you're going to see more focus on safety and security. You're going to see that people outside the industry are looking at security around payments. The ETA is a wonderful entity to bring forth what we're doing with EMV, tokenization and so forth. There is a lot of change, but it is really exciting.</p><p>How can the ETA promote security? I guess education is part of it.Definitely education. It's also government advocacy. The ETA is working very hard in Washington, D.C., to educate regulators. \"~What is EMV? What is tokenization? What has the industry done or not done, and where are they moving to really focus on safety and security?' They play a very key role, a very specific role in educating key legislators around this. I'm not sure anyone else can play that role in Washington.</p><p>Can the ETA's Certified Payments Professional credential promote data security?The second way the ETA can help with safety and security is the CCP. It's a certification program that sets the standard for professional performance in the payments industry. What we like to say is that it's the symbol of excellence. Almost a thousand individuals earned the credential in this past year. That program actually focuses not only on educating individuals about payments but educating them on the safety and security around payments - as well as the ethics around payments. Big companies like Wells Fargoand First Data have training departments for their employees, but what about the ISOs? They don't have large training organizations, and the look to the ETA. The CPP is their training department, and they are really embracing it.</p><p>Are merchants using the CPP as a way to screen ISOs? How can the ETA tell merchants about the credential?The ETA is getting the word out there about the CPP and making sure people are aware it is available. They're partnering with groups such as the National Retail Federation to let them know in newsletters and magazines that this program is available.</p><p>How is this important to merchants? Merchants want to know they are dealing with experts in the payments industry - people who know about the risk, people who know about the efficiency and people who know in general about payments. Merchants would embrace this.\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>It's another value of doing business with the ETA. It's another value of being a member of the ETA.</p><p>The ETA's annual conference and trade show's been changing. It's now called \"~Transact,' and there's an emphasis on innovation, especially on innovative startups. What other changes do you have in store for us?The 2014 show was the largest event in ETA history. There were a record 220 exhibitors. Attendance was the largest it ever had been. The focus of the ETA is not to be the biggest conference in the world - like some others - but for the quality it brings to its members.</p><p>So in 2015, the show is in San Francisco, very close to Silicon Valley, and it's going to have a track with an emphasis on startups. There are a lot of startups coming to the show, and a lot of startups are members of the ETA.</p><p>Right now, payments is probably the most exciting place in technology. Investment in payments is picking up faster than ever. So there's going to be a three-day track that really is focused on letting investors know what's out there, what's the thinking around payments, what's new in startups in payments. So, they're going to focus on that.</p><p>At this 2015 conference you're also going to see something called \"~Payments Pitch Off,' where some of the most innovative companies in payments are going to vie for the ePay Innovation Award. So, there's a lot of emphasis around that.</p><p>In the exhibits, there's going to be a section for innovative startups at the conference.</p><p>Also at this conference you're going to have keynote speakers who are very interesting: the president of Visa, Ryan McInerney; the CEO of MCX, [Dekkers Davidson], the president of Alipay USA, [Jinming Li]. Talk about a wide range of payments perspectives. That's going to generate a lot of interest. It's a very exciting space right now.</p><p>Do you foresee more changes in the ETA itself?As the industry changes, so does the ETA. If it remained an ISO organization, there would be no growth. But it expanded the tent. Payments is about ISOs and banks and processors and technology companies. You're going to continue to see change in the ETA. We're going to have to see where payments are taking us.</p><p>For one thing, mobile is going to change the way we do business today, not only for our consumers, but for merchants, the processors, banks. How are we going to do it in a secure fashion - that has got to change. EMV and tokenization have existed internationally for a very long time. The U.S. has to really take a stance in catching up, focusing in these areas.</p><p>I think we can bring the value proposition when it comes to security to various entities in the payments value chain.</p><p>The ETA is involved with the Global Acquiring Conference, which is scheduled for May in London. Do you see other international opportunities for the association?ETA started out as a very U.S.-based business. It's now expanded to where many members are now international. It seems to make sense to me to extend the reach of ETA internationally. The conference in London is a natural extension of what the ETA is doing in the U.S.</p><p>Shifting gears, how are women faring in payments?I would say OK, probably not great. It could be better. When I started in this business, it was exclusively men. I sat on many boards for MasterCard and Visa, and I was the only woman on those boards. I'm happy to say, though, we have diversity on the ETA board. There are women representing large companies. We have a ways to go, but we're starting to move into this space where women play a serious, vital role. They've got to be willing to take the risk. They have to have the courage and commitment. This is a very complicated, male-dominated industry. But I'm thrilled that it's starting to change. The sails are starting to shift.</p><p>I'm very pleased to see we have representation from women from companies large, medium and small. We do have women sitting on the board as well as on all of the committees. So I think we are seeing a shift in this industry. The opportunity is there for them to really succeed and help change the industry.</p><p>We talked about mobile payments taking off this year. What else do you see happening?What we see ahead, especially with mobile and Apple Pay being introduced, is payments is going to continue to grow.\u00c2\u00a0 We're going to see more innovation. Security and\u00c2\u00a0 safety are going to be key for the future, ensuring the payments that we are supporting and managing and processing all have the security and safety around making consumers feel \"~This is safe when I'm shopping and I should never have to care where I shop, how I shop. I'm going to have a good experience.'</p><p>What advice would you have for ISOs and tech startups?Make sure you understand the payments business. The industry is very complicated. No. 2, make sure that anything you are doing in this space has the appropriate safety and security. That has to be paramount. Then there has to be a level of ethics in the value proposition, whether you're selling to merchants or you are distributing to consumers. If you have those as a sound foundation, the innovation will be great and the rest will come.</p><p>We deal with a lot of startups and we make sure that they have all those controls in place. A misstep in those areas, and your business is over. It can have devastating impact.

The ETA is now welcoming of the large tech companies its members once considered outsiders or even competitors. Though this change may be unsettling to many ETA members, it's all too familiar to Rossi.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Rossi, an executive vice president at Wells Fargo, grew up on both the issuing and acquiring side of the industry. She was influential in bringing electronic payments to the stores that clung hardest to cash, such as grocery stores and fast-food chains. And she participated in the development of an electronic payment system for eBay that set the stage for PayPal's success.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Her vision for the ETA, particularly as payments shift increasingly to digital and mobile platforms, is to steer the group - both its traditional and new constituencies -toward a more collaborative future, one in which the very definition of an acquiring company changes. \"Things evolve in payments, and you can't stay in silos because we all depend on one another,\" she said. \"The fact that an executive of a bank is heading up ETA sends the message that we're all in payments together.\"</p><p>Rossi sat down with ISO&amp;Agent to discuss her objectives as new head of the ETA and the challenges she anticipates as she takes the helm.</p><p>ISO&amp;Agent: You majored in communications at Ohio University. Were you thinking then of a career in banking and payments?</p><p>DR: I had a minor in business, but my goal was not to get into banking. One of my first jobs was working in real estate at Crocker National Bank, which was acquired by Wells Fargoin 1986. It just so happened that a position on the credit card issuing side became available at Wells Fargo, and somebody reached out to me. I thought it would be a great learning experience, and the rest is history.</p><p>ISO&amp;Agent: That was a good time to get into the card business.</p><p>DR: In the mid- to late-'80s, credit card issuing was just taking off. BankAmericard was evolving into Visa, and there were a lot of opportunities back then because the credit card industry was just building out. Opportunity came along, and I took it.</p><p>ISO&amp;Agent: So you were in issuing before you got into acquiring.</p><p>DR: I was very fortunate in that I started on the issuing side of the business and in the early '90s I moved over to the acquiring side. There are probably not a lot of people who grew up on both sides-merchant acquiring and card issuing.</p><p>ISO&amp;Agent: You helped pioneer card acceptance at grocery stores and quick-service restaurants.</p><p>DR: Yes. When I first got into the acquiring business, Wells Fargowas just a California and Western states bank. We were just building out our acquiring business and trying to expand into emerging markets. It came up that, 'wouldn't it be interesting if fast food took debit cards at the point of sale?' It wasn't even credit cards. It was debit cards because a lot of that business is cash.</p><p>We worked with Carl's Jr. way back then in '89, and they were the first fast-food chain to accept debit cards at the point of sale. We were the ones that helped them install the terminals at the point of sale. We had public announcements about the first fast-food chain to accept cards.</p><p>Today, every single fast food chain accepts debit and credit cards, but at the time it was new. Debit cards, we felt, were no different from cash - except it was a more convenient way to make payment. So it just made sense.</p><p>Carl's Jr. was in Southern California, willing to work with us and very interested in the future of payments.</p><p>ISO&amp;Agent: What grocers were involved with the transition to cards?</p><p>DR: Around that same time we were talking with a grocery store in California. It was Lucky Stores. Its parent company, American Stores, was taken over by Albertsons. They were the first grocery in the country to accept a debit card and credit card. That grocery store was looking for a more efficient way to handle cash, which is through a debit card. They were also asking how they could expand service to their customers so that anyone could pay any way they wanted. And the credit card was born as payment for the first time at a grocery chain.</p><p>So, it was all built around convenience. Back then, there was some pushback. People said, 'Wait a minute. You're not going to put food on a credit card?' That wasn't the premise. The goal was how do we create convenience for consumers at the point of sale for merchant segments like grocery, fast food or petroleum?</p><p>We were very much a pioneer in creating new payments.</p><p>ISO&amp;Agent: We're talking about the late '80s. How much did the public use debit cards then?</p><p>DR: There was a company called Interlink, and it was owned by five big banks in California and Arizona-Security Pacific Bank, First Interstate Bancorp, Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Crocker Bank. Those five banks said, 'Today, a debit card is used to take money out of an ATM. What are other ways we could expand the use of a debit card if this is truly an alternative to cash?'</p><p>And those five banks got together and created Interlink. The Interlink mark was put on the back of the debit card. That is when we introduced it to be more than just to get cash out of an ATM. Now you could use it at the point of sale. Eventually, the five banks sold that company to Visa.</p><p>People didn't hear about it a lot because it was going on in the Western United States at that time. When we sold it to Visa, the whole premise was that it could work across the country. Today, the Interlink mark is still on the back of Visa debit cards in the United States and beyond. It is the debit card mark of Visa.</p><p>ISO&amp;Agent: You also played a role in the early acceptance of cards on the Internet.</p><p>DR: Wells Fargohas always looked at innovation for how we can expand payment beyond traditional payments.</p><p>When the Internet was just picking up we asked, 'How can debit and credit be used on the Internet for payment purposes so people can buy, shop and pay with a debit or credit card?' In the early '90s, we ran the first secure credit card transaction on the Internet with a small Internet startup company called Virtual Vineyards, which morphed into Wine.com.</p><p>We then worked with a startup that had an interesting idea. They wanted to sell Beanie Babies and other things in auctions on the Internet. In the early '90s when an auction was completed on the Internet they paid by sending checks to one another. The CEO of that company came to Wells Fargoand asked if there was a way to create payments on the Internet. That was a startup in the early '90s called eBay. We created a payment company called Billpoint that was going to become the payment engine for eBay, and that eventually [set the stage for] PayPal.</p><p>So that's how we got our start on Internet. We were focused on how commerce could be expanded to do shopping online and have a convenient way to pay - whether it be debit card or credit card - because cash and checks were not do going to do it for the Internet.</p><p>ISO&amp;Agent: How did you become involved with the Electronic Transactions Association?</p><p>DR: I first started in about 2000 by sitting on their industry relations committee, and then I headed up that committee. It was dealing with the industry and all of the players, especially the card networks. I was also involved on the government relations committee, and then was eventually invited to sit on the board of ETA.</p><p>ISO&amp;Agent: The ETA started as an ISO trade group, but now it's more inclusive. Do you feel it's unusual that someone from the banking side of the business is ascending to the ETA presidency?</p><p>DR: No, I really don't. As much as we all want to stay within our silos, with ISOs in theirs and banks in theirs, we all work together. We all depend upon one another. ISOs couldn't have existed without banks to sponsor them and help them with clearing and acquiring. It's kind of like Bank of America with the BankAmericard morphing into the Visa card. Things evolve in payments, and you can't stay in silos because we all depend on one another to collaborate, to work together on innovation. There've been heads of ISOs that have been president of ETA. There have been executives of processors. And the fact that an executive of a bank is heading up ETA sends the message that we're all in payments together and we collaborate to succeed in this space.</p><p>ISO&amp;Agent: We're seeing some changes in the ETA with big tech companies joining the organization. How will that affect ISOs?</p><p>DR: You're right. There are a lot of big tech companies coming into the ETA. A lot of these companies are forming partnerships with ISOs. Some of the ISOs are becoming technology companies themselves. All of them are focused on promoting safety, security, reliability, usability. The tech companies are wonderful collaborators. They come into this space with some unique offerings and service and technology, and they're becoming wonderful partners for ISOs, banks, processors. I think they're playing a vital role in the ETA as far as the ISOs are concerned.</p><p>ISO&amp;Agent: Do new entrants to the industry realize ISOs have a role to play in acquiring?</p><p>DR: I think they do. They understand that there is no one entity that is key to payments. It's not banks. It's not the Apples of the world. It's not technology companies. We're all working together. ISOs are very much key to the distribution of the services that are offered in payments. They play a critical role, and I do think the tech companies are aware of it. That's why a lot of them are partnering with ISOs.</p><p>ISO&amp;Agent: ETA membership has grown quickly in the last year. Will that continue? What else do you see ahead for the association?</p><p>The industry is growing, and the ETA is growing along with it. It started out to be an ISO organization, and it now has banks and processors and technology companies involved. In 2015, we're finally going to move from the discussion phase of mobile payments to real implementation, thanks to ETA member companies like Apple, Samsung, PayPal, AT&amp;T. These are the companies that are going to help ETA with the changes that we see ahead. And these are the people that are looking for distribution or looking for partners and are very focused on ISOs and banks and processors.</p><p>ISO&amp;Agent: Will we see changes in data security this year?</p><p>DR: With the ETA, you're going to see more focus on safety and security. You're going to see that people outside the industry are looking at security around payments. The ETA is a wonderful entity to bring forth what we're doing with EMV, tokenization and so forth. There is a lot of change, but it is really exciting.</p><p>ISO&amp;Agent: How can the ETA promote security? I guess education is part of it.</p><p>DR: Definitely education. It's also government advocacy. The ETA is working very hard in Washington, D.C., to educate regulators. 'What is EMV? What is tokenization? What has the industry done or not done, and where are they moving to really focus on safety and security?' They play a very key role, a very specific role in educating key legislators around this. I'm not sure anyone else can play that role in Washington.</p><p>ISO&amp;Agent: Can the ETA's Certified Payments Professional credential promote data security?</p><p>DR: The second way the ETA can help with safety and security is the CCP. It's a certification program that sets the standard for professional performance in the payments industry. What we like to say is that it's the symbol of excellence. Almost a thousand individuals earned the credential in this past year. That program actually focuses not only on educating individuals about payments but educating them on the safety and security around payments - as well as the ethics around payments. Big companies like Wells Fargoand First Data have training departments for their employees, but what about the ISOs? They don't have large training organizations, and the look to the ETA. The CPP is their training department, and they are really embracing it.</p><p>ISO&amp;Agent: Are merchants using the CPP as a way to screen ISOs? How can the ETA tell merchants about the credential?</p><p>DR: The ETA is getting the word out there about the CPP and making sure people are aware it is available. They're partnering with groups such as the National Retail Federation to let them know in newsletters and magazines that this program is available.</p><p>How is this important to merchants? Merchants want to know they are dealing with experts in the payments industry - people who know about the risk, people who know about the efficiency and people who know in general about payments. Merchants would embrace this.</p><p>It's another value of doing business with the ETA. It's another value of being a member of the ETA.</p><p>ISO&amp;Agent: The ETA's annual conference and trade show's been changing. It's now called 'Transact,' and there's an emphasis on innovation, especially on innovative startups. What other changes do you have in store for us?</p><p>DR: The 2014 show was the largest event in ETA history. There were a record 220 exhibitors. Attendance was the largest it ever had been. The focus of the ETA is not to be the biggest conference in the world - like some others - but for the quality it brings to its members.</p><p>So in 2015, the show is in San Francisco, very close to Silicon Valley, and it's going to have a track with an emphasis on startups. There are a lot of startups coming to the show, and a lot of startups are members of the ETA.</p><p>Right now, payments is probably the most exciting place in technology. Investment in payments is picking up faster than ever. So there's going to be a three-day track that really is focused on letting investors know what's out there, what's the thinking around payments, what's new in startups in payments. So, they're going to focus on that.</p><p>At this 2015 conference you're also going to see something called 'Payments Pitch Off,' where some of the most innovative companies in payments are going to vie for the ePay Innovation Award. So, there's a lot of emphasis around that.</p><p>In the exhibits, there's going to be a section for innovative startups at the conference.</p><p>Also at this conference you're going to have keynote speakers who are very interesting: the president of Visa, Ryan McInerney; the CEO of MCX, [Dekkers Davidson], the president of Alipay USA, [Jinming Li]. Talk about a wide range of payments perspectives. That's going to generate a lot of interest. It's a very exciting space right now.</p><p>ISO&amp;Agent: Do you foresee more changes in the ETA itself?</p><p>DR: As the industry changes, so does the ETA. If it remained an ISO organization, there would be no growth. But it expanded the tent. Payments is about ISOs and banks and processors and technology companies. You're going to continue to see change in the ETA. We're going to have to see where payments are taking us.</p><p>For one thing, mobile is going to change the way we do business today, not only for our consumers, but for merchants, the processors, banks. How are we going to do it in a secure fashion - that has got to change. EMV and tokenization have existed internationally for a very long time. The U.S. has to really take a stance in catching up, focusing in these areas.</p><p>I think we can bring the value proposition when it comes to security to various entities in the payments value chain.</p><p>ISO&amp;Agent: The ETA is involved with the Global Acquiring Conference, which is scheduled for May in London. Do you see other international opportunities for the association?</p><p>DR: ETA started out as a very U.S.-based business. It's now expanded to where many members are now international. It seems to make sense to me to extend the reach of ETA internationally. The conference in London is a natural extension of what the ETA is doing in the U.S.</p><p>ISO&amp;Agent: Shifting gears, how are women faring in payments?</p><p>I would say OK, probably not great. It could be better. When I started in this business, it was exclusively men. I sat on many boards for MasterCard and Visa, and I was the only woman on those boards. I'm happy to say, though, we have diversity on the ETA board. There are women representing large companies. We have a ways to go, but we're starting to move into this space where women play a serious, vital role. They've got to be willing to take the risk. They have to have the courage and commitment. This is a very complicated, male-dominated industry. But I'm thrilled that it's starting to change. The sails are starting to shift.</p><p>I'm very pleased to see we have representation from women from companies large, medium and small. We do have women sitting on the board as well as on all of the committees. So I think we are seeing a shift in this industry. The opportunity is there for them to really succeed and help change the industry.</p><p>ISO&amp;Agent: We talked about mobile payments taking off this year. What else do you see happening?</p><p>DR: What we see ahead, especially with mobile and Apple Pay being introduced, is payments is going to continue to grow. We're going to see more innovation. Security and safety are going to be key for the future, ensuring the payments that we are supporting and managing and processing all have the security and safety around making consumers feel 'This is safe when I'm shopping and I should never have to care where I shop, how I shop. I'm going to have a good experience.'</p><p>ISO&amp;Agent: What advice would you have for ISOs and tech startups?</p><p>DR: Make sure you understand the payments business. The industry is very complicated. No. 2, make sure that anything you are doing in this space has the appropriate safety and security. That has to be paramount. Then there has to be a level of ethics in the value proposition, whether you're selling to merchants or you are distributing to consumers. If you have those as a sound foundation, the innovation will be great and the rest will come.</p><p>We deal with a lot of startups and we make sure that they have all those controls in place. A misstep in those areas, and your business is over. It can have devastating impact.</p><p>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ISOAGT-0813605</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ISOAGT2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5FDR-XJB1-F06X-W3P6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303688</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3014\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

Continue to respect the rules. From Europe to the US - it has recorded more than twice as many deaths as any other country. But it's important to use population to place America's numbers in context. </p><p>This graph shows the number of deaths per 100,000 people - in the six worst affected countries. The US is fourth, while the UK has the highest death rate by this measure. Now to big furore in the US connected to COVID19 - Twitter has temporarily restricted the account of Donald Trump Jr - the President's son. He posted a video which makes false claims about the drug hydroxy-chloroquine as a treatment for the virus. The video has been watched millions of times was retweeted by President Trump - but has now been taken down. This is a screenshot shared by an adviser to President Trump. It shows us that Twitter concluded that Donald Trump Jr had violated its policy on spreading information about coronavirus. The advisor writes \"Big tech is the biggest threat to free expression in America\". Trump Jr said the video was different from the narrative that everybody was running with. Yes - different and also factually incorrect. Hydroxychloroquine is not considered an effective treatment against coronavirus. Last month - the US Food and Drug Administration revoked its emergency use authorization for the drug. Here's more from our disinformation reporter Marianna Spring. What's interesting here is that it marks firstly what its battles towards misinformation on its platform and the attempt being made by social media sites to tackle possibly harmful claims being made about coronavirus. But then also it's an escalation in this battle that is going on between Twitter and the Trumps. And because since Twitter began labelling Donald trumps tweets either is misleading, inflammatory or otherwise, Trump has hyped up his attacks on Twitter and it's something I think we're going to see only getting more heated in the months to come. Especially as we approach the US election for top Trump has repeatedly argued, especially since Twitter first decided to label his tweets that actually Twitter is deliberately trying to attack him, his supporters and those with right-wing views. Twitter argues otherwise and says in this case it is taken action because the post was in violation of its policies of harmful miss information for the backside, Twitter has not ever labelled or removed Trumps tweets about harmful coronavirus misinformation including hydroxycloroquine in the past. Anthony Zurcher, Washington. What have you made of this particular story, Anthony? It's interesting it's just another example of how highly contentious social media used by the president and by his supporters including his son have been. Pressure and scrutiny of Donald Trump use of Twitter is increasing and I think in the past we've seen him that's happened Donald Trump has pushed back again social media companies and said that he is going to more closely regulate them. I think we could see an increasing round back and forth between Twitter and Facebook on one and Donald Trump threatening the use of law enforcement procedures, criminal procedures or regulation in order to push back against us. I guess on the virus specifically, this is more evidence that the president and his supporters and family are quite comfortable taking different positions to the official advice. Yes, if you remember just a few days ago there was talk about how Donald Trump Stone was going to change on the coronavirus. How he was going to endorse the use of masks and endorse the science behind this and strike a more measured response will stop then here you go just over the past 25 hours to be giving a platform re-airing this misinformation and these unfounded assertions about how to recall our client come about mask wearing, quoting this Doctor who is in this video who has a very questionable background. All of this suggests that while they may talk about a change of tone that doesn't last very long as it hasn't in the past with this president. More broadly, where we got to with the election campaigns and let's talk about Mr trumps opponent Joe Biden, do we have any idea when we might know who his running mate is? Well, the biting campaign and Biden himself has hinted that something could be coming next week. -- Biden. He said early August and August is Saturday. The reports are he's narrowed it down to a handful of female candidates who he has been viewed vetting and intentionally scrutinising to see who fits as a campaign on a whole we are entering August without the conventions are that far away.

giants shell I think many Americans for a while now and beans and raising questions about the tech sector and Washington in some ways have been more reluctant slow to this now that does appear to be changing and signed your senior regulators begin to take this seriously really cent share price of these tech heavy stocks on wall substantially lower today what we've seen over the course of the weekend ease reports that regulators in America have started carving up which departments will investigate which of these big tech companies for example the wall Street Journal on Friday reported the Department of justice will be looking into Google or the federal trade Commission according to the Washington post will be looking into Amazon carving up the works so you don't have to do the occasion this is all fairly sort of routine in some ways but I think what it signifies and the reason you saw the sell-off in the share price is this intent on the part of regulators to maybe get serious in a way they weren't in the past the last big anti-trust case we've seen here in America was Watson 20 years ago that involved Microsoft and impart the companies have been as successful the likes of GoogleFacebook because they've been able to make the case where is the harm being done to American consumers when we are providing a free service in exchange for people's data shout thanks very much Michelle Fleury in new York to see now work the latest front in President Trump's trade wars is its 3000 kilometre border with its southern neighbour Mexico from next week the US president wants to impose tariffs on everything that comes into this country because he thinks Mexico is not doing enough to stop illegal migration and drugs almost 350 50 billion $ worth of goods came from Mexico into the US last year Sick government wants to keep the tariff free which is why several of its ministers in Washington today trying to stop them coming into force one of them is the foreign Minister leave not sure that this slapping tariffs along with the decision to cancel be programmed to the North and central American countries could have a counterproductive effect would not reduce migration flows tariffs could cause financial and economic instability which means that Mexico would have reduced capacity to address migration players and of alternatives to the new migrants who recently arrived in Mexico a lot for me that's a lot of sentiment there is has sought to Barbara Plett usher in Washington Barbara what is the message from the Mexican delegation why it's an emergency mission really to try to get the Trump administration to change its mind in the message in a nutshell is essentially that the Mexicans have been taking steps to us to try to stem the flow of migrants but resources are limited and at Root this is a a humanitarian and social issues so you need a development plan to deal with poverty and violence that is causing these people the previous centre American countries terrace I'm gonna fix that if you do impose tariffs across the board and that Quindell that could destabilise Mexico economically which would make it even harder for Mexico to stop the flow of migrants That's the argument and they are hoping the Mexicans to get a negotiated solution to this but has said they are considering other options if that doesn't work such as for example putting tariffs on selected US goods what are the chances of the US backing down in any way on this it was very sudden announcement wasn't there for yellow it is reported that Mr. Trump's top economic officials advised him against this move so I think these Mexican ministers will receive quite sympathetic hearing from their counterparts but it is Mr. Trump that makes the decision and he has been digging in at the weekend he issued a series of quite tough tweets in which she said See action from the Mexicans not words and his chief of staff said he fully expects at least the first in the first 5% terror to go into play on the 10th of June it is worth noting that 8 days later on the 18th of June Mr. Trump is planning to officially announce his second term presidential run and you know that's a cracking down on immigration has been a signature issue from his first campaign will also be for his second campaign what has been the response from US business some pretty unhappy Prix universally negative they say that this is gonna be bad for us consumers and it would be bad for us business consumers because of Americans apanese terrace which essentially taxes will be paying more for everything from cars to put the readers because they have had as they had terror son and business well a number of complaints but one of the main ones is that these supply lines really integrated so if you just look at our parks for example they cross the border several times up to 8 times before review was a semblance of costs simply increase</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

The Wall Street Journal reported that there will be looking into Google, the Federal Trade Commission, according to the Washington Post will be looking at Amazon. Carving up the work so that you do not have duplication. This is all fairly sort of routine in some ways, but what it signifies and the reasons why you saw in the share price, is for regulators to get serious and ways that they were not in the past. </p><p>The last big antitrust case to be seen here in America was 20 years ago that involved Microsoft and in part, the companies have been very successful because they been able to make the case that, where's the harm being done to American consumers but we have been providing a free service in exchange for People's data. The latest front in President Trump's trade wars is this 3,100km border with its southern neighbour Mexico. From next week the US President wants to impose tariffs on everything that comes into his country because he thinks Mexico isn't doing enough to stop illegal migration and drugs. Almost $350bn worth of goods came from Mexico into the US last year and the Mexican government want to keep them tariff free which is why several of its ministers are in Washington today trying to stop them coming into force. One is the foreign minister. TRANSLATION: Slapping tariffs, along with the decision to cancel the aid programs to the northern Central American countries, Could have a counter Productive effect and cause instability which means that Mexico would have a reduced capacity to address migration flows and offer alternatives to the new migrants who have recently arrived in Mexico. Our correspondent Barbara Plett-Usher It is an emergency mission to get them to change its mind and the message in a nutshell is essentially that they have been taking steps to try and stem the flow of new migrants, but the resources are limited and this is a humanitarian and social issue, see you need a different way to solve the problem of them fleeing these areas and if you add tariffs, decadents destabilise Mexico economically which can make it even harder for them to stop the flow of migrants. So that is the argument, they are trying to get a negotiated solution to this but they are considering other options if that does not work, for example, putting tariffs on select US goods. What are the chances of the US backing down on what was a rather sudden announcement?Q3. sudden announcement? I think these ministers will have quite a sympathetic hearing from their counterparts but it is President Trump that is making the decision and he has been issuing quite a tonne of messages saying that he wants to see action and not words, he fully expects at least the first 5% tariff to going to play on the 10th of June, it is worth noting that eight days later on the 18th of June, President Trump is planning to announce his second term presidential run and do you know that clamping down on immigration has been the signature issue for his first campaign it will be for a second. What's been the response from business in the US who are unhappy about this? Pretty universally negative. They said that this is going be bad for US consumers and it will be back for US business. Because it is Americans that will be paying these tariffs that are essentially taxes that they will be paying more for everything from cards to chipotle burritos because they will have tariffs on them and business, a number of complaints for the main ones is the supply lines are integrated because if you just look at auto parts for example, they crossed the border several times, up to eight times before a vehicle is assembled and so the cost simply increases, and also the broader concern that will make it more difficult to clinch that new Mexico, Canada, US free trade agreement. Lets to show you from Buckingham Palace. Donald Trump is attending his banquet with the Queen on the first day of this state visit, he arrived with Milani, his wife on Air Force One, this morning</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-c8a83c7cc40a4d759ca74c27fe28dc97</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W84-NV81-DY08-33B7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"707\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

attacks and to become a Radicalised she talked about there being a safe space online the terrorist ideology while some of the biggest tech firms in the world Google Facebook and others of respondents say they detect this issues seriously BBC's media editor of are Roger and has made a report a look at these issues if you know what you're looking for it's easy to find extremist propaganda on the internet online magazines and videos with my production values that glamorises struggled to establish a caliphate a shared widely on social media so and through messaging apps the spotlight is now on the technology platforms that host such material despite public concern Google Facebook and Twitter declined an interview request and not for the 1st time but in a statement Google said it already employs thousands of people and invest millions in fighting abuse Facebook said they work aggressively to remove terrorist content and Twitter said such material has no place on their platform extremists are migrating to messaging apps like telegram and what's that these have end to end encryption which create a safe space in which those extremes can operate but opening a back door to such apps brings its own problems and could be a gift to cyber criminals a lot of people that we think that these tech companies make billions in profit and so should be held to account but that's true of course but these issues are fiendishly complex with no single solution one problem is the sheer volume of material that uploaded onto the internet every day but the deeper question is whether or not internet companies who have no democratic mandate should be given the power to decide who sees what online Germany's drafting legislation that would find tech firms if they don't remove extremist material but not everyone thinks that more regulation is a good idea regulation is something needs to be carefully you need to understand that you're not creating incentives to do the wrong thing to set to more than you need to they don't remove people's free speech That rather just removing terrorist content you need to be confident that you're not upsetting the delicate balance here that's caused the tech giants to clamp down on terror grow is not yet clear the granting the world's biggest companies yet more power over our lives is the best available solution among Roger on BBC news well here in London Bridge the right on the edge of the police cordon you can see a big police band behind me while the policeman and there'll be concern themselves about the security of this the whole area was affected by the attack and also the investigations into what happened here so that colleagues will be working on issues of online security such as those discussed in our margins report and play in the early with a man called James o' malley's front Gizmodo UK which is a big tech firm are once again his thoughts on whether Theresa may talking about safe spaces the terrorist online is fair comment a i-i-i think undeniably are places online which are places where a terrorist or terrorists continue to mention black think there is no easy solution to what would you do about these very easy for 3 might say enough is enough something must be done about that something is a very difficult question because when it comes to security is not just like camping up more secure the report care less secure this about trade-offs and other thing all we did it up if we if he tried to shut down these places are safe and dismantling pension black holes into the that days to carry out so get those be watching music in the background is that these guys turned up with the PA system and at the moment is not going to turn it down Jason bankrupt pace on the dark web that you choose is where one person has told the BBC one of the attackers was radicalised stuff they're my view is that the responsibility of Google and Facebook the other big tech giants has a really interesting question I think if it is then that the wider debate We need to have this fear about what the role of these enormous companies are basically colonised huge amount of the public sphere so Google Facebook Apple Amazon is a handful of massive companies is now the control huge swathes of data are entire digital lives or essentially are entire life easier they've got a phone in a pocket you do everything on it that your entire life so what we want these complete control that what we want the government to have access to all of the data all the time that is another question as well we're not a lot of discussion of end to end encryption no be plenty of this suit don't understand what that means explain why it is so relevant in the case of this and encryption is when you got it if you and other person BBC content of the messages we have transported it is fully encrypted and what what suggestions have been what the home secretary and Rogers means is suggesting after the Manchester attack I'm pretty sure it will be suggested</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Well, I am not a member of the G7. But you are watching as closely as I am. What I can tell you as I see several members of the G7 very active in relation to promoting health, education initiatives and several areas of inequality. Of course it is a different pattern, depending on different countries, different political options. </p><p>I don't think we can today look into the egs and think they will solve the problem of the world. The problems of the world will need a strong political will by everybody. Now you are off to the effort, thank you for making time for us. It was a pleasure. Antonio Gutierrez speaking to Stirling. The differences on climate were apparent at this G7 summit but elsewhere there was - surprisingly perhaps - more agreement to be found. Let's get some final thoughts from Ros, at the summit. Before the summit, one local newspaper in France said the best outcome for President Macron is if nothing happened here at all in Biarritz, but everyone was aware of the last G7 Donald Trump left before the end and was decidedly unhappy about the whole thing. As such, this G7 has been constructed to avoid conflict, so much so that with the final press conferences this afternoon there has been one constant message. Donald Trump talked about the great unity here. Emmanuel Macron talked about common ground and shared messages. He also talked about the fact that everyone within the G7 likes concrete outcomes. So let's look at what we've got. On the issue of trade and the trade war, well, Donald Trump made positive noises about the possibility of getting a deal with China. Lots of other people simply said they wanted the trade war to finish, but if you're looking for significant policy shifts that take us towards that end, no concrete results, I'm afraid. On the issue of Russia rejoining the G7, Donald Trump is not keen on that. The rest seem decidedly ambivalent, so no concrete outcomes there. In terms of a digital tax, an international digital text to pull in more from the big tech giants, like Google and Facebook, in their final press conference -- conference, President Macron and Trump both referred to this but it hasn't been agreed, so no concrete results there. Then we have Iran, and this huge surprise that was pulled this afternoon when President Macron said, actually the Iranian president is willing to meet with the Americans, then President Trump said in certain circumstances I would be willing to meet with President Rahane in the next few weeks. Not a concrete result, because it is not definitely happening, but my goodness if it did it would justify this summit in itself. And then we have the issue of the forest in the Amazon, the fires in the Amazon, the G7 has signed off over $20 million to support Brazil in fighting those fires, but already the Brazilian president has also this is part of a colonial enterprise, an effort to turn Brazil into a colony. On top of that, there were no commitments on either long term deforestation or climate change itself. In fact, Donald Trump didn't turn up for the main climate change discussion and when asked in the press conference if he was willing to clear up whether he was sceptical about whether man-made climate change exists, he declined to clear that up. All of which really confirms what has been in plain sight for the last few years that the international order as we knew it has been disrupted by the Trump presidency, by the increased assertiveness of Russia on the foreign stage, and of China's growing economic might. We have also seen Donald Trump quite willingly walking away from a global leadership role, and we have seen President Macron quite willingly seeking to step into that. And with his plans for a change in the way trade is regulated around the world and with his hopes that President Rahane will meet President Trump, he has brought great ambition to this summit, and he has undoubtedly brought leadership too. That is too early, though, to tell whether that ambition will deliver results. We will have to wait for a few weeks and months to know that. Thanks very much to Ros Atkins for that analysis on the G7 and thanks to you for watching Outside Source. Hello, for many of us it has been a bank holiday weekend, and what a scorch it has been. A record-breaking Lee hot late August Bank holiday, with temperatures, parts of the South East reaching the low to mid 30s Celsius. A record-breaking spell of weather over the last few days, indeed the last couple of days. Beyond the middle part of the week onwards things are set to be much</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-1bc77b2db7294ed5861e7efbc179b439</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WX2-CW31-DY08-33X2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"831\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

But his visit comes in the time when the US is seeking to reduce its military presence in Africa. Also on the agenda will be the $5 billion US Renaissance Dam, which is currently under construction in western Ethiopia, and causing conflicts with another US ally, Egypt. The US and World Bank are mediating talks to find a solution, but compromise does not appear to come easy. </p><p>This is Outside Source live from the BBC newsroom. Our lead story... Two planes carrying hundreds of US citizens from a coronavirus-hit cruise ship in Japan have arrived in the US. The ship, with some 3,700 passengers and crew, has been in quarantine for two weeks. Here's the other stories from the WC world service. -- BBC world service... The Speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi has been warning European officials against allowing the Chinese firm Huawei to build 5G communications networks. She's told officials in Brussels said it would be like putting the Chinese state police in the pocket of everyone who uses the information highway. The authorities in Ireland are warning the public to stay away from a so called ghost ship, which washed up on rocks near Cork on Sunday. The MV Alta became disabled south of Bermuda in 2018 and has been drifting without a crew for more than a year. Mark Zuckerberg was in Brussels today, meeting top European commissioners to discuss Facebook's plans for regulation and tax. But he got a hostile reception from a top EU chief, Industry commissioner Thierry Breton, who warned that big tech firms face tougher rules and penalties in Europe, if they fail to curb hate speech and disinformation. Chiyo Robertson joins us. Quite a pack agenda for both? The Facebook boss was in or just Brussels today. Central to that plan was his idea of having a single global regulator, a single policy for all online platforms. He also wanted technology firms like Facebook to be given much more flexibility in experimenting, the board he used, with technologies for moderating online platforms. This plan was firmly rejected by the industry chairman, saying it simply was not enough. He also came down hard on them saying that if Facebook failed to get its act together that when it came to things like monitoring harmful content and disseminating disinformation, he would find them by the end of the year. Did they talk about tax? That's a subject that always comes up. That's a big problem with US tech firms, because they make huge amounts of revenue in Europe and they don't pay that much tax, according to European governments. They want to be taxed more. France has proposed a digital tax, but France had to put that on hold in the UK is working out how to do that. In the meantime, Mark Zuckerberg said he wanted to work with the OECD. That's the body trying to harmonize global taxes, and he said he wanted to harmonize global solution, an interesting line because it is contrary to what America wants. The US has always said these tech firms should be taxed at home back in the state. Speaking of tech firms and tax, speaking of Amazon, Jeff Baeza as has been giving away a lot of money but not to the tax? That's correct. When the world's richest man pledges money to help fight climate change, it must be a big song. Putting it in perspective, he's promised $10 billion to fund work by scientists, activists and other groups. And he will begin handing money out from that fund over the summer. But Mr Baeza is worth $130 billion, it is eye watering. That's roughly 8% of his worth. It's also worth remembering that in the last three months, Amazon made revenues of around $87 billion. So he's been under intense pressure from customers, politicians, employees who have been protesting to do more after his business doesn't contribute to a lot of packaging, vehicles driving around delivering those packages. They basically put him under pressure in the last few years to do more to help combat climate change. Thank you very much indeed. Let's stay with business stories. Travel restrictions on those living in China are having a major impact on the global travel and hospitality industry. Chinese people make up one in eight of tourists globally.

Dave Lee, our North America technology correspondent, joins me now. He is in San Francisco. Busy reading while I bring him in. </p><p>Somebody has said in my ear that Facebook is up by 40 something percent? Is that right? There are some incredibly interesting metrics. I am reading through them now because they have just been published. Facebook saying that their changes to the news feed have already resulted in 50 million less hours being spent on the platform, which will have a big impact on how many adverts are being seen. As part of that announcement, Mark Zuckerberg has attached a statement to these earnings which goes into more depth than usual, he goes back to the talking points he has made recently. I will read you a small bit comment 2018 we focused on making sure Facebook is not just fun to use but also good for people's well-being and society. What he is doing is basically saying, look, this will impact our network, it is already impacting, but it is important we have sacrifice right now to protect the long-term health of Facebook. Shares around by about 4% at the moment. What about eBay and the others? I am only reading them as they drop. Microsoft had a strong earnings results, unfortunately I have no chance to pick through them yet. Let's talk about Facebook more than, I guess the issues the Zuckerberg is money is not necessarily the number one factor long-term, he needs to fend off criticism and regulators? I think the concern is the problem has two sides. They are not quite sure how Facebook will solve what could be seen as a societal problem of large, also the pressure put on Facebook to get onto this problem immediately could be quite expensive. Compared to this time last year, Facebook is 47% more employees, a huge amount of growth for what was already quite a big company. Over 2018 they will hire an extra 10,000 employees to police various parts of the network, be more stringent on what kind of adverts are right on its network. -- adverts arrive on its network. It will be very costly and may not even work. This is just the beginning of Mark Zuckerberg on Facebook trying to take hold of the situation. Dave, I will let you get back to those figures. Thank you very much. We try to bring you the latest information as a concern, but asking Dave to jump ahead and tell me things he has not yet got was asking a bit much of him! Follow him on Twitter for his analysis as he digests those figures. The US Federal Reserve has left rates unchanged at 1.25 to 1.5%, event will be chaired but it is the last time any Fed by Janet Yellen. She's the first woman to hold the post and the first head of the Fed not to remain in the post after the election of a new president. woman of huge stature, whatever your Yogita Limaye is in New York. A politics, who will be missed, I guess, by many people? Yes, she steered the economy through tough times, these with the economy in pretty good state. Growth rate of 2.3% in 2017. That is not the key job of the Federal Reserve, the key job is fixing interest rates and ensuring it keeps inflation and unemployment in check. On her watch, year low. Like a trader told me and employment at 4.1% went to a 17 today, she was a good leader but not necessarily creative. Thank you. Just a quick conversation today. We finish with a report about how charity shops in the UK perhaps do not want all the clothes are donating. Pity today because my clothes. One minute yellow is the colour, next week Denham, tomorrow it is mint green fur, anyone?! If you are like me, you try to lessen the guilt of your fashion fickleness by dropping off some of your barely worn clothes at a charity shop. And I am not alone. They come every single day. From 10am to 6pm, a continuous drop in donations. Donations to Oxfam have increased over the past year, but only a fraction of the clothes here are actually sold through the store. The unsold inventory is bought by distributors who sell them to other countries, where they are resold in second-hand markets like this one in Uganda. It used to be a virtuous countries don't want the second-hand cycle, except increasingly these clothes.

substantial changes announced the first was a substantial restrictions on the access to data app developers would have and the other is making it much easier for everyday users of Facebook to find out their personal data they've left vulnerable in the last hour we speak to Chris Cox is the number 3 Facebook is head of product here and he's very very clear that Facebook has been susceptible in a massive breach of trust and there's an element of contrition right across the company but the difficulty they have is really there contribution today <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>blog post had a few different audiences there was internal audience here in California the staff wanted reassurance and they were I think reassured there is the regulators and lawmakers which you mentioned you think I've got plenty more questions added on top of that there's a member of the public who do feel that Facebook cannot be trusted with data in the way they previously thought and will take a lot more than a blog post adding to restore the reputation and on where is the most pressure coming from It's coming from all sides how damaging This being I think has been very damaging me financially damaging in terms of the stock price fawning very significantly those bounce-back today's you been reporting I think it's damaging says investors say they want a better forcing the company's management but I think the biggest issue is that we really about to see a big battle between what he called the Valley and the hilt between the big tech firms here and regulators on Capitol Hill we've known for some time the European regulators in Brussels indeed in Berlin where they quite like the idea of using the power of words of hate speech laws of to clamp down on social media companies in Europe they've been trying for some time to clip the wings of big tech but is now come over to Washington and there is a new mood foot there is a new feeling in this country that actually the power of government regulation needs to be used detained BTEC in terms of stature way Facebook companies like Facebook Google Prince's don't like regulation they don't like the idea is for more intervention for government I think yes scared about the idea of coming back from Washington that is where they are really feeling the pinch now am Thanks very much Amol Rajan media editor there in San Francisco Let's take you to a story about a fighter jet attack by Israel in Syria and this attack happened back in 2007 but the reason it is in the News today is because Israel finally confirmed it carried out the bombing to destroy a suspected nuclear reactor they also released this footage itself from the cockpit of a fighter jet and it shows it bombing the facility in north-eastern Syria the Syrian government always denied it was building a reactor so why has Israel decided to release all this now here is your land now there isn't really any question over the fact that Israel was behind the strike in Syria over a decade ago that just makes the timing and the publicity around all of this even more interesting we've had official after official coming out and saying that the message is basically to Israel's enemies today Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu took to There and he praised Israel's government its military and its intelligence services for stopping Syria from developing a nuclear capability and he said as well but it remains Israel's policy to make sure that its enemies couldn't arm themselves with nuclear weapons now Israel has mentioned Iran specifically what it's been saying you announce been explaining why this might be of course it's Iran's nuclear ambitions and now seen by Israel to pose an existential threat although Iran does say that its intentions are peaceful see you could read into this that Israel is saying it is ready if it comes to it to target Iran's nuclear facilities in the future and there's no doubt it also wants to add to an American diplomatic pressure on Europe to toughen up the 2015 nuclear deal between 6 world powers and Iran and what Mr. Netanyahu has been saying is thickset on Nick's its this can also be seen as a warning about Iran's involvement in Syria where of course it's been fighting on the side of the Assad government forces and it looks like Iran wants to maintain its present and its influence in Syria and future just next door to Israel that's something that really worries Israeli leaders Yellen now in Jerusalem before we go let's go to Kenya's rift Valley because geologists are warning that a huge crack could be showing signs that the continent is a blessing Let's show you what it looks like because the earth movements down last week they were exacerbated by

The highly visible left flank of the Democratic Party, fully embracing socialism in name and approach, erupted with proposals that would drastically change the country in ways they intend and many more in ways they do not.  Meanwhile, the Republican Party's debt from its Faustian bargain with President Donald Trump began to come due. What can we learn from bad ideas?</p><p> Plenty, if we approach them with curiosity rather than assumed intellectual or moral deficiency on the part of those trafficking in them.  The truth that people have a really hard time understanding the benefits of free markets and bottom-up organization is both difficult and galvanizing. Free-market ideas don't really have a place in the current incarnation of our two-party system. We're free agents and that can open a world of new possibilities if we let it. There will be plenty of time for resolutions. Right now let's have some fun and run the bloopers reel, in no particular order, of the year's bad economic ideas. 1. The Green New Deal: Making precise predictions about the climate is nearly impossible, a fact any economist should respect. The U.N. Reports frequently referenced by the environmental left paint a serious picture, albeit one that can't be summed up in the boldface blurbs our politics and media demand. Those reports don't go as far as to predict 'mass extinctions,' but proponents of plans like Bernie Sanders' harrowing $16 trillion Green New Deal do. The plan misunderstands climate complexity just as much as Sanders' billionaires narrative misunderstands the economy. But most frustratingly, supporters present a 12-year doomsday clock and then pile on a wishlist of not-directly-related progressive policies. The debate cannot go forward until Green New Dealers back up the claim of mass extinctions, or walk it back. 2. Hipster antitrust: The emboldened far left also has big plans for antitrust. The nexus of regulatory policy and case law that defines our efforts to check the power of big business has been imperfectly but effectively delineated by the consumer welfare standard since the late 1970s. The self-proclaimed New Brandeisians[1], who earned the 'hipster' moniker as a wry nod to their retro pre-consumer welfare aesthetic, focus on a host of other scenarios where big business might rear its head, such as labor market power. The economists behind the recent Utah Statement recommend numerous specific changes to regulation and legal doctrine, but what emerges is vast discretionary power for regulators and a rubber stamp for courts. Hopefully, the Utah Statement will be the hipster antitrust movement's Garden State, the moment when something cool becomes so obviously overwrought and precious that's its silliness is on display for all. 3. Breaking up big tech: Look no further than the New Brandeisians' flagship project, the dismantling of tech giants Google holding company Alphabet  GOOG, -0.63%[2] GOOGL, -0.57%[3], Facebook  FB, 0.15%[4] and Amazon  AMZN, 0.06%[5], for the dangers of these ideas. These corporations' ascent raises new challenges such as data security and the control of information. It also reframes old issues, such as whether network effects that make bigger social platforms more valuable to consumers mitigate concerns over market power. Reevaluating the consumer welfare standard for the 21st century should be an 'intellectual feast' for antitrust economists, but has instead become a potent political rallying cry invoking fear of the unknown and the incessant scapegoating of big corporations. There are no angels here \u2014 these companies have misstepped or worse and will do so again. But in a market where technological change still has a long course to run, lasting solutions will come from evolution \u2014 not intelligent design. Also read: Regulating Big Tech was mostly talk in 2019 \u2014 expect the same in 2020[6]  4. Protectionism: Our hipster friends may look back 50 years in search of policy, but nobody does retro quite like Peter Navarro, the one-man intellectual lawn mower engine keeping President Donald Trump's disastrous trade policy sputtering along. Let's call it early 1770s-chic, not bothering himself or the president with mainstream thinking such as Adam Smith's debunking of mercantilism in 'The Wealth of Nations.' It's easy during Democratic primary season to forget just how anti-business our tycoon-president is, missing that international trade is commerce between people and firms across an ocean and instead envisioning himself and the Chinese premier across a chess board. With neither side approaching checkmate, the people of both countries lose. There's strong evidence that tariffs are behind the recent economic downturn, and the fact the president has wiped out most of his corporate and income tax cuts is undeniable. 5. Billionaire tears: Let's keep this simple: When candidates and their backers propose financially harming billionaires, the next question must be 'who is helped, and how?' Is the debate about taxation and policy, over which fair minds can disagree, or merely crass post-Trumpist scapegoating? The latter is always misleading and corrosive, no matter how much money the target has. 6. New tech, old jobs: Technological change never stops but that rarely prevents policymakers from trying to turn back the clock to the known, comfortable, and counterproductive. The so-called sharing economy, really about matching small buyers and sellers, has created unprecedented numbers of contract-work opportunities. We could be talking about ways to change with technology \u2014 health care and other benefits that move with workers instead of the now oddly longed-for days where company men had their needs met by the factory at which they worked their entire career. Proposals like California's new crackdown on contract work may do the most harm by foreclosing opportunities that would only be revealed as technology and the labor market continued to coevolve. 7. Bitcoin maximalism: As crypto continues its strange journey, bitcoin  BTCUSD, -0.94%[7] maximalists who believe the original blockchain technology will, must and should become all the money everyone uses remain its strangest travelers. It's likely safe to bet against the predictions of someone who says the 'free market' means they know exactly what's going to happen. It's an even safer bet when inevitability requires online bullying that grows in desperation as true uncertainty increases. While not perfectly overlapping, bitcoin maximalism carries whiffs of 'libertarians' who want the government out of the way so they can be the ones in charge. Market participants can be admonished to HODL, but markets won't cave so easily, and they'll decide what if any cryptocurrencies are in our future. 8. Inhale this, don't inhale that: We don't fully know the health risks of vaping nicotine oil, though to an addicted smoker they may be life-saving. The wave of deaths that turned out to be from an illness caused by vitamin E oil in bootleg THC vapes was disturbing and tragic. It also paled in comparison to the number of smokers who die every day, but the four-month ban Massachusetts just lifted shows the potency of the expectation that politicians 'do something.' Meanwhile, 'legalizing' cannabis gave the state carte blanche to lord over sellers in ways that a mature industry wouldn't tolerate \u2014 after a year, 75% of sales remained away from the state's grasp on the black market. 9. Elizabeth Warren: The U.S. senator from Massachusetts and presidential hopeful stakes at least a partial claim each of items one through six on this list (yes, even Trumpist protectionism). So why does she get her own spot? Warren represents something new in an American political scene that desperately needs fresh thinking, but her hyperactive technocracy combined with fire-breathing populism represents just about the worst embodiment one could find of central planning in mainstream politics. Sen. Bernie Sanders, Warren's rival on the left, loses interest in the private sector when he can't dismantle it. Warren, on the other hand, wants to run the private sector. Her staggering number of plans, several dozen and more than I care to count at the time of this writing, would give her administration unprecedented discretionary power over the corporations and wealthy individuals she often demonizes. One could certainly see private wealth having the last laugh with countless new points of entry to the levers of government power. Or perhaps Warren could set us on the road to a state-capitalist model. That seems outlandish but Warren has repeatedly stunned me with her hubris this year as she produces plan after plan that indicate she thinks the right person just needs to tell companies what to do.  10. National conservatism: The left has unsurprisingly occupied most of the spots on this list \u2014 they're the opposition and we're approaching primary season, which means plenty of ideas from radicals and one or two from centrists. Given the litany of destined-to-fail Hail Marys on this list, one might think the right would find it expedient to double down on its perceived affinity for free markets, but that would be easier had the perception ever been true. Events like Yoram Hazony's national conservatism conference suggest that for much of the right 'free markets' always meant what the left assumed it did \u2014 a preference for big business and the businessman in his place atop society's hierarchy. In truth, capitalism and conservatism don't go hand in hand, the former being a force for constant change in society through bottom-up evolutionary means that, while messy, offer sounder guidance than any hand. Our system may offer the choice between Donald Trump and Elizabeth Warren. Bring it on. Never have those in the free-market camp been ceded more ground, but we need to jettison our old bad ideas too. Let's be clear, libertarians have repeatedly made the mistake that right-populists also want small government. They don't. They want to be the government. This isn't a quick-turnaround opportunity, and more elections will likely come and go before we're out of this hole.  A lot of those bad ideas above have the seed of good intentions and those intentions can be met far more effectively by markets, philanthropy and private governance. It may require patience and some dead-end bad ideas of our own, but the potential is out there to make people's lives better without making everyone's worse. That's a daunting resolution for the new year, but consider the alternatives. This article was published with permission by the American Institute for Economic Research[8].

He also said it would likely take three years to get there.  The speculation around electric vehicles (EVs) comes with an inherent risk. </p><p>Tesla TSLA, +5.04%[1] is the most established EV manufacturer, but plenty of traders live to short-sell Tesla shares, betting on their decline. In the past week, we have seen other promising EV makers including Nikola[2] NKLA, +1.88%[3] and Workhorse WKHS, +12.11%[4] face immense pressure from 'shorts' despite what looked just days before as a steady ascent. Read:Tesla's Battery Day was 'long on vision and boldness,' short on here-and-now[5] Tesla's ride to prosperity has been both exciting and erratic. The eccentric Musk is prone to saying controversial and sometimes unpredictable things. Before its famous split, the stock touched over $2,000, and while momentum seemed to be driving it, pundits and analysts struggled to defend a valuation that far exceeded the world's most established automotive brands, from General MotorsGM, -0.37%[6] to BMW BMW, -2.60%[7].  But Tesla, unlike its more ordinary automotive rivals, isn't valued or looked upon as a car company. Tesla is a tech company that makes vehicles based on the most cutting-edge technology. On days like Battery Day, where a three-year vision is shared, as is the case with any of the Big Tech companies, many scrutinize the company's claims and goals, and the road it will take to reach them. This is how the boldest of tech companies operate: By setting big goals and endeavoring to deliver exponential gains to those who invested in their vision. Bold visionariesApple AAPL, +3.75%[8], Nvidia NVDA, +4.25%[9], Qualcomm QCOM, +2.05%[10], Amazon AMZN, +2.49%[11] and Microsoft MSFT, +2.27%[12] all come to mind.  Apple constantly went against the grain. Most notably, its closed ecosystem was always a point of contention. The 'Think Different' company built a platform that was extremely sticky for its users, but that didn't work with any standard operating system. The company focused on building products that customers loved to use. Then it built ecosystems for music and apps. Now this is expanding into health care, gaming, TV and more. Many thought Apple would struggle to grow a meaningful streaming and services business, but in the span of a few years, the company has shown success moving in that direction Qualcomm has constantly faced regulatory pressure for playing in the intellectual-property (IP) and chip-making business. The company is arguably the most important contributor to 5G, and its technology is featured in pretty much every mobile device on the planet, either as part of the system itself, or its patents as part of another chip makers' system. This business model requires investing in R&amp;#38;D years ahead of new standards and risking big dollars to reap the rewards of being on the front edge of new standards. Regulatory scrutiny has held back the company's stock price at times, but the business' stability as a critical component to the world's connectivity standards makes it robust.  Nvidia's recent $40 billion acquisition announcement of Arm[13] will follow a similar suit for IP and chip making under the same roof. Moreover, Nvidia's longer-term vision puts the company at the forefront of artificial intelligence (AI), which will be one of the biggest tech booms and investment areas over the next decade.  Microsoft went bold after appointing Satya Nadella, which saw the company go all in on cloud computing. This meant disrupting its steady, but antiquated, licensing business and building an almost entirely new stack and business model in almost every facet of the company. Short term, the risks were big and there was a lot of uncertainty for the company in the long term. Clearly, thinking long was the right strategy as the company's market cap has, at its peak, more than tripled in the time since Nadella took over six years ago.  Amazon made two big bets on the long term that paid off. First, that shoppers would move to do almost all types of purchasing online, and, second, and the one that I parallel more to Tesla, the bet on building a platform business around delivering cloud services. The idea of taking its excess computing capacity and monetizing it was without question opportunistic, but becoming the world's largest public cloud provider was done with intention, with the big picture in mind. Amazon bet on the fact that just as many people were turning to online for shopping, businesses would likewise need to turn to cloud to scale their business and fuel digital transformation. It was a long bet, and one that many investors probably didn't understand at the time, but now represents over 60% of Amazon's quarterly profit. Big Tech parallelsTesla's strategy parallels much closer with the Big Tech platform companies that have delivered huge gains and customer loyalty by playing the long game. Electric vehicles and sophisticated autonomous vehicles powered by robust computing power are the future. While the $25,000 Tesla may be a few years away, the company's long vision is to deliver Tesla's fully electric, highly intelligent automobiles at a price that truly makes electric vehicles at scale a reality. And a strategy much more akin to Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Nvidia and Qualcomm than anything else.  For investors, this should provide a bit of comfort despite knowing that in the short run Tesla could face continued volatility as there will always be those who want to bet against it. However, I believe the company is on the right track, and if it can deliver its entry level model in the next 36 months, there may be only one direction for the company from there, and that will be up.

But the Department of Education's (DoE) plan to outsource student loan servicing to Big Tech and Big Finance may not erase some of the existing problems.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The DoE has historically relied on the same group of companies to handle the job, like Navient, Nelnet and Great Lakes Educations Loan Services to name a few, but their contracts with the federal government are set to expire in 2019 \"\" and Big Tech and Big Finance are more than happy to take over.</p><p>Last week, president Donald Trump's administration and the DoE met with several of these firms names, including Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Visa, American Express and Amazon, to look at ways to improve the servicing infrastructure and \"gauge their interest in taking bids\", according to published reports.</p><p>The move to address issues with student loan servicing by the federal government is definitely one in the right direction. Existing student loan infrastructure has added fuel to the $1.4tr student debt fire. Published reports over the years have indicated that some borrowers have defaulted on their payments or had their credit ruined because their student loan payments were either not processed on time or were completely missed by the servicer.</p><p>Separately, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has already called out or filed lawsuits against some servicers in the past for \"deceptive practices\" related to faulty student debt collections.</p><p>The entrance of the big guns will definitely give student loan servicing infrastructure the overhaul it sorely needs, making it easier for borrowers to make repayments, and for student loan ABS issuers and bondholders to track payments, deferments and aggregate data for securitization purposes.</p><p>But handing over student loan servicing to these companies does not guarantee that the same deceptive practices will not happen again.</p><p>Moreover, since federal student loans are government-guaranteed, the federal government is basically giving these financial titans the ability to run a lucrative collections business, spurred on by the fact that borrowers cannot discharge student debt even after filing for bankruptcy. Meanwhile, the newly overhauled servicing infrastructure will likely give these companies the ability to track and chase down borrowers even more persistently than their predecessors.</p><p>Adding to this potentially toxic cocktail is the DoE's intention to roll back some regulations targeting for-profit colleges, meaning that more borrowers could be misled by these predatory institutions \"\" and the astronomical amounts of debt they can heap upon students.</p><p>An overhauled servicing infrastructure is only effective if the federal government \"\" and the regulatory climate \"\" protect and enable borrowers to repay to the best of their ability.</p><p>But if the federal government continues to remain lax in protecting borrowers \"\" and fails to keep higher education affordable \"\" then perhaps the new servicing infrastructure will only be good for is reflecting the spike in defaults and deferred payments as consumer protection laws are dismantled and the cost of higher education continues to soar.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUROWK-b15xh03gbv4khz</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUROWK2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RDK-JW31-JD1P-T2WW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">318064</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"491\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Global Capital Euroweek</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"12\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>December 5, 2017</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0009EAY</classCode><className>NELNET INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00027NH</classCode><className>JPMORGAN CHASE &amp;

Facebook was the second most common, used in 23 per cent of offices, followed by Snapchat which was the platform used in 14 per cent of crimes.</p><p>Peter Wanless, the chief executive of the NSPCC, said the huge number of offences in just 18 months showed self-regulation by big tech companies had failed: \"These figures are overwhelming evidence that keeping children safe cannot be left to social networks. We cannot wait for the next tragedy before tech companies are made to act.</p><p>\"It is hugely concerning to see the sharp spike in grooming offences on Instagram, and it is vital that the platform designs basic protection more carefully into the service it offers young people.\"</p><p>The data runs from April 2017, when the law was changed, and September 2018 and was obtained through freedom of information requests from 39 of the 42 police forces in England and Wales.</p><p>In most instances, the police force did not record which particular website or app was used to groom the victim. But where they did, there has been a steep increase in the usage of Instagram.</p><p>In the first six months since the law came into force (April to September 2017) there were 126 recorded instances of Instagram being used to sexually groom a child.</p><p>Just one year later during the same time period, that number rose to 428 times, a 240 per cent increase.</p><p>However, it is not clear if these figures do represent a major increase in the number of abusers choosing to groom their victims over Instagram. In many cases the platform used by the groomer was not recorded and in some instances multiple apps were used.</p><p>According to the NSPCC data, the most common target of online groomers were girls aged 12 to 15. One in five victims, however, were aged under 11. Children as young as five were recorded as victims in some instances.</p><p>The government is due to publish a white paper on internet safety before the end of winter and Mr Wanless said it was vital it included tough new regulation.</p><p>The NSPCC is campaigning for tech firms to be given a legal duty of care to children who use their platforms and for large fines to be imposed on them when they fail to protect under-18s.</p><p>One mother of a 13-year-old girl who was groomed by a 24-year-old man over Facebook and Snapchat said if social media had not existed her daughter would have been spared her ordeal.</p><p>\"We felt as though we had failed as parents - we knew about these social media sites, we thought we were doing everything we could to ensure our children's safety when they were online, but we still couldn't protect her. Somebody has got to take responsibility for what happens to children on their platforms. Simply put, if social media didn't exist, this would never have happened to her.\"</p><p>The white paper on internet safety was originally supposed to have been published by the end of 2018, although that deadline later slipped to by the end of the winter.</p><p>In February, a spokesperson for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said it had \"heard\" demands for an internet regulator and statutory duty of care and was \"seriously considering all options\".</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INPDWB-INMLMMGLSTRY000031630380-ARTICLE-TEXT-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDPNT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VJ0-MSX1-F072-43NX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"603\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Independent Print Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Independent - Daily Edition</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30262\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 1, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Amazon employed just two of its own registered lobbyists in Washington. And Facebook had only recently graduated to a real office after running its D.C. operation out of an employee's living room.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since then, though, these technology companies have evolved into some of the most potent political forces in the nation's capital, a Washington Post analysis of new federal records reveals, with just seven tech giants accounting for nearly a half-billion dollars in lobbying over the past decade.</p><p>The data \" culled from the companies' required filings to the government, including new reports made public late Tuesday \" tells the story of a sector that increasingly has tapped its deep pockets to beat back regulatory threats and boost its bottom line. Despite actions by companies that exposed users' personal information and left democratic elections in digital disarray, Congress has not adopted new laws to limit the industry \" a reality some critics attribute in part to Silicon Valley's evolving lobbying prowess.</p><p>'These companies, because they are so large, have tremendous economic power and tremendous political power,' said Rep. David N. Cicilline (D-R.I.), who is leading the House in an antitrust investigation of big tech companies. 'And they're spending hundreds of millions of dollars to try to protect the status quo.'</p><p>Facebook, for example, spent almost $81-million in the nation's capital between 2010 and 2019, according to new lobbying records as well as data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. That includes nearly $17-million last year, its highest amount, as it sought to assuage federal regulators who were furious at what they saw as Facebook's failures to protect users' data, crack down on dangerous content and stop the spread of viral misinformation ahead of the 2020 presidential election. The company declined to comment for this report.</p><p>Apple, Google, Microsoft, Twitter and Uber, which were included in the analysis, also declined to comment.</p><p>Amazon said it is 'focused on ensuring we are advocating on issues that are important to our customers, our employees and policymakers,' according to spokeswoman Jill Kerr. Amazon spent more than $16-million on lobbying last year, a record for the e-commerce giant.</p><p>(Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Post.)</p><p>The steep rise in Silicon Valley's political spending reflects the coming-of-age of an industry that began the decade in Washington's good graces. Ten years ago, federal regulators fawned over Facebook, Google and their tech peers, seeking a chance to associate themselves with companies considered to be engines of American economic recovery \" and executives who could help pad their reelection coffers.</p><p>But then came data mishaps at Facebook and Google, and an election in 2016 in which popular social media services were weaponized by the Russian government. The revelations shook Washington, where Congress would come to subject tech companies and their top leaders to the same harsh spotlight that long had been trained on big banks, oil giants and other more entrenched industries.</p><p>'People were celebrating these companies as great stories of American success,' said Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.). 'The founders would make noble statements about corporate goals, and everybody bought into that without a lot of scrutiny.'</p><p>Now, Warner said, the industry's recent troubles have 'put us in a place now where the potential for fairly dramatic action is there.'</p><p>In recent months, members of Congress have started translating their threats against big tech into action. Democrats and Republicans have introduced a flurry of bills that would restrict how tech companies collect data, for example, and penalize them more harshly for privacy abuses. They have forged ahead with efforts to adopt new laws aimed at online political advertising and debated whether to hold Facebook, Google and other digital behemoths liable for dangerous or problematic content their users' post.</p><p>Silicon Valley's largest players have responded in kind, steadily ratcheting up their lobbying expenses. Tech giants now spend as much or more as big banks, pharmaceutical manufacturers and oil giants, the records show, led by Amazon, Facebook and Google, which regularly draw lawmakers' ire.</p><p>Google, for example, dedicated roughly $150-million to lobbying over the past decade, far more than any of its peers over that period, as it found itself under siege for a wide range of business practices, including its highly criticized approach to children's data.</p><p>The company's newest data reflects its political activity between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31. Over that period, Google lobbyists focused heavily on 'privacy and competition issues in online advertising,' its report shows, reflecting probes underway on Capitol Hill and at the Justice Department looking at one of the most lucrative arms of its business.</p><p>Amazon, meanwhile, spent nearly $80-million over the course of 10 years. The e-commerce giant's political operation, which also includes its cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services, has grown exponentially as federal lawmakers and regulators have showered the company with similar antitrust scrutiny.</p><p>Amazon lobbyists also blanketed the Capitol on issues related to law enforcement and facial-recognition technology.</p><p>Once absent from Washington, Apple has lobbied more forcefully than ever in a bid to ensure President Trump's policies on taxes and tariffs benefit the iPhone giant and its bottom line. The company ended the year having spent more than $7-million to reach Congress and the White House, federal records show. That was less than its tech peers but a record for Apple, whose chief executive, Tim Cook, has forged with a close relationship with Trump.</p><p>Ten years ago, Uber did not employ a single federal lobbyist. But the company now spends millions of dollars in Washington each year \" $2.3-million in 2019 \" as it charts the next chapter for its ride-hailing business. It has lobbied considerably for more-permissive rules allowing self-driving vehicles on U.S. roads, its records show, as well as more-audacious gambits such as 'vertical take-off and landing technology' \" essentially, flying cars.</p><p>Twitter, meanwhile, spent $1.48-million in 2019, less than other tech companies but still its most ever, in a year when its chief executive regularly found himself in Washington. Microsoft, a longtime political player, shelled out more than $10-million in 2019, federal records show.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tony.romm@washpost.com\">tony.romm@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-0efc28e03d3611ea88725df698785a4e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y1Y-GH21-DYX1-H0M2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1102\"/><timeReceived>3:53 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 23, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Amazon employed just two of its own registered lobbyists in Washington. And Facebook had only recently graduated to a real office after running its D.C. operation out of an employee's living room.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since then, though, these technology companies have evolved into some of the most potent political forces in the nation's capital, a Washington Post analysis of new federal records reveals, with just seven tech giants accounting for nearly a half-billion dollars in lobbying over the past decade.</p><p>The data \" culled from the companies' required filings to the government, including new reports made public late Tuesday \" tells the story of a sector that increasingly has tapped its deep pockets to beat back regulatory threats and boost its bottom line. Despite actions by companies that exposed users' personal information and left democratic elections in digital disarray, Congress has not adopted new laws to limit the industry \" a reality some critics attribute in part to Silicon Valley's evolving lobbying prowess.</p><p>'These companies, because they are so large, have tremendous economic power and tremendous political power,' said Rep. David N. Cicilline (D-R.I.), who is leading the House in an antitrust investigation of big tech companies. 'And they're spending hundreds of millions of dollars to try to protect the status quo.'</p><p>Facebook, for example, spent almost $81-million in the nation's capital between 2010 and 2019, according to new lobbying records as well as data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. That includes nearly $17-million last year, its highest amount, as it sought to assuage federal regulators who were furious at what they saw as Facebook's failures to protect users' data, crack down on dangerous content and stop the spread of viral misinformation ahead of the 2020 presidential election. The company declined to comment for this report.</p><p>Apple, Google, Microsoft, Twitter and Uber, which were included in the analysis, also declined to comment.</p><p>Amazon said it is 'focused on ensuring we are advocating on issues that are important to our customers, our employees and policymakers,' according to spokeswoman Jill Kerr. Amazon spent more than $16-million on lobbying last year, a record for the e-commerce giant.</p><p>(Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Post.)</p><p>The steep rise in Silicon Valley's political spending reflects the coming-of-age of an industry that began the decade in Washington's good graces. Ten years ago, federal regulators fawned over Facebook, Google and their tech peers, seeking a chance to associate themselves with companies considered to be engines of American economic recovery \" and executives who could help pad their reelection coffers.</p><p>But then came data mishaps at Facebook and Google, and an election in 2016 in which popular social media services were weaponized by the Russian government. The revelations shook Washington, where Congress would come to subject tech companies and their top leaders to the same harsh spotlight that long had been trained on big banks, oil giants and other more entrenched industries.</p><p>'People were celebrating these companies as great stories of American success,' said Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.). 'The founders would make noble statements about corporate goals, and everybody bought into that without a lot of scrutiny.'</p><p>Now, Warner said, the industry's recent troubles have 'put us in a place now where the potential for fairly dramatic action is there.'</p><p>In recent months, members of Congress have started translating their threats against big tech into action. Democrats and Republicans have introduced a flurry of bills that would restrict how tech companies collect data, for example, and penalize them more harshly for privacy abuses. They have forged ahead with efforts to adopt new laws aimed at online political advertising and debated whether to hold Facebook, Google and other digital behemoths liable for dangerous or problematic content their users' post.</p><p>Silicon Valley's largest players have responded in kind, steadily ratcheting up their lobbying expenses. Tech giants now spend as much or more as big banks, pharmaceutical manufacturers and oil giants, the records show, led by Amazon, Facebook and Google, which regularly draw lawmakers' ire.</p><p>Google, for example, dedicated roughly $150-million to lobbying over the past decade, far more than any of its peers over that period, as it found itself under siege for a wide range of business practices, including its highly criticized approach to children's data.</p><p>The company's newest data reflects its political activity between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31. Over that period, Google lobbyists focused heavily on 'privacy and competition issues in online advertising,' its report shows, reflecting probes underway on Capitol Hill and at the Justice Department looking at one of the most lucrative arms of its business.</p><p>Amazon, meanwhile, spent nearly $80-million over the course of 10 years. The e-commerce giant's political operation, which also includes its cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services, has grown exponentially as federal lawmakers and regulators have showered the company with similar antitrust scrutiny.</p><p>Amazon lobbyists also blanketed the Capitol on issues related to law enforcement and facial-recognition technology.</p><p>Once absent from Washington, Apple has lobbied more forcefully than ever in a bid to ensure President Trump's policies on taxes and tariffs benefit the iPhone giant and its bottom line. The company ended the year having spent more than $7-million to reach Congress and the White House, federal records show. That was less than its tech peers but a record for Apple, whose chief executive, Tim Cook, has forged with a close relationship with Trump.</p><p>Ten years ago, Uber did not employ a single federal lobbyist. But the company now spends millions of dollars in Washington each year \" $2.3-million in 2019 \" as it charts the next chapter for its ride-hailing business. It has lobbied considerably for more-permissive rules allowing self-driving vehicles on U.S. roads, its records show, as well as more-audacious gambits such as 'vertical take-off and landing technology' \" essentially, flying cars.</p><p>Twitter, meanwhile, spent $1.48-million in 2019, less than other tech companies but still its most ever, in a year when its chief executive regularly found himself in Washington. Microsoft, a longtime political player, shelled out more than $10-million in 2019, federal records show.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tony.romm@washpost.com\">tony.romm@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-0efc28e0-3d36-11ea-8872-5df698785a4e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y1Y-MHV1-DXXY-30M2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1102\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Suburban Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 23, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The most significant update in more than two decades, the new regulations approved by the European Parliament will hold social media platforms legally responsible for content uploaded by users. Its chief impact will be on copyright violations and their prevention. The responsibility now lies plainly with the powerful owners of platforms like YouTube, Google and Facebook. </p><p>Today, social media firms have become the dominant suppliers of news and other copyright materials such as music, especially for younger people. Their owners have reaped unimaginable profits and become some of the world's biggest corporations. While exploiting creative materials produced by the more traditional content producers, the big tech firms have also contributed directly to their decline as advertising migrates to the dominant social media platforms. In the United States, Facebook and Google accounted for 60 per cent of online advertising revenue last year. Washington has lobbied fiercely against the changes in the EU. One obvious reason is that virtually all the big tech firms are American. But there are also fundamental legal and philosophical differences over regulation of the media. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3003993/mark-zuckerberg-says-governments-should-regulate\">Zuckerberg cares about your privacy, says governments should regulate internet</url></p><p>By law since 1996 in the US, online platforms are not considered \"publishers\" of content produced by third parties. The crucial difference is that publishers, such as this newspaper, are legally responsible for the content they publish. Google and YouTube, however, are not. This US law arguably lies at the foundation of the profit-making model of such big tech firms. It also puts traditional media at a huge disadvantage. </p><p>In the US and many EU countries, the decline of traditional news media is advanced. Asian cities such as Hong Kong are not far behind. With few exceptions, most of our traditional media companies from print to television are experiencing decline in readership, viewership, circulation and audience ratings. In Hong Kong as elsewhere, younger people prefer online platforms for their daily media diet. The EU is showing there needs to be a balance between regulation and an online free-for-all, between accountability and the free and fair use of copyright materials. </p><p>Copyright (c) 2019.

One o...</p><p>The digital transformation of an organisation, once considered a nice-to-have, is now viewed as critical for business survival, allowing businesses to quickly respond and adapt to change. This has been one of the key lessons of the Covid-19 pandemic.    One of the most asked questions in recent months is the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the pace of digital transformation. Are organisations, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs), now more inclined to invest in automating and digitalising their operations, and are companies in general accelerating their digital transformation plans in the wake of the pandemic?    Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC) director of business digital adoption Muhundhan Kamarapullai says the pandemic has been a wake-up call. \u201cCovid-19 has definitely altered the drive for digital transformation where, in order to sustain and survive, businesses need to inject digital [technology] into their business operations.\u201d    KPMG head of IT-enabled transformation Alvin Gan is observing a mindset change among business executives and leaders. \u201cIt used to be a \u2018wait-for-digital\u2019 mindset with digital transformation initiatives in several industries tottering at the edges. Today, we are seeing more of a \u2018straight-to-digital\u2019 mindset as Covid-19 becomes the burning platform to change,\u201d he says.    The digital transformation conversation is not new. Malaysia has recognised the importance of digital transformation from as far back as the 1990s, with the establishment of the National IT Council as well as the launch of initiatives such as the National IT Agenda and the Multimedia Super Corridor.     Benchmarking studies conducted in recent years show that Malaysia is competitive in terms of digital adoption, says Muhundhan. For example, the Digital Adoption Index, developed for the World Bank\u2019s World Development Report 2016: Digital Dividends, ranks Malaysia at No 41 out of 180 countries. The IMD World Digital Competitiveness Rankings 2019 meanwhile places Malaysia at No 26 out of 63 other economies in Overall Performance in Digital Trends.     Malaysia is ranked No 31 (out of 139 countries) in the World Economic Forum\u2019s 2016 Network Readiness Index, an aggregate measure that aims to capture how well an economy is using information and communications technology. Basically, the index shows that connectivity indicators are mostly strong with good internet and mobile penetration and widespread smartphone usage.    DataReportal\u2019s Digital 2020 Malaysia report, created in partnership with We Are Social and Hootsuite, shows that at the start of 2020, there were 26.69 million internet users in the country, comprising 83% of the total population. Mobile internet users made up the bulk of total internet users (97%), with 96% of them accessing the internet via smartphones.    Thillai Raj T Ramanathan, chief technology officer at national applied research and development centre Mimos Bhd, says the public sector has also embraced digital technology. He points to digital transformation initiatives such as MyGOV \u2014 the government\u2019s one-stop service delivery portal \u2014 and the government\u2019s open data platform, data.gov.my.   The current technology infrastructure is limited with respect to support for e-commerce activities and video conferencing. - Thillai    \u201cIt is important for appropriate metrics to be put in place to measure progress,\u201d says Thillai, adding that a measure for e-government is the UN\u2019s E-Government Development Index (EGDI). \u201cEGDI comprises three important dimensions \u2014 provision of online services, telecommunications connectivity and human capacity. The recent UNEG 2020 Report has Malaysia moving from high to very high.\u201d   Where we have done well   Gan believes that where Malaysia has done well is in policymaking, which enables platforms for businesses and stakeholders to digitally thrive. \u201cFor example, Bank Negara Malaysia in recent times has issued policies that encourage digital growth in the banking sector such as electronic Know Your Customer processes, which impact banks, insurers and others to accelerate and streamline practices in identifying and verifying individual customers online,\u201d he says. The country is gearing up for a digital banking revolution with the central bank set to provide five digital banking licences, he adds.    With this new development, Gan expects to see a higher rate of digital adoption in the financial sector. A report by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in February shows that internet banking quadrupled in the last decade \u2014 topping a usage rate of 90% in 2018. Regulatory efforts are helping to advance digital adoption, as seen in the growth of mobile wallets, or e-wallets.   Today, we are seeing more of a \u2018straight-to-digital\u2019 mindset as Covid-19 becomes the burning platform to change. - Gan    Bank Negara has a longstanding commitment to accelerate Malaysia\u2019s migration to e-payments, which is part of the Financial Sector Blueprint 2011-2020. To spur greater adoption of mobile payments, the central bank introduced the Interoperable Credit Transfer Framework, which establishes a shared payment infrastructure that connects bank and non-bank accounts while managing the resultant risks.    What is significant about the e-wallet growth is the launch of multiple ones by non-bank players in Malaysia, particularly financial technology (fintech) start-ups and big technology firms, including Chinese big tech firms such as Ant Financial and Tencent.    The number of non-bank e-money issuers that offer payment solutions through mobile apps has grown significantly from just five in 2016 to 47 currently, according to Bank Negara. Of these e-wallets, GrabPay, Touch \u2018n Go (a partnership with Ant Financial) and Tencent\u2019s WeChat Pay MY are said to be among the most popular.    Indeed, on the consumer side, the digital leap appears to be well underway. As for the other verticals, the e-Conomy SEA 2019 report by Google &amp; Temasek in partnership with Bain &amp; Co, shows that Malaysia\u2019s e-commerce market has tripled in size since 2015, exceeding US$3 billion in 2019. The report forecast that the e-commerce market will hit US$11 billion by 2025. In addition, the online travel sector, spearheaded by budget airlines and budget hotel chains, reached close to US$5 billion last year and was projected to hit US$9 billion by 2025.    Apart from regulators, agencies such as MDEC are playing a role in the country\u2019s digital transformation journey. Muhundhan points to the 100 Go Digital initiative, which is aimed at SMEs. \u201cFocusing on cashless payment for the pilot project that was rolled out in Langkawi in 2019, we have successfully onboarded more than 100 SMEs for the initiative, with 30% successfully implementing digital payment solutions,\u201d he says.   The Covid-19 pandemic has been the greatest catalyst for digital transformation in defining how businesses need to remain relevant by adopting future work practices that have been discussed for years. - Muhundhan    One of the most successful of these SMEs is TerraGrill Satay, which was started by Zainah Abd Manaf when she took over her father\u2019s satay business at the night market. According to Muhundhan, Zainah now delivers satay throughout Malaysia, having accelerated the process by injecting digital technology into business functions such as automating the satay-making process, utilising digital marketing to increase sales and implementing a cashless payment solution. She has more than doubled production to 7,000 sticks daily (up from 3,000 sticks) to date and hit sales of RM40,000 to RM60,000 a month through digital marketing.   Is Covid-19 pushing us to a digital future?   Muhundhan says that when the Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR4.0) kicked off, there was great emphasis on the role of digital transformation in defining how businesses would remain relevant in the future. \u201cBut the Covid-19 pandemic has been the greatest catalyst for digital transformation in defining how businesses need to remain relevant by adopting future work practices that have been discussed for years. For example, working from home has become the \u2018new normal\u2019 \u2014 enabling a geographically dispersed workforce in the public and private sectors to continuously function at an effective degree.\u201d    Thillai says the current technology infrastructure, however, is limited with respect to support for e-commerce    activities and video conferencing. \u201cThere are areas that can be improved. For example, in loan disbursements, during the Movement Control Order (MCO) period, documents could not be signed for processing. This could have been alleviated had there been a digital signature system in place for electronic transactions.\u201d    He adds that the pandemic has highlighted the gaps in data sharing and communication as well.    EY Malaysia \u2014 in its survey of nearly 700 companies, large and listed as well as SMEs \u2014 found that 80% of companies experienced challenges with communications, connectivity and infrastructure during the MCO period.    Indeed, what has been most apparent during the pandemic and the subsequent restrictions to stem its spread is that    organisations with digital strategies in place have been able to react and adapt swiftly such as meeting the demands of a work-from-home workforce and shifting businesses online.    Workday \u2014 a provider of enterprise cloud applications for finance and human resources (HR), through its survey of C-suite and business leaders from the IT, HR and finance functions in Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia in June and July \u2014 says that almost all the chief information officers surveyed reported that digital technologies have been used to carry out their company\u2019s business continuity plans.    The pandemic is creating opportunities for industries that have lagged behind in terms of technology such as food and beverage (F&amp;B) and hospitality. The restaurant industry, which has been brought to its knees by the pandemic and continues to face challenges with changing consumer behaviours, has the opportunity to embrace technology whether in the form of contactless payments, reservations software,or even robotic assistants. Similarly, the hotel industry is looking to the Internet of Things (IoT) to aid in its recovery by enabling contactless access, connected appliances and energy management.    There are also opportunities for digital innovations across the entire value chain of the agriculture sector, often considered the world\u2019s final technological frontier. IoT-based farming solutions to monitor crops and the use of autonomous vehicle technology for sowing and harvesting, for example, can help farmers increase productivity and reduce the cost of fertilisers and pesticides.    Technology can help farmers shorten the supply chain and reach their customers more effectively. During the MCO period, for example, the disruption in the food supply chain saw farmers in Cameron Highlands dumping tonnes of vegetables. To mitigate this, e-commerce players stepped in and started selling the produce on their platforms.    One example is Everleaf Eco Solutions, which operates the organic product platform Everleaf, that set up a storage and fulfilment centre in April. Everleaf founder Clarence Chin says it assisted farmers in listing their produce on various online marketplaces. This expanded the farmers\u2019 digital exposure, allowing them to take the first steps in digitalising their operations.    \u201cCovid-19 has emerged as a game changer for digital transformation. Where previous initiatives and programmes to go digital met with lukewarm responses, particularly from SMEs, the pandemic has spurred Corporate Malaysia to accelerate its digital transformation,\u201d says EY Malaysia managing partner Datuk Abdul Rauf Rashid.    EY\u2019s survey found that 37% of SMEs and 32% of the large and listed companies have taken steps to expand or upgrade their technology capabilities. Close to 30% of businesses (30% large and listed companies and 26% SMEs) have invested in work-from-home hardware and software to ensure connectivity with their employees and improve employee productivity.   So what\u2019s the hold up?   Although the pandemic is pushing organisations to digitally transform, the reality is that many are struggling to do so. The Workday Digital Agility Index, a study conducted in collaboration with global technology market intelligence company International Data Corp (IDC) found that 90% of organisations it surveyed in Malaysia struggled to make changes to their financial plans for the year, with 83% unable to realign their organisational structures.    \u201cRecent events have brought into focus the importance of businesses being digitally agile. Without the right technological backbone, organisations cannot move quickly to adapt to rapid change. Most companies have had to make significant changes to their financial and human resources plans this year, at quick notice, and our research shows that offline processes have hampered this,\u201d says Workday Asia president Rob Wells.    While it is difficult to expect companies to invest in the digitalisation of their organisations at a time when they are struggling to pay overheads, the dearth of digital skills is another key factor in an organisation\u2019s lack of digital agility.    The Workday Digital Agility Index, for example, found that two-thirds of Malaysian organisations lack an enterprise-wide culture of agility and 67% say that less than half of their people are equipped with digital skills and capabilities. Meanwhile, a staggering 13% say they have almost no employees with digital experience or skills.    KPMG\u2019s 2019 CEO Outlook report found that the top three scarcest skills are big data/analytics, cybersecurity and artificial intelligence (AI). The findings show that skills shortages are at an all-time high since 2008 and that these shortages act as a bottleneck to growth, says Gan. \u201cIt is a point often discussed in digital transformation, but a tough nut to crack,\u201d he adds.    Workday\u2019s study attributes the lack of digital expertise in part to the prevailing mindset within Malaysian organisations of not viewing talent as a source of competitive advantage. Therefore, they are not investing in finding and nurturing it \u2014 with 79% of the organisations it surveyed discounting talent as an important strategic asset and, as such, lack the proper tools and processes to manage it.    The lack of digital growth education in the Malaysian education system, the mismatch of skills to meet the increasing demands of the digital economy and the migration of skilled workers overseas further exacerbate the country\u2019s digital skill deficiency, says Muhundhan.    iTrain Group co-founder and executive director Datuk Eric Ku stresses that to create a successful digital economy that contributes to the country\u2019s GDP and growth, more digital creators are required. \u201cCurrently, Malaysia is a digital consumer country compared with the US and China or even Taiwan. A simple way to discover this is to find out how many apps are created by Malaysians,\u201d he says.    The lack of homegrown unicorns (a term used in the venture capital industry to describe a privately held start-up with a value of more than US$1 billion) also explains the lower levels of funding received by Malaysia compared with its neighbours such as Singapore and Indonesia. The e-Conomy SEA 2019 report, for instance, shows that although funds for Malaysian internet companies have totalled nearly US$1 billion since 2015, the US$140 million raised in the first half of 2019 fell short of 2018 levels.    The other common issue that derails digital transformation is the resistance to change, Gan observes. \u201cThis is seen in almost every layer of the organisation, where corporate leaders have enjoyed a certain degree of comfort. Resistance to change can grind transformations to a halt. It is up to the CEO to rally the troops and align everyone around a strategy, narrative and vision,\u201d he says.    The challenges related to infrastructure is also hampering the digital transformation process. MDEC\u2019s Muhundhan points out that although nearly 80% of the Malaysian population is online and there is a high broadband subscription, Malaysia lags in terms of coverage, with download speeds of only 100 Mbps for high-growth areas. This lags behind countries such as Vietnam, he adds.    A lack of competition among the country\u2019s internet service providers means Malaysians are paying more for broadband compared with their neighbours in the region. The World Bank\u2019s Malaysia Economic Monitor June 2018 report ranks Malaysia at No 74 out of 167 countries for fixed broadband services and No 64 out of 118 for fibre broadband services \u2014 behind regional competitors like Vietnam and countries at a similar level of economic development such as Mexico and Turkey.   How to make that leap?   In digital skills development, initiatives such as MDEC\u2019s #mydigitalmaker aims to impart skills like coding, app development, 3D printing, robotics, embedded programming and data analytics and expose students to careers related to digital technology. The goal is to transform Malaysian youths from digital consumers into digital producers.   The goal is to upskill and reskill all the tech and non-tech employees on digital skills in order to increase the organisation\u2019s digital quotient. - Ku    Companies such as the iTrain Group are assisting organisations and the government on employee digital empowerment. \u201cThe goal is to upskill and reskill all the tech and non-tech employees on digital skills in order to increase the organisation\u2019s digital quotient,\u201d says Ku, disclosing that the group is currently working with a financial institution to come up with a digital skills competency framework.    \u201cDigital skills are important for non-tech employees, more so than tech employees. Non-tech employees are the domain experts in their respective fields whether it is finance, marketing or sales. Training them in digital skills allows them to discover the opportunity for digitalisation whereas it is the tech employees who will be tasked with the implementation,\u201d he points out.    Thillai believes that a public-private sector partnership is important to accelerate digital transformation. The government serves as a catalyst by putting in the appropriate policies, plans, mechanisms and regulatory measures while the private sector acts as the investment and implementation arm, he adds.    \u201cA Digital Economic Blueprint is being developed by the government to overcome these challenges and issues and it will involve both the public and private sectors,\u201d he says.    From the government\u2019s Budget 2020, there are already positive efforts to further the country\u2019s digital transformation journey. The RM21.6 billion National Fiberisation and Connectivity Plan, for one, aims to improve Malaysia\u2019s economic competitiveness through connectivity while preparing the nation for IR4.0.    Click here to view more infographic         The plan\u2019s objective is to bridge the digital divide between the rural and urban areas in Malaysia. It hopes to achieve this by, among others, having an entry-level fixed broadband package at 1% of the gross national income by 2020; for fibre networks to cover 70% of schools, hospitals, libraries, police stations and post offices by 2022; average speeds of 30Mbps in 98% of populated areas by 2023 and to have gigabits avaiability in selected industrial areas by 2020 as well as all state capitals by 2023.    MDEC, on its part, has rolled out several programmes to bridge the urban-rural digital divide, including the establishment of Digital Enhancement Centres. There are 14 such one-stop centres located throughout the country aimed at assisting SMEs in increasing their digital adoption as well as their access to financing and capacity building.    Meanwhile, the recently announced Short Term Economic Recovery Plan (Penjana) focuses on digitalisation to spur economic recovery. Among the initiatives are the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation\u2019s National Technology and Innovation Sandbox (NTIS).    Initiatives included in the NTIS (which has a RM100 million allocation) include the use of autonomous robots for health services and the agriculture sector by optimising the usage of fertilisers and spraying of pesticides, AI and IoT technologies and advanced manufacturing such as 3D printing.    The #SMART Automation Grant is another government initiative to expand support for SMEs to make the digital leap. The grant is available for 50% of the total project cost or up to a maximum grant cap of RM200,000, whichever is lower. Businesses in the services sector that qualify for the grant include retail, wholesale, food and beverage, tourism, logistics, transport, education, healthcare, real estate as well as professional and financial services.    In last year\u2019s tabling of Budget 2020, the government introduced a 5G Ecosystem Development Grant worth RM50 million and allocated RM25 million to set up a contestable matching grant fund to spur more pilot projects related to emerging technologies such as AI, blockchain and autonomous vehicles that leverage the fibre optics and 5G infrastructure.     \u201c5G will see connectivity in Malaysia evolve to a level which is unseen before in terms of connectivity speed, less latencies, higher number of connections and, of course, bigger capacity,\u201d says Gan.    He adds that 5G, to a large extent, will be the backbone of the country\u2019s goals in making it big in the digital economy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42850572168</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60KX-XPC1-JCSC-J2J2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3644\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Edge Markets</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 16, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Internet of Things Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Internet of Things Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Internet of Things Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Internet of Things Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Internet of Things Inc</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Malaysia</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Asia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>South-Eastern Asia</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.ticker\"><classificationItem><className>7IT</className><className>MUN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>7IT</className><className>STU</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>7IT</className><className>FRA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>ITT</className><className>TSX</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>INOTF</className><className>PINX</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Electronic Banking Requirements</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODQ4RjlEQkM4MTJDNDY3MTg3N0ZDNUMwQkY4OEI5OTE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzBDNzQyN0JENDRFNDYwMkEyNjVFRTgxNjNFRDExNUI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Former Federal Communications Commission Chairman Mark Fowler once said on \u201cThe Mark Levin Show\u201d: \u201cI believe as President Reagan did, that the electronic press and you\u2019re included in that the press that uses air and electrons, should be and must be as free from government control as the press that uses paper and ink, Period.\u201d He was a champion of removing the so-called fairness doctrine, which opened the door to the growth of talk radio. \u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Imagine if Rush Limbaugh had to give equal time on his show to the radical left? Over the years, liberals have tried to revive the fairness doctrine in hopes it would neuter the influence of talk-radio voices. Conservatives have correctly countered with arguments upholding free speech and free enterprise.\u00a0</p><p> The same standards should apply to new forms of technology  even though I do not always agree with some of their points of view. Conservatives must be consistent in the application of our principles.\u00a0</p><p> Plus, taxpayers oppose wasteful government spending. Specifically, they believe that continuing probes of America\u2019s technology sector are a poor use of time as well as tax dollars. Policymakers have been warned repeatedly about the lasting negative impact of antitrust investigations on economic innovation, consumer welfare and the development of technologies that make the government more efficient, more productive and more accountable to the taxpayers. Prospective antitrust investigations are a waste of time and government resources, and almost always end up making government officials look foolish.\u00a0</p><p> Attention is on the federal government, but many of the threats of antitrust investigations are coming from the state level. State attorneys general have been colluding with federal lawmakers to send a signal to many of the most successful companies in the United States that they need to be worried about the heavy hand of regulators reaching into their businesses.</p><p> State policymakers should be cautious. Taxpayers across the country don\u2019t support these kinds of fishing investigations and generally hold tech innovators in much higher esteem than they do their own elected representatives. The biggest technology companies have positive approval ratings by up to 20 points  approval ratings that politicians would dream of having.</p><p> New polling out of more than 3,000 voters across the country finds that investigating \u201cbig tech\u201d is one of the lowest priorities that constituents have for their elected officials. The traditional responsibilities of attorneys general  fraud, human trafficking, criminal prosecution and others  are what voters want their officials to focus on going forward.\u00a0</p><p> The coronavirus crisis is placing a significant strain on state budgets, and with limited resources, officials would be wise to heed public sentiment. Large majorities of voters in every state said that it is either not a priority at all or only a minor priority to investigate big tech. While lawmakers may be looking to score cheap points on antitrust investigations during an election year, these provocations may backfire: big tech is popular, and voters don\u2019t want to see these kinds of actions taken.</p><p> Murmurs of monopoly and antitrust always seem to crop up right at a tipping point when companies that look like monopolies begin to falter. MySpace was called a \u201cmonopoly\u201d in 2007 and is now merely a blip in the memory of technology companies. Walmart was said to have been a monopoly right when Amazon began its rise. Blockbuster Video in 2005 backed out of a merger with Hollywood Video due to concerns over a Federal Trade Commission antitrust investigation  and now only one Blockbuster store remains in the entire country.</p><p> Our antitrust policy should apply a light touch, not a heavy hand, and examples abound of companies that looked like monopolies and were targeted for antitrust only to have those cases collapse like a house of cards. Overzealous politicians love to focus on \u201cbig business,\u201d and the most successful businesses in the new century have far and away been technology companies. These companies, however, are much more popular than politicians  and the politicians could end up looking foolish.</p><p> Overall, the largest group of voters in these most recent polls suggested that a focus on combating human trafficking and price gouging were the most important priorities for their state\u2019s top prosecutor. The share of voters focused on investigating companies for antitrust violations fell below the margin of error. On the flip side, voters thought the least important priorities for the state attorneys general were suing the drug manufacturers over addiction to painkillers and investigating companies for antitrust violations. \u00a0</p><p> Bottom-line: Free enterprise thrives when the government gets out of the way. Overzealous regulators shouldn\u2019t try to use big government to over-regulate individuals, families and employers. Using the heavy hand of the government through antitrust investigations or similar means is a waste of taxpayers\u2019 money. And the latest poll shows that the voters agree.</p><p> \u2022 Scott Walker was the 45th governor of Wisconsin.

Deliver universal free health care, education and other public services that also work for women and girls. </p><p>Stop supporting privatization of public services. Provide pensions, child benefits and other social protection for all. Design all services to ensure they also deliver for women and girls.2. Free up women's time by easing the millions of unpaid hours they spend every day caring for their families and homes. Let those who do this essential work have a say in budget decisions and make freeing up women's time a key objective of government spending. Invest in public services including water, electricity and childcare that reduce the time needed to do this unpaid work.3. End the under-taxation of rich individuals and corporations. Tax wealth and capital at fairer levels. Stop the race to the bottom on personal income and corporate taxes. Eliminate tax avoidance and evasion by corporates and the super-rich. Agree a new set of global rules and institutions to fundamentally redesign the tax system to make it fair, with developing countries having an equal seat at the table.ControversyPolicymakers should take Oxfam's findings and suggestions with a grain of salt, however, since even after repeated criticism year after year, the report remains methodologically sloppy. Their calculation of inequality is based on \"net assets\" in which the assets owned by individuals, such as property and shares, is subtracted by their debt liabilities, to calculate their position in the global wealth distribution. Income is excluded from the calculation.Read more: Global Wealth Report finds millennials in financial fixOne of the most intuitive problems with this is that the poorest people by this method are not those in developing countries living with little to nothing, but young professionals, who own no assets with a significant degree of student debt. It seems absurd to believe that a Harvard graduate in his first job, with a steady income, is somehow worse off than those living with little debt in sub-Saharan Africa or Southeast Asia, simply because he had to take out a loan for college.Jamie White, research director at the UK think tank, Institute of Economic Affairs, says that what Oxfam's got fundamentally wrong here isn't so much the inclusion of the debt; it's the failure to recognize the asset it has funded.\"It's true that a Harvard graduate, say from law school, has a high debt. But what Oxfam isn't counting is the value from this degree,\" he says.Issues like these persist throughout Oxfam's work. Individual data, for example, does not capture family assets nor the pension claims that one has. Last year, Oxfam tried to dismiss claims that pension funds act as institutional investors for the average person by claiming \"even in countries where pension funds are significant institutional investors, in effect sharing the returns with pensioners, their share of these lucrative assets has been declining.\"This is contrasted with the evidence that pension funds and liabilities represent a growing share of the global economy. Pension funds are rapidly expanding around the world, with China having the fastest growth rate. Ignoring this distorts the findings on the real ownership structures of capital assets.What really mattersIt is clear that the Oxfam report is not of the high academic caliber worthy of the sort of media attention it generates. The organization's notion that global wealth is a collective pool to which people around the world contribute, and from which the rich take the lion's share, depriving others is preposterous.Jamie White says that taking away the wealth of the 26 super-rich and giving it to the poor \u2014 a policy Oxfam may favor \u2014 wouldn't help at all. \"All that would happen is they would double their net worth, and that would amount to an increase of $750 [per person]. That's not an increase in their income, but a one-off payment. It wouldn't really change their lives at all,\" he says.But the underlying problem of inequality is nonetheless real. Economist David Autor from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that a significant degree of inequality can be explained by what is referred to as \"superstar firms\" such as Big Tech companies, who significantly outperform everyone else.Read more: Number of billionaires rises rapidlyResearch into the likes of Google and Facebook shows that most inequality is not between bosses and their employees, but between those that work at superstar companies with smaller labor forces, and everyone else.That is why Jamie White argues that rather than increasing the scope of regulations that allows for special interests to capture policy, the focus should be on increasing competition and reducing barriers to market entry. A more competitive market economy would increase prosperity and combat cronyism in a much more effective manner than the suggestions proposed by Oxfam. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DEWL109991154802928614225176500062</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DEWL-7829</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V7N-V541-JCMN-Y25D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1090\"/><timeReceived>12:08 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Deutsche Welle Business</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 21, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0001X99</classCode><className>CREDIT SUISSE GROUP AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS551111 OFFICES OF BANK HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS524126 DIRECT PROPERTY &amp;

Mark Warner tells PACIFIC that China's technological rise has been fueled by US tech companies that \"prostituted themselves\" to gain access to the Chinese market.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sign up for PACIFIC: The new CNNMoney newsletter about the center of change and innovation</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In an interview in his Capitol hideaway, Warner offered his strongest criticism to date of American tech giants and their accession to Chinese demands.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"A lot of Americans don't understand what's happening in China and how good their tech companies have become,\" Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told me. \"Partially that's because American companies have bastardized themselves so much to get into the Chinese market that they've given away a lot of the intellectual capital.\"</p><p>Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and other big tech companies have all stored users' encryption keys in China in exchange for access to the Chinese market. Any hand-over of data is a top concern for lawmakers and data privacy experts.</p><p>Warner believes China's rising technological prowess should be a top priority for lawmakers and the intelligence community. \"The theft of intellectual property ... Chinese investment in early-stage companies in America, the fact that China has taken all the American companies who basically sacrificed their source code to get into that market,\" he said. \"They prostituted themselves to get into that market.\"</p><p>More from Warner on Facebook and regulation below.</p><p>---</p><p>Today's PACIFIC</p><p>Good morning from Georgetown.</p><p>Tonight: The United Talent Agency's annual White House Correspondents' Dinner party at Fiola Mare. Tomorrow: Tammy Haddad's brunch.</p><p>---</p><p>The Trust Crisis: Warner: Regulation too slow</p><p>Warner told me he is \"absolutely concerned\" that the government is not moving fast enough to keep up with the pace of technological change. It is therefore ill-positioned to regulate the tech industry, enforce data privacy laws and ensure that foreign actors don't meddle in future US elections, he said.</p><p>Warner's top concerns</p><p>? Another Cambridge Analytica-type event will rattle American tech. \"The chance of another incident is going up immensely,\" he said.</p><p>? Corporate espionage. \"We have some evidence that there were corporate espionage folks who saw how effective misinformation was in the 2016 campaign,\" he said. \"This doesn't just have to be Democrats vs. Republicans. It can be Coke vs. Pepsi.\"</p><p>? Regulating the past, not the future. \"The U.S. government is still trying to understand 2016 technology,\" he told me. \"The next wave will be deep fake, it will be voice, it will be facial -- and we're not really ready.\"</p><p>? Misplaced priorities. \"We have a $700 billion defense budget we just passed, but I wonder if we're buying 20th Century stuff,\" he said. \"Russia has a $68 billion defense budget and they are much heavier on misinformation, disinformation and cyber.\"</p><p>? Government bureaucracy. \"We're still trying to figure out where inside US government this fits. You've this task force set up and that task force set up. Are they really working together?\"</p><p>Warner's ideas for regulation</p><p>? 1. Forcing tech companies to assume responsibility for content. \"You could go as far as saying you've got the same responsibility that a newspaper or radio or television station has. You've got to do full content creation,\" he said.</p><p>? 2. Forcing tech companies to warn users about foreign actors. \"Could you at least have a flag that comes up and says a person is marketing themselves as an American, but really the post is coming from abroad?\"</p><p>? 3. Giving users easy ownership of data. \"At this point Facebook says they will allow you to move all of your information, but it's a real pain in the ass.\"</p><p>? 4. Compensating users for data. \"Platform companies could still use their same advertising model [but would pay you] each time they used your data.\"</p><p>The Big Picture</p><p>Warner: \"If we don't put some framework around this, bad stuff is going to happen.\" But ... Warner also said: \"I've got no interest in not seeing Facebook continue to succeed. ... The worst thing in the world would be to knee-cap innovation in American tech companies and open the field to the exact Chinese equivalents.\"</p><p>Sign up for PACIFIC: The new CNNMoney newsletter about the center of change and innovation</p><p>---</p><p>The Takeaway</p><p>Warner thinks deeply about data privacy and cybersecurity and has done more homework than most Senators. He sees Russia's meddling in US politics as part of a larger story about a decline of validation in American media and society, wherein foreign entities and cybercriminals can \"splinter our country or undermine our institutions.\" But he is also acutely aware of the Sisyphean task of moving Congress forward on regulation and longs for a president who acknowledges and prioritizes this issue. \"There's not anybody in charge in the White House that's trying to make sure our election security is safe in 2018,\" he said. \"You've got to start with a White House that acknowledges the problem.\"</p><p>---</p><p>Across the Pond: What Warner is reading</p><p>\"Facebook Faces Tough Questions in Britain That It Avoided in the U.S.\" by NYT's Adam Satariano:</p><p>? \"Mark Zuckerberg escaped tough questioning during congressional testimony this month in part because American lawmakers weren't well versed about how the social network functions. On Thursday, one of his deputies faced a decidedly sharper inquisition from a panel in Britain.\"</p><p>? \"Facebook's chief technology officer, Mike Schroepfer, faced more than four hours of questions from a British parliamentary committee ...\"</p><p>? \"If American politicians have been lampooned for being Luddites, the British Parliament's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee has built a reputation for thoroughness and detailed questioning.\"</p><p>The Big Picture, via Satariano: \"The dueling experiences highlight the different approaches taken on both sides of the Atlantic toward oversight of personal data and the social media giants who hold it. While the United States has largely eschewed regulating companies like Facebook, Britain and other countries in Europe have taken more aggressive stances, seeking to make tighter rules to better protect consumer privacy.\"</p><p>Bonus: The one question I asked Warner that he didn't want to answer: \"Why didn't his Senate Intelligence Committee call on Zuckerberg to testify?\"</p><p>Sign up for PACIFIC: The new CNNMoney newsletter about the center of change and innovation</p><p>---</p><p>Valleyspeak</p><p>Facebook is Being Unfriended by Big Tech (Axios)</p><p>Microsoft's Cloud Has Business Booming Again (NYT)</p><p>Sequoia Capital's Growth Fund Tops $6 Billion (WSJ)</p><p>T-Mobile and Sprint Aim for Deal Next Week (Reuters)</p><p>Grab Is Just Getting Started in Southeast Asia (CNNMoney)</p><p>---</p><p>Amazon East: Jeff Bezos' D.C. Life</p><p>The Washingtonian's Ben Wofford goes long on Jeff Bezos' D.C. takeover, complete with blueprints of his Kalorama mansion renovations, a map of his Washington social network and a sidebar on why D.C., Montgomery County, Md., or Northern Virginia might win rights to Amazon HQ2.</p><p>Highlights:</p><p>? Bezos views Washington \"as an everything city -- a delta of diplomats and techies, military engineers and journalists, powerbrokers and problem solvers, a m\u00c3\u00a9lange perfectly suited to the tinkerer's heterodox taste,\" Wofford writes.</p><p>? Jean Case says Bezos is going to \"revive the legacy of Kay Graham,\" the late Washington Post publisher, \"and her great socializing -- bringing smart, interesting people together in a social context.\"</p><p>? Bezos' trips to Washington \"typically last one or two days; he stays in fashionable hotels -- the Jefferson, the St. Regis, the Four Seasons -- and holds court at the most popular Washington canteens: Cafe Milano, Le Diplomate, Minibar, Fiola Mare.\"</p><p>The Kalorama home:</p><p>? \"The $12-million project encompasses 191 doors ... 25 bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, five living rooms or lounges, five staircases, three kitchens, two library/studies, two exercise rooms, two elevators?and one very large ballroom.\"</p><p>? \"The estate is split into two -- the 'Pope' house and the 'Wood' ... The Pope will serve as the Bezos family quarters ... Plans call for a large kitchen and pantry, a wine room and a whiskey cellar (complete with drying racks), a lounge ... a south-facing dining room ... two dressing rooms ... bedrooms dubbed 'Ottoman,' 'Garden,' and 'Bunk,' and many?many?more rooms.\"</p><p>? \"The Wood ... opens onto a magnificent staircase of slab marble. It's flanked on the left by a 36-foot-long gallery and on the right by a nearly 1,500-square-foot ballroom with floor-to-ceiling, ionic fluted columns and a new limestone fireplace. Glance up and you'll find partygoers smiling down through the iron guardrails of the balconied promenade.\"</p><p>\"Jeff Bezos's Washington solar system\":</p><p>Or, who you need to know: Steve and Jean Case ...

Amazon Web Services saw sales jump nearly 50%, reaching $5.4 billion.\"</p><p>What's Next: $119 for Prime:</p><p>? \"Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky announced plans to help offset the rising costs of investments like original programming by raising the price of Amazon Prime ... from $99 to $119 per year starting next month.\"</p><p>Speaking of investments: Amazon has paid the NFL $130 million for streaming rights to Thursday Night Football for through the 2019 season.</p><p>Bloomberg's Shira Ovide: \"It is awesome to be Jeff Bezos.\"</p><p>Sign up for PACIFIC: The new CNNMoney newsletter about the center of change and innovation</p><p>---</p><p>The Big Short: What Jeffrey Katzenberg is reading</p><p>\"Why Netflix and Amazon are experimenting with short-form programming\" by Digiday's Sahil Patel:</p><p>? \"After a recent downswing in the video market for TV-quality short-form video series, there is renewed optimism among video makers as the top streaming giants experiment with this type of content.\"</p><p>? \"Netflix ... announced this week that it will air a new documentary series from BuzzFeed News ... Amazon [has] commissioned three original digital shorts from Funny Or Die through its Prime Video Direct program.\"</p><p>? \"Katzenberg's new venture WndrCo ... is looking to build a mobile video streaming platform anchored by expensive original series ...\"</p><p>But, but, but ...</p><p>? \"That doesn't mean Netflix, Amazon and Hulu will start buying high-end short-form video programming left and right, and some producers caution to treat these experiments as just that: experiments.\"</p><p>The Big Picture: Hollywood's brightest minds believe the entertainment industry needs to adjust to a mobile world where people watch content in 2-, 5- or 10-minute increments. But \"short form\" is a misnomer. The content is actually long form, its just broken up into shorter chunks.</p><p>Bonus: David Letterman will interview Jerry Seinfeld for Netflix's Emmy event, per Variety.</p><p>Sign up for PACIFIC: The new CNNMoney newsletter about the center of change and innovation</p><p>---</p><p>Pay It Forward: Europe's other regulation</p><p>The European Union has reached a deal that will force Netflix, Amazon and other content streamers to fund European films and television shows.</p><p>The Latest, from Reuters:</p><p>? \"The new law extends the European Union's broadcasting rules to online video services and includes a quota of 30 percent for European works on video-on-demand platforms.\"</p><p>? \"Video-sharing platforms like Google's YouTube and Facebook will also have to take measures against content \"inciting violence, hatred and terrorism.\"</p><p>---</p><p>Dub Shot: The Pelican brief</p><p>What's Next: New Orleans at Golden State, Game 1. Saturday at 7:30. TNT.</p><p>Do not buy any pregame hype about the Pelicans actually beating the Warriors, even if Steph Curry is questionable for Game 1.</p><p>Deadspin's Giri Nathan:</p><p>? \"It's still a little audacious to take New Orleans over the defending champs. But this Pelicans team, now running faster and leaner without DeMarcus Cousins, scarcely resembles the one that lost 3 of 4 games against the Warriors in the regular season.\"</p><p>? \"The annoying and immutable fact, of course, is that you have to anticipate that the Warriors win this and every other round, with or without their crown jewel.\"</p><p>Bleacher Report's Adam Fromal:</p><p>? \"New Orleans has earned respect.

The House Intelligence Committee has just released 3,000 Facebook ads that the Russia-based Internet Research Agency ran during and after the 2016 presidential campaign to sow political and cultural discord among US voters.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sign up for PACIFIC: The new CNNMoney newsletter about the center of change and innovation</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They highlight two inconvenient truths:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">1. We're so obvious: Our political divisions have become so ripe and our national discourse so poor that all it takes to exploit our partisan anxieties is a low six-figure ad spend on alarmist, agenda-driven Facebook ads.</p><p>2. We're so vulnerable: Facebook says point-blank that it will never be able to fully prevent foreign meddling on its platform \"because we're up against determined, creative and well-funded adversaries.\" This will happen again, in 2018, 2020 and beyond.</p><p>My colleague Donie O'Sullivan reviews the ads here. He also notes that Facebook and Google's handling of ads around Ireland's recent abortion referendum raise questions about their readiness for 2018 and 2020.</p><p>Meanwhile ... Bloomberg has found that at least a dozen U.S.-designated terror groups still maintain a presence on Facebook, despite its assurances about taking down terrorist content.</p><p>---</p><p>Today's PACIFIC</p><p>Good morning. Look forward, don't look back.</p><p>Just in: San Francisco is one of eight cities vying for the 2020 Democratic National Convention, my colleague Dan Merica reports. It would likely be held at Chase Center, the Warriors' new billion-dollar arena at Mission Bay, which will be completed in 2019.</p><p>Today in Washington: The White House AI Summit we told you about earlier this week is happening today. Representatives from Facebook, Google and about 40 other US companies will meet with administration officials to discuss how AI could boost the US economy while also benefitting US workers. WSJ's John D. McKinnon has a preview.</p><p>---</p><p>Preferential Pipes: Net Neutrality ends June 10</p><p>The FCC has announced that net neutrality will end on June 10.</p><p>The Big Picture: The repeal will allow internet service providers like AT&amp;T, Comcast and Verizon to control the speed at which users can access certain websites and services:</p><p>? Most internet providers support an end to net neutrality because they believe it hampers competition and blocks them from charging more money for video and data-rich content.</p><p>? Most big tech companies support net neutrality and believe an equal playing field is necessary to foster digital innovation and the growth of new companies. They also don't want to pay more for faster download times, or pass those costs on to their users.</p><p>? More than 20 states have filed suit to try to block the FCC's repeal.</p><p>Elsewhere in telecom: China's ZTE has halted its main operations following the US government ban on its sale of components to US companies.</p><p>As my colleague Sherisse Pham reports, the fact that a major Chinese company might go out of business because of the US government has major implications for the US-China fight over trade and technology.</p><p>Sign up for PACIFIC: The new CNNMoney newsletter about the center of change and innovation</p><p>---</p><p>New Plastic: Apple to offer credit card</p><p>Breaking now: Apple and Goldman Sachs are planning to launch a new joint credit card.</p><p>WSJ's Tripp Mickle and Liz Hoffman have the scoop:</p><p>? \"The planned card would carry the Apple Pay brand and could launch early next year, people familiar with the matter said.\"</p><p>? \"As new iPhone sales growth slows, Apple is focusing on services such as mobile payments, streaming-music subscriptions, and App Store sales. Apple Pay, which generates revenue on each transaction, is a key contributor ...\"</p><p>The Big Picture: An Apple credit card \"would deepen the technology giant's push into its customers' wallets and mark [Goldman's] first foray into plastic.\"</p><p>---</p><p>Sunshine State: California to require solar</p><p>The State of California, long a leader in clean energy, will require new homes to be built with solar panels starting in 2020.</p><p>The Details, via WSJ's Erin Ailworth:</p><p>? \"The California Energy Commission voted 5-0 to approve a mandate that residential buildings up to three stories high, including single-family homes and condos, be built with solar installations starting in 2020.\"</p><p>? \"The commission expects the cost of adding solar [will] add about $40 to an average monthly payment on a 30-year mortgage\" ... and save them \"$80 a month on heating, cooling and lighting bills.\"</p><p>? \"The change appears to have broad support from home builders as well as California leaders and solar advocates.\"</p><p>The Big Picture, via NYT's Ivan Penn: \"The new requirement ... brings solar power into the mainstream in a way it has never been until now.\"</p><p>Sign up for PACIFIC: The new CNNMoney newsletter about the center of change and innovation</p><p>---</p><p>Valleyspeak: Jordan Valinsky's top links</p><p>Apple scraps $1 billion Irish data center (Reuters)</p><p>Google acquires a cloud computing startup (Fortune)</p><p>Tesla is facing 4 government crash investigations (Fortune)</p><p>WeWork hires a White House chief security officer (Recode)</p><p>Snap may not be profitable til 2021 (TheStreet)</p><p>Airbnb wants you to visit Puerto Rico (CNET)</p><p>---</p><p>The Fox Wars: Will Disney give up Sky?</p><p>The latest in Disney vs. Comcast: Disney could give up Sky Broadcasting in order to seal its 21st Century Fox acquisition.</p><p>? Disney has offered $52.4 billion for Fox, which may soon own all of Sky; Comcast has counter-offered for Fox at somewhere around $60 million.</p><p>? THR's Paul Bond says \"letting Comcast get Sky so that Disney could close on Fox is an arrangement that makes sense, given Comcast's mission is to grow more rapidly overseas ... while Disney's goal has more to do with total domination of the movie business and crushing Netflix.\"</p><p>Why we're dubious: Disney CEO Bob Iger has called Sky a \"crown jewel\" of the Fox assets. It includes highly coveted rights to the Premiere League, which could keep television subscribers from cutting the cord. Also: Why would Iger want to let Comcast CEO Brian Roberts have anything?</p><p>Bonus: Fox's James Murdoch is calling for a \"robust\" regulatory review of Comcast's Sky offer. Variety's Cynthia Littleton has the details.</p><p>---</p><p>Going Direct: Apple to sell video subs</p><p>\"Apple Plans to Sell Video Subscriptions Through TV App,\" via Bloomberg's Lucas Shaw, Gerry Smith and Mark Gurman:</p><p>? \"Apple plans to begin selling subscriptions to certain video services directly via its TV app, rather than asking users to subscribe to them through apps individually downloaded from the App Store.\"</p><p>? \"This would simplify the process and bolster Apple's TV app on Apple TV, iPhones and iPads, making it a central place for people to find, watch, and buy content.\"</p><p>The Big Picture: Going direct allows Apple to \"boost its services business, which it expects to generate $50 billion a year in revenue by 2021.\"</p><p>Sign up for PACIFIC: The new CNNMoney newsletter about the center of change and innovation</p><p>---</p><p>Remix to Ignition: Spotify takes on R. Kelly</p><p>Spotify has announced that it will stop promoting R. Kelly's music and no longer include it on its playlists in the wake of multiple accusations of sexual violence against the artist.</p><p>But: His music will still be available on the service:</p><p>? Spotify: \"We don't censor content because of an artist's or creator's behavior, but we want our editorial decisions ... to reflect our values.\"</p><p>? \"When an artist or creator does something that is especially harmful or hateful, it may affect the ways we work with or support that artist or creator.\"</p><p>The Big Picture: The move highlights the growing pressure on platforms to take greater responsibility for the content they host, and the fine line companies walk between responsible behavior and censorship.</p><p>---</p><p>What Next: This thread on Chinese nicknames for NBA players, from East Asia historian Nick Kapur. \"China is crazy for the NBA,\" Kapur writes, \"but official sources use boring phonetic transcriptions, failing to take advantage of Chinese characters having both sound and meaning.

The House is by nature more unwieldy than the Senate, they say, and lawmakers have used yesterday's hearing to come up with new angles.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sign up for PACIFIC: The new CNNMoney newsletter about the center of change and innovation</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Still, Facebook knows that Zuckerberg beat expectations yesterday and left senators looking out of touch with modern-day technology. Facebook is not celebrating yet, but if today's hearing goes as well as yesterday's, they will be.</p><p>Watch the House hearing live here.</p><p>---</p><p>Today's PACIFIC</p><p>Good morning from Washington.</p><p>The Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal is about one issue above all else: The extent of Facebook's data collection, which is more widespread than many people thought. Facebook tracks you even when you're on other sites and apps. They didn't exactly shout that from the rooftops in the user agreement.</p><p>The real story here is that we -- more than 2 billion of us -- signed up for a shiny new object before stopping to ask the tough questions about what that would mean for our privacy, our security and our society.</p><p>---</p><p>Analog Congress: Senate fails the Zuck test</p><p>The Big Picture: The United States Congress is largely illiterate when it comes to 21st-century technology and ill-prepared to deal with the major challenges of big tech.</p><p>The Senate hearing made that clear:</p><p>? Many senators seemed to have no clue how Facebook worked, what the solutions to its problems are, or even what they were trying to achieve by calling on its CEO to testify.</p><p>? Many displayed an ignorance about the very basics of Facebook's platform and its business model; some seemed to be asking Zuckerberg how Facebook worked.</p><p>? The questions also lacked focus, ranging from issues like Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign to hate speech to a lack of transparency in election advertising.</p><p>Why it matters: The Senators' lack of understanding allowed Zuckerberg to evade important, unanswered questions about the extent of Facebook's data monitoring and why the company hasn't been more transparent about its handling of user data.</p><p>At a time when the country is in desperate need of a smart conversation about privacy, Congress instead provided meandering questions and misfires.</p><p>Sign up for PACIFIC: The new CNNMoney newsletter about the center of change and innovation</p><p>---</p><p>Kamala Harris goes hard</p><p>Exception to the Rule: Sen. Kamala Harris pressed Zuckerberg on his failure to explain how extensively Facebook tracked user activity:</p><p>? \"I'm concerned about how much Facebook values trust and transparency... During the course of this hearing... you've been asked several critical questions for which you don't have answers.\"</p><p>? \"Those questions have included whether Facebook can track users' browsing activity even after the user has logged off of Facebook [and] whether Facebook can track your activity across devices even when you aren't logged into Facebook...\"</p><p>Real Talk: Yes, Facebook tracks your browsing activity even when you're not on Facebook. They do this through third-party cookies and \"like\" buttons.</p><p>Sen. Harris also pressed Zuckerberg to explain why Facebook did not inform users in 2015 that their data had been shared with Cambridge Analytica:</p><p>? \"Are you aware of anyone in the leadership at Facebook who was in a conversation where a decision was made not to inform your users? Or do you believe no such conversation ever took place?\"</p><p>? Zuckerberg: \"I am not sure whether there was a conversation about that.\"</p><p>Real Talk: Zuckerberg is Facebook's CEO. If he really wasn't involved in or aware of a conversation about such a major decision, it raises serious questions about Facebook's priorities.</p><p>---</p><p>Zuck's Notes: What Facebook really thinks</p><p>Zuckerberg (accidentally?) left his notes open on the table during a break. Many reporters concluded that the notes were more revealing than the hearing.</p><p>Highlights:</p><p>? \"Don't say we already do what GDPR requires,\" which suggests Facebook is aware it most certainly does not already do what GDPR requires.</p><p>? The section on combatting criticism from Apple, which highlights how much Apple CEO Tim Cook has gotten under Facebook's skin. One line: \"Lots of stories about apps misusing Apple data, never seen Apple notify people.\"</p><p>? The line stating that Facebook only has a \"small part of the ad market\" and that \"advertisers have choices too,\" which highlights a concern about lawmakers characterizing Facebook as a monopoly.</p><p>---</p><p>Big Picture: What happens next</p><p>The pressure on Facebook is not over. But Congress has sent a signal to Wall Street and the public that it is limited in its ability to grapple with big tech, much less regulate it. The only existing regulatory proposal on the table -- the Honest Ads Act -- is narrowly focused on political advertising and, frankly, toothless. Real substantive regulation that gives users greater control over its data, like Europe's GDPR, is a long way off.</p><p>Top reads:</p><p>? \"Zuckerberg's boring testimony is a big win for Facebook: This 5-hour nothingburger made the scandal seem over\" by TechCrunch's Josh Constine.</p><p>? \"Mark Zuckerberg got a win today in Congress, but the threat of more regulation looms\" by Recode's Kurt Wagner.</p><p>? \"What was missing from Mark Zuckerberg's first day of congressional testimony\" by The New Yorker's Adrien Chen.</p><p>Sign up for PACIFIC: The new CNNMoney newsletter about the center of change and innovation</p><p>---</p><p>Talk of Tinseltown: Moonves, Redstone at war</p><p>\"Moonves vs. Redstone: Inside the Poisonous War for Control of CBS and Viacom\" by The Hollywood Reporter's Kim Masters:</p><p>? \"Leslie Moonves is open to merging CBS and Viacom -- on his terms -- but Shari Redstone, eager for power, may be ready to sacrifice Hollywood's most celebrated exec to chart her own path.\"</p><p>? \"Shari, daughter of ailing 94-year-old empire builder Sumner Redstone, insists that Viacom and CBS must merge, an idea that once would have held great appeal for Moonves ? assuming he would be in charge.\"</p><p>? \"[N]ot only is Redstone pressing for a merger, she also is widely seen as intent on taking a hand in the running of the combined companies. For Moonves, long accustomed to being absolute monarch at CBS, that looks like a deal-breaker.\"</p><p>How it's playing: CNBC: \"Redstone likely to replace Moonves as head of CBS if no deal with Viacom, sources say\"</p><p>What our sources think: This is a negotiating tactic. It's not clear how pushing out Moonves is a smart business play. He's one of the most revered execs in the game.</p><p>---</p><p>The Stream: ESPN+ test run</p><p>ESPN's subscription streaming service launches today with \"The Last Days of Knight,\" a documentary about basketball coach Bob Knight.</p><p>My colleague Brian Lowry calls the doc \"first rate,\" but notes that it \"merely adds to the debate of what qualifies as the kind of must-have content\" that justifies paying for ESPN+:</p><p>? \"ESPN... provides an interesting test case for over-the-top services, given the unique hold that sports has on its fans.\"</p><p>? \"The question is, what kind of content -- amid such abundance -- merits paying for it?\"</p><p>What we're still wondering: How long til Bob Iger goes all-in on streaming?</p><p>---</p><p>What Next: Pop-Up Magazine -- which brings the magazine storytelling experience to the stage -- has just announced its national Spring Issue tour, with stops in Seattle (April 30 at Benaroya Hall), Oakland (May 10 at the Paramount) and Los Angeles (May 12 at the Theatre at Ace Hotel).

The question now is whether Americans accept this level of monitoring as the new status quo or push lawmakers to enact regulation. As of today, based on the lack of user revolt and the absence of a cohesive congressional plan, regulation appears to be a long ways away.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sign up for PACIFIC: The new CNNMoney newsletter about the center of change and innovation</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">---</p><p>Today's PACIFIC</p><p>Good morning. Mark Zuckerberg is back in California and feeling relieved, per our Facebook sources. He survived Washington relatively unscathed, and Facebook stock is at its highest point since mid-March.</p><p>I'm on tonight's DCA-to-LAX.</p><p>What Silicon Valley is talking about: Google's turn in the spotlight, Apple's new music chief and Elon Musk's new promises ... What Seattle is talking about: The future of brick-and-mortar retail, and Walmart's India move ... What Hollywood is talking about: Les Moonves, Netflix vs. Cannes and new soccer rights ... Plus: Warriors playoff preview ...</p><p>---</p><p>The Trust Crisis: Why Zuck didn't talk data</p><p>In 10+ hours of hearings, Zuckerberg was only once forced to acknowledge that Facebook collects data from users even when they're not on Facebook.</p><p>Why he avoided it:</p><p>? Facebook's data collection is the core of its business. The company brings in $40 billion in advertising revenue annually because it offers brands data that gives them an unparalleled ability to target consumers.</p><p>? Facebook collects data on users and non-users on every site that features a Facebook \"Like\" or \"Share\" button. Facebook states this on its Help page, but Zuckerberg wouldn't say it in front of cameras.</p><p>? Facebook also provides advertisers with a tool called Facebook Pixel, an invisible code that allows both marketers and Facebook to track users' actions.</p><p>If Zuckerberg doesn't want to talk about this issue in front of lawmakers, it may be because he doesn't want to encourage regulation that would curb Facebook's ability to track data on third-party sites.</p><p>Other questions Zuckerberg didn't answer:</p><p>? \"If I delete Facebook, how long will it take for Facebook to purge my data?\"</p><p>? \"Will Facebook do anything about its confusing privacy policy and terms of service?\"</p><p>? \"Is Facebook willing to change its business model?\"</p><p>Mounting scrutiny:</p><p>? \"Here's How Facebook Tracks You When You're Not On Facebook\" by BuzzFeed's Alex Kantrowitz.</p><p>? \"What You Don't Know About How Facebook Uses Your Data\" by NYT's Natasha Singer.</p><p>? \"I downloaded 14 years of my Facebook data and here's what happened\" by CNNMoney's Sara Ashley O'Brien.</p><p>? \"I Downloaded the Information That Facebook Has on Me.

Walmart and Amazon are the leading contenders to play this role in the U.S.\"</p><p>The Latest:</p><p>?

Backstory: FIFA President Gianni Infantino told his board last month that a mystery group of investors from the Middle East and Asia wanted to pay $25 billion to buy an expanded version of FIFA's Club World Cup and create a new global league for national teams.</p><p>? Investors: In addition to SoftBank, the FT reports that the group includes investors from China, Saudi Arabia, the US and the United Arab Emirates.</p><p>The Big Picture, via NYT's Tariq Panja:</p><p>? \"Such an agreement would be unprecedented. FIFA has never sold control of its events to the highest bidder, and never to an investment fund.\"</p><p>? \"Selling the competitions to a third party would also represent a major shift in FIFA's business model, which relies on the sales of tickets, sponsorships and media rights for revenue.\"</p><p>The Other Big Picture: This is huge news for soccer fans, including yours truly. The world's top-flight clubs play at a much higher caliber than national teams. A FIFA Club World Cup could supplant the traditional World Cup as the biggest sporting event in the world.</p><p>---</p><p>Talk of Tinseltown: Netflix vs. Cannes</p><p>Ted Sarandos tells Variety's Ramin Setoodeh that Netflix will not be going to the Cannes Film Festival this year after the hosts banned films without theatrical distribution in France:</p><p>? \"Netflix's chief content officer says that the festival sent a clear message with [the] new rule... Netflix could screen some of its upcoming movies out of competition, but Sarandos says that doesn't make sense for the streaming service.\"</p><p>? Sarandos: \"There's a risk in us going in this way and having our films and filmmakers treated disrespectfully at the festival. They've set the tone. I don't think it would be good for us to be there.\"</p><p>The Big Picture: This is a smart play by Netflix. The new Cannes rule is admirably tr\u00c3\u00a8s fran\u00c3\u00a7ais, but also archaic and woefully out of touch with the new media landscape in which audiences spend more time watching films at home.</p><p>Bonus: Netflix had planned to screen Orson Welles' unfinished film, \"The Other Side of the Wind,\" at the festival. Vanity Fair's Rebecca Keegan now reports that Welles' daughter has made a personal appeal to Sarandos to reconsider his decision.</p><p>Sign up for PACIFIC: The new CNNMoney newsletter about the center of change and innovation</p><p>---</p><p>M&amp;A on Delay: Moonves vs. Redstone, con't</p><p>Negotiations between Viacom and CBS are ongoing after reports that Shari Redstone was ready to fire Les Moonves if the two sides couldn't read a deal.</p><p>The Latest, via my colleague Brian Stelter:</p><p>? \"CBS took the unusual step of issuing a statement defending its CEO: 'The industry and the marketplace know Leslie Moonves' record and we think it speaks for itself.'\"</p><p>? \"Redstone's camp tried to take the temperature down a notch, [saying] \"has tremendous respect for Les Moonves and it has always been our intention that he run a combined company.\"</p><p>---</p><p>The Stream: ESPN+ launches (for real)</p><p>Correction: Yesterday I said ESPN+ was launching yesterday.

The Mercury News' Dieter Kurtenbach says \"the Warriors could not have asked for a better playoff bracket.\"</p><p>? Apple SVP Eddy Cue told me last month that he believes OKC is the biggest threat to Golden State's title ambitions, because of the way the two teams match up (or don't). The way the bracket shakes out now, the Warriors won't play OKC til the Western Conference Finals -- assuming both teams make it that far.</p><p>New at ESPN: \"Everything you need to know about the binge-worthy NBA playoffs.\"</p><p>Bonus: James Harden in GQ.</p><p>---</p><p>What Next: Bill Simmons on the Best NBA-Finals Food Cities.</p><p>See you tomorrow.</p><p>Want this in your inbox every morning?

After the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook sources tell me it will take a Herculean effort to restore public trust in the company's commitment to privacy and data protection. Regulation feels imminent, other Silicon Valley sources say, and yet Mark Zuckerberg appears missing in action.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUBSCRIBE to PACIFIC</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The real scandal? Data exploitation isn't a bug at Facebook, it's a feature.</p><p>Facebook is in the data exploitation business: They make money by harvesting your data and selling it to app developers and advertisers. Indeed, the most alarming aspect of Cambridge Analytica's \"breach\" of 50 million users' data is that it wasn't a breach at all. It happened almost entirely above board and in line with Facebook policy.</p><p>The one rule that Cambridge professor Aleksandr Kogan violated, according to Facebook, was passing user data to third parties, including Cambridge Analytica. But even my Facebook sources acknowledge that it is impossible for the company to completely monitor what developers and advertisers do with the data.</p><p>This is why it is so hard to trust Facebook when they say \"protecting people's information is at the heart of everything we do.\" In fact, Facebook's business is providing people's information to outside parties whose ultimate goals are unknowable.</p><p>If protecting data was truly at the heart of Facebook's business, Facebook wouldn't be in business.</p><p>---</p><p>Today's PACIFIC</p><p>What everyone is talking about: The next shoe to drop in the Facebook-Cambridge crisis, the vanishing Mark Zuckerberg, and the threat of regulation .... What Silicon Valley is talking about: Google retail, Apple screens, and the coming of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ... What Sacramento is talking about: Kamala Harris in Vogue, Jerry Brown in The New Yorker, and Antonio Villaraigosa in trouble ...</p><p>Good morning. Or, for those of our readers who crossed the Pacific for Solina Chau's exclusive tech conference in Tokyo, good night. We hope you enjoyed the view from Prime42. On tomorrow's agenda: Stella McCartney, Will.i.am and Stanford's David Spiegel on the power of hypnosis.</p><p>---</p><p>The Trust Crisis: Facebook under fire</p><p>Sources from Silicon Valley to Capitol Hill say the Cambridge Analytica scandal is likely to accelerate efforts to regulate big tech:</p><p>? Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar has called on Zuckerberg to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee, on which she serves, to explain \"what Facebook knew about misusing data from 50 million Americans in order to target political advertising and manipulate voters.\"</p><p>? A well-placed Senate source tells me lawmakers feel even more emboldened now than they did in the wake of revelations about Russian meddling in the 2016 election.</p><p>? Several tech industry sources said they believe Facebook's missteps could have regulatory ramifications for all major tech companies, especially those like Google and Twitter that rely on the sale of user data.</p><p>Where is Zuck?</p><p>? The Facebook CEO and his top deputies have been conspicuously absent during this crisis. Public statements are being handled by a company lawyer.</p><p>? Zuckerberg's plan to sell off $13 billion worth of shares by mid-2019 to support the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative is drawing new scrutiny from critics who believe it may signal his lack of faith in the company.</p><p>? Damian Collins, a British lawmaker, said Monday that Zuckerberg should \"stop hiding behind his Facebook page and actually come out and answer questions about his company.\"</p><p>Questions for Facebook</p><p>? Why didn't the company disclose this issue to the public when it first learned about it in 2015?</p><p>? How closely did it work with the Trump campaign on data analytics?</p><p>? How can it be trusted to monitor data it sells to others?</p><p>What's next</p><p>? Facebook deputy general counsel Paul Grewal says Facebook is \"conducting a comprehensive internal and external review and are working to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists.\"</p><p>? My colleague Donie O'Sullivan reports that Facebook is looking into ties between one of its current employees and Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>? My colleague Jordan Valinsky emails: \"UK's Channel 4 is scheduled to air an undercover expos\u00c3\u00a9 tonight in which Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix talks openly about how the platform operates.\"</p><p>The Big Picture</p><p>Facebook is already struggling to retain users in the United States. The number of daily active users in the U.S. -- roughly 184 million -- declined for the first time last quarter. Facebook also lost 2.8 million users under the age of 25 last year, and is set to lose another 2 million this year, according to eMarketer.

Today, Andrew Ross Sorkin asks if we are \"witnessing the end of a tech boom.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUBSCRIBE to PACIFIC</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The influential VCs, investors and tech executives I've spoken with over the last 48 hours believe the \"tech crisis\" story is absurd. They say the media is tying together unique setbacks to force a cohesive narrative that, on closer inspection, lacks cohesion:</p><p>? Amazon stock is down after an Axios report that President Trump \"wants to go after\" Jeff Bezos. But none of my sources believe the president is actually capable of forcing meaningful regulation on Amazon. Moreover, his attitude toward Bezos has been well-known since before the election -- even he says so.</p><p>? Nvidia stock is down after the company temporarily suspended testing on its self-driving cars in light of the recent Uber accident that killed a woman in Arizona. But none of my sources believe that means autonomous vehicles aren't in our near-future.</p><p>? Tesla stock is down due in part to the fact that Elon Musk can't hit production targets on the Model 3. That is a very real problem for Tesla, but none of my sources believe investors will stop investing in electric car technology.</p><p>? Facebook stock is down because the company is enduring a very real crisis over very real data privacy concerns. But none of my sources believe those concerns have the power to tank a company with a $450 billion market cap and more than 2 billion users worldwide.</p><p>Sentence of the day, from my colleague Paul R. La Monica: \"Experts say that the Big Tech stocks should eventually bounce back once investors remember how strong their earnings, sales and balance sheets are.\"</p><p>Headline of the day, from my colleagues David Goldman and Kaya Yurieff: \"Now is a great time to buy Amazon\"</p><p>The Big Picture:</p><p>?

We've elected not to do that.\"</p><p>? \"We're not going to traffic in your personal life. Privacy to us is a human right, a civil liberty.\"</p><p>? \"This is not something that we just started last week when we saw something happening.

That number is staggering. It may also be high. Several Hollywood sources in or close to the content acquisition space tell me Amazon probably won't end up spending seven figures on rights to the show.</p><p>? Nevertheless: Amazon is spending big. Last November it spent roughly $250 million on rights -- just the rights -- to Lord of the Rings. By the time you add the cost of producing a single season of the show you're up well north of $500 million.</p><p>How to read it:</p><p>? Amazon is not in the entertainment business. It is in the Prime subscriptions business. Every content play should be seen through that lens.</p><p>? A Hollywood television executive texts: \"It's the equivalent of spending $1 billion on marketing for Prime subscriptions.\"</p><p>The Big Picture: Hollywood is being radically upended by big tech companies with deep pockets that view content acquisition as a means to an end, rather than the end itself. Amazon, Apple and Netflix are driving up the cost of rights, talent and showrunners and making it harder and harder for HBO, Showtime, FX and others to compete.</p><p>Bonus: The Monopoly Money timeline:</p><p>?

DAZN will start with exclusive rights to more than 70 boxing and MMA events and plans to expand to other sports down the line.</p><p>? Perform Group hired Michael Buffer, the man behind the famous \"Let's get ready to rumble\" call, to introduce fight nights.</p><p>Will It Work? It's early days. Sports streaming still pales in comparison to traditional TV, which has multiyear rights to the biggest events.</p><p>But that could change once the rights come up for sale: The first big year will be 2021, when Major League Baseball, NFL's \"Monday Night Football\" and the UEFA Champions League all go up for sale.</p><p>Silicon Valley has a major financial advantage over Hollywood, so if it really wants those rights it can probably get them.</p><p>Oh, and .... Sports rights are likely to become even more valuable now that the Supreme Court has enabled states to legalize sports gambling.</p><p>---</p><p>Today's PACIFIC</p><p>Good morning. Today on Golf Channel: The British Open. Tonight on ABC: The ESPYs.</p><p>Tonight in San Diego: Comic Con, the annual conference for fantasy, sci-fi and comic book fans, kicks off with a media preview. One Hollywood insider describes it as the event \"where a few hundred thousand geeks decide what's big and what's nothing in pop culture for the year ahead.\"</p><p>---</p><p>Brussels Tussle: EU fines Google $5.1b</p><p>The European Union has hit Alphabet's Google with a record $5.1 billion fine for abusing its power in the smartphone market.</p><p>Margrethe Vestager, the EU antitrust chief and the face of Europe's efforts to combat big tech, says Google is disadvantaging competitors by forcing smartphone makers to favor Google search and the Chrome browser over others:</p><p>? \"In this way it has cemented the dominance of its search engine,\" Vestager tweeted. \"Denying rivals a chance to innovate and compete on the merits. It's illegal under EU antitrust rules. @Google now has to stop it\"</p><p>The Big Picture: The EU's aggressive regulation of antitrust, data privacy and other issues has forced big tech to price in fines as the cost of doing business in Europe. Companies like Google can afford the penalties, but as one tech exec told me recently, \"losing billions of dollars never feels good, no matter how much money you have.\"</p><p>What's Next: Google CEO Sundar Pichai says the company will appeal. In a blog post, he argues that the company's operating system has given smartphone makers, app developers and consumers more choice, not less.</p><p>---</p><p>Future of Retail: Walmart wants streaming</p><p>Walmart, which is already at war with Amazon in brick-and-mortar retail and delivery, both at home and abroad, is now in talks to launch a subscription streaming video service to compete with the Amazon Prime Video, The Information reports:</p><p>? Walmart \"sees an opportunity to undercut Netflix and Amazon on price [with] a service priced below $8 per month.\"</p><p>? \"Walmart executives believe their customers, particularly in the middle of America, would be interested in a lower-cost option than what is currently available ... Netflix and Amazon are seen as more popular with people on the [coasts].\"</p><p>The Big Picture: \"Launch of a subscription service would be a major expansion in entertainment. In taking such a step, Walmart would join numerous tech and telecom companies that see TV shows as a way to attract customers.\"</p><p>Bonus: Over at Axios, Sara Fischer notes a larger trend:</p><p>? \"Mass market retailers and grocers are developing their own content and advertising businesses to compete with legacy media:\"</p><p>? \"Ad-serving and video creation has become so democratized that any company with an audience is now able to steal advertising dollars or content budgets away from traditional media companies.\"</p><p>---</p><p>What Hollywood is Reading</p><p>? The Hollywood Reporter's new cover story on entertainment industry jitters in the age of disruption, consolidation and Trump.</p><p>? Variety's new cover story on Steph Curry's foray into Hollywood.</p><p>---</p><p>At The Movies: A 'Skyscraper' theory</p><p>Sonny Bunch, The Washington Free Beacon's executive editor and film critic, says differences between 1988's \"Die Hard\" and 2018's \"Skyscraper\" -- two films with a remarkably similar plot -- tell us how America and the film industry have changed:</p><p>? Militarization: \"Bruce Willis's John McClane was, more or less, your average cop. ... [Dwayne] Johnson's Will Sawyer [is] a member of the elite FBI Hostage Rescue Team, fully militarized and heavily skilled ... a reflection of the way our police forces have been militarized over the past few decades.\"</p><p>? China-fication: \"The action has moved from Los Angeles to China ... a reminder that, for Hollywood ... the foreign market is king now, and even if American stars are still needed to put butts in seats, the real action is overseas.\"</p><p>? Genericization: \"Skyscraper's villain is ... just a bland, inoffensive, apolitical white guy looking to do evil. ... Part of the appeal of Hans Gruber ... in 'Die Hard' was the manner in which he feinted at social relevance, initially posing as a leftist revolutionary.\"</p><p>The Big Picture: \"Skyscraper\" is \"a somewhat depressing sign of our cinematic times: generic action scenes and bland villains with boring motivations, all designed to appeal to a global audience that asks little of its action films.\"</p><p>---</p><p>What Next: Netflix's first look at \"Narcos: Mexico,\" which will launch as a new original series later this year, via THR.</p><p>See you tomorrow.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNMNY-20180718pacific-newsletter1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNMNY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SV1-66W1-JBPX-W3J2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266331</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1077\"/><timeReceived>10:29 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNNMoney.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15302\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 18, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS532282 VIDEO TAPE &amp;

They are also likely to have immeasurable influence over politics, given their spending power and lobbying resources, and culture, given the infiltration of their products and services into nearly every aspect of our lives.</p><p>We believe their power is unlikely to be checked in either country, because the Chinese government supports their rise and the US government isn't going to impose tough regulation right now. We also agree with the McKinsey Global Institute's assessment that these companies have a long-term \"insurmountable advantage\" because of their ability to invest heavily in future technologies like AI and robotics.</p><p>The Latest ...</p><p>\"Tech's Titans Tiptoe Toward Monopoly\" by WSJ's Christopher Mims:</p><p>? Facebook, Alphabet and Amazon are enjoying \"profit margins, market dominance and clout that, according to economists and historians, suggest they're developing into a new category of monopolists.\"</p><p>? \"They may not yet be ripe for such extreme regulatory action, but as they consolidate control of their markets, negative consequences for innovation and competition are becoming evident.\"</p><p>? \"Apple is considered more vulnerable to competitive disruption, despite the fact that it tops the tech world in revenue, profit and market capitalization.\"</p><p>\"Chinese Giants Make America's Look Tame\" by NYT's Raymond Zhong:</p><p>? Tencent and Alibaba \"are ratcheting up their no-holds-barred contest to dominate the ways 770 million internet users communicate, shop, get around, entertain themselves and even invest their savings and visit the doctor.\"</p><p>? \"China's internet titans have a powerful ally [in] the Chinese government. Tencent and Alibaba have avoided antimonopoly clampdowns by staying in Beijing's good graces ... Their sheer size also makes them easier for the authorities to control.\"</p><p>The Big Picture: The new Gilded Age is global, split between tech companies in the world's two biggest economies. As they compete for control of Asia, Africa, Latin America and Europe, their wealth and influence will balloon to levels even more unthinkable than the levels they're at now.</p><p>---</p><p>Today's PACIFIC</p><p>Details about Apple's WWDC conference are continuing to leak ahead of the June 4 keynote. Apple is reportedly working on an initiative called \"Digital Health,\" which enables users to monitor how much time they're spending on their devices. It's also reportedly looking to expand its digital advertising business with a new network for apps.</p><p>Spotted at last night's Warriors-Cavs nail-biter: Apple CEO Tim Cook ... and Apple SVP Eddy Cue, who gave up his usual seats to sit with friend and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver ...</p><p>---</p><p>State of Surveillance: Google to end 'Maven'</p><p>JUST IN: \"Google will not seek another contract for its controversial work providing artificial intelligence to the U.S. Department of Defense for analyzing drone footage after its current contract expires,\" Gizmodo's Kate Conger scoops.</p><p>? \"Google Cloud CEO Diane Greene [told employees] Google would not choose to pursue Maven today because the backlash has been terrible for the company ... adding that the decision was made at a time when Google was more aggressively pursuing military work.\"</p><p>? \"The company plans to unveil new ethical principles about its use of AI next week.\"</p><p>? \"Thousands of employees ... signed a petition asking Google to cancel its contract for the project, nicknamed Project Maven, and dozens of employees have resigned in protest.\"</p><p>The Backstory: The move comes just days after The New York Times that the Maven project was creating internal strife at the company.</p><p>The Big Picture: As we wrote two days ago, the growing public awareness and concern about big tech's government contracts is likely to become a public relations crisis for America's tech giants because that work seems to conflict with their stated moral values.</p><p>Sign up for PACIFIC: The new CNNMoney newsletter about the center of change and innovation</p><p>---</p><p>Zuck Watch: Facebook's next: TV news</p><p>Facebook is on the verge of announcing a new batch of news shows for its Watch platform, per WSJ's Deepa Seetharaman and Lukas Alpert:</p><p>? \"The push for news shows, which will be a mix of daily and weekly formats, is part of Facebook's 'broader push to help reliable information drown out fabricated articles and rumors on the platform.'\"</p><p>? \"Possible shows from Shepard Smith of Fox News, CNN, WSJ, BuzzFeed and NowThis, among others.\"</p><p>? Facebook is financing the shows and asked potential partners \"to detail their ethical standards, including corrections policies, people familiar with the talks said.\"</p><p>Facebook has also announced it will shut down its trending topics section.</p><p>The Big Picture, via my colleague Seth Fiegerman: \"Facebook [is] rethinking how news is presented on its platform after more than a year of criticism over fake news and election meddling.\"</p><p>The Bigger Picture: The majority of US Facebook users use the platform as a source for news and information, according to Pew Research. The Watch feature has immense potential to burnish Facebook's news credibility and expand the reach of media outlets' programming.</p><p>About that shareholder call...</p><p>Facebook shareholders went hard on Zuckerberg and other top Facebook execs over data privacy, election meddling and corporate governance at the company's annual shareholder meeting Thursday.</p><p>Scenes from the Circus, via Fiegerman:</p><p>? Christine Jantz, chief investment officer at NorthStar Asset Management: \"If 'privacy is a human right,' as stated by Microsoft's CEO, then we contend that Facebook's poor stewardship of customer data is tantamount to a human rights violation.\"</p><p>? Another attendee asked if Facebook's board would \"commission a study to evaluate the impact on shareholder value of breaking up Facebook's business line\" given recent regulatory scrutiny into the company's data practices.</p><p>? Outside the meeting space in Menlo Park, California, a group called Freedom From Facebook flew a plane carrying the banner: \"You broke democracy.\"</p><p>---</p><p>Sounding Board: Spotify's long-term problem</p><p>This week at Code Conference I put a very simple question to Spotify founder Daniel Ek about the long-term viability of his company:</p><p>? \"Your biggest competitors are three out of the four biggest market cap companies in the world\" -- Apple, Amazon and Google.</p><p>? \"Fundamentally, the content you're offering is the same.\"</p><p>? \"You don't have a mobile phone, you don't have home devices. So in the longterm, what is to stop Apple, Amazon, Google from basically pushing you out of the market by virtue of the fact that they can bring this music to scale to more people?\"</p><p>Ek:</p><p>? \"Well, I think when you look at that, about the competitive set that we have, I think you could almost universally say that's true about all internet companies.\"</p><p>? \"The way we think about it though, is one of their real important things is that it remains ... that these platforms remains open.\"</p><p>? \"When we compete on equal terms with all of these companies, we tend to do pretty well. So that's our focus, is keeping this platform open because we think it's in the interest of customers and obviously we know that we do well when that's the case.\"</p><p>In other words ... Ek didn't exactly address the question. At some point Apple, Amazon and Google could be able to box Spotify out because they can offer the same content -- music -- to their users in a more seamless way. That, or one of these three companies buys Spotify.</p><p>We have yet to hear a reasonable explanation for why that's not the end game.</p><p>The Big Picture: Even an extraordinarily successful company like Spotify is vulnerable to the overwhelming power of the big tech giants.</p><p>Bonus: Spotify has changed its \"hate conduct and content\" policy, again.</p><p>Sign up for PACIFIC: The new CNNMoney newsletter about the center of change and innovation</p><p>---</p><p>Valinsky's Links</p><p>Softbank looks for its next leader (FT)</p><p>Amazon's AWS fuels its expansion (WSJ)</p><p>Lyft nears its next acquisition (The Information)</p><p>Delta pumps $2 billion into LAX (CNBC)</p><p>Elon Musk rips Boeing (Fortune)</p><p>---</p><p>Retail Wars: Walmart's 'Prime Now'</p><p>What Jeff Bezos is reading: \"Walmart's new startup: Text anything and get it delivered within a day,\" by PACIFIC's Jordan Valinsky:</p><p>? \"The company is launching Jetblack, a new personal shopping service that lets customers order items via a text message with same-day or next-day delivery.\"</p><p>? \"For now, the invite-only service is only available in parts of New York City and costs a hefty $50-a-month.\"</p><p>? \"Walmart is positioning the service for 'time-strapped urban parents' that delivers items from Walmart, Jet, Saks Fifth Avenue and other New York shops.\"</p><p>The Big Picture, via Valinsky: Walmart and Amazon are at war for consumers both at home and abroad. Jetblack is part of Walmart's 'two-Americas' strategy: Promoting non-Walmart branded companies like Jet, Bonobos and ModCloth to attract urban dwellers while boosting its own website with grocery delivery and expanded inventory.</p><p>Sign up for PACIFIC: The new CNNMoney newsletter about the center of change and innovation</p><p>---</p><p>Talk of Tinseltown: Could DOJ beat AT&amp;T?</p><p>The Unconventional Wisdom, via NYT's James B.

That doesn't mean it can't happen.\"</p><p>? \"Looming over this deal are AT&amp;T's size and influence in cable, wireless and satellite communications. ... The heart of the government's case is that AT&amp;T, because of its size and power, can weaponize popular Time Warner content like HBO, CNN and sports programming to harm competitors and ultimately drive up prices.\"</p><p>? \"Being too big and powerful isn't illegal, but it often sets the tone for antitrust actions.\"</p><p>What AT&amp;T and Time Warner say: AT&amp;T-Time Warner isn't too big and powerful if you weigh it against its real competitors, which are in Seattle and Silicon Valley.

From grand strategy to day-to-day implementation, there aren't enough women authoring our future.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Reuters' Jennifer Saba has created a calculator to show how many years it would take Apple, Google and Facebook to achieve gender parity in their workforces if they each committed to making 51% of new hires women: Apple: 15, Google: 14, Facebook: 7.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But: 51% is not the current ratio. Far from it. Which means that without bold leadership on gender parity, we're at least several decades away from a world where tech companies reflect the overall makeup of the labor market.</p><p>What's standing in the way, via Saba:</p><p>? Education: \"Less than one-fifth of computer and information science majors are female,\" according to the National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology.</p><p>?

The report is timed to the release of 'Bad Blood,' a book detailing Theranos' rise and collapse.\"</p><p>---</p><p>Sex Ed: Gates dishes on Trump</p><p>MSNBC's Chris Hayes has obtained footage of Bill Gates speaking to Gates Foundation staff about his interactions with President Trump.</p><p>What he said:</p><p>? Trump left an event \"and 20 minutes later flew in in a helicopter to the same place. So clearly he had been driven away and wanted to make a grand entrance in a helicopter.\"</p><p>? \"When I first talked to him it was actually kind of scary how much he knew about my daughter's appearance. Melinda didn't like that too well.\"</p><p>? In two separate meetings Trump \"asked me if vaccines weren't a bad thing because he was considering a commission to look into ill-effects of vaccines.\" Gates said he told Trump, \"That's a dead end, that would be a bad thing, don't do that.\"</p><p>? In both meetings, Trump \"wanted to know if there was a difference between HIV and HPV. So I was able to explain that those two are rarely confused with each other.\"</p><p>? Trump spoke to Gates in the third person: \"When I first walked in, he said, 'Trump hears that you don't like what Trump is doing.'\"</p><p>The Big Picture: I mean ...</p><p>Sign up for PACIFIC: The new CNNMoney newsletter about the center of change and innovation</p><p>---</p><p>Analog Administration: Trump pushes on Amazon</p><p>President Trump has reportedly pushed the US Postmaster General to double the rate the Postal Service charges Amazon and others to ship packages, despite the fact that the postmaster general herself believes the move is counterintuitive.</p><p>The Washington Post's Damian Paletta and Josh Dawsey scoop:</p><p>? U.S. Postmaster General Megan Brennan \"has so far resisted Trump's demand, explaining in multiple conversations occurring this year and last that these arrangements are bound by contracts and must be reviewed by a regulatory commission.\"</p><p>? \"She has told the president that the Amazon relationship is beneficial for the Postal Service and gave him a set of slides that showed the variety of companies, in addition to Amazon, that also partner for deliveries.\"</p><p>? \"Despite these presentations ...

Musk described the tunnels as \"almost like an autonomous, underground multi-level car system,\" which may eventually number in the thousands.</p><p>? Musk said Boring's machines will be 10 times as fast as existing tunneling machines.</p><p>? Boring is seeking permits for a 2.7-mile tunnel under Sepulveda Boulevard in L.A. It's the first step toward a 60-mile tunnel network across the city.</p><p>? The city government has been receptive, and a city council committee granted the Boring Company an exemption to a state environmental review.</p><p>The Big Picture: As I said yesterday, Musk is part visionary, part P.T. Barnum. The tunnel is a grand vision that could do wonders to alleviate traffic, if it ever comes to fruition. It's also a nice distraction from all of Musk's problems at Tesla.

Barnum. He makes stunning promises and predictions about the future and doesn't always deliver. The tone of the media coverage oscillates accordingly, often depending on whether his most recent rocket launch was a success or a failure. February's Falcon Heavy launch was a high point.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Like production of the Tesla Model 3, coverage of Musk has come down to earth. Every missed deadline, every staff change, every autonomous car crash is covered with intense scrutiny.</p><p>Musk clearly sees the coverage as both sensational and myopic.</p><p>In the last two weeks, he has ...</p><p>? criticized The Washington Post for a story about a Tesla crash: \"It's super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the ~40,000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage.\"</p><p>? criticized Fox Business for reporting that he had hired two Tesla interns: \"Ford has had 3 CEOs in 4 years &amp; no one even knows, but hey Tesla hired some interns!\" (He later deleted the tweet.)</p><p>? criticized Wall Street analysts for asking about capital expenditures and Tesla Model 3 production: \"Boring, bonehead questions are not cool,\" Musk said to one. \"These questions are so dry. They're killing me,\" he said to another.</p><p>Memo to Musk: He's right that one Tesla crash pales in comparison to tens of thousands of fatal auto accidents, but as Jalopnik's Ryan Felton points out, \"it'd be wholly irresponsible to avoid scrutinizing whether [autonomous] technology can perform in the real world.\"</p><p>Musk's dismissal of analysts' concerns is also hard to justify. Musk's visions can't be achieved without financing. Today, Goldman Sachs predicts Tesla will need $10.5 billion in new capital over the next two-and-a-half years to keep operating and meet targets.</p><p>The Big Picture: Musk is a long-term thinker in a short-term world, and his runway is running out. Tesla needs to demonstrate real, tangible progress to convince everyone other than his most bullish investors that he's still a safe bet.</p><p>---</p><p>Welcome to PACIFIC</p><p>Musk is listening to Grimes.</p><p>What's Next: Musk will hold an event here in L.A. tonight to discuss The Boring Company's plans for the city, including a plan to link Boring's Hyperloop with SpaceX's rockets and get people anywhere on earth in under an hour.</p><p>Last night, it took me an hour to get from Venice to Hollywood.</p><p>Sign up for PACIFIC: The new CNNMoney newsletter about the center of change and innovation</p><p>---</p><p>Beijing Rising: The Big Picture: US-China</p><p>President Trump is meeting with China's top trade official Liu He today.</p><p>If you care half as deeply as we do about China's technological rise and what it means for the future of the world, please, please read Keith Bradsher's big-picture take on US-China trade relations in today's New York Times.</p><p>Highlights:</p><p>? The US and China \"are seeking nothing less than a fundamental rethinking of a trade relationship that encompasses more than $700 billion in goods and services that flow between the countries every year.\"</p><p>? \"The plans being developed in Beijing and Washington anticipate a time when the economic engines of China and the United States are not so closely linked, particularly in high-tech industries.\"</p><p>? \"The focus on disengagement reflect broader political realities. China is rapidly building a world-class navy; conducting military exercises in Africa and off the shores of northern Europe; and developing some of the world's most advanced stealth fighter planes and ballistic missiles. The military muscle-flexing has caused alarm in Washington and directly influenced trade policy.\"</p><p>Flashback: PACIFIC, May 4, 2018:</p><p>? \"Some of the brightest minds I talk to in tech believe we are headed toward a bipolar future where the United States and China close their tech markets to one another and fight for conquest of the rest of the world, like a game of Risk.\"</p><p>? \"There will be an American and a Chinese version of everything -- an Amazon and an Alibaba; a Google and a Baidu; an Uber and a Didi Chuxing -- and each pair will compete for rights to Asia, Africa, Latin America and Europe.\"</p><p>? \"Tech dominance will be how the US and China establish political and economic influence over the rest of the world. The lines of the new geopolitical map will be drawn by tech companies, on a country-by-country basis. Longstanding political and military alliances will shift due to new economic considerations.\"</p><p>What's Next: \"Amazon Brings Cross-Border Ambitions to Alibaba's Backyard,\" by Bloomberg's Spencer Soper:</p><p>? \"In the coming weeks, Amazon will host an event in the city of Hangzhou -- Alibaba's hometown -- to connect online merchants with 400 Chinese manufacturers keen to sell ... directly to American and European consumers.\"</p><p>? \"The gathering is part of Amazon's effort to evolve from an e-commerce platform into a global logistics operation. The idea is to help Amazon merchants connect directly with manufacturers in China.\"</p><p>? \"Speedy delivery helped Amazon dominate e-commerce in the U.S., and the company wants to do the same globally to fend off Alibaba ... EBay ... and Wish.\"</p><p>---</p><p>What Jeff Bezos Is Reading</p><p>\"Walmart's online sales grow 33%,\" by CNNMoney's Nathaniel Meyersohn: \"Digital sales jumped 33% last quarter ... Walmart expects that number to increase 40% for the entire year as CEO Doug McMillon scrambles to refit the world's largest brick-and-mortar retailer for the digital era.\"</p><p>---</p><p>Bird on the Hill: Jack Dorsey in D.C.</p><p>Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey met with Sen. Mark Warner today to discuss Russia's election meddling efforts and potential regulation on political advertising and data privacy, a source with knowledge of the meeting tells me. They also talked about GDPR and German hate speech law.</p><p>The Senate Intelligence Committee's ranking Democrat has been leading the charge to regulate tech companies. When I interviewed him last month he laid out four ideas for potential regulation, all of which he discussed with Dorsey today, per the source.</p><p>Those four ideas are:</p><p>? 1. Forcing tech companies to assume responsibility for content.</p><p>? 2. Forcing tech companies to warn users about foreign actors.</p><p>? 3. Giving users easy ownership of their data.</p><p>? 4. Giving users financial compensation for their data.</p><p>Warner also believes Congress and big tech are not moving fast enough to prevent foreign meddling from happening in 2018 and 2020. \"If we don't put some framework around this, bad stuff is going to happen,\" he told me.</p><p>Sign up for PACIFIC: The new CNNMoney newsletter about the center of change and innovation</p><p>---</p><p>The Trust Crisis: What's Worse: Facebook or Google?</p><p>What Menlo Park and Mountain View are reading: NYT's Brian Chen downloaded a file containing all the data Google had on him and compared it with all the data Facebook had collected on him.</p><p>Chen's findings:</p><p>? \"My Google data archive was much larger than my Facebook file ? about 12 times larger, in fact ? but it was also packed with fewer unpleasant surprises.\"</p><p>? \"Most of what I saw in my Google file was information I already knew I had put in there ... while my Facebook data contained a list of 500 advertisers with my contact information and a permanent record of friends I thought I had 'deleted' years ago, among other shockers.\"</p><p>---</p><p>Top links via PACIFIC's Jordan Valinsky</p><p>Google announces YouTube Music, Premium (Verge)</p><p>Amazon will rule the world with Whole Foods (CNNMoney)</p><p>Tencent's WeChat hits a billion monthly users (Bloomberg)</p><p>Apple brings coding to the deaf and blind (Engadget)</p><p>Uber airs ads to improve its reputation (FastCo)</p><p>---</p><p>CBS vs. Viacom: Les loses, Shari wins</p><p>Les Moonves has lost his lawsuit attempting to remove Shari Redstone's control over CBS, a win for Redstone as she tries to merge CBS and Viacom.</p><p>What's Next:</p><p>? My colleague Brian Stelter says CBS has vowed \"to keep fighting.\"</p><p>? Recode's Ed Lee says Moonves will likely take Redstone back to court.</p><p>The Big Picture: Moonves and Redstone are fighting to best position themselves for acquisitions later down the line. Moonves believes CBS is more valuable without Viacom, Redstone believes Viacom is more valuable with CBS.</p><p>The Bigger Picture: We often talk about media mergers and acquisitions as a game of scale. For CBS and Viacom, it's really a game of self preservation, as tech companies seize control of the means of distribution and reduce the influence of old school media companies.</p><p>Sign up for PACIFIC: The new CNNMoney newsletter about the center of change and innovation</p><p>---</p><p>Talk of Tinseltown: Amazon lands Peele drama</p><p>Amazon Studios has landed rights to \"The Hunt,\" a drama series about Nazi hunters by \"Get Out\" writer-director Jordan Peele.</p><p>Deadline's Nellie Andreeva has the exclusive:</p><p>? \"This marks the first new scripted series pickup for Amazon since Jennifer Salke took the reins as head of Amazon Studios.\"</p><p>? \"The Hunt follows a diverse band of Nazi Hunters living in 1977 New York City [who] have discovered that hundreds of high ranking Nazi officials are living among us and conspiring to create a Fourth Reich in the U.S.\"</p><p>The Big Picture: Amazon, Apple and Netflix are paying top dollar for the best content, talent and showrunners, building up their content portfolios at the expense of old Hollywood.</p><p>---</p><p>What Next: The Information's Beejoli Shah takes a deep dive into BuzzFeed's Hollywood adventure.</p><p>See you tomorrow.</p><p>Sign up for PACIFIC: The new CNNMoney newsletter about the center of change and innovation</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNMNY-20180517pacific-newsletter1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNMNY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SBT-0TS1-DY60-K09F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266331</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1625\"/><timeReceived>3:33 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNNMoney.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15302\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 17, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS523930 INVESTMENT ADVICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS523920 PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS523110 INVESTMENT BANKING &amp;

If the bills pass the Assembly, they will then move on to the Senate and come one step closer to becoming law.</p><p>However, the package has gone through significant changes during committee process -- with some pieces of legislation remaining largely unscathed, while others have been tabled or substantially altered.</p><p>The initiative when initially introduced consisted of five pieces of legislation:</p><p>* One of the more prominent bills within the package would create a corporate notification requirement relative to data breaches. The bill, introduced by Assemblyman Chad Mayes, originally would have asked that companies notify consumers within 72 hours of a data breach. However, the bill's text now gives companies a window of 45 days to notify affected consumers. This would still put tighter restrictions on companies, which, according to current California laws, must notify consumers \"in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay.\" The bill recently exited the P&amp;CP Committee and will be voted on in the House.</p><p>* A bill that would have allowed consumers to request that social media companies delete their personal data after they had closed their accounts has been pulled from consideration. The bill would have also prohibited companies from \"selling that information to, or exchanging that information with, a third party in the future, subject to specified exceptions.\" The bill, which was introduced by Assemblyman Jordan Cunningham, was pulled from consideration in the P&amp;CP Committee and has instead been converted into a \"two-year bill,\" which means Cunningham will continue to do work on it with the hope of reintroducing it next year. \"He is committed to continuing to work on that bill over the course of this year,\" said Nick Mirman, legislative aide to Cunningham. \"It's been tabled for the rest of this year and we plan on continuing to work with stakeholders to craft a bill that accomplishes the same goals that the Assemblyman has.\"</p><p>* The \"Anti-Eavesdropping Act,\" also sponsored by Cunningham, would curb the kind of data collection that tech companies can conduct through smart devices like Amazon Alexa or a Google Home device. The bill would ban companies from storing and selling data collected through voice commands without written consent from individual consumers. The bill recently exited the P&amp;CP Committee and is expected to be voted on \"in the next few weeks,\" said Mirman.</p><p>* The \"Family Green Light Bill\" is being sponsored by Assemblyman James Gallagher and would require social media companies to receive a parent or guardian's permission before a child under the age of 16 could use their platforms. The point of the bill is to give parents greater control over the amount of social media they are exposed to, Cunningham said in an interview with Techwire. The legislation recently exited the Committee on Appropriations and is currently on the Assembly floor and will be voted on in the coming weeks, said a representative of Gallagher's office.</p><p>* A non-binding resolution on \"21st Century Monopolies\" had been announced as part of the bill package that would have called on Congress and the Federal Trade Commission to update federal anti-trust laws to be more effective -- with a particular eye toward reining in big tech companies. However, the language within the resolution has yet to be clarified, according to Cunningham. \"We're still working on the language of it,\" he said. \"We're trying to build a broad coalition and get a consensus and be thoughtful about it. ... Monopolistic behavior, like all large aggregations of power, historically is really bad for the little guy and the public.\"</p><p>The initiative's larger goal to augment and hone the regulatory framework put forth by the CCPA is an important one, according to Cunningham.</p><p>\"I was proud to vote for it,\" Cunningham said of the CCPA during an interview with Government Technology, while also noting that he felt it was \"passed in quite a hurry. ...There are some issues that need to be cleaned up. ...We need to make sure that we're narrowly tailoring [the legislation] to the problem. But it's a strong law -- it's stronger than anything we have federally.\"</p><p>Ultimately, Cunningham said, he felt that privacy was an issue that both sides of the political spectrum could come together on.</p><p>\"Privacy is a very bipartisan -- I would even say nonpartisan -- issue,\" he said. \"I'm very thankful to have colleagues on both sides of the aisle willing to take on this fight. There are some very well-financed groups that have a lot of clout that have thus far opposed these bills, but I'm willing always to collaborate with anybody to accomplish the goal.\"</p><p>Lucas Ropek is a staff writer for Government Technology.

If the bills pass the Assembly, they will then move on to the Senate and come one step closer to becoming law.</p><p>However, the package has gone through significant changes during committee process -- with some pieces of legislation remaining largely unscathed, while others have been tabled or substantially altered.</p><p>The initiative when initially introduced consisted of five pieces of legislation:</p><p>* One of the more prominent bills within the package would create a corporate notification requirement relative to data breaches. The bill, introduced by Assemblyman Chad Mayes, originally would have asked that companies notify consumers within 72 hours of a data breach. However, the bill's text now gives companies a window of 45 days to notify affected consumers. This would still put tighter restrictions on companies, which, according to current California laws, must notify consumers \"in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay.\" The bill recently exited the P&amp;CP Committee and will be voted on in the House.</p><p>* A bill that would have allowed consumers to request that social media companies delete their personal data after they had closed their accounts has been pulled from consideration. The bill would have also prohibited companies from \"selling that information to, or exchanging that information with, a third party in the future, subject to specified exceptions.\" The bill, which was introduced by Assemblyman Jordan Cunningham, was pulled from consideration in the P&amp;CP Committee and has instead been converted into a \"two-year bill,\" which means Cunningham will continue to do work on it with the hope of reintroducing it next year. \"He is committed to continuing to work on that bill over the course of this year,\" said Nick Mirman, legislative aide to Cunningham. \"It's been tabled for the rest of this year and we plan on continuing to work with stakeholders to craft a bill that accomplishes the same goals that the Assemblyman has.\"</p><p>* The \"Anti-Eavesdropping Act,\" also sponsored by Cunningham, would curb the kind of data collection that tech companies can conduct through smart devices like Amazon Alexa or a Google Home device. The bill would ban companies from storing and selling data collected through voice commands without written consent from individual consumers. The bill recently exited the P&amp;CP Committee and is expected to be voted on \"in the next few weeks,\" said Mirman.</p><p>* The \"Family Green Light Bill\" is being sponsored by Assemblyman James Gallagher and would require social media companies to receive a parent or guardian's permission before a child under the age of 16 could use their platforms. The point of the bill is to give parents greater control over the amount of social media they are exposed to, Cunningham said in an interview with Techwire. The legislation recently exited the Committee on Appropriations and is currently on the Assembly floor and will be voted on in the coming weeks, said a representative of Gallagher's office.</p><p>* A non-binding resolution on \"21st Century Monopolies\" had been announced as part of the bill package that would have called on Congress and the Federal Trade Commission to update federal anti-trust laws to be more effective -- with a particular eye toward reining in big tech companies. However, the language within the resolution has yet to be clarified, according to Cunningham. \"We're still working on the language of it,\" he said. \"We're trying to build a broad coalition and get a consensus and be thoughtful about it. ... Monopolistic behavior, like all large aggregations of power, historically is really bad for the little guy and the public.\"</p><p>The initiative's larger goal to augment and hone the regulatory framework put forth by the CCPA is an important one, according to Cunningham.</p><p>\"I was proud to vote for it,\" Cunningham said of the CCPA during an interview with Government Technology, while also noting that he felt it was \"passed in quite a hurry. ...There are some issues that need to be cleaned up. ...We need to make sure that we're narrowly tailoring [the legislation] to the problem. But it's a strong law -- it's stronger than anything we have federally.\"</p><p>Ultimately, Cunningham said, he felt that privacy was an issue that both sides of the political spectrum could come together on.</p><p>\"Privacy is a very bipartisan -- I would even say nonpartisan -- issue,\" he said. \"I'm very thankful to have colleagues on both sides of the aisle willing to take on this fight. There are some very well-financed groups that have a lot of clout that have thus far opposed these bills, but I'm willing always to collaborate with anybody to accomplish the goal.\"</p><p>Lucas Ropek is a staff writer for Government Technology.

Expect the staff to be trained and professionally certified. You'd have similar expectations on college, schools, women's shelters, or other state-run facilities, wouldn't you?<br/>Women and girls receive \"misinformation and manipulation\" on an extraordinary scale in \"pregnancy crisis centers\" around the world.<br/>See. In a new report, global news site openDemocracy reveals how women and girls receive \"misinformation and manipulation\" on an extraordinary scale in \"pregnancy crisis centers\" (CPCs) around the world.<br/><br/>Backed by powerful American activists with close ties to President Donald Trump's administration, and often with an air of health clinics, many of these centers claim to offer unbiased \"advice\" to pregnant women. In fact, staff aim to deter women from having legal abortions and, in some cases, access to contraception.<br/><br/>In the first research of its kind, openDemocracy mapped the global spending, networks, and activities of two influential anti-abortion groups based in the United States, Heartbeat International and Human Life International. Together, they have invested $13 million worldwide since 2007 and have funded and trained hundreds of organizations globally.<br/><br/>We sent covert reporters, who presented theself as vulnerable pregnant women, to Heartbeat-affiliated CPCs in 18 countries, where they consistently received markedly misleading and false information, such as \"abortion can increase Cancer risks,\" \"a woman needs her partner's consent to have an abortion,\" \"hospitals will not treat medical complications, \" or \"women will suffer a post-abortion syndrome.\" All that, clearly, false.<br/><br/>We also send a reporter to receive training in Heartbeat, available online or in person. Our reporter was taught to encourage women to delay abortion and emergency contraception. In training, they also say that condoms are not effective at preventing pregnancy and that women should be informed that abortion increases the risk of abuse of other children and could \"return\" homosexuals to their partners.<br/><br/>In the United States, there are thousands of CPCs. After the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Roe vs. Wade who legalized abortion throughout the territory, Heartbeat was one of many groups that expanded a model that began in response to the liberalization of state abortion laws in the 1960s.<br/><br/>Their CPCs have often been challenged in the United States for presenting theself as neutral health institutions, when they truly hide their anti-abortion and religious agendas from women seeking help. But, until now, the overall scale of these activities had not been mapped.<br/><br/>The power and influence of American religious conservatives in Latin America and Africa are well known. As a result of the draconian anti-abortion restrictions they have supported, women have been imprisoned for miscarriages and thousands die from unsafe abortions each year.<br/>                In Uganda, our journalist was told that she could never \"truly\" love and care for a child after an abortion, and that she may have difficulty reconceiving. In Argentina, a journalist who claimed to be in an abusive relationship was told, \"Now, you're a victim, but an abortion would make you part of that violence since you will be violent.\"<br/><br/>However, the scale of these operations in Europe has surprised legislators, doctors and health experts. We discovered more than 400 PCCs affiliated with Heartbeat in Italy alone, and dozens more in Spain, Croatia, Serbia, Romania and Ukraine.<br/><br/>At a CPC inside a hospital in Lombardy, our reporter was told that having a baby can cure leukemia. In Spain, she was given books and articles stating that abortion causes mental health disorders and heart attacks. She was also warned that female abortions are \"144% more likely\" to abuse their children.<br/><br/>The organizations that run these centers have received funding from Heartbeat and participated in face-to-face training. They also receive public funds and political backing: in Italy, far-right leader Matteo Salvini; in Spain, from the far-right Party Vox.<br/><br/>Neil Datta, secretary of the European Parliamentary Forum for Sexual and Reproductive Rights, finds it highly \"disturbing\" that foreign groups are \"proactively trying to deprive women of their legal rights... deliberately deceiving them.\" He calls it \"a rule of legal issue.\" No legislator, no matter your position on abortion, should stand aside while \"deviating your country's laws through misinformation, emotional manipulation, and resounding deception that specifically target pregnant women.\"<br/><br/>What can be done? Revealingly, openDemocracy reporters did not receive these extreme falsehoods when they visited CPCs in North America. In the United States, Heartbeat has a \"commitment to care\" that promises that women will always receive \"accurate information,\" including about abortion and contraception, and with advertising and communication that are \"truthful and honest, and accurately describe the services\" they offer.<br/><br/>While many of Heartbeat's global affiliates clearly do not follow these rules, it appears that legal pressure and increased scrutiny in the United States has had some effect, despite strong protections of U.S. freedom of expression. This means that there is certainly room for more ambitious action in the European Union. It may not be right for most EU countries to require a license to sell vitamins, but not to practice ultrasound on a pregnant woman. All countries we investigate have laws or regulations that prohibit false or misleading advertising of goods or services; however, we find no evidence of legal lawsuits against CPCs under these rules outside the United States.<br/><br/>There are obvious measures that can be taken in countries such as Italy, where national and regional legislators must urgently ban CPCs from public hospitals and essentially improve the provision of precise science-based advice, education and health care services for women and girls. The catastrophic lack of these services in Italy has created a vacuum that some religious conservatives have skillfully filled. In particular, many of thepatients who saw our reporters in the Italian CPCs were Roma (gypsies) women and migrants; in the same way, in Spain, we see Latin American migrants in financial distress.<br/><br/>Other countries have made some efforts. In 2017, France made it a crime to provide women with false information about abortion, although there have not yet been cases under this law, and rights advocacy groups question their effectiveness. The same year, Ireland submitted proposals for a new law aimed at regulating advisers, after journalists discovered that staff at a CPC told women that abortion causes cancer, among other fakes. But these legislative proposals are now paralyzed.<br/><br/>There is, and rightly so, a lot of discussion in Brussels and in European capitals about how to combat fake online news and curb the power of big tech makers. But the toxic spread of offline disinformation is certainly even more insidious and influential. Are you more likely to believe something you're being told in a hospital or that you hear from a trusted community member, or a facebook ad?<br/><br/>What openDemocracy's research discovered is probably the tip of the iceberg. Heartbeat and Human Life International are part of a wider universe of anti-abortion evangelists targeting vulnerable women and girls around the world. We have uncovered evidence targeting hundreds of CPCs in other countries, from czech republic to Kenya. The model is cheap, often dependent on well-meaning volunteers, and easy to replicate. It's disinformation on a global scale. Europe must take the lead and put a brake on it.<br/><br/>Mary Fitzgerald: editor-in-chief of openDemocracy.<br/><br/>\u00a9 Project Syndicate 1995\u20132020<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CELAME-57867</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CELAME2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:606C-GF81-DY1R-B214-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470872</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1305\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 ContentEngineLLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Latin America Migration English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 14, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

Pai asked Friday whether tweets from Iran Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei violate platform rules about glorifying violence, rules that Twitter cited in flagging Trump.</p><p>Trump tweeted about the death of George Floyd and riots in Minneapolis. Trump wrote: \"These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won't let that happen. Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!\" The White House quoted the president's remark in another tweet, which Twitter also flagged.</p><p>Twitter took action to prevent \"others from being inspired to commit violent acts, but have kept the Tweet on Twitter because it is important that the public still be able to see the Tweet given its relevance to ongoing matters of public importance,\" a spokesperson emailed. Users can no longer like, reply or retweet the tweets in question, but they can retweet with comment.</p><p>Trump signed his social media executive order Thursday. Pai said: \"This debate is an important one. The Federal Communications Commission will carefully review any petition for rulemaking filed by the Department of Commerce.\"</p><p>FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr welcomed the EO, saying he looks forward to NTIA's petition. NTIA didn't comment. Carr welcomed Trump's call for guidance on Communications Decency Act Section 230, which he described as \"legal privileges that Congress conferred on social media companies\" but on no other speakers: \"Internet giants and social media companies now benefit from those Section 230 protections when other speakers do not. Yet the federal government has provided virtually no guidance on the 'good faith' limitation Congress included in Section 230.\"</p><p>Commissioner Geoffrey Starks said he will review the EO and voiced support to bridge the digital divide through quality, affordable broadband. Asked whether he has reviewed the EO, his office didn't comment Friday.</p><p>\"The FTC is committed to robust enforcement of consumer protection and competition laws,\" emailed a spokesperson Friday. That's \"including with respect to social media platforms, and consistent with our jurisdictional authority and constitutional limitations.\"</p><p>Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, defended the president and blasted Big Tech, saying industry stifles free speech and shapes what \"Americans see, hear, &amp; ultimately think about the major issues facing our country.\" Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., also sided with the president, saying Big Tech has manipulated 230 to create its behavioral advertising machine, which has led to dominance and monopolies. He asked why Twitter hasn't targeted Chinese officials for spreading misinformation about the U.S. role in the origin of COVID-19. Hawley and Trump ally Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., separately discussed writing legislation to limit Section 230 protections for the tech industry. Hawley accused Twitter of editorializing user posts, and Gaetz claimed election interference from Twitter.</p><p>House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said it's sad Trump used an EO \"for political grievance\" over an \"ego bruised.\" The EO lacks any substantive policy, he said, criticizing Trump for frequently engaging in \"dangerous misinformation.\" Thompson noted social media companies need to \"do their part to stem the tide of misinformation and extremist content on their sites.\"</p><p>Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., called the EO a \"blatant attempt to use the full power of the United States government to force private companies to lie for the President.\" He condemned Trump for attempting to \"suborn\" the FTC into his \"condemnable campaigns.\" Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., saying the EO is a \"sad distraction,\" called for common sense regulation that's \"desperately needed\" for platforms. He blasted Trump for threatening \"retaliation if they try to reign in the disinformation, targeted harassment, and voter suppression taking place on their platforms.\"</p><p>The National Religious Broadcasters welcomed the order, saying it started an \"important conversation about the threats posed by powerful social media companies that often censor opinions with which they disagree.\" Big Tech's \"viewpoint suppression\" is real, said CEO Troy Miller, saying the tech industry should adopt \"a free speech charter that 'utilizes the wisdom of the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment.'\" He said he hopes industry will make voluntary changes.</p><p>The EO \"reflects a deep misunderstanding\" of the section's purpose and ignores a \"quarter century of judicial precedent\" establishing it as \"affording broad protections to online platforms, including when they moderate, in whatever ways they see fit, the third-party content that they host,\" WilmerHale media/entertainment litigator Patrick Carome emailed. \"The discretion that platforms may choose to exercise in this context is not something the government may regulate without violating the First Amendment.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6026-9951-JC8G-8003-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"852\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 01, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

According to the government's statement on February 25, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) will undertake an \"extensive and broad based consultation process with all relevant segments of civil society and technology companies\". It is significant that the consultation is happening after the Rules have been notified, that is, put into effect. It is not clear how the consultation will help at this stage. We have reached out to the Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication for comment. The New York Times first reported this development.</p><p><br/><br/>This was done at the direction of Prime Minister Imran Khan. Called the Citizens Protection (Against Online Harm) Rules, 2020, the Rules called for content takedowns within 24 hours, take down of accounts of Pakistani citizens outside Pakistan for spreading fake news, labelling of false content, sharing information with the Investigation Agency, data localisation, mandating physical office in Pakistan, and appointment of a National Coordinator to oversee regulation of social media. Read a summary of the rules here.<br/><br/>The American Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs tweeted that \"New restrictions on social media platforms in #Pakistan could be setback to freedom of expression &amp; development of digital econ. Unfortunate if Pakistan discourages foreign investors &amp; stifles domestic innovation in such a dynamic sector. Encourage discussion w/ stakeholders\". This statement came after the Pakistani government decided to hold a consultation. Global Network Initiative (GNI), a multistakeholder organisation, has welcomed this decision to hold a consultation.<br/><br/>The Rules had come under intense criticism from the global and Pakistani businesses and civil society for impinging on people's privacy and freedom of expression. Digital Rights Foundation, based in Pakistan, had also criticised the Rules as they \"severely restrict the freedom of expression and privacy of Pakistani citizens in online spaces\".<br/><br/>Asia Internet Coalition (AIC), which includes Google, Facebook, Apple, LinkedIn, Amazon, etc. as its members, had written to Prime Minister Khan that these Rules would \"severely cripple the growth of Pakistan's digital economy\" as it would make it difficult for AIC members to offer services to Pakistani users and businesses. It had problems with the policy making process itself and urged the government to initiate a proper public consultation \"to ensure wider participation to develop a new set of rules\".<br/><br/>Pakistan Software Houses Association for IT &amp; ITES (P@SHA), the country's only IT and ITES trade association, had said that these rules would \"adversely affect Pakistan's IT sector growth and its fledgling e-commerce industry\" and criticised the fact that these rules were drafted without engagement and consultation with the IT industry and other stakeholders.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MEDNMA-0051934212</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MEDNMA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y9N-BBP1-DXMP-K1H9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">373690</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"507\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Media Nama, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Media Nama</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 28, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;
