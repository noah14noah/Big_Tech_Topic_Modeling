Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in a report in November wrote, quote: We expect the drag from the trade war to fade gradually although much could go wrong. We now expect a phase one agreement signed in coming weeks, end quote.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But after the president said yesterday, there may not be a trade deal until after the 2020 elections.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mike Ferally (ph) at J.P. Morgan said, quote: We never swung all the way to thinking trade peace was breaking out. It`s not like we have to do a big pivot here.</p><p>Goldman has a more upbeat 2020 outlook at 2.3 percent. J.P. Morgan not banking on trade peace, only 1-1/2 percent. UBS, most pessimistic of all at just above 1 percent.</p><p>We contacted a half dozen economists after the president`s comments, most have just about had it with taking out the erasers. On average, they see the fourth quarter of this year and first quarter of next as the bottom of the slowdown.</p><p>Growth is seen ramping up to 2 percent by the end of the next year. In general, economists are inclined to assume the worst on trade and be pleasantly surprised if they`re wrong.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: And then there`s housing, a pillar of the economy and probably your most valuable asset. A new report tonight paints an unexpectedly harsh picture for the market next year.</p><p>And it got the attention of prospect of buyers, sellers, home owners and investors.</p><p>Here is Diana Olick.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Almost everything is in place for a strong start to 2020 housing market -- growing demand, a stable job market and low mortgage rates. But one critical thing is missing. Enough homes for sale.</p><p>GEORGE RATIU, REALTOR.COM SENIOR ECONOMIST: We`re running out of product to sell. So, if you can`t sell it, obviously, even with demand, prices don`t have anywhere to go.</p><p>OLICK: Realtor.com is forecasting a slowdown for housing next year, and a potential record low supply of available homes. Low inventory will cause sales to drop just under 2 percent from this year and home prices will flatten nationally. As millennials who will account for half the buying market struggle to afford overheated prices.</p><p>RATIU: What they do find in terms of product, they have all upper end for new product. The only existing inventory that they can really enter at is the existing home sales pipeline. And there, they are basically running out of products.</p><p>OLICK: In some major markets, realtor.com is predicting prices could go negative, the first time that`s happened since the housing crash. Those cities include Chicago, Dallas, Las Vegas, Miami, Detroit, St. Louis and San Francisco. With home values weakening, sellers will have little incentive to put their homes on the market because nobody wants to catch a falling knife. That will only weaken supplies further.</p><p>Home construction is increasing and the forecast is for a 6 percent annual gain. But so far, it has largely been on the upper end of the market, not at the entry level where demand is strongest.</p><p>The only good news in this report is that mortgage rates should remain low. But low rates will only help if consumer confidence in housing is high.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick in Austin.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BILL GRIFFETH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Time to look at some of today`s \"Upgrades and Downgrades\".</p><p>We only have two for you tonight. First, Marvell Technology downgraded to market perform from outperform at BMO Capital. The analyst says that the semiconductor maker stock is reasonably valued right now. Price target, $28. That stock fell about 5 percent today to $23.92.</p><p>And Owens Corning (NYSE:OC) (NYSE:GLW) was downgraded to neutral from buy at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch. The analyst says that the long rumored breakup of the fiber glass company is not likely in the near term. Price target, $72. Shares fell a fraction today to $65.43.</p><p>HERERA: Still ahead, United Airlines places a multibillion-dollar jet order and it`s a blow to Boeing (NYSE:BA).</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: The White House is changing work requirements for some food stamp recipients. The new rules make it more difficult for states to waive requirements that able-bodied adults without children work at least 20 hours a week or risk losing bifurcates. Critics say that that could make hundreds of thousands ineligible for the program. But the administration says it will get more people into workforce.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SONNY PERDUE, SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE: What we`re doing here, people have to work 20 hours a week or volunteer 20 hours a week or be in job training for 20 hours a week. What we want to do is increase employment. We need these people in the workforce.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH: The rules take effect in April of next year.</p><p>HERERA: European plane maker Airbus announced a major order of its new long range airplane. The buyer is United Airlines, which is purchasing 50 of the jets. It`s an order Boeing (NYSE:BA) could not compete with as it tackles a number of issues, including the grounding of the 737 MAX.</p><p>Phil LeBeau has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: United Airlines is turning to Airbus for its next generation of planes, to fly between the East Coast of the U.S. and destinations in Europe. The airline is buying 50 Airbus A321XLR planes. First flight, 2024.</p><p>United did not place an order for long-range planes with Boeing (NYSE:BA), in part because Boeing (NYSE:BA) does not have a model that fits United`s needs. Earlier this year, Airline executives expected Boeing (NYSE:BA) CEO Dennis Muilenburg to announce plans for a in new long range model. That never happened, due in part to the grounding of the 737 MAX, which had become the primary focus for the company.</p><p>So, airlines like American will fly the new Airbus planes, between destinations that are further apart like the U.S. to Europe where U.S. carriers are battling foreign airlines who get higher marks in a new survey of travelers flying from North America to Europe and Asia.</p><p>To Europe, those surveyed by JD Power ranked Turkish Airlines first, then Virgin Atlantic, British Airways and Delta tied for third.</p><p>A big reason some airlines ranked higher than others for international trips, what they serve passengers.</p><p>MICHAEL TAYLOR, J.D. POWER: The food and beverage service is actually a little bit more important to the satisfaction. And that`s really because food and beverages interaction between, you know, the airline and the staff that`s in the aircraft itself --</p><p>LEBEAU: Those flying to Asia put Japan Airlines at the top, followed by Delta, Korean Air and the Japanese carrier ANA.</p><p>JD Power says U.S. airlines are not far behind the foreign competitors when it comes to flights to Europe and Asia, and they could further improve as Delta, American and United make further investments in their international routes.</p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: And we`re learning that Boeing`s chief engineer who led Boeing`s response to the crashes is retiring.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Last night, we told you about the transition of power at Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) parent company Alphabet. Gaggle cofounder Sergey Brin and Larry Page are stepping back. And current Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) CEO Sundar Pichai is also going to be become the parent -- the CEO of the parent company Alphabet.</p><p>And as Deirdre Bosa reports now, the new boss faces a list of challenges.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DEIRDRE BOSA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: It`s the end of an era at one of tech`s biggest and most successful companies.</p><p>Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin are handing over the reins to engineer-turned-manager Sundar Pichai. Pichai has already been overseeing the company`s core business as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) CEO but now as Alphabet CEO, is he ready to take the company into the next decade, one that is fraught with more challenges and threats than ever?</p><p>Regulatory battles in the U.S. and Europe are brewing. Employee activism is on the rise. And privacy practices are under fire.</p><p>Now, Pichai is relatively untested when it comes to the type of battles other big tech CEOs like Facebook`s Mark Zuckerberg and Apple`s Tim Cook have been fighting.</p><p>Another challenge for Pichai could be actual control. While he gets the full CEO title, Larry Page and Sergey Brin are still Alphabet`s biggest individual shareholders, they still retain control through their majority voting power.</p><p>Day to day, not a lot is changing in Alphabet. Pichai will continue to run Google`s most important and profitable businesses, while now also overseeing its more ambitious moon shot projects.</p><p>On the horizon, though, Pichai has his work cut out.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Deirdre Bosa, San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Campbell`s reports soupy sales, and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>Campbell`s Soup sold fewer of its namesake products in the U.S. in the most recent quarter, but the company did see an increase in its share of the soup market, for the first time in 10 quarters. And its earnings came in better than expected.</p><p>That was enough to lift the stock which rose about 2 percent to $48.47. It hit a 52-week high during the session.</p><p>Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) is replacing its CEO and CFO following a strategy disagreement with the board of directors. Earlier this year, Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) sought to unite its brands, including Orbitz, hotels.com and VRBO, but the chairman of the board said the strategy failed and led to disappointing results. Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) shares were up 6 percent to $105.56.</p><p>Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) sold its Ballast Point craft beer unit to a small Illinois brewery for an undisclosed amount. Constellation bought ballast point in 2015 for a record $1 billion. This deal is believed to be below that amount as the market for craft beer has slowed. Shares were off a fraction today to $184.29.</p><p>GRIFFETH: G-III apparel group missed sales estimates for the third quarter and they`ve lowered guidance as a result. Company which owns brands like Donna Karan, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger blamed the shortfall on trade tariffs. G-III fell 2 percent today to $27.89.</p><p>Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) said it sees fourth quarter shipping volume down a little more than 10 percent and the rail operator also expects revenue to slip by about that same amount. But after falling for five straight sessions, the stock actually rose 2 percent today to $171.46.</p><p>Instructure is being acquired by private equity firm Thoma Bravo. The price tag is about $2 billion or $47.60 a share. That`s actually 10 percent below yesterday`s closing price. Last month, the education software company said it was reviewing some strategic options. Instructure dropped 8 percent today to $48.75.</p><p>HERERA: Following YouTube`s recent landmark $170 million settlement with regulators, for alleged violation of children`s privacy laws, the company is changing its policies and restricting some features around content aimed at kids. But that is not going over well with creators.</p><p>Ylan Mui has the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YLAN MUI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Jeremy Johnston normally fills his day was family.</p><p>JEREMY JOHNSTON, J HOUSE VLOGS CREATOR: All right. Who wants to help me.</p><p>MUI: And plenty of fun.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: One, two, three, go!</p><p>MUI: And he shares it all on his YouTube channel with his 2 million subscribers. It`s a full-time job and a big business. It takes up to 40 people to put together all these videos but lately, the most important place for Johnson to be is Washington, D.C.</p><p>JOHNSTON: We`re trying to inform the FTC commissioners and legislators how the regulation is going to impact creators who make family-friendly content.</p><p>MUI: Johnson is worried his channel and his ad revenue will take a hit. That`s because YouTube is changing the way it handles content aimed at kids. Personalized ads will be banned and features like comments, suggested videos and play lists will be turned off.</p><p>It all comes after the company was forced to pay a record $136 million to the Federal Trade Commission over allegations that it illegally collected children`s personal data. Privacy advocates say the change is long overdue.</p><p>JOSH GOLIN, CAMPAIGN FOR A COMMERCIAL-FREE CHILDHOOD: I do understand this is going to affect the bottom line and they`re upset about that. But one thing they need to recognize is that the business model that they were using was an illegal one.</p><p>MUI: Some content creator predict their ad revenue could plunge 60 to 90 percent. So, now, they`re fighting back.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is very serious.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Family-friendly content is in danger right now.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We may not be able to create content on YouTube.</p><p>MUI: Creators argue that YouTube`s new rules discourage them from making content for kids because they can`t make money doing it. Some of them could move to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime or Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) where the rules are different. But most of all, they just want Washington to hear their side.</p><p>JOHNSTON: As they`re getting this new information, they are reconsidering, they`re thinking about it, and they`re realizing that this is a bigger problem. They don`t want the unintended consequences.</p><p>MUI: For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Ylan Mui in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And coming up, we`re going to take to you a store that has no inventory but it does have a daily snow store.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Here is what we`re watching tomorrow.</p><p>This is highly anticipated. Biogen is presenting data from its experimental Alzheimer`s drug six weeks after the company said it was bringing the treatment back from the dead. That should be interesting.</p><p>Members of OPEC meet to decide on production levels. Jobless claims, international trade and factory orders are all on the economic calendar as well. That`s what we are watching tomorrow, Thursday.</p><p>HERERA: Hedge fund manager Steve Cohen is in talks to increase its stake in the New York Mets. There are reports that Cohen could end up controlling 80 percent of the baseball team. Under the agreement, Fred Wilpon would remain CEO of the Mets for five years. In April, \"Forbes\" valued the New York Mets at $2.3 billion.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Finally tonight, as the retail industry evolves in this digital age, stores are popping up that have no merchandise for shoppers to take home. Canada Goose is the retailer to open a so-called experience store, one it hopes helps consumer understand why Canada Goose outer wear is worth the $1,000 price tag.</p><p>Courtney Reagan went to Toronto to experience it for herself.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: We`re in a mall in Toronto, but this new Canada Goose store is not really a store at all, but an experience. We`re going to take you inside.</p><p>The entrance of the store is called the crevasse. It literally means deep crack in the glacier. As you walk, it sounds as if the galls is cracking under your feet. The walls are made to look and feel like rock. And you can hear above the sound track of the arctic.</p><p>Then you enter the elements room. It`s surrounded by curved walls projecting nature films shot in British Columbia. Those films will change as the seasons change. In the middle of the room, mannequins and the gear will complement the season.</p><p>Now, you`re in the gear room. This is meant to be a reinterpretation of a seed vault, which is in Norway, storing the world`s seeds in case of pandemic. It`s located in the permafrost.</p><p>You`re going to get a brief explanation of the merchandise and you`re going to choose the gear that`s most appropriate for you and how you deal with cold. And then, you`re going to take it inside the cold room.</p><p>Now you`re in the cold room. This is about 10 degrees Fahrenheit but can get as low as negative 4 degrees. It`s meant to simulate arctic conditions.</p><p>Canada goose has other cold rooms, but this is the only one with actual snow.</p><p>DANI REISS, CANADA GOOSE PRESIDENT &amp; CEO: What`s really important is the experience and to be experimental and to try new things. Especially in this day and age whereas we all know retail is changing.</p><p>REAGAN: If the Canada Goose journey store did its job, you`ll actually leave empty handed. There`s no inventory here. But you can come to one of the kiosks, pick out the item that you like and it can be delivered to your home the same day or the next day if you live right here in the Toronto area.</p><p>The no inventory store is part of Canada Goose`s growing direct to consumer business, which makes up about a quarter of totals sales. But the new experience may not be enough to convince investors that have given the stock the cold shoulder. Shares are down 45 percent from the all-time highs set last November, and down more than 10 percent so far this year.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Courtney Reagan in Toronto, Canada.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: That is very cool.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Yes.</p><p>HERERA: Literally.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Literally, yes.</p><p>HERERA: That is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I`m Sue Herera. Thanks for watching.</p><p>We`d like to remind you that this is the time of year your public television station seeks your support.</p><p>GRIFFETH: I`m Bill Griffeth.

The U.S. and China make it official. Agreeing to a limited trade deal, removing what many considered a big uncertainty for the market.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Market monitor. Looking for earnings growth to fuel your portfolio. Well, our guest has a list of names he says are buys.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GRIFFETH: New breed of banks. Tech companies, big and small, are getting into the banking business. But how do you know if they`re right for you and your money?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and much more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, December 13th.</p><p>HERERA: Good evening, everyone, and welcome.</p><p>U.S. and Chinese officials have agreed to a limited trade deal, halting the all out tariff war between the two largest economies? President Trump removed the threat of new tariffs that were supposed to go into effect on Sunday. And he rolled back some others as well, but not all of them.</p><p>Beijing made promising to purchase American agricultural goods. It`s an event investors have been waiting for. And while stocks rallied sharply yesterday on reports of agreement, today, they moved only slightly higher. But it was enough for a record close on the Nasdaq.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average added three points to 28,135. The Nasdaq was up 17. And the S&amp;P 500 was up just slightly.</p><p>Both countries spoke about the phase one deal today, one offering up more details than the other. So, we have two reports tonight. Eunice Yoon is in Beijing, but we begin tonight with Kayla Tausche at the White House.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: After nearly three years of negotiating President Trump today, hailing the first phase of a China trade deal as phenomenal.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I affectionately the farmers have going to have to buy larger tractors because it means a lot of business, a tremendous amount of business.</p><p>TAUSCHE: The U.S. says China has agreed to about $40 billion in additional purchases of agricultural purchases of products over the next two. China will buy another $150 billion of manufactured goods and energy.</p><p>There are also provisions on forced technology transfer, intellectual property and currency. In return, Chinese officials said the U.S. committed to remove tariffs step by step. The rate on a round of tariffs that hit in September will be cut in half. And tariffs on toys and phones set for this weekend will be shelved.</p><p>But the White House is keeping the rest of the tariffs as leverage.</p><p>TRUMP: Tariffs will largely remain at 25 percent on $250 billion. And we`ll use them for future negotiations on the phase 2 deal.</p><p>TAUSCHE: Ambassador Bob Lighthizer, the lead U.S. trade negotiator, told reporters he expects ministers, not leaders of the two countries to sign the deal the first week of January in Washington. It will take effect 30 days after that.</p><p>This process has seen many false starts before. As recently as October when President Trump touted a deal being reached before it was finished.</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR: Really should believe it this time. This is a major development, large phase 1 deal.</p><p>TAUSCHE: As for what happened the last two months, Lighthizer says the countries had made notional agreement but needed time to work out the exact figures behind it. He hailed this deal as unprecedented. Even so, he said it`s wise to remain skeptical as to whether China can actually deliver.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Kayla Tausche in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The Chinese have agreed to a phase 1 trade deal with the U.S. At a late night Friday press briefing in Beijing, senior members of China`s negotiating team said that reaching a deal would benefit China, the U.S. and the world.</p><p>The key highlight was that the Chinese did not commit to a specific figure for purchases of U.S. goods, which was a key demand of the Trump administration. Instead they said China would buy more goods without a doubt but based on market needs.</p><p>Other interesting points, the Chinese said the U.S. agreed to keep its promise to cancel tariffs step by step, some existing levies and future ones. And the ministers stressed how both sides were making compromises and commitments to avoid having the deal appear unequal in the eyes of the Chinese public, with the U.S. imposing changes on China.</p><p>It appears there`s plenty of work left to do. The Chinese said that both sides still need today finalize the texts and take other steps before deciding when and where they would sign the deal.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Eunice Yoon in Beijing.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Michael Farr joins us now to talk more about trade and the markets. He, of course, is the president and CEO of Farr, Miller and Washington.</p><p>Michael, always good to see you. Thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>MICHAEL FARR, PRESIDENT AND CEO, FARR, MILLER &amp; WASHINGTON: Thank you, Bill. Great to be with you.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Does this deal in any get you to look at the markets in a different way?</p><p>FARR: If we have a deal, Bill -- I mean, so much of this negotiation has been loosely promising to hold the football for Charlie Brown and Charlie Brown trusting her and ending up flat on his back. There`s been a bit of that for markets.</p><p>When you hear Bob Lighthizer who is an old friend say that we`re really there, I feel better about it. What I like for stocks is it does seem to be removing more and more uncertainty even incrementally. So, I think it gives a more stable platform to the negotiations that`s going to quiet some of the noise. And investors are going to be able to focus a little bit more on the numbers, on earnings and on what makes stocks valuable.</p><p>HERERA: Michael, would you be stepping into some of the names that have suffered because of the length of the trade war?</p><p>FARR: I think so, Sue. But not necessarily with an idea that they`re going to rebound all that quickly because this still promises to be a long process. But I like to buy things when they are beaten up.</p><p>So, for those very good companies that have suffered, you know, you buy them when folks don`t like them. You try and buy them when cheap. A lot of them have become less expensive. There is opportunity there and yes I`m looking at those.</p><p>GRIFFETH: You`re getting phase one now of a trade deal. You`ve got the Federal Reserve which pretty much signaled this week they`re out of the picture for the foreseeable future and you got the stock market at all-time highs.</p><p>Is it too good to be true? Or what are you looking at into the New Year here?</p><p>FARR: You know, Bill, I`ve been doing this so long, any time everything feels good I get more nervous. But yes, at 17.5 times earnings, stocks aren`t cheap but they`re not awful. Earnings growth for 2019 may be 1.5 percent really, 17.5 times earnings, the economy is doing OK. The Federal Reserve says they`re going to be on the sideline for a while.</p><p>And we know in an election year the fed doesn`t want to do anything. So, you get past April and May, Fed is quiet, interest rates low. This is a constructive, bullish environment for stocks. So, yes, I think it could continue to go along not -- I don`t expect another 25 percent year, but a positive year for 2020 -- yes, I`m reasonably bullish.</p><p>GRIFFETH: All right. Michael Farr with Farr, Miller and Washington -- always good to see you, Michael. Thanks. Have a good weekend.</p><p>FARR: Great to see you. Happy holidays to everybody. And as my friend Paul Kangas used to say, I wish everybody the best of goodbyes.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Very good.</p><p>HERERA: A handful of economic reports today give hints about the outlook for growth. Import prices rebounded in November, rising 0.2 percent, the fastest pace in six months. But the gain was tied to oil prices, meaning underlying inflation pressures remain muted. A separate report showed business inventories rose 0.2 percent, lifted by stocks at retailers, suggesting that inventory management could contribute to economic growth in the fourth quarter.</p><p>But retail sales not a as strong as expected in November. They also rose 0.2 percent but economists say the short fall may be because of the late Thanksgiving, which pushed the first big weekend of holiday spending into December.</p><p>GRIFFETH: In his first public comments since the Federal Reserve`s policy meeting this week, the president of the New York Fed said today that this year`s interest rates cuts have positioned the economy for solid growth in 2020.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN WILLIAMS, FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF NEW YORK PRESIDENT: The economy is it in a good place. Unemployment is at 50-year low. The economy is growing. The economy is performing about as well as we have seen in decades.</p><p>The real issue is, you know, how do we keep the economy strong? How do we keep inflation at -- back to 2 percent? And then, you know, what are the risks and uncertainties out there?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Williams said he does expect the economy to grow about 2 percent annually over the next couple of years.</p><p>HERERA: Although much of the attention today was on trade relations with China, the trade fight with Europe is still brewing. Tonight we learn that the U.S. is considering tariffs of up to 100 percent on European products that were previously absolved from such duties. Those products include things Irish and scotch whiskeys, cognac, Spanish olive oil and French cheese.</p><p>GRIFFTH: And in the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Boris Johnson spent his day celebrating his decisive election victory. He pledged to unite his country and move forward with the U.K.`s exit from the European Union.</p><p>Willem Marx is in London for us tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BORIS JOHNSON, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: I am forming a new government.</p><p>WILLEM MARX, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Boris Johnson came to power in 10 Downing Street over the summer promising that he would deliver Brexit by the end of October. When it looked like that wasn`t possible, he fought through an election to win a new parliamentary majority. After five weeks of a very divisive campaign, he`s ended up with a significant majority for his Conservative Party, the largest since the 1980s.</p><p>His opponent, Labour, led by Jeremy Corbyn, saw the most disappointing results since the 1930s and that allows Boris Johnson to move forward with his own divorce deal for the E.U., looking forward to the end of January when the U.K. will now move very likely, formally leave the European Union as part of that divorce arrangement.</p><p>The next challenge for the prime minister, of course, is how he forms a trading relationship with the U.K.`s largest trading partner, the European Union. He will face a huge amount of pressure to rush that through in terms of the negotiations to get approval from his own party and from other members of the parliament here in the U.K. And the challenge is he promised to do that by the end of next year, 2020. If he fails to do that, investors, businesses, voters concerned about the possibility that any will have a hard Brexit, U.K. will leave the European Union at the end of next year if there is no trade deal and return to WTO terms, something economists have said will be very damaging for the British economy.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Willem Marx outside 10 Downing Street in London.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: It is time to take a look at some of today`s \"Upgrades and Downgrades\".</p><p>Bristol Myers Squibb was upgraded to buy from hold at Argus. The analyst cites the company`s drug pipeline after the completion -- completed acquisition of Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG). The price target is $80. The stock fell a fraction to $63.82.</p><p>Snap was upgraded to outperform from market perform at JMP Securities. The analyst there cites the company`s ability to grow its user base and attract advertisers. The price target is $20. The stock rose 4 percent to $15.09.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Regeneron was upgraded to outperform from neutral at Credit Suisse. The stock was also named a top pick for 2020. The analyst cited sales of the company`s macular degeneration drug. And price target is now an even $400. The stock rose 1 percent today to $376.42.</p><p>Hanes Brand was downgraded to underperform from neutral at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch. The analyst cited a slowdown of sales for the company`s Champion athletic apparel brand. Price target down to $13 now, and shares were down 5 percent to $14.40.</p><p>HERERA: Still ahead, a year`s long high stakes labor case and a big win for one of America`s biggest companies.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: A long running labor union case has finally come to an end. And it was a win for the world`s largest fast food restaurant chain.</p><p>Kate Rogers (NYSE:ROG) has the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KATE ROGERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: A big win for McDonald`s in the big debate over the franchisee franchiser relations and how much responsibility franchisors like the restaurant giant have over actions taken at their franchise locations. The National Labor Relations Board instructing a federal judge Thursday to approve settlements to resolve complaints against McDonald`s (NYSE:MCD) and 29 of its franchisees in a case that`s been under way for three years.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What do we want?</p><p>ROGERS: Workers claimed they faced retaliation for participating in rallies calling for $15 an hour minimum wage and unions. The decision still has to be finalized. But it means McDonald`s (NYSE:MCD) escapes joint employer liability which would hold corporations accountable for violations at franchise locations. The settlement places liability on franchisees.</p><p>CATHERINE MONSON, FAST SIGNS INTERNATIONAL CEO: McDonald`s (NYSE:MCD), like all franchisers such as Fast Signs International puts together a brand, an entity, training, supply chain and everything. But our individual franchisees are the ones who hire, fire make the pay decisions, et cetera, do all the management. So, to finally have some closure on this vagueness of the expanded definition of joint employer is a really positive for Fast Signs and the entire franchise industry.</p><p>ROGERS: The International Franchise Association says that an expanded definition of the joint employer rule from 2015 has stifled industry growth and increased litigation against franchise businesses by 93 percent over that time period.</p><p>MONSON: It has reduced the addition of over 370,000 jobs in those five years and actually eliminated about $33 billion of economic growth because of the uncertainty. Franchisors have been hesitant to grow and franchisees really didn`t know what was happening to their business. So, this is a very positive, positive step for all of franchising, whether you`re a franchiser or a franchisee.</p><p>ROGERS: In a statement, McDonald`s (NYSE:MCD) said in part that the decision allows our franchisees and their employees to move forward and resolve all matters without any admission of wrongdoing. Additionally, current and former franchisee employees involved in the proceedings can now receive long overdue satisfaction of claims.</p><p>Workers rights group Fight for 15 and a union said it plans to forcefully appeal, adding: The settlement is not valid. McDonald`s (NYSE:MCD) is walking away with a get-out-of-jail-free card after illegally retaliating against low paid workers who are fighting to paid enough to feed their families.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Kate Rogers (NYSE:ROG).</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: A surprise FDA approval for Sarepta, and that`s where with we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The biotech second drug for Duchene muscular dystrophy was given the green light by regulators. Sarepta already makes the first FDA approved treatment for the disease. And until now, it had been the company`s only commercialized therapy. Shares soared 31 percent to $132.05.</p><p>The CEO of Kate Spade is leaving her position at the end of the year, after less than two years on the job. Same store sales at the handbag maker have been falling since Kate spade was acquired by Tapestry back in 2017. Shares of Tapestry were down 1.5 percent to $25.94.</p><p>GRIFFETH: The Department of Justice is reportedly preparing legal action against live nation. According to the \"Wall Street Journal\", officials are looking into allegations that the live entertainment company tried to strong-arm concert venues into using its Ticket Master subsidiary. Shares fell 7 percent on the news, down to $64.34.</p><p>And AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) is also increasing its quarterly dividend by 2 percent. It`s going to be payable February 3rd to shareholders of record as of January 10th. AT&amp;T`s dividend yield of course is a healthy 5.3 percent. The company also plans to retire about $100 million worth of stock in the first quarter of next year. The stock fell about a fraction today to $38.26.</p><p>HERERA: It is time now for our weekly market monitor. He likes three companies. He says the shares are industry leaders that could see strong earnings growth over the next 12 months.</p><p>Nick Giacoumakis joins us. He is president of the New England Investment and Retirement Group.</p><p>Nick, welcome. Nice to have you here.</p><p>NICK GIACOUMAKIS, NEW ENGLAND INVESTMENT &amp; RETIREMENT GROUP PRESIDENT: Thank you very much for having me.</p><p>HERERA: And we start with the Adobe. You say that they basically have been innovative. They transformed their business in many sectors. That`s one of the reasons that you like it.</p><p>Why else do you like it?</p><p>GIACOUMAKIS: Sure, I mean, they have expansion of business in the artificial intelligence side of the business with their building that out. Also in addition to that the e-commerce side of the business has been lucrative and if you look at the earnings release that came out today, even the older line business such as Acrobat and Photoshop, they are really, really, you know, hit the numbers for the company to be that large and producing those types of numbers, 21 percent of revenue growth. That`s pretty fantastic. So, I think the train going forward should continue.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Next you have is retail -- the furniture retailer now called RH. It`s the old Restoration Hardware. What a year this company has had, both earnings and stock-wise. Do you think they can keep up this momentum up going into the New Year?</p><p>GIACOUMAKIS: I think so, Bill. I think it`s a situation where creativity and innovation is kicking in where RH has decided to go into the brick and mortar side of the business and they have some beautiful, large creative gallery stores that really been drawing in the public and creating a lot of buzz.</p><p>For example, just recently they came out with the ski home lifestyle store, obviously right in time for the winter season. I think really they`ve differentiated themselves from the typical retailer that we see out there that`s just relying on online sales.</p><p>HERERA: And next, we finish with J.P. Morgan. And you make the point that it is basically executing to a gold standard here in the United States. And it has also had a nice one-year gain.</p><p>GIACOUMAKIS: Yes. And you know, between the leadership of Jamie Dimon obviously over the years, building the business to the gold standard that they are, even as large as J.P. Morgan is, they are continuing to reinvent themselves. More recently, they`re putting a thrust and drive towards the wealth management side of the business where they partnered up some of the Chase locations on the advisory side of the business for the high net weather and also ultra high net worth side of the business.</p><p>And this will help to not only increase revenue, but also to smooth out earnings if and when we see a slowdown in the more traditional side of the business such as commercial banking and lending.</p><p>So, for that reason, we really continue to see good things for J.P. Morgan.</p><p>HERERA: On that note, Nick, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>GIACOUMAKIS: Thank you for having me. Appreciate it.</p><p>HERERA: Nick Giacoumakis with the New England Investment and Retirement Group.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And coming up, getting away for the holiday this season. Well, watch out for hidden fees on your hotel bill.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: We all pay them. And we all get annoyed when we do. We`re talking about resort fees which are added to the cost of your hotel room. And while they`re annoying to travelers, they are a lucrative source of revenue for the industry. And they are expected to go up.</p><p>Seema Mody has the details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEEMA MODY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: As you prepare to travel for the holidays, watch out for the pesky resort fees that may be added onto your hotel bill at checkout. Hotels say the resort fee, which can range from $25 to $45 a night covers activities or specific amenities such as free Wi-Fi or access to the gym. It`s seen as an effective way for properties to collect more money from customers without raising the room rate.</p><p>PATRICK SCHOLES, SUNTRUST ROBINSON HUMPHREY: It`s been very challenging the last couple of years to push room rates higher. And one way that they`ve been able to at least make profits higher is by tacking on these resort fees.</p><p>MODY: Resort fees are quickly becoming a source of frustration for travelers who may not even be using any of the amenities that are included in the resort fee. Like complementary drinks at the bar, or a beach chair. And it`s not just hotels and travel distinctions like the Caribbean. Many hotels in cities are implementing an urban fee.</p><p>Research from hospitality firm Skift shows an increase in a number of urban hotels in cities such as New York, Chicago and Los Angeles that are charging fees even if they don`t have the swimming pools and other amenities that resort fees are normally supposed to cover. Other guests complaint they`re often not made aware of these fee when booking the hotel.</p><p>Lawmakers have taken notice. Earlier this year, the attorney generals in Washington, D.C. and Nebraska filed lawsuits against the two largest hotel operators, Marriott and Hilton, for not properly disclosing the fees. But experts don`t see the fees going away any time soon.</p><p>SCHOLES: I think for many hotels it`s been quite successful. And it`s not just the revenue. It doesn`t cost anymore employees to tack these fees on. And because of that, you have a high profit stream from them.</p><p>MODY: According to SDR Analytics, for the fifth year in a row, miscellaneous income which includes resort and cancellation fees was the biggest source of growth at more than 11 percent. If fees continue to rise, experts caution that may push more travelers to off to stay at a short-term rental over a hotel.</p><p>SCHOLES: You know, as people start to notice that more, yes, if something that`s costing more you may look at an alternative accommodation such as Airbnb or the like.</p><p>MODY: Depending on where you are staying, there may be a way to get out of paying the resort fee. Travel consulting firm TPG recommends booking hotels using awards or points and advises clients to check in with the hotel manager to see if the resort fee can be taken off the bill if you`re not planning to use the amenities or services it covers.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Seema Mody.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And finally tonight, they are called non-bank banks, among other things. And there are a lot of them out there to choose from these days. Big and small tech companies are getting into the banking business by offering credit cards and savings accounts and other services. But before opening an account with one of them, it`s important to think about how you bank.</p><p>Our senior personal finance correspondent Sharon Epperson is here with some tips on that tonight.</p><p>What -- how does this differ from traditional bank?</p><p>SHARON EPPERSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT SENIOR PERSONAL FINANCE CORRESPONDENT: Well, they are called challenger banks and they can be from big tech companies or smaller fintech, financial technology startups. And the purpose of them is to allow you to have easier access to banking with a branchless bank, digital bank, get checking account, savings accounts and then most of the time but you have to check on this, they`re partnered with a federally insured FDIC insured bank to actually provide you that kind of protection.</p><p>But there are a number of companies that are doing this from companies like Chime that has 6.5 million accounts, to other companies, SoFi, which is a refinancing company for student loans but now also has SoFi Money and has then there`s T-Mobile Money, as well as Betterment. So, a lot of companies that are in the mix doing this.</p><p>HERERA: What are the advantages if there are some for consumers?</p><p>EPPERSON: Well, they are lower cost because there may not have overdraft fees, there may not be a minimum balance, there may not be -- may be higher rates that you can get on loans and there -- and your savings accounts and then you may have greater access to credit because artificial technology making it easier to get more access. And then the specialized services as well, whether it`s checking or sayings, or payment options, you want that specific option, that`s for you and it`s right on the phone.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Disadvantages? What happens when the lights go out, for example?</p><p>EPPERSON: Exactly. So, there`s no human interaction. If you have an issue, there is nothing you can do to talk about it. If you want to go one place and get your mortgage and credit card and your checking, that`s not for you, because it`s going to be a specialized offering.</p><p>And then your data is out there. Any time that you`re doing something with --</p><p>HERERA: Yes.</p><p>EPPERSON: -- technology like this, you`re putting your data out there. So, you may be at greater risk. You need to think about this. Basically ask how do I want to bank and then decide which is best for you?</p><p>GRIFFETH: As always, Sharon Epperson, thank you.</p><p>EPPERSON: My pleasure.</p><p>GRIFFETH: See you later.</p><p>HERERA: All right. Well, before we go, let`s take a look at the day`s final numbers for the Wall Street and also the end of the week. The Dow added three points to finish at 28,135. The Nasdaq was up 17 to close at a record, and the S&amp;P 500 was up just slightly.</p><p>All of the major averages were also higher for the week. Pulled it off on this Friday the 13th.</p><p>GRIFFETH: It is. You know, I was just going to say Friday the 13th, but we still finish with these record highs.</p><p>HERERA: Yes.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And now we got a Fed behind us and we got a trade deal behind us.</p><p>HERERA: Yes.</p><p>GRIFFETH: What will come next week?</p><p>HERERA: What will come next -- what I was going to say.</p><p>That does it for us tonight. I`m Sue Herera. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>GRIFFETH: I`m Bill Griffeth. Have a great weekend. See you Monday.</p><p>HERERA: See you Monday.</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

The U.S. and  China make it official.  Agreeing to a limited trade deal, removing what  many considered a big uncertainty for the market.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Market monitor.  Looking for  earnings growth to fuel your portfolio.  Well, our guest has a list of  names he says are buys.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GRIFFETH:  New breed of banks.  Tech companies, big and small, are getting  into the banking business.  But how do you know if they`re right for you  and your money?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and much more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday,  December 13th.</p><p>HERERA:  Good evening, everyone, and welcome.</p><p>U.S. and Chinese officials have agreed to a limited trade deal, halting the  all out tariff war between the two largest economies?  President Trump  removed the threat of new tariffs that were supposed to go into effect on  Sunday.  And he rolled back some others as well, but not all of them.</p><p>Beijing made promising to purchase American agricultural goods.  It`s an  event investors have been waiting for.  And while stocks rallied sharply  yesterday on reports of agreement, today, they moved only slightly higher.   But it was enough for a record close on the Nasdaq.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average added three points to 28,135.  The Nasdaq  was up 17.  And the S&amp;P 500 was up just slightly.</p><p>Both countries spoke about the phase one deal today, one offering up more  details than the other.  So, we have two reports tonight.  Eunice Yoon is  in Beijing, but we begin tonight with Kayla Tausche at the White House.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  After nearly three  years of negotiating President Trump today, hailing the first phase of a  China trade deal as phenomenal.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I affectionately the farmers  have going to have to buy larger tractors because it means a lot of  business, a tremendous amount of business.</p><p>TAUSCHE:  The U.S. says China has agreed to about $40 billion in additional  purchases of agricultural purchases of products over the next two.  China  will buy another $150 billion of manufactured goods and energy.</p><p>There are also provisions on forced technology transfer, intellectual  property and currency.  In return, Chinese officials said the U.S.  committed to remove tariffs step by step.  The rate on a round of tariffs  that hit in September will be cut in half.  And tariffs on toys and phones  set for this weekend will be shelved.</p><p>But the White House is keeping the rest of the tariffs as leverage.</p><p>TRUMP:  Tariffs will largely remain at 25 percent on $250 billion.  And  we`ll use them for future negotiations on the phase 2 deal.</p><p>TAUSCHE:  Ambassador Bob Lighthizer, the lead U.S. trade negotiator, told  reporters he expects ministers, not leaders of the two countries to sign  the deal the first week of January in Washington.  It will take effect 30  days after that.</p><p>This process has seen many false starts before.  As recently as October  when President Trump touted a deal being reached before it was finished.</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR:  Really should believe it  this time.  This is a major development, large phase 1 deal.</p><p>TAUSCHE:  As for what happened the last two months, Lighthizer says the  countries had made notional agreement but needed time to work out the exact  figures behind it.  He hailed this deal as unprecedented.  Even so, he said  it`s wise to remain skeptical as to whether China can actually deliver.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Kayla Tausche in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The Chinese have  agreed to a phase 1 trade deal with the U.S.  At a late night Friday press  briefing in Beijing, senior members of China`s negotiating team said that  reaching a deal would benefit China, the U.S. and the world.</p><p>The key highlight was that the Chinese did not commit to a specific figure  for purchases of U.S. goods, which was a key demand of the Trump  administration.  Instead they said China would buy more goods without a  doubt but based on market needs.</p><p>Other interesting points, the Chinese said the U.S. agreed to keep its  promise to cancel tariffs step by step, some existing levies and future  ones.  And the ministers stressed how both sides were making compromises  and commitments to avoid having the deal appear unequal in the eyes of the  Chinese public, with the U.S. imposing changes on China.</p><p>It appears there`s plenty of work left to do.  The Chinese said that both  sides still need today finalize the texts and take other steps before  deciding when and where they would sign the deal.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Eunice Yoon in Beijing.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Michael Farr joins us now to talk more about trade and the  markets.  He, of course, is the president and CEO of Farr, Miller and  Washington.</p><p>Michael, always good to see you.  Thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>MICHAEL FARR, PRESIDENT AND CEO, FARR, MILLER &amp; WASHINGTON:  Thank you,  Bill.  Great to be with you.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Does this deal in any get you to look at the markets in a  different way?</p><p>FARR:  If we have a deal, Bill -- I mean, so much of this negotiation has  been loosely promising to hold the football for Charlie Brown and Charlie  Brown trusting her and ending up flat on his back.  There`s been a bit of  that for markets.</p><p>When you hear Bob Lighthizer who is an old friend say that we`re really  there, I feel better about it.  What I like for stocks is it does seem to  be removing more and more uncertainty even incrementally.  So, I think it  gives a more stable platform to the negotiations that`s going to quiet some  of the noise.  And investors are going to be able to focus a little bit  more on the numbers, on earnings and on what makes stocks valuable.</p><p>HERERA:  Michael, would you be stepping into some of the names that have  suffered because of the length of the trade war?</p><p>FARR:  I think so, Sue.  But not necessarily with an idea that they`re  going to rebound all that quickly because this still promises to be a long  process.  But I like to buy things when they are beaten up.</p><p>So, for those very good companies that have suffered, you know, you buy  them when folks don`t like them.  You try and buy them when cheap.  A lot  of them have become less expensive.  There is opportunity there and yes I`m  looking at those.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  You`re getting phase one now of a trade deal.  You`ve got the  Federal Reserve which pretty much signaled this week they`re out of the  picture for the foreseeable future and you got the stock market at all-time  highs.</p><p>Is it too good to be true?  Or what are you looking at into the New Year  here?</p><p>FARR:  You know, Bill, I`ve been doing this so long, any time everything  feels good I get more nervous.  But yes, at 17.5 times earnings, stocks  aren`t cheap but they`re not awful.  Earnings growth for 2019 may be 1.5  percent really, 17.5 times earnings, the economy is doing OK.  The Federal  Reserve says they`re going to be on the sideline for a while.</p><p>And we know in an election year the fed doesn`t want to do anything.  So,  you get past April and May, Fed is quiet, interest rates low.  This is a  constructive, bullish environment for stocks.  So, yes, I think it could  continue to go along not -- I don`t expect another 25 percent year, but a  positive year for 2020 -- yes, I`m reasonably bullish.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  All right.  Michael Farr with Farr, Miller and Washington --  always good to see you, Michael.  Thanks.  Have a good weekend.</p><p>FARR:  Great to see you.  Happy holidays to everybody.  And as my friend  Paul Kangas used to say, I wish everybody the best of goodbyes.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Very good.</p><p>HERERA:  A handful of economic reports today give hints about the outlook  for growth.  Import prices rebounded in November, rising 0.2 percent, the  fastest pace in six months.  But the gain was tied to oil prices, meaning  underlying inflation pressures remain muted.  A separate report showed  business inventories rose 0.2 percent, lifted by stocks at retailers,  suggesting that inventory management could contribute to economic growth in  the fourth quarter.</p><p>But retail sales not a as strong as expected in November.  They also rose  0.2 percent but economists say the short fall may be because of the late  Thanksgiving, which pushed the first big weekend of holiday spending into  December.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  In his first public comments since the Federal Reserve`s policy  meeting this week, the president of the New York Fed said today that this  year`s interest rates cuts have positioned the economy for solid growth in  2020.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN WILLIAMS, FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF NEW YORK PRESIDENT:  The economy is  it in a good place.  Unemployment is at 50-year low.  The economy is  growing.  The economy is performing about as well as we have seen in  decades.</p><p>The real issue is, you know, how do we keep the economy strong?  How do we  keep inflation at -- back to 2 percent?  And then, you know, what are the  risks and uncertainties out there?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Williams said he does expect the economy to grow about 2 percent  annually over the next couple of years.</p><p>HERERA:  Although much of the attention today was on trade relations with  China, the trade fight with Europe is still brewing.  Tonight we learn that  the U.S. is considering tariffs of up to 100 percent on European products  that were previously absolved from such duties.  Those products include  things Irish and scotch whiskeys, cognac, Spanish olive oil and French  cheese.</p><p>GRIFFTH:  And in the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Boris Johnson spent his  day celebrating his decisive election victory.  He pledged to unite his  country and move forward with the U.K.`s exit from the European Union.</p><p>Willem Marx is in London for us tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BORIS JOHNSON, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER:  I am forming a new government.</p><p>WILLEM MARX, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Boris Johnson came to  power in 10 Downing Street over the summer promising that he would deliver  Brexit by the end of October.  When it looked like that wasn`t possible, he  fought through an election to win a new parliamentary majority.  After five  weeks of a very divisive campaign, he`s ended up with a significant  majority for his Conservative Party, the largest since the 1980s.</p><p>His opponent, Labour, led by Jeremy Corbyn, saw the most disappointing  results since the 1930s and that allows Boris Johnson to move forward with  his own divorce deal for the E.U., looking forward to the end of January  when the U.K. will now move very likely, formally leave the European Union  as part of that divorce arrangement.</p><p>The next challenge for the prime minister, of course, is how he forms a  trading relationship with the U.K.`s largest trading partner, the European  Union.  He will face a huge amount of pressure to rush that through in  terms of the negotiations to get approval from his own party and from other  members of the parliament here in the U.K.  And the challenge is he  promised to do that by the end of next year, 2020.  If he fails to do that,  investors, businesses, voters concerned about the possibility that any will  have a hard Brexit, U.K. will leave the European Union at the end of next  year if there is no trade deal and return to WTO terms, something  economists have said will be very damaging for the British economy.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Willem Marx outside 10 Downing Street in  London.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  It is time to take a look at some of today`s \"Upgrades and  Downgrades\".</p><p>Bristol Myers Squibb was upgraded to buy from hold at Argus.  The analyst  cites the company`s drug pipeline after the completion -- completed  acquisition of Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG).  The price target is $80.  The stock  fell a fraction to $63.82.</p><p>Snap was upgraded to outperform from market perform at JMP Securities.  The  analyst there cites the company`s ability to grow its user base and attract  advertisers.  The price target is $20.  The stock rose 4 percent to $15.09.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Regeneron was upgraded to outperform from neutral at Credit  Suisse.  The stock was also named a top pick for 2020.  The analyst cited  sales of the company`s macular degeneration drug.  And price target is now  an even $400.  The stock rose 1 percent today to $376.42.</p><p>Hanes Brand was downgraded to underperform from neutral at Bank of America  (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch.  The analyst cited a slowdown of sales for the  company`s Champion athletic apparel brand.  Price target down to $13 now,  and shares were down 5 percent to $14.40.</p><p>HERERA:  Still ahead, a year`s long high stakes labor case and a big win  for one of America`s biggest companies.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  A long running labor union case has finally come to an end.  And  it was a win for the world`s largest fast food restaurant chain.</p><p>Kate Rogers (NYSE:ROG) has the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KATE ROGERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  A big win for  McDonald`s in the big debate over the franchisee franchiser relations and  how much responsibility franchisors like the restaurant giant have over  actions taken at their franchise locations.  The National Labor Relations  Board instructing a federal judge Thursday to approve settlements to  resolve complaints against McDonald`s (NYSE:MCD) and 29 of its franchisees  in a case that`s been under way for three years.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What do we want?</p><p>ROGERS:  Workers claimed they faced retaliation for participating in  rallies calling for $15 an hour minimum wage and unions.  The decision  still has to be finalized.  But it means McDonald`s (NYSE:MCD) escapes  joint employer liability which would hold corporations accountable for  violations at franchise locations.  The settlement places liability on  franchisees.</p><p>CATHERINE MONSON, FAST SIGNS INTERNATIONAL CEO:  McDonald`s (NYSE:MCD),  like all franchisers such as Fast Signs International puts together a  brand, an entity, training, supply chain and everything.  But our  individual franchisees are the ones who hire, fire make the pay decisions,  et cetera, do all the management.  So, to finally have some closure on this  vagueness of the expanded definition of joint employer is a really positive  for Fast Signs and the entire franchise industry.</p><p>ROGERS:  The International Franchise Association says that an expanded  definition of the joint employer rule from 2015 has stifled industry growth  and increased litigation against franchise businesses by 93 percent over  that time period.</p><p>MONSON:  It has reduced the addition of over 370,000 jobs in those five  years and actually eliminated about $33 billion of economic growth because  of the uncertainty.  Franchisors have been hesitant to grow and franchisees  really didn`t know what was happening to their business.  So, this is a  very positive, positive step for all of franchising, whether you`re a  franchiser or a franchisee.</p><p>ROGERS:  In a statement, McDonald`s (NYSE:MCD) said in part that the  decision allows our franchisees and their employees to move forward and  resolve all matters without any admission of wrongdoing.  Additionally,  current and former franchisee employees involved in the proceedings can now  receive long overdue satisfaction of claims.</p><p>Workers rights group Fight for 15 and a union said it plans to forcefully  appeal, adding: The settlement is not valid.  McDonald`s (NYSE:MCD) is  walking away with a get-out-of-jail-free card after illegally retaliating  against low paid workers who are fighting to paid enough to feed their  families.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Kate Rogers (NYSE:ROG).</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  A surprise FDA approval for Sarepta, and that`s where with we  begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The biotech second drug for Duchene muscular dystrophy was given the green  light by regulators.  Sarepta already makes the first FDA approved  treatment for the disease.  And until now, it had been the company`s only  commercialized therapy.  Shares soared 31 percent to $132.05.</p><p>The CEO of Kate Spade is leaving her position at the end of the year, after  less than two years on the job.  Same store sales at the handbag maker have  been falling since Kate spade was acquired by Tapestry back in 2017.   Shares of Tapestry were down 1.5 percent to $25.94.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  The Department of Justice is reportedly preparing legal action  against live nation.  According to the \"Wall Street Journal\", officials are  looking into allegations that the live entertainment company tried to  strong-arm concert venues into using its Ticket Master subsidiary.  Shares  fell 7 percent on the news, down to $64.34.</p><p>And AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) is also increasing its quarterly dividend by 2 percent.   It`s going to be payable February 3rd to shareholders of record as of  January 10th.  AT&amp;T`s dividend yield of course is a healthy 5.3 percent.   The company also plans to retire about $100 million worth of stock in the  first quarter of next year.  The stock fell about a fraction today to  $38.26.</p><p>HERERA:  It is time now for our weekly market monitor.  He likes three  companies.  He says the shares are industry leaders that could see strong  earnings growth over the next 12 months.</p><p>Nick Giacoumakis joins us.  He is president of the New England Investment  and Retirement Group.</p><p>Nick, welcome.  Nice to have you here.</p><p>NICK GIACOUMAKIS, NEW ENGLAND INVESTMENT &amp; RETIREMENT GROUP PRESIDENT:   Thank you very much for having me.</p><p>HERERA:  And we start with the Adobe.  You say that they basically have  been innovative.  They transformed their business in many sectors.  That`s  one of the reasons that you like it.</p><p>Why else do you like it?</p><p>GIACOUMAKIS:  Sure, I mean, they have expansion of business in the  artificial intelligence side of the business with their building that out.   Also in addition to that the e-commerce side of the business has been  lucrative and if you look at the earnings release that came out today, even  the older line business such as Acrobat and Photoshop, they are really,  really, you know, hit the numbers for the company to be that large and  producing those types of numbers, 21 percent of revenue growth.  That`s  pretty fantastic.  So, I think the train going forward should continue.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Next you have is retail -- the furniture retailer now called RH.   It`s the old Restoration Hardware.  What a year this company has had, both  earnings and stock-wise.  Do you think they can keep up this momentum up  going into the New Year?</p><p>GIACOUMAKIS:  I think so, Bill.  I think it`s a situation where creativity  and innovation is kicking in where RH has decided to go into the brick and  mortar side of the business and they have some beautiful, large creative  gallery stores that really been drawing in the public and creating a lot of  buzz.</p><p>For example, just recently they came out with the ski home lifestyle store,  obviously right in time for the winter season.  I think really they`ve  differentiated themselves from the typical retailer that we see out there  that`s just relying on online sales.</p><p>HERERA:  And next, we finish with J.P. Morgan.  And you make the point that  it is basically executing to a gold standard here in the United States.   And it has also had a nice one-year gain.</p><p>GIACOUMAKIS:  Yes.  And you know, between the leadership of Jamie Dimon  obviously over the years, building the business to the gold standard that  they are, even as large as J.P. Morgan is, they are continuing to reinvent  themselves.  More recently, they`re putting a thrust and drive towards the  wealth management side of the business where they partnered up some of the  Chase locations on the advisory side of the business for the high net  weather and also ultra high net worth side of the business.</p><p>And this will help to not only increase revenue, but also to smooth out  earnings if and when we see a slowdown in the more traditional side of the  business such as commercial banking and lending.</p><p>So, for that reason, we really continue to see good things for J.P. Morgan.</p><p>HERERA:  On that note, Nick, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>GIACOUMAKIS:  Thank you for having me.  Appreciate it.</p><p>HERERA:  Nick Giacoumakis with the New England Investment and Retirement  Group.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And coming up, getting away for the holiday this season.  Well,  watch out for hidden fees on your hotel bill.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  We all pay them.  And we all get annoyed when we do.  We`re  talking about resort fees which are added to the cost of your hotel room.   And while they`re annoying to travelers, they are a lucrative source of  revenue for the industry.  And they are expected to go up.</p><p>Seema Mody has the details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEEMA MODY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  As you prepare to  travel for the holidays, watch out for the pesky resort fees that may be  added onto your hotel bill at checkout.  Hotels say the resort fee, which  can range from $25 to $45 a night covers activities or specific amenities  such as free Wi-Fi or access to the gym.  It`s seen as an effective way for  properties to collect more money from customers without raising the room  rate.</p><p>PATRICK SCHOLES, SUNTRUST ROBINSON HUMPHREY:  It`s been very challenging  the last couple of years to push room rates higher.  And one way that  they`ve been able to at least make profits higher is by tacking on these  resort fees.</p><p>MODY:  Resort fees are quickly becoming a source of frustration for  travelers who may not even be using any of the amenities that are included  in the resort fee.  Like complementary drinks at the bar, or a beach chair.   And it`s not just hotels and travel distinctions like the Caribbean.  Many  hotels in cities are implementing an urban fee.</p><p>Research from hospitality firm Skift shows an increase in a number of urban  hotels in cities such as New York, Chicago and Los Angeles that are  charging fees even if they don`t have the swimming pools and other  amenities that resort fees are normally supposed to cover.  Other guests  complaint they`re often not made aware of these fee when booking the hotel.</p><p>Lawmakers have taken notice.  Earlier this year, the attorney generals in  Washington, D.C. and Nebraska filed lawsuits against the two largest hotel  operators, Marriott and Hilton, for not properly disclosing the fees.  But  experts don`t see the fees going away any time soon.</p><p>SCHOLES:  I think for many hotels it`s been quite successful.  And it`s not  just the revenue.  It doesn`t cost anymore employees to tack these fees on.   And because of that, you have a high profit stream from them.</p><p>MODY:  According to SDR Analytics, for the fifth year in a row,  miscellaneous income which includes resort and cancellation fees was the  biggest source of growth at more than 11 percent.  If fees continue to  rise, experts caution that may push more travelers to off to stay at a  short-term rental over a hotel.</p><p>SCHOLES:  You know, as people start to notice that more, yes, if something  that`s costing more you may look at an alternative accommodation such as  Airbnb or the like.</p><p>MODY:  Depending on where you are staying, there may be a way to get out of  paying the resort fee.  Travel consulting firm TPG recommends booking  hotels using awards or points and advises clients to check in with the  hotel manager to see if the resort fee can be taken off the bill if you`re  not planning to use the amenities or services it covers.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Seema Mody.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And finally tonight, they are called non-bank banks, among other  things.  And there are a lot of them out there to choose from these days.   Big and small tech companies are getting into the banking business by  offering credit cards and savings accounts and other services.  But before  opening an account with one of them, it`s important to think about how you  bank.</p><p>Our senior personal finance correspondent Sharon Epperson is here with some  tips on that tonight.</p><p>What -- how does this differ from traditional bank?</p><p>SHARON EPPERSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT SENIOR PERSONAL FINANCE  CORRESPONDENT:  Well, they are called challenger banks and they can be from  big tech companies or smaller fintech, financial technology startups.  And  the purpose of them is to allow you to have easier access to banking with a  branchless bank, digital bank, get checking account, savings accounts and  then most of the time but you have to check on this, they`re partnered with  a federally insured FDIC insured bank to actually provide you that kind of  protection.</p><p>But there are a number of companies that are doing this from companies like  Chime that has 6.5 million accounts, to other companies, SoFi, which is a  refinancing company for student loans but now also has SoFi Money and has  then there`s T-Mobile Money, as well as Betterment.  So, a lot of companies  that are in the mix doing this.</p><p>HERERA:  What are the advantages if there are some for consumers?</p><p>EPPERSON:  Well, they are lower cost because there may not have overdraft  fees, there may not be a minimum balance, there may not be -- may be higher  rates that you can get on loans and there -- and your savings accounts and  then you may have greater access to credit because artificial technology  making it easier to get more access.  And then the specialized services as  well, whether it`s checking or sayings, or payment options, you want that  specific option, that`s for you and it`s right on the phone.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Disadvantages?  What happens when the lights go out, for  example?</p><p>EPPERSON:  Exactly.  So, there`s no human interaction.  If you have an  issue, there is nothing you can do to talk about it.  If you want to go one  place and get your mortgage and credit card and your checking, that`s not  for you, because it`s going to be a specialized offering.</p><p>And then your data is out there.  Any time that you`re doing something with  --</p><p>HERERA:  Yes.</p><p>EPPERSON:  -- technology like this, you`re putting your data out there.   So, you may be at greater risk.  You need to think about this.  Basically  ask how do I want to bank and then decide which is best for you?</p><p>GRIFFETH:  As always, Sharon Epperson, thank you.</p><p>EPPERSON:  My pleasure.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  See you later.</p><p>HERERA:  All right.  Well, before we go, let`s take a look at the day`s  final numbers for the Wall Street and also the end of the week.  The Dow  added three points to finish at 28,135.  The Nasdaq was up 17 to close at a  record, and the S&amp;P 500 was up just slightly.</p><p>All of the major averages were also higher for the week.  Pulled it off on  this Friday the 13th.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  It is.  You know, I was just going to say Friday the 13th, but  we still finish with these record highs.</p><p>HERERA:  Yes.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And now we got a Fed behind us and we got a trade deal behind  us.</p><p>HERERA:  Yes.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  What will come next week?</p><p>HERERA:  What will come next -- what I was going to say.</p><p>That does it for us tonight.  I`m Sue Herera.  Thanks for joining us.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  I`m Bill Griffeth.  Have a great weekend.  See you Monday.</p><p>HERERA:  See you Monday.</p><p>END</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

I`m Tyler Mathisen. Susie Gharib has the night off.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Well, 2014 is almost in the books and it`s been filled with highs, many of them closing highs for the major indexes and lows like plummeting crude oil prices. But that wasn`t all that happened this year in the world of business. The economy and the job market hit a number of milestones as well. The health care sector dominated deal making, recalls roiled the auto business and a Chinese e-commerce company called Alibaba became the biggest IPO ever.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight, we look back on 2014, the year that was.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN (voice-over): With the Dow notching record highs more than 30 times and the S&amp;P about 50, the bull market is now more than 5 years old. But 2013`s perpetual push upward bumped into appear old acquaintance, volatility.</p><p>In November, stocks bounced up to new highs, but in December, there was another slide. Stock prices wavered just as the Federal Reserve prepared to end its economic stimulus program. Talk of the taper hung over the markets like a cloud a year ago. Now, it`s still about the Fed but the question is when it will begin to push interest rates back up?</p><p>Can the economy handle higher interest rates? Well, employment numbers are better but real incomes really aren`t and inflation is still below the Fed`s target level of 2 percent.</p><p>One reason for the low inflation: a historic drop in the price of oil, down more than 45 percent from the year`s high in June. Why? Well, it is simple and complex as the law of supply and demand. Supply is up. The U.S. alone has increased production 65 percent in just five years. Demand, though, is decidedly down, because the global economy is slowing.</p><p>Here at home, the drop in oil pushed gas prices down by a dollar a gallon and more in some places. Cheaper gas, of course, puts an estimated $100 billion back into the hands of U.S. consumers. That`s about 60 bucks a month for the typical household. But is that enough to get them spending again? Money still tight for most of us.</p><p>So, where is the U.S. finding growth? Companies are still sitting on record piles of cash. Some of that money is staying overseas as the wait for U.S. corporate tax reform lingers on.</p><p>But there`s plenty of money to invest in the latest technologies and corporate spending is helping to grow the economy. Tech is booming. Silicon Valley is a world leader. Apple`s new iPhones are a huge hit. In Seattle, Boeing (NYSE:BA) gets orders for more than fuel efficient jets from all over the globe and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) expanded in New York City, which is suddenly flush with more than 4 million jobs, the most the Big Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has ever had.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Quite a year. And we`ll start with Wall Street. The bull market, of course, proved it was alive and kicking. Major indexes closing at numerous records, almost too many to count, but it`s hard to talk about the stock market without touching on what may be the biggest story of the year for investors, oil prices.</p><p>So, with us, Dom Chu to focus on the stock market, Jackie DeAngelis on energy.</p><p>Welcome to you both. Happy holidays.</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Happy holidays.</p><p>MATHISEN: Let me start with you, Dom. Sum it up in a few sentences for us.</p><p>DOMINIC CHU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: If you talk about the market, you cannot forget that we`ve hit record highs upon record highs, like you said.</p><p>So, as we look at what`s happening in 2014, this bull run is very much intact. But it was this time around, it wasn`t so much a lot of the technology names that we talked about before. It was health care that was a real driver for the market this time around. Those stocks, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals alike, a lot of deal-making like you said, all of that drove that to be the best performing sector in the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>Of course, with those record highs, a lot of investors are calling to question whether or not they can sustain that going into 2015. Of course, the trend has been positive for a lot of them so far.</p><p>MATHISEN: You know, and when you look at those sectors, almost all of them higher except the one you follow most closely, which is energy. And were not for the falling oil prices, presumably, energy would be higher.</p><p>CHU: It`s been a huge drag, of course.</p><p>MATHISEN: Huge drag.</p><p>Lots of factors, we talked there in the piece about supply and demand. Is it really as simple as that?</p><p>DEANGELIS: It really is as simple as that. And, actually, I don`t think investors were expecting energy to be the story that it was in the back half of the year.</p><p>It certainly was no secret that supply was ramping the way analysts were expecting it to. As a matter of fact, this year, we finally started producing over 9 million barrels a day. That is almost up to the point of what Saudi Arabia`s output is. We never thought we`d be at that level.</p><p>At the same time, the demands part of the equation is what took us off guard. When the demand started to fall off, that`s prices started to decline. The question right now is, how do we curtail the supply to be able to meet the demand? Does the demand equation change in 2015 so that supply should stay stable right now? These are all the unknowns.</p><p>MATHISEN: Let`s talk a little bit about OPEC. Have they become irrelevant?</p><p>DEANGELIS: A lot of people are thinking the OPEC is becoming irrelevant but I would say the last meeting in November really changed the game. When they did not change their stance in terms of production and prices really tanked even further, OPEC was sort of showing some muscle and flexing it and saying, look, we`re in this game.</p><p>MATHISEN: So, what`s their end game? Is what they really to do, to squeeze out the higher cost U.S. producers or squeeze them so they scream?</p><p>DEANGELIS: I think what they`re worried about for themselves is losing shares. So, right now, they`re saying, we`re going to eat the price decline but we are going to hold on to market share. And if that squeezes shale, it squeezes shale. This is going to be a game of chicken, every man for itself, and it could get really ugly.</p><p>MATHISEN: Back to stocks. Falling oil prices really thought to be a net positive for the economy.</p><p>CHU: Sure.</p><p>MATHISEN: But in recent weeks, as oil has receded, collapsed in some people`s view --</p><p>CHU: Of course.</p><p>MATHISEN: -- equities hit a hard spot.</p><p>CHU: I mean, here, the numbers are quite staggering. Because just this quarter alone, the last quarter, and we`re only in the middle, we haven`t finished December at this point. By mid-December just in the S&amp;P 500 energy companies alone, that oil price decline left the decline in stocks of all varieties in the energy sector. So much so that just this quarter to date, we`ve lost about $265 billion, with a B, dollars worth of market values for these energy companies.</p><p>So, this slide in oil price is huge. But it`s also important to remember that the driver for the economy right now, oil is a big part of it but it`s smaller part of the overall index than say, technology and financial stocks. Those two sectors are the most heavily weighted in the index. You want to see leadership there. If oil prices can rebound, that`s great as well.</p><p>MATHISEN: So, let`s spin in ahead here.</p><p>Why don`t you go first, Jackie? What is the outlook for energy prices over the first six months or all of 2015?</p><p>DEANGELIS: Well, for the first six months, certainly, analysts and traders alike are saying we could potentially go lower from here. Nobody really wants to call the bottom just yet until again, they get a sense of where this story is going, until some of the data shows us if the demand is going to come back on the table.</p><p>Having said that, people have also said to me, you know, once we do hit the bottom, maybe it`s somewhere in the 40s. We will rebound quickly back to the $60 or $70 range. So, that probably could happen in the back half of the year.</p><p>MATHISEN: And for you, Dom, we got back last week guidance from the Fed on interest rates.</p><p>CHU: We did.</p><p>MATHISEN: What`s the outlook for stock prices 2015?</p><p>CHU: Well, for 2015, what you`re seeing a lot of experts say is that you`re going to see the same level of valuation in the overall market, but it`s going to match earnings` growth. Earnings growth is not expected to be gang-busters but it`s still expected to grow. So, a lot of experts are seeing, yes, gains in the stock market. But you`re not talking about the 10 percent, 15 percent, 20 percent return varieties. You`re talking about --</p><p>MATHISEN: The profit growth and dividend.</p><p>CHU: -- maybe that 5 percent, 6 percent, 7 percent. Yes.</p><p>MATHISEN: Dom and Jackie, thanks very much. Appreciate it.</p><p>All righty. Now, to the economy, which is being helped by those low energy prices we just mentioned. But they didn`t start out that way. If anything, the brutal winners slammed the brakes on much of the country`s economic activity. But then the growth engine was turned on.</p><p>Steve Liesman reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Five long years after the end of the recession, a period marked by sluggish growth and stubbornly high unemployment, the U.S. economy may have turned a corner in 2014. Beginning the year with a surprise decline in growth, attributed to weather but causing many to say, here we go again. The U.S. economy proceeded to rocket ahead, tallying its best two quarters of growth since in 2003, and on track for its best year of job gains since 2000.</p><p>Unlike previous post-crisis growth spurts, this time it didn`t appear, the gains would be given back.</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It`s pretty hard to find an economic measure where we`re not significantly better off. I don`t have to tell you about the stock market and where that`s gone, corporate profits, record highs. But also, unemployment now lower than it was previously. We`ve seen the housing market recover, although not as fast as we`d like, the auto industry recovering. We remain the most dynamic, innovative economy in the world.</p><p>LIESMAN: Indeed, the U.S. looks like the shining city on the hill compared to other places around the world like Europe which teetered on the verge of recession and China, where the growth was reduced. The differences were apparent in monetary policy, where the Federal Reserve took the momentous steps this year of ending its open-ended quantitative easing or bond buying program launched in September 2012.</p><p>JANET YELLEN, U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIR: Looking at unfolding economic development and as the economy strengthens, and we come closer to achieving our objectives, I think it`s very likely that we will, you know, progress on the path of normalizing policy.</p><p>LIESMAN: At the same time, the European central bank looks up to take its first step into a U.S. style Q.E. program to kick-start its economy.</p><p>MARIO DRAGHI, ECB PRESIDENT: The Q.E. program, which could include sovereign bonds, falls within our mandate, or better, is a eligible instrument that we could use in the pursue of our mandate. Not to pursue our mandate would be legal.</p><p>LIESMAN: Next year looks to be one where the Fed takes another step towards normalcy, possibly raising interest rates for the first time in eight years. But it`s not without risk, if 2014 turns out to be another false start, the Fed could be moving too early. But if growth continues to be strong, the Fed could find itself behind the curve.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: One major component of the economy, the job market, and this year, American businesses picked up their pace of hiring, turning 2014 into a solid year for job growth.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN (voice-over): A year ago, the national unemployment rate stood at 6.7 percent. Now, it`s down to 5.8 percent, the lowest it`s been since July of 2008. In November alone, U.S. employers added more than 320,000 jobs and 2014 is on track now to become the strongest hiring year since way back in 1999. The gains have come across all the major sectors with professional services like accountants and engineers leading the way.</p><p>Wages though have barely budged in seven years and though there have been signs of improvement recently, they are still barely keeping pace with inflation.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Hampton Pearson has been covering the job market for us all year and he comes to us now from Washington, D.C.</p><p>So, Hamp, we mentioned a couple of things that we`re strong points in job creation. But from where you sit, what drove job creation this past year?</p><p>HAMPTON PEARSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Well, it was sort of a \"Little Engine That Could\" syndrome, if you will, looking at all those numbers. By the way, this time last year, the month of December produced only 84,000 jobs and at the close of the Fed meeting this year, we had the Fed chairman trumping the last three months of 2014, we`ve averaged 280,000.</p><p>But to get to the core of your question, it started out with jobs essentially that did not pay all that well. It became widespread and we`re now at a point where, again, there`s some competition for skilled labor and skilled jobs and that`s actually beginning to produce some wage growth along the way as well.</p><p>And I think better job and better paying jobs will really have to be the job story of 2015.</p><p>MATHISEN: You hinted at the answer to the next question, which is about the quality of the jobs created, and you seem to be suggesting that they keep getting better and better and better.</p><p>PEARSON: Yes, we even in the November jobs report, we had a four tenths of an increase in average hourly earnings. That doesn`t sound like much, but it`s one of the biggest monthly increases we`ve seen in quite a few years. However, year over year, we`re only talking about 2 percent wage growth.</p><p>The Fed said it can live with 3 percent wage growth and still hit 2 percent inflation target. So, lots of room from a Fed standpoint, for wages to grow, and really, I think, you need the more spending power in the hands of consumers to keep the overall economy growing.</p><p>MATHISEN: So, what will it take to keep the job growth going and what could potentially throw a wrench into it?</p><p>PEARSON: More of the same, especially that near term hike we`re all getting now from lower oil prices, putting more money in people`s pockets. That too is going to boost the total demand figures in early January when we started to see what kind of holiday season we`ve had going forward.</p><p>But the road blocks along the way are, still tight labor market in some respect. Is this growth for real? Can it be sustained? You know, have we really turned a big corner here?</p><p>MATHISEN: All right, Hampton. Thank you very much. Happy holidays. Hampton Pearson --</p><p>PEARSON: Same to you.</p><p>MATHISEN: You bet -- in Washington for us.</p><p>Still ahead: the auto industry was hit by major recalls this past year, but were buyers scared away from the brands that were hit hardest?</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN: The auto industry facing some of the biggest safety controversies in its history. It`s been a big year and a big focus for investors, drivers, and regulators. Topping the list, recalls of two of the biggest, the Takata airbag recall and General Motors` faulty ignition switches.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATHISEN (voice-over): Cars and trucks are selling, almost 17 million sold this year. But recalls have auto makers reeling. The year`s biggest? About 18 million vehicles worldwide has to do with dangerous air bags made by a Japanese company, Takata. At least five deaths are blamed on those defective air bags and the recall list is still growing.</p><p>Manufacturers, meantime, have refocused on safety. In the wake of GM`s failure to deal with faulty ignition switches, blamed for some 40-plus deaths more than a decade ago. In its rearview mirror, GM can still see and feel the effects of a $35 million fine and a recall covering 15 million vehicles.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATHISEN: Phil LeBeau has been tracking the recalls and their impact on the industry and it comes to us from Chicago.</p><p>Phil, welcome.</p><p>It`s been a record year for recalls but how have those recalls affected the brands that have been hardest hit by them?</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Well, it`s certainly tarnished some of the brands. General Motors (NYSE:GM) has taken a hit. Honda because it`s linked so closely with Takata, has taken a hit.</p><p>But when you look at what`s happened in terms of people coming into the showrooms, it hasn`t slowed down sales at all. And that`s primarily because these recalls for the most part has impacted older models.</p><p>And when people go into a showroom, Tyler, they have short memories. If the model that`s on the floor is not under recall, they tend to look at these recalls and say, that`s somebody else`s problem or that`s a 2008 model. I`m not looking at that. I`m looking at a 2015 model.</p><p>MATHISEN: Right, some of the ignition switch recalls, particularly so on cars that in many cases aren`t even made anymore.</p><p>LEBEAU: Right. Correct.</p><p>MATHISEN: So, with so many of these recalls, Phil, are the cars less reliable or more reliable?</p><p>LEBEAU: Actually, cars are more reliable now than they were five, ten years ago. What`s happened, Tyler, is that the globalization of the auto industry means that you have fewer suppliers and so you have a commonality of parts, so that you have one part that goes bad, and take a look at the Takata airbags as a good example, that one part goes bad, it affects millions of vehicles. And that`s what we`re seeing now, and likely will see this in the future too when recalls are announced, it will impact millions of vehicles.</p><p>MATHISEN: Let`s talk about falling gasoline prices a little bit. I think it`s in part responsible for the fact we seem to be falling in love, once again, with SUVs. The Jeep Cherokee (NASDAQ:CHKE) had a great year.</p><p>So, talk to me about that and what those gas prices may mean for more fuel efficient cars like the hybrids.</p><p>LEBEAU: Well, something like the Toyota (NYSE:TM) Prius is a perfect example. We`re going to see lower sales for the Prius and for other hybrids, and we`re already seeing that this year. It`s tougher to convince people that they should pay a slight premium to buy more fuel efficient gas electric hybrid vehicle. It`s certainly tough, Tyler, because people can sit there and say, well, why don`t I buy a compact car, I won`t have to pay $3,000 more?</p><p>However, we should point out that fuel efficiency is now part of what people look for when they`re going into the showroom. So, it`s not as if people have forgotten about what happened ten years ago when we fell in love with gas guzzler, they`re still thinking about that, but we are tending to go back towards the SUVs.</p><p>MATHISEN: Do we know anything about the aluminum bodied F-150 truck and how it`s doing, supposedly more fuel-efficient?</p><p>LEBEAU: It`s expected to be more fuel-efficient. We won`t know how the public reacts to that new truck until well into next year. We`re just seeing them trickle into showrooms. The early reviews are very positive. But that`s usually with all new vehicles.</p><p>Talk to me in the middle of next year and we`ll see how the public embraces it.</p><p>MATHISEN: All right. We`ll get back to you, Phil. Thanks very much. Philip LeBeau in Chicago.</p><p>LEBEAU: You bet.</p><p>MATHISEN: Now to the hottest industry for mergers and acquisitions. This year, health care, a changing landscape and efforts to avoid U.S. corporate taxes through so-called inversion deals, made for a very busy year for some of the biggest drug makers?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN (voice-over): Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), the biggest names in big pharma, all the subjects of deal talk, big deals, with tens of billions of dollars this year.</p><p>One reason: pressure on their product pipeline. It had some looking for growth outside their own company. Another reason? Taxes. Companies that could relocate to overseas addresses often get a tax break. The Washington did begin to clamp down on the so-called inversion craze with new rules in September.</p><p>The biggest of the pharma deals involve the Botox maker, Allergan (NYSE:AGN). The hedge funder Bill Ackman engineered an offer worth more than $50 billion for the company, but Allergan (NYSE:AGN) steered away and this fall, Allergan (NYSE:AGN) accepted an offer to join with Ireland`s Actavis for $66 billion.</p><p>And that wasn`t all for Actavis, which already made a deal back in July to buy another American company, Forest Labs for $28 billion.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: And coming up, the Chinese e-commerce company that made its way to the New York Stock Exchange and became the biggest initial public offering ever.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN: Perhaps the biggest stock story of the year with Alibaba`s initial public offering. Not only did it introduce investors to its CEO Jack Ma, colorful guy, but it also claimed the title biggest IPO ever.</p><p>Kayla Tausche was at the New York Stock Exchange on the very day it started trading.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Alibaba is off and running. The Chinese ecommerce giant soaring above $90 in its debut after pricing for $68 a share.</p><p>The company founded in the apartment of entrepreneur Jack Ma in 1999 with just a dozen partners now responsible for 80 percent of China`s ecommerce and valued today by the public market in the United States at $240 billion.</p><p>Alibaba`s business model is often described as a mash up between Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), but it`s now is a formidable challenge to tech companies here in the U.S. It`s bigger than Disney (NYSE:DIS), IBM and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Chase.</p><p>But Ma said he draws inspiration from another U.S. corporation.</p><p>JACK MA, ALIBABA FOUNDER: We hope in the next 50 years, the world change because of that. We want to be bigger than Walmart. We want to be bigger -- it`s not just the size, we want to learn from Walmart. They changed the business last century. They stressed the B2C.</p><p>And we hope, 15 years later, they say, this is a company like a Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), like IBM, like Walmart. They changed and shaped the world.</p><p>TAUSCHE (on camera): Alibaba`s platform sold $259 billion in goods last year and its vendors were responsible for 60 percent of all packages shipped in China. Alibaba helped small businesses connect to new customers and in turn buttressing China`s middle class.</p><p>(voice-over): That`s the main reason why investors have been clamoring for shares. They`re willing to pay much more than the $68 IPO price set by the company, formally minting Hangzhou`s Jack Ma as the richest man in mainland China.</p><p>But his fight to grow Alibaba is still centered on the little guy, when he`s often reminded of by a famous movie character.</p><p>MA: The hero I had was Forrest Gump. And I watched the movie before I came here again, before -- for coming to New York, because I watched the movie again, telling me that no matter, whatever changed, you are you. And I`m still the guy 15 years ago.</p><p>TAUSCHE: Alibaba, of course, is now far bigger.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: And Kayla Tausche with us now for more on Alibaba and the other big tech stories of the year.</p><p>You know, Alibaba, the IPO, biggest ever, came off seemingly without a hitch. How did it change the landscape and the willingness for people to back these big IPOs?</p><p>TAUSCHE: You know, people were a little bit hesitant to see a company that was technically based in the Cayman Islands, with the bulk of its business in China, now trading here on U.S. soil. But investors really bought the story. They clamored to get the shares.</p><p>And when I talk to bankers on the day of the IPO, they said twice as many orders for shares of Alibaba coming from U.S. retail investors than they were for shares of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Tyler. This has become a household name and it`s really broken down the borders of ecommerce, this company that really was an upstart, came from nowhere, and all of the sudden, is bigger --</p><p>MATHISEN: Household name in China, but is it ever going to be a household name and a big player in the U.S.? What do you think?</p><p>TAUSCHE: The expectation is that it will and the demand from U.S. investors through their retail financial advisors trying to get these shares just shows you that it is starting to pick up a little bit. Now, it`s bigger than JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Chase. It`s bigger than Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).</p><p>MATHISEN: What?</p><p>TAUSCHE: When you think about that market cap, Jack Ma was just saying in that piece, he wants to be bigger than Walmart. Well, his stock already is.</p><p>MATHISEN: All right. Now, explain to me the other one that maybe on the radar screen for 2015, and that is Uber, the ride-sharing service. The valuations that are being tossed around for this company, if it does indeed go public this year, are astronomical for what I think is a taxi service. I don`t get it.</p><p>TAUSCHE: Well, the key to something like Uber and the reason why now is the time that a company like Uber can grow so much is this little tool right here, this smartphone. This wouldn`t have been the power behind a company like Uber were we talking about five years ago.</p><p>But Uber is now worth $40 billion. Just six months ago, it was worth $18 billion, which even then sounded like an astounding number. A year and a half, worth $3.5 billion but investors say the earnings back that up that Uber in a year`s time could make $10 billion in bookings because people say, hey, I don`t want to get stuck in traffic. I`d like to have someone drive me and --</p><p>MATHISEN: Do you use it?</p><p>TAUSCHE: I do.</p><p>MATHISEN: I use it too.</p><p>TAUSCHE: And if the cost is comparable to a taxi, why not?</p><p>MATHISEN: All right. Kayla, thanks very much. Have a good New Year. All right. Thanks, everybody, for watching this special holiday edition of NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT. I`m Tyler Mathisen. Have a great evening, everybody. And we`ll hope to see you right back here tomorrow night.</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

I'm Tyler Mathisen. Susie Gharib has the night off.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Well, 2014 is almost in the books and it's been filled with highs, many of them closing highs for the major indexes and lows like plummeting crude oil prices. But that wasn't all that happened this year in the world of business. The economy and the job market hit a number of milestones as well. The health care sector dominated deal making, recalls roiled the auto business and a Chinese e-commerce company called Alibaba became the biggest IPO ever.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight, we look back on 2014, the year that was.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN (voice-over): With the Dow notching record highs more than 30 times and the S&amp;P about 50, the bull market is now more than 5 years old. But 2013's perpetual push upward bumped into appear old acquaintance, volatility.</p><p>In November, stocks bounced up to new highs, but in December, there was another slide. Stock prices wavered just as the Federal Reserve prepared to end its economic stimulus program. Talk of the taper hung over the markets like a cloud a year ago. Now, it's still about the Fed but the question is when it will begin to push interest rates back up?</p><p>Can the economy handle higher interest rates? Well, employment numbers are better but real incomes really aren't and inflation is still below the Fed's target level of 2 percent.</p><p>One reason for the low inflation: a historic drop in the price of oil, down more than 45 percent from the year's high in June. Why? Well, it is simple and complex as the law of supply and demand. Supply is up. The U.S. alone has increased production 65 percent in just five years. Demand, though, is decidedly down, because the global economy is slowing.</p><p>Here at home, the drop in oil pushed gas prices down by a dollar a gallon and more in some places. Cheaper gas, of course, puts an estimated $100 billion back into the hands of U.S. consumers. That's about 60 bucks a month for the typical household. But is that enough to get them spending again? Money still tight for most of us.</p><p>So, where is the U.S. finding growth? Companies are still sitting on record piles of cash. Some of that money is staying overseas as the wait for U.S. corporate tax reform lingers on.</p><p>But there's plenty of money to invest in the latest technologies and corporate spending is helping to grow the economy. Tech is booming. Silicon Valley is a world leader. Apple's new iPhones are a huge hit. In Seattle, Boeing (NYSE:BA) gets orders for more than fuel efficient jets from all over the globe and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) expanded in New York City, which is suddenly flush with more than 4 million jobs, the most the Big Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has ever had.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Quite a year. And we'll start with Wall Street. The bull market, of course, proved it was alive and kicking. Major indexes closing at numerous records, almost too many to count, but it's hard to talk about the stock market without touching on what may be the biggest story of the year for investors, oil prices.</p><p>So, with us, Dom Chu to focus on the stock market, Jackie DeAngelis on energy.</p><p>Welcome to you both. Happy holidays.</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Happy holidays.</p><p>MATHISEN: Let me start with you, Dom. Sum it up in a few sentences for us.</p><p>DOMINIC CHU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: If you talk about the market, you cannot forget that we've hit record highs upon record highs, like you said.</p><p>So, as we look at what's happening in 2014, this bull run is very much intact. But it was this time around, it wasn't so much a lot of the technology names that we talked about before. It was health care that was a real driver for the market this time around. Those stocks, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals alike, a lot of deal-making like you said, all of that drove that to be the best performing sector in the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>Of course, with those record highs, a lot of investors are calling to question whether or not they can sustain that going into 2015. Of course, the trend has been positive for a lot of them so far.</p><p>MATHISEN: You know, and when you look at those sectors, almost all of them higher except the one you follow most closely, which is energy. And were not for the falling oil prices, presumably, energy would be higher.</p><p>CHU: It's been a huge drag, of course.</p><p>MATHISEN: Huge drag.</p><p>Lots of factors, we talked there in the piece about supply and demand. Is it really as simple as that?</p><p>DEANGELIS: It really is as simple as that. And, actually, I don't think investors were expecting energy to be the story that it was in the back half of the year.</p><p>It certainly was no secret that supply was ramping the way analysts were expecting it to. As a matter of fact, this year, we finally started producing over 9 million barrels a day. That is almost up to the point of what Saudi Arabia's output is. We never thought we'd be at that level.</p><p>At the same time, the demands part of the equation is what took us off guard. When the demand started to fall off, that's prices started to decline. The question right now is, how do we curtail the supply to be able to meet the demand? Does the demand equation change in 2015 so that supply should stay stable right now? These are all the unknowns.</p><p>MATHISEN: Let's talk a little bit about OPEC. Have they become irrelevant?</p><p>DEANGELIS: A lot of people are thinking the OPEC is becoming irrelevant but I would say the last meeting in November really changed the game. When they did not change their stance in terms of production and prices really tanked even further, OPEC was sort of showing some muscle and flexing it and saying, look, we're in this game.</p><p>MATHISEN: So, what's their end game? Is what they really to do, to squeeze out the higher cost U.S. producers or squeeze them so they scream?</p><p>DEANGELIS: I think what they're worried about for themselves is losing shares. So, right now, they're saying, we're going to eat the price decline but we are going to hold on to market share. And if that squeezes shale, it squeezes shale. This is going to be a game of chicken, every man for itself, and it could get really ugly.</p><p>MATHISEN: Back to stocks. Falling oil prices really thought to be a net positive for the economy.</p><p>CHU: Sure.</p><p>MATHISEN: But in recent weeks, as oil has receded, collapsed in some people's view --</p><p>CHU: Of course.</p><p>MATHISEN: -- equities hit a hard spot.</p><p>CHU: I mean, here, the numbers are quite staggering. Because just this quarter alone, the last quarter, and we're only in the middle, we haven't finished December at this point. By mid-December just in the S&amp;P 500 energy companies alone, that oil price decline left the decline in stocks of all varieties in the energy sector. So much so that just this quarter to date, we've lost about $265 billion, with a B, dollars worth of market values for these energy companies.</p><p>So, this slide in oil price is huge. But it's also important to remember that the driver for the economy right now, oil is a big part of it but it's smaller part of the overall index than say, technology and financial stocks. Those two sectors are the most heavily weighted in the index. You want to see leadership there. If oil prices can rebound, that's great as well.</p><p>MATHISEN: So, let's spin in ahead here.</p><p>Why don't you go first, Jackie? What is the outlook for energy prices over the first six months or all of 2015?</p><p>DEANGELIS: Well, for the first six months, certainly, analysts and traders alike are saying we could potentially go lower from here. Nobody really wants to call the bottom just yet until again, they get a sense of where this story is going, until some of the data shows us if the demand is going to come back on the table.</p><p>Having said that, people have also said to me, you know, once we do hit the bottom, maybe it's somewhere in the 40s. We will rebound quickly back to the $60 or $70 range. So, that probably could happen in the back half of the year.</p><p>MATHISEN: And for you, Dom, we got back last week guidance from the Fed on interest rates.</p><p>CHU: We did.</p><p>MATHISEN: What's the outlook for stock prices 2015?</p><p>CHU: Well, for 2015, what you're seeing a lot of experts say is that you're going to see the same level of valuation in the overall market, but it's going to match earnings' growth. Earnings growth is not expected to be gang-busters but it's still expected to grow. So, a lot of experts are seeing, yes, gains in the stock market. But you're not talking about the 10 percent, 15 percent, 20 percent return varieties. You're talking about --</p><p>MATHISEN: The profit growth and dividend.</p><p>CHU: -- maybe that 5 percent, 6 percent, 7 percent. Yes.</p><p>MATHISEN: Dom and Jackie, thanks very much. Appreciate it.</p><p>All righty. Now, to the economy, which is being helped by those low energy prices we just mentioned. But they didn't start out that way. If anything, the brutal winners slammed the brakes on much of the country's economic activity. But then the growth engine was turned on.</p><p>Steve Liesman reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Five long years after the end of the recession, a period marked by sluggish growth and stubbornly high unemployment, the U.S. economy may have turned a corner in 2014. Beginning the year with a surprise decline in growth, attributed to weather but causing many to say, here we go again. The U.S. economy proceeded to rocket ahead, tallying its best two quarters of growth since in 2003, and on track for its best year of job gains since 2000.</p><p>Unlike previous post-crisis growth spurts, this time it didn't appear, the gains would be given back.</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It's pretty hard to find an economic measure where we're not significantly better off. I don't have to tell you about the stock market and where that's gone, corporate profits, record highs. But also, unemployment now lower than it was previously. We've seen the housing market recover, although not as fast as we'd like, the auto industry recovering. We remain the most dynamic, innovative economy in the world.</p><p>LIESMAN: Indeed, the U.S. looks like the shining city on the hill compared to other places around the world like Europe which teetered on the verge of recession and China, where the growth was reduced. The differences were apparent in monetary policy, where the Federal Reserve took the momentous steps this year of ending its open-ended quantitative easing or bond buying program launched in September 2012.</p><p>JANET YELLEN, U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIR: Looking at unfolding economic development and as the economy strengthens, and we come closer to achieving our objectives, I think it's very likely that we will, you know, progress on the path of normalizing policy.</p><p>LIESMAN: At the same time, the European central bank looks up to take its first step into a U.S. style Q.E. program to kick-start its economy.</p><p>MARIO DRAGHI, ECB PRESIDENT: The Q.E. program, which could include sovereign bonds, falls within our mandate, or better, is a eligible instrument that we could use in the pursue of our mandate. Not to pursue our mandate would be legal.</p><p>LIESMAN: Next year looks to be one where the Fed takes another step towards normalcy, possibly raising interest rates for the first time in eight years. But it's not without risk, if 2014 turns out to be another false start, the Fed could be moving too early. But if growth continues to be strong, the Fed could find itself behind the curve.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Steve Liesman in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: One major component of the economy, the job market, and this year, American businesses picked up their pace of hiring, turning 2014 into a solid year for job growth.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN (voice-over): A year ago, the national unemployment rate stood at 6.7 percent. Now, it's down to 5.8 percent, the lowest it's been since July of 2008. In November alone, U.S. employers added more than 320,000 jobs and 2014 is on track now to become the strongest hiring year since way back in 1999. The gains have come across all the major sectors with professional services like accountants and engineers leading the way.</p><p>Wages though have barely budged in seven years and though there have been signs of improvement recently, they are still barely keeping pace with inflation.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Hampton Pearson has been covering the job market for us all year and he comes to us now from Washington, D.C.</p><p>So, Hamp, we mentioned a couple of things that we're strong points in job creation. But from where you sit, what drove job creation this past year?</p><p>HAMPTON PEARSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Well, it was sort of a \"Little Engine That Could\" syndrome, if you will, looking at all those numbers. By the way, this time last year, the month of December produced only 84,000 jobs and at the close of the Fed meeting this year, we had the Fed chairman trumping the last three months of 2014, we've averaged 280,000.</p><p>But to get to the core of your question, it started out with jobs essentially that did not pay all that well. It became widespread and we're now at a point where, again, there's some competition for skilled labor and skilled jobs and that's actually beginning to produce some wage growth along the way as well.</p><p>And I think better job and better paying jobs will really have to be the job story of 2015.</p><p>MATHISEN: You hinted at the answer to the next question, which is about the quality of the jobs created, and you seem to be suggesting that they keep getting better and better and better.</p><p>PEARSON: Yes, we even in the November jobs report, we had a four tenths of an increase in average hourly earnings. That doesn't sound like much, but it's one of the biggest monthly increases we've seen in quite a few years. However, year over year, we're only talking about 2 percent wage growth.</p><p>The Fed said it can live with 3 percent wage growth and still hit 2 percent inflation target. So, lots of room from a Fed standpoint, for wages to grow, and really, I think, you need the more spending power in the hands of consumers to keep the overall economy growing.</p><p>MATHISEN: So, what will it take to keep the job growth going and what could potentially throw a wrench into it?</p><p>PEARSON: More of the same, especially that near term hike we're all getting now from lower oil prices, putting more money in people's pockets. That too is going to boost the total demand figures in early January when we started to see what kind of holiday season we've had going forward.</p><p>But the road blocks along the way are, still tight labor market in some respect. Is this growth for real? Can it be sustained? You know, have we really turned a big corner here?</p><p>MATHISEN: All right, Hampton. Thank you very much. Happy holidays. Hampton Pearson --</p><p>PEARSON: Same to you.</p><p>MATHISEN: You bet -- in Washington for us.</p><p>Still ahead: the auto industry was hit by major recalls this past year, but were buyers scared away from the brands that were hit hardest?</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN: The auto industry facing some of the biggest safety controversies in its history. It's been a big year and a big focus for investors, drivers, and regulators. Topping the list, recalls of two of the biggest, the Takata airbag recall and General Motors' faulty ignition switches.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATHISEN (voice-over): Cars and trucks are selling, almost 17 million sold this year. But recalls have auto makers reeling. The year's biggest? About 18 million vehicles worldwide has to do with dangerous air bags made by a Japanese company, Takata. At least five deaths are blamed on those defective air bags and the recall list is still growing.</p><p>Manufacturers, meantime, have refocused on safety. In the wake of GM's failure to deal with faulty ignition switches, blamed for some 40-plus deaths more than a decade ago. In its rearview mirror, GM can still see and feel the effects of a $35 million fine and a recall covering 15 million vehicles.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATHISEN: Phil LeBeau has been tracking the recalls and their impact on the industry and it comes to us from Chicago.</p><p>Phil, welcome.</p><p>It's been a record year for recalls but how have those recalls affected the brands that have been hardest hit by them?</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Well, it's certainly tarnished some of the brands. General Motors (NYSE:GM) has taken a hit. Honda because it's linked so closely with Takata, has taken a hit.</p><p>But when you look at what's happened in terms of people coming into the showrooms, it hasn't slowed down sales at all. And that's primarily because these recalls for the most part has impacted older models.</p><p>And when people go into a showroom, Tyler, they have short memories. If the model that's on the floor is not under recall, they tend to look at these recalls and say, that's somebody else's problem or that's a 2008 model. I'm not looking at that. I'm looking at a 2015 model.</p><p>MATHISEN: Right, some of the ignition switch recalls, particularly so on cars that in many cases aren't even made anymore.</p><p>LEBEAU: Right. Correct.</p><p>MATHISEN: So, with so many of these recalls, Phil, are the cars less reliable or more reliable?</p><p>LEBEAU: Actually, cars are more reliable now than they were five, ten years ago. What's happened, Tyler, is that the globalization of the auto industry means that you have fewer suppliers and so you have a commonality of parts, so that you have one part that goes bad, and take a look at the Takata airbags as a good example, that one part goes bad, it affects millions of vehicles. And that's what we're seeing now, and likely will see this in the future too when recalls are announced, it will impact millions of vehicles.</p><p>MATHISEN: Let's talk about falling gasoline prices a little bit. I think it's in part responsible for the fact we seem to be falling in love, once again, with SUVs. The Jeep Cherokee (NASDAQ:CHKE) had a great year.</p><p>So, talk to me about that and what those gas prices may mean for more fuel efficient cars like the hybrids.</p><p>LEBEAU: Well, something like the Toyota (NYSE:TM) Prius is a perfect example. We're going to see lower sales for the Prius and for other hybrids, and we're already seeing that this year. It's tougher to convince people that they should pay a slight premium to buy more fuel efficient gas electric hybrid vehicle. It's certainly tough, Tyler, because people can sit there and say, well, why don't I buy a compact car, I won't have to pay $3,000 more?</p><p>However, we should point out that fuel efficiency is now part of what people look for when they're going into the showroom. So, it's not as if people have forgotten about what happened ten years ago when we fell in love with gas guzzler, they're still thinking about that, but we are tending to go back towards the SUVs.</p><p>MATHISEN: Do we know anything about the aluminum bodied F-150 truck and how it's doing, supposedly more fuel-efficient?</p><p>LEBEAU: It's expected to be more fuel-efficient. We won't know how the public reacts to that new truck until well into next year. We're just seeing them trickle into showrooms. The early reviews are very positive. But that's usually with all new vehicles.</p><p>Talk to me in the middle of next year and we'll see how the public embraces it.</p><p>MATHISEN: All right. We'll get back to you, Phil. Thanks very much. Philip LeBeau in Chicago.</p><p>LEBEAU: You bet.</p><p>MATHISEN: Now to the hottest industry for mergers and acquisitions. This year, health care, a changing landscape and efforts to avoid U.S. corporate taxes through so-called inversion deals, made for a very busy year for some of the biggest drug makers?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN (voice-over): Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), the biggest names in big pharma, all the subjects of deal talk, big deals, with tens of billions of dollars this year.</p><p>One reason: pressure on their product pipeline. It had some looking for growth outside their own company. Another reason? Taxes. Companies that could relocate to overseas addresses often get a tax break. The Washington did begin to clamp down on the so-called inversion craze with new rules in September.</p><p>The biggest of the pharma deals involve the Botox maker, Allergan (NYSE:AGN). The hedge funder Bill Ackman engineered an offer worth more than $50 billion for the company, but Allergan (NYSE:AGN) steered away and this fall, Allergan (NYSE:AGN) accepted an offer to join with Ireland's Actavis for $66 billion.</p><p>And that wasn't all for Actavis, which already made a deal back in July to buy another American company, Forest Labs for $28 billion.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: And coming up, the Chinese e-commerce company that made its way to the New York Stock Exchange and became the biggest initial public offering ever.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN: Perhaps the biggest stock story of the year with Alibaba's initial public offering. Not only did it introduce investors to its CEO Jack Ma, colorful guy, but it also claimed the title biggest IPO ever.</p><p>Kayla Tausche was at the New York Stock Exchange on the very day it started trading.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Alibaba is off and running. The Chinese ecommerce giant soaring above $90 in its debut after pricing for $68 a share.</p><p>The company founded in the apartment of entrepreneur Jack Ma in 1999 with just a dozen partners now responsible for 80 percent of China's ecommerce and valued today by the public market in the United States at $240 billion.</p><p>Alibaba's business model is often described as a mash up between Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), but it's now is a formidable challenge to tech companies here in the U.S. It's bigger than Disney (NYSE:DIS), IBM and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Chase.</p><p>But Ma said he draws inspiration from another U.S. corporation.</p><p>JACK MA, ALIBABA FOUNDER: We hope in the next 50 years, the world change because of that. We want to be bigger than Walmart. We want to be bigger -- it's not just the size, we want to learn from Walmart. They changed the business last century. They stressed the B2C.</p><p>And we hope, 15 years later, they say, this is a company like a Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), like IBM, like Walmart. They changed and shaped the world.</p><p>TAUSCHE (on camera): Alibaba's platform sold $259 billion in goods last year and its vendors were responsible for 60 percent of all packages shipped in China. Alibaba helped small businesses connect to new customers and in turn buttressing China's middle class.</p><p>(voice-over): That's the main reason why investors have been clamoring for shares. They're willing to pay much more than the $68 IPO price set by the company, formally minting Hangzhou's Jack Ma as the richest man in mainland China.</p><p>But his fight to grow Alibaba is still centered on the little guy, when he's often reminded of by a famous movie character.</p><p>MA: The hero I had was Forrest Gump. And I watched the movie before I came here again, before -- for coming to New York, because I watched the movie again, telling me that no matter, whatever changed, you are you. And I'm still the guy 15 years ago.</p><p>TAUSCHE: Alibaba, of course, is now far bigger.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: And Kayla Tausche with us now for more on Alibaba and the other big tech stories of the year.</p><p>You know, Alibaba, the IPO, biggest ever, came off seemingly without a hitch. How did it change the landscape and the willingness for people to back these big IPOs?</p><p>TAUSCHE: You know, people were a little bit hesitant to see a company that was technically based in the Cayman Islands, with the bulk of its business in China, now trading here on U.S. soil. But investors really bought the story. They clamored to get the shares.</p><p>And when I talk to bankers on the day of the IPO, they said twice as many orders for shares of Alibaba coming from U.S. retail investors than they were for shares of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Tyler. This has become a household name and it's really broken down the borders of ecommerce, this company that really was an upstart, came from nowhere, and all of the sudden, is bigger --</p><p>MATHISEN: Household name in China, but is it ever going to be a household name and a big player in the U.S.? What do you think?</p><p>TAUSCHE: The expectation is that it will and the demand from U.S. investors through their retail financial advisors trying to get these shares just shows you that it is starting to pick up a little bit. Now, it's bigger than JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Chase. It's bigger than Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).</p><p>MATHISEN: What?</p><p>TAUSCHE: When you think about that market cap, Jack Ma was just saying in that piece, he wants to be bigger than Walmart. Well, his stock already is.</p><p>MATHISEN: All right. Now, explain to me the other one that maybe on the radar screen for 2015, and that is Uber, the ride-sharing service. The valuations that are being tossed around for this company, if it does indeed go public this year, are astronomical for what I think is a taxi service. I don't get it.</p><p>TAUSCHE: Well, the key to something like Uber and the reason why now is the time that a company like Uber can grow so much is this little tool right here, this smartphone. This wouldn't have been the power behind a company like Uber were we talking about five years ago.</p><p>But Uber is now worth $40 billion. Just six months ago, it was worth $18 billion, which even then sounded like an astounding number. A year and a half, worth $3.5 billion but investors say the earnings back that up that Uber in a year's time could make $10 billion in bookings because people say, hey, I don't want to get stuck in traffic. I'd like to have someone drive me and --</p><p>MATHISEN: Do you use it?</p><p>TAUSCHE: I do.</p><p>MATHISEN: I use it too.</p><p>TAUSCHE: And if the cost is comparable to a taxi, why not?</p><p>MATHISEN: All right. Kayla, thanks very much. Have a good New Year. All right. Thanks, everybody, for watching this special holiday edition of NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT. I'm Tyler Mathisen. Have a great evening, everybody. And we'll hope to see you right back here tomorrow night.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Susie  Gharib has the night off.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Well, 2014 is almost in the books and it's been filled with highs,  many of them closing highs for the major indexes and lows like plummeting  crude oil prices.  But that wasn't all that happened this year in the world  of business.  The economy and the job market hit a number of milestones as  well.  The health care sector dominated deal making, recalls roiled the  auto business and a Chinese e-commerce company called Alibaba became the  biggest IPO ever.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Tonight, we look back on 2014, the year that was.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  MATHISEN (voice-over):  With the Dow notching record highs more than  30 times and the S&amp;P about 50, the bull market is now more than 5 years  old.  But 2013's perpetual push upward bumped into appear old acquaintance,  volatility.  </p><p>  In November, stocks bounced up to new highs, but in December, there  was another slide.  Stock prices wavered just as the Federal Reserve  prepared to end its economic stimulus program.  Talk of the taper hung over  the markets like a cloud a year ago.  Now, it's still about the Fed but the  question is when it will begin to push interest rates back up?  </p><p>  Can the economy handle higher interest rates?  Well, employment  numbers are better but real incomes really aren't and inflation is still  below the Fed's target level of 2 percent.  </p><p>  One reason for the low inflation: a historic drop in the price of oil,  down more than 45 percent from the year's high in June.  Why?  Well, it is  simple and complex as the law of supply and demand.  Supply is up.  The  U.S. alone has increased production 65 percent in just five years.  Demand,  though, is decidedly down, because the global economy is slowing.  </p><p>  Here at home, the drop in oil pushed gas prices down by a dollar a  gallon and more in some places.  Cheaper gas, of course, puts an estimated  $100 billion back into the hands of U.S. consumers.  That's about 60 bucks  a month for the typical household.  But is that enough to get them spending  again?  Money still tight for most of us.  </p><p>  So, where is the U.S. finding growth?  Companies are still sitting on  record piles of cash.  Some of that money is staying overseas as the wait  for U.S. corporate tax reform lingers on.  </p><p>  But there's plenty of money to invest in the latest technologies and  corporate spending is helping to grow the economy.  Tech is booming.   Silicon Valley is a world leader.  Apple's new iPhones are a huge hit.  In  Seattle, Boeing (NYSE:BA) gets orders for more than fuel efficient jets  from all over the globe and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) expanded in New York City,  which is suddenly flush with more than 4 million jobs, the most the Big  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has ever had.  </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  MATHISEN:  Quite a year.  And we'll start with Wall Street.  The bull  market, of course, proved it was alive and kicking.  Major indexes closing  at numerous records, almost too many to count, but it's hard to talk about  the stock market without touching on what may be the biggest story of the  year for investors, oil prices.  </p><p>  So, with us, Dom Chu to focus on the stock market, Jackie DeAngelis on  energy.  </p><p>  Welcome to you both.  Happy holidays.  </p><p>  JACKIE DEANGELIS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Happy  holidays.</p><p>  MATHISEN:  Let me start with you, Dom.  Sum it up in a few sentences  for us. </p><p>  DOMINIC CHU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  If you talk about  the market, you cannot forget that we've hit record highs upon record  highs, like you said.  </p><p>  So, as we look at what's happening in 2014, this bull run is very much  intact.  But it was this time around, it wasn't so much a lot of the  technology names that we talked about before.  It was health care that was  a real driver for the market this time around.  Those stocks,  biotechnology, pharmaceuticals alike, a lot of deal-making like you said,  all of that drove that to be the best performing sector in the S&amp;P 500.  </p><p>  Of course, with those record highs, a lot of investors are calling to  question whether or not they can sustain that going into 2015.  Of course,  the trend has been positive for a lot of them so far.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  You know, and when you look at those sectors, almost all of  them higher except the one you follow most closely, which is energy.  And  were not for the falling oil prices, presumably, energy would be higher. </p><p>  CHU:  It's been a huge drag, of course.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  Huge drag.  </p><p>  Lots of factors, we talked there in the piece about supply and demand.   Is it really as simple as that?  </p><p>  DEANGELIS:  It really is as simple as that.  And, actually, I don't  think investors were expecting energy to be the story that it was in the  back half of the year.  </p><p>  It certainly was no secret that supply was ramping the way analysts  were expecting it to.  As a matter of fact, this year, we finally started  producing over 9 million barrels a day.  That is almost up to the point of  what Saudi Arabia's output is.  We never thought we'd be at that level.  </p><p>  At the same time, the demands part of the equation is what took us off  guard.  When the demand started to fall off, that's prices started to  decline.  The question right now is, how do we curtail the supply to be  able to meet the demand?  Does the demand equation change in 2015 so that  supply should stay stable right now?  These are all the unknowns.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  Let's talk a little bit about OPEC.  Have they become  irrelevant?</p><p>  DEANGELIS:  A lot of people are thinking the OPEC is becoming  irrelevant but I would say the last meeting in November really changed the  game.  When they did not change their stance in terms of production and  prices really tanked even further, OPEC was sort of showing some muscle and  flexing it and saying, look, we're in this game.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  So, what's their end game?  Is what they really to do, to  squeeze out the higher cost U.S. producers or squeeze them so they scream?  </p><p>  DEANGELIS:  I think what they're worried about for themselves is  losing shares.  So, right now, they're saying, we're going to eat the price  decline but we are going to hold on to market share.  And if that squeezes  shale, it squeezes shale.  This is going to be a game of chicken, every man  for itself, and it could get really ugly.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  Back to stocks.  Falling oil prices really thought to be a  net positive for the economy.  </p><p>  CHU:  Sure.</p><p>  MATHISEN:  But in recent weeks, as oil has receded, collapsed in some  people's view -- </p><p>  CHU:  Of course.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  -- equities hit a hard spot.  </p><p>  CHU:  I mean, here, the numbers are quite staggering.  Because just  this quarter alone, the last quarter, and we're only in the middle, we  haven't finished December at this point.  By mid-December just in the S&amp;P  500 energy companies alone, that oil price decline left the decline in  stocks of all varieties in the energy sector.  So much so that just this  quarter to date, we've lost about $265 billion, with a B, dollars worth of  market values for these energy companies.  </p><p>  So, this slide in oil price is huge.  But it's also important to  remember that the driver for the economy right now, oil is a big part of it  but it's smaller part of the overall index than say, technology and  financial stocks.  Those two sectors are the most heavily weighted in the  index.  You want to see leadership there.  If oil prices can rebound,  that's great as well.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  So, let's spin in ahead here.  </p><p>  Why don't you go first, Jackie?  What is the outlook for energy prices  over the first six months or all of 2015?  </p><p>  DEANGELIS:  Well, for the first six months, certainly, analysts and  traders alike are saying we could potentially go lower from here.  Nobody  really wants to call the bottom just yet until again, they get a sense of  where this story is going, until some of the data shows us if the demand is  going to come back on the table.  </p><p>  Having said that, people have also said to me, you know, once we do  hit the bottom, maybe it's somewhere in the 40s.  We will rebound quickly  back to the $60 or $70 range.  So, that probably could happen in the back  half of the year.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  And for you, Dom, we got back last week guidance from the  Fed on interest rates.  </p><p>  CHU:  We did.</p><p>  MATHISEN:  What's the outlook for stock prices 2015?  </p><p>  CHU:  Well, for 2015, what you're seeing a lot of experts say is that  you're going to see the same level of valuation in the overall market, but  it's going to match earnings' growth.  Earnings growth is not expected to  be gang-busters but it's still expected to grow.  So, a lot of experts are  seeing, yes, gains in the stock market.  But you're not talking about the  10 percent, 15 percent, 20 percent return varieties.  You're talking about  -- </p><p>  MATHISEN:  The profit growth and dividend.  </p><p>  CHU:  -- maybe that 5 percent, 6 percent, 7 percent.  Yes.</p><p>  MATHISEN:  Dom and Jackie, thanks very much.  Appreciate it.  </p><p>  All righty.  Now, to the economy, which is being helped by those low  energy prices we just mentioned.  But they didn't start out that way.  If  anything, the brutal winners slammed the brakes on much of the country's  economic activity.  But then the growth engine was turned on.</p><p>  Steve Liesman reports.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   Five long years after the end of the recession, a period marked by sluggish  growth and stubbornly high unemployment, the U.S. economy may have turned a  corner in 2014.  Beginning the year with a surprise decline in growth,  attributed to weather but causing many to say, here we go again.  The U.S.  economy proceeded to rocket ahead, tallying its best two quarters of growth  since in 2003, and on track for its best year of job gains since 2000.  </p><p>  Unlike previous post-crisis growth spurts, this time it didn't appear,  the gains would be given back.  </p><p>  BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It's pretty hard to  find an economic measure where we're not significantly better off.  I don't  have to tell you about the stock market and where that's gone, corporate  profits, record highs.  But also, unemployment now lower than it was  previously.  We've seen the housing market recover, although not as fast as  we'd like, the auto industry recovering.  We remain the most dynamic,  innovative economy in the world.  </p><p>  LIESMAN:  Indeed, the U.S. looks like the shining city on the hill  compared to other places around the world like Europe which teetered on the  verge of recession and China, where the growth was reduced.  The  differences were apparent in monetary policy, where the Federal Reserve  took the momentous steps this year of ending its open-ended quantitative  easing or bond buying program launched in September 2012.  </p><p>  JANET YELLEN, U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIR:  Looking at unfolding  economic development and as the economy strengthens, and we come closer to  achieving our objectives, I think it's very likely that we will, you know,  progress on the path of normalizing policy.  </p><p>  LIESMAN:  At the same time, the European central bank looks up to take  its first step into a U.S. style Q.E. program to kick-start its economy.  </p><p>  MARIO DRAGHI, ECB PRESIDENT:  The Q.E. program, which could include  sovereign bonds, falls within our mandate, or better, is a eligible  instrument that we could use in the pursue of our mandate.  Not to pursue  our mandate would be legal.  </p><p>  LIESMAN:  Next year looks to be one where the Fed takes another step  towards normalcy, possibly raising interest rates for the first time in  eight years.  But it's not without risk, if 2014 turns out to be another  false start, the Fed could be moving too early.  But if growth continues to  be strong, the Fed could find itself behind the curve.  </p><p>  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Steve Liesman in Washington.  </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  MATHISEN:  One major component of the economy, the job market, and  this year, American businesses picked up their pace of hiring, turning 2014  into a solid year for job growth.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  MATHISEN (voice-over):  A year ago, the national unemployment rate  stood at 6.7 percent.  Now, it's down to 5.8 percent, the lowest it's been  since July of 2008.  In November alone, U.S. employers added more than  320,000 jobs and 2014 is on track now to become the strongest hiring year  since way back in 1999.  The gains have come across all the major sectors  with professional services like accountants and engineers leading the way. </p><p>  Wages though have barely budged in seven years and though there have  been signs of improvement recently, they are still barely keeping pace with  inflation.  </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  MATHISEN:  Hampton Pearson has been covering the job market for us all  year and he comes to us now from Washington, D.C.</p><p>  So, Hamp, we mentioned a couple of things that we're strong points in  job creation.  But from where you sit, what drove job creation this past  year?  </p><p>  HAMPTON PEARSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Well, it was  sort of a \"Little Engine That Could\" syndrome, if you will, looking at all  those numbers.  By the way, this time last year, the month of December  produced only 84,000 jobs and at the close of the Fed meeting this year, we  had the Fed chairman trumping the last three months of 2014, we've averaged  280,000.  </p><p>  But to get to the core of your question, it started out with jobs  essentially that did not pay all that well.  It became widespread and we're  now at a point where, again, there's some competition for skilled labor and  skilled jobs and that's actually beginning to produce some wage growth  along the way as well.  </p><p>  And I think better job and better paying jobs will really have to be  the job story of 2015.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  You hinted at the answer to the next question, which is  about the quality of the jobs created, and you seem to be suggesting that  they keep getting better and better and better.  </p><p>  PEARSON:  Yes, we even in the November jobs report, we had a four  tenths of an increase in average hourly earnings.  That doesn't sound like  much, but it's one of the biggest monthly increases we've seen in quite a  few years.  However, year over year, we're only talking about 2 percent  wage growth.  </p><p>  The Fed said it can live with 3 percent wage growth and still hit 2  percent inflation target.  So, lots of room from a Fed standpoint, for  wages to grow, and really, I think, you need the more spending power in the  hands of consumers to keep the overall economy growing.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  So, what will it take to keep the job growth going and what  could potentially throw a wrench into it?  </p><p>  PEARSON:  More of the same, especially that near term hike we're all  getting now from lower oil prices, putting more money in people's pockets.   That too is going to boost the total demand figures in early January when  we started to see what kind of holiday season we've had going forward.  </p><p>  But the road blocks along the way are, still tight labor market in  some respect.  Is this growth for real?  Can it be sustained?  You know,  have we really turned a big corner here?  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  All right, Hampton.  Thank you very much.  Happy holidays.   Hampton Pearson --  </p><p>  PEARSON:  Same to you.</p><p>  MATHISEN:  You bet -- in Washington for us.  </p><p>  Still ahead: the auto industry was hit by major recalls this past  year, but were buyers scared away from the brands that were hit hardest?  </p><p>  (MUSIC)</p><p>  MATHISEN:  The auto industry facing some of the biggest safety  controversies in its history.  It's been a big year and a big focus for  investors, drivers, and regulators.  Topping the list, recalls of two of  the biggest, the Takata airbag recall and General Motors' faulty ignition  switches.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  MATHISEN (voice-over):  Cars and trucks are selling, almost 17 million  sold this year.  But recalls have auto makers reeling.  The year's biggest?   About 18 million vehicles worldwide has to do with dangerous air bags made  by a Japanese company, Takata.  At least five deaths are blamed on those  defective air bags and the recall list is still growing.  </p><p>  Manufacturers, meantime, have refocused on safety.  In the wake of  GM's failure to deal with faulty ignition switches, blamed for some 40-plus  deaths more than a decade ago.  In its rearview mirror, GM can still see  and feel the effects of a $35 million fine and a recall covering 15 million  vehicles.  </p><p>  (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>  MATHISEN:  Phil LeBeau has been tracking the recalls and their impact  on the industry and it comes to us from Chicago.  </p><p>  Phil, welcome.  </p><p>  It's been a record year for recalls but how have those recalls  affected the brands that have been hardest hit by them?  </p><p>  PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Well, it's  certainly tarnished some of the brands.  General Motors (NYSE:GM) has taken  a hit.  Honda because it's linked so closely with Takata, has taken a hit.</p><p>  But when you look at what's happened in terms of people coming into  the showrooms, it hasn't slowed down sales at all.  And that's primarily  because these recalls for the most part has impacted older models.  </p><p>  And when people go into a showroom, Tyler, they have short memories.   If the model that's on the floor is not under recall, they tend to look at  these recalls and say, that's somebody else's problem or that's a 2008  model.  I'm not looking at that.  I'm looking at a 2015 model.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  Right, some of the ignition switch recalls, particularly so  on cars that in many cases aren't even made anymore.  </p><p>  LEBEAU:  Right.  Correct.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  So, with so many of these recalls, Phil, are the cars less  reliable or more reliable?  </p><p>  LEBEAU:  Actually, cars are more reliable now than they were five, ten  years ago.  What's happened, Tyler, is that the globalization of the auto  industry means that you have fewer suppliers and so you have a commonality  of parts, so that you have one part that goes bad, and take a look at the  Takata airbags as a good example, that one part goes bad, it affects  millions of vehicles.  And that's what we're seeing now, and likely will  see this in the future too when recalls are announced, it will impact  millions of vehicles.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  Let's talk about falling gasoline prices a little bit.  I  think it's in part responsible for the fact we seem to be falling in love,  once again, with SUVs.  The Jeep Cherokee (NASDAQ:CHKE) had a great year.  </p><p>  So, talk to me about that and what those gas prices may mean for more  fuel efficient cars like the hybrids.  </p><p>  LEBEAU:  Well, something like the Toyota (NYSE:TM) Prius is a perfect  example.  We're going to see lower sales for the Prius and for other  hybrids, and we're already seeing that this year.  It's tougher to convince  people that they should pay a slight premium to buy more fuel efficient gas  electric hybrid vehicle.  It's certainly tough, Tyler, because people can  sit there and say, well, why don't I buy a compact car, I won't have to pay  $3,000 more?  </p><p>  However, we should point out that fuel efficiency is now part of what  people look for when they're going into the showroom.  So, it's not as if  people have forgotten about what happened ten years ago when we fell in  love with gas guzzler, they're still thinking about that, but we are  tending to go back towards the SUVs.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  Do we know anything about the aluminum bodied F-150 truck  and how it's doing, supposedly more fuel-efficient?</p><p>  LEBEAU:  It's expected to be more fuel-efficient.  We won't know how  the public reacts to that new truck until well into next year.  We're just  seeing them trickle into showrooms.  The early reviews are very positive.   But that's usually with all new vehicles.  </p><p>  Talk to me in the middle of next year and we'll see how the public  embraces it.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  All right.  We'll get back to you, Phil.  Thanks very much.   Philip LeBeau in Chicago.  </p><p>  LEBEAU:  You bet.</p><p>  MATHISEN:  Now to the hottest industry for mergers and acquisitions.   This year, health care, a changing landscape and efforts to avoid U.S.  corporate taxes through so-called inversion deals, made for a very busy  year for some of the biggest drug makers?  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  MATHISEN (voice-over):  Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline,  Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), the biggest names in big pharma, all the subjects of  deal talk, big deals, with tens of billions of dollars this year.  </p><p>  One reason: pressure on their product pipeline.  It had some looking  for growth outside their own company.  Another reason?  Taxes.  Companies  that could relocate to overseas addresses often get a tax break.  The  Washington did begin to clamp down on the so-called inversion craze with  new rules in September.  </p><p>  The biggest of the pharma deals involve the Botox maker, Allergan  (NYSE:AGN).  The hedge funder Bill Ackman engineered an offer worth more  than $50 billion for the company, but Allergan (NYSE:AGN) steered away and  this fall, Allergan (NYSE:AGN) accepted an offer to join with Ireland's  Actavis for $66 billion.</p><p>  And that wasn't all for Actavis, which already made a deal back in  July to buy another American company, Forest Labs for $28 billion.  </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  MATHISEN:  And coming up, the Chinese e-commerce company that made its  way to the New York Stock Exchange and became the biggest initial public  offering ever.  </p><p>  (MUSIC)</p><p>  MATHISEN:  Perhaps the biggest stock story of the year with Alibaba's  initial public offering.  Not only did it introduce investors to its CEO  Jack Ma, colorful guy, but it also claimed the title biggest IPO ever.  </p><p>  Kayla Tausche was at the New York Stock Exchange on the very day it  started trading.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   Alibaba is off and running.  The Chinese ecommerce giant soaring above $90  in its debut after pricing for $68 a share. </p><p>  The company founded in the apartment of entrepreneur Jack Ma in 1999  with just a dozen partners now responsible for 80 percent of China's  ecommerce and valued today by the public market in the United States at  $240 billion.  </p><p>  Alibaba's business model is often described as a mash up between  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), but it's now is a formidable  challenge to tech companies here in the U.S.  It's bigger than Disney  (NYSE:DIS), IBM and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Chase.  </p><p>  But Ma said he draws inspiration from another U.S. corporation.</p><p>  JACK MA, ALIBABA FOUNDER:  We hope in the next 50 years, the world  change because of that.  We want to be bigger than Walmart.  We want to be  bigger -- it's not just the size, we want to learn from Walmart.  They  changed the business last century.  They stressed the B2C.</p><p>  And we hope, 15 years later, they say, this is a company like a  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), like IBM, like Walmart.  They changed and shaped  the world.  </p><p>  TAUSCHE (on camera):  Alibaba's platform sold $259 billion in goods  last year and its vendors were responsible for 60 percent of all packages  shipped in China.  Alibaba helped small businesses connect to new customers  and in turn buttressing China's middle class.</p><p>  (voice-over): That's the main reason why investors have been clamoring  for shares.  They're willing to pay much more than the $68 IPO price set by  the company, formally minting Hangzhou's Jack Ma as the richest man in  mainland China. </p><p>  But his fight to grow Alibaba is still centered on the little guy,  when he's often reminded of by a famous movie character.</p><p>  MA:  The hero I had was Forrest Gump.  And I watched the movie before  I came here again, before -- for coming to New York, because I watched the  movie again, telling me that no matter, whatever changed, you are you.  And  I'm still the guy 15 years ago.  </p><p>  TAUSCHE:  Alibaba, of course, is now far bigger.  </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  MATHISEN:  And Kayla Tausche with us now for more on Alibaba and the  other big tech stories of the year.  </p><p>  You know, Alibaba, the IPO, biggest ever, came off seemingly without a  hitch.  How did it change the landscape and the willingness for people to  back these big IPOs?  </p><p>  TAUSCHE:  You know, people were a little bit hesitant to see a company  that was technically based in the Cayman Islands, with the bulk of its  business in China, now trading here on U.S. soil.  But investors really  bought the story.  They clamored to get the shares.</p><p>  And when I talk to bankers on the day of the IPO, they said twice as  many orders for shares of Alibaba coming from U.S. retail investors than  they were for shares of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Tyler.  This has become a  household name and it's really broken down the borders of ecommerce, this  company that really was an upstart, came from nowhere, and all of the  sudden, is bigger -- </p><p>  MATHISEN:  Household name in China, but is it ever going to be a  household name and a big player in the U.S.?  What do you think?  </p><p>  TAUSCHE:  The expectation is that it will and the demand from U.S.  investors through their retail financial advisors trying to get these  shares just shows you that it is starting to pick up a little bit.  Now,  it's bigger than JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Chase.  It's bigger than Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB).  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  What?  </p><p>  TAUSCHE:  When you think about that market cap, Jack Ma was just  saying in that piece, he wants to be bigger than Walmart.  Well, his stock  already is.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  All right.  Now, explain to me the other one that maybe on  the radar screen for 2015, and that is Uber, the ride-sharing service.  The  valuations that are being tossed around for this company, if it does indeed  go public this year, are astronomical for what I think is a taxi service.   I don't get it.  </p><p>  TAUSCHE:  Well, the key to something like Uber and the reason why now  is the time that a company like Uber can grow so much is this little tool  right here, this smartphone.  This wouldn't have been the power behind a  company like Uber were we talking about five years ago.  </p><p>  But Uber is now worth $40 billion.  Just six months ago, it was worth  $18 billion, which even then sounded like an astounding number.  A year and  a half, worth $3.5 billion but investors say the earnings back that up that  Uber in a year's time could make $10 billion in bookings because people  say, hey, I don't want to get stuck in traffic.  I'd like to have someone  drive me and -- </p><p>  MATHISEN:  Do you use it?</p><p>  TAUSCHE:  I do.</p><p>  MATHISEN:  I use it too.  </p><p>  TAUSCHE:  And if the cost is comparable to a taxi, why not?  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  All right.  Kayla, thanks very much.  Have a good New Year.    All right.  Thanks, everybody, for watching this special holiday  edition of NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.  I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Have a great  evening, everybody.

I'm Sue  Herera.  Bill Griffeth is off.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Tonight, we are going to take a look at the year that was, from the stock  market to the economy to policy out of Washington.  It was a 12-month  stretch filled with events that few could have predicted.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> HERERA:  And the ship be rockin' -- 300 and 400 point market moves are  usually eyebrow-raisers.  Now, not much.  Markets jumped in January, tax  cuts in hand until a nasty brew of global tensions led to mounting worries  about growth, and steep drops in February.  </p><p> Immunity?  Not in high fliers like Boeing (NYSE:BA).  Not in health care.   Not even in tech.  Market darling Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) might see a loss for  the year.  </p><p> Even as markets climbed in January, so did tensions with North Korea,  claiming its missiles can reach the United States mainland.  Historic face- to-face talks with South Korea and the United States followed, calming  nerves for a bit, but for how long as North Korea complains about a  constant irritant, economic sanctions.  </p><p> To maintain sanctions, the U.S. leans on China, even as their duel over  tariffs pinched over time auto makers and parts suppliers, farmers selling  pork and soybean, steel and aluminum production, even tech where tariffs  cost now top a billion dollars a months.  And constant threats of more and  higher tariffs are rattling investors.  For now, there is a March 1st  deadline to reach a trade agreement.  </p><p> Closer to home, a reworked NAFTA brought an agreement with Canada and  Mexico.  But just look around, debt issues hang over Italy's new  government.  Brexit is messier than ever in the U.K.  And the U.S.  relationship with Saudi Arabia, murky, following the death of Jamal  Khashoggi.  </p><p> Oil prices hit a four-year high this fall before dropping more than 30  percent in weeks.  And the stock market path is bumpy.  Up in September,  down by November, and then up a bit, and down in December.  </p><p> Tech investors fear government regulations to appease concerns about  privacy and data safety that might crimp growth.  Overall, this year's  earnings are stellar, up more than 20 percent.  But was that a one-time  high induced by tax cuts.  Next year's forecasts are still up but by less  than 10 percent.</p><p> And the list goes on.  Will a Democratic majority in the House change or  hinder the president's agenda?  If growth is slowing, will the Fed ease off  on interest rate hikes?  In housing, sales and construction are slowing  down.  While mortgage rates topping 5 percent for a while are up.  </p><p> Employment, still strong.  And consumers are spending.  Just ask Macy's  (NYSE:M) McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and the auto makers.  But is this economy in  2018 as good as it gets? </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  Some say 2018 was a turning point for the market.  Volatility  gripped Wall Street early in the year and it made a triumphant return in  the final few weeks.  </p><p> Bob Pisani takes a look at the market highs and lows.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It was a rollercoaster  year with several 10 percent swings in the market.  Here's the six most  important stories of 2018.  </p><p> Number six, the tax cuts and the market boost.  Earnings grew 24 percent in  2018, half due to tax cuts.  It's the best growth since 2010, but the  markets sniffed out global slowing late in the year.  Stocks come down 10  percent in the fourth quarter.  </p><p> Number five, it's the return of cash.  You know, suddenly, you could get a  2 percent on a bank certificate of deposit.  For the first time since 2008,  cash and short-term treasuries outperformed a 6040 stock bond portfolio.   Cash is up 2 percent this year.  The stock bond portfolio is down about 2  percent.  </p><p> Number four, the big coin bust.  Bitcoin popped out near $20,000 in  December of last year and it's closing out the year near $3,400.  What did  it combination of endless reports of thefts and break-ins, combined with an  SEC that has adamantly refused to approve a bitcoin ETF.  </p><p> Number three, the interest rate spike that never happened.  Short-term  interest rates rose for most of the year, but longer term rates did not.   Ten-year treasury yields are about where they were in February.  Those  betting rates would rise across the board were surprised when inflation  remained relatively subdued and concerns about the slowing economy kept  long term rates down.  </p><p> Number two, China trade and tariffs.  Everyone agrees the U.S. should stand  up to China on intellectual property thefts, but the market are saying it  does not like tariffs as a way to force change in behavior from China.  </p><p> And the number one story for 2018, my opinion, the return of volatility.   In 2017, the S&amp;P closed up or down 1 percent or more only eight times.  In  2018, the S&amp;P closed down or up 1 percent on 57 occasions.  Twenty-six of  those were down, 31 were up.  Wow!  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  The Federal Reserve and its interest rate-raising campaign was the  focus for investors for much of the year.  And it caused a lot of anxiety.  </p><p> Steve Liesman has been covering the central bank for us and the economy,  and he joins us tonight from Washington.  </p><p> Great to see you, Steve.  </p><p> STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Good to be here,  Sue.  </p><p> HERERA:  Anxiety I think is one word for it but also volatility is another  word, not only in the stock market but in the bond market.  Correct?  </p><p> LIESMAN:  That's right.  And I had hair when they had those 18 up or down 1  percent moves and I lost it with the 57.  I mean, you had days you would go  in and it would be up 300 points and end down 400.  So, there was not only  day to day but intraday volatility.  </p><p> As the market swung wildly, I think one of the big stories this year, Sue,  are the two halves of it.  I can't remember a year where we had such  buoyant growth up above 3 percent.  Remember, we hit an history 3.7 percent  low unemployment rate, lowest since 1969.  </p><p> We're doing 200,000 jobs a month regularly, which is fantastic because  remember we were only supposed to add 100,000 by population growth.  So,  really strong.  And I can't remember a year where there was such good  economic numbers that created and ended the year with such incredible  pessimism about the next one.  </p><p> HERERA:  And language mattered much more this year than it has in the past.   It seems as though investors were parsing those Fed statements much more  than they used to.  </p><p> LIESMAN:  I think that's right.  And I think they're especially, Sue,  parsing the words of the new Fed chairman.  It's well to remember, Jay  Powell who has been a governor for a lot of years, only took over at the  chairmanship at the beginning of 2018.</p><p> And then in October, I think he stumbled.  He made a mistake.  He said we  are a long way from neutral.  This was Jay Powell trying to talk to the lay  audience, not financial markets.  </p><p> And markets pretty much freaked out about that when he said a long way from  neutral.  He had to come back a month later with his vice chairman as well  and say, no, no, no we are just below the broad range of neutral rates.   And that kind of calmed the markets down.  </p><p> But as happened last week, this idea that the Fed still wants to raise  rates is still a matter of abiding concern and a source of volatility for  the market.  </p><p> HERERA:  We will see what the New Year brings.  Thanks, Steve, as always.  </p><p> LIESMAN:  Thanks.  </p><p> HERERA:  Steve Liesman in Washington.  </p><p> Well, trade and tariffs once viewed at dry topics for investors became a  focal point that triggered waves of market volatility and this was the year  that brought trade wars.  And they became a reality.  </p><p> Ylan Mui has more.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> YLAN MUI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The White House  celebrating several new deals.  Among the trade winds, the U.S. began  negotiations with Japan and European Union.  There is a new free trade  agreement with South Korea and a new deal pending with Canada and Mexico.  </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It's my honor to announce  that we have successfully completed negotiations on a brand-new deal to  terminate and replace NAFTA.  </p><p> MUI:  That agreement is designed to encourage car companies to pay their  workers more and make more of their vehicles in North America.  U.S.  farmers get more access to Canada's dairy market and pharmaceutical  companies get more protections for certain kinds of new drugs.  Still, the  deal needs to be approved by Congress.  </p><p> President Trump is threatening to cancel NAFTA if they don't act fast.  But  Democrats are skeptical.  </p><p> REP. NANCY PELOSI (D), MINORITY LEADER:  What isn't in it yet is enough  enforcement reassurance regarding workers.  There has not been a law passed  in Mexico in terms of wages and working conditions in Mexico.  </p><p> MUI:  Meanwhile, Wall Street is focused on trade wars.  Tariffs on foreign  steel and aluminum, also on $250 billion worth of Chinese products.  About  half of what we import from them.  </p><p> At the G20 summit in Argentina, President Trump and Chinese President Xi  Jinping agreed to work on issues like intellectual property theft and  forced technology transfers.  They called a truce on tariffs during those  talks and White House trade adviser Peter Navarro urge investors to be  patient.  </p><p> PETER NAVARRO, WHITE HOUSE TRADE ADVISOR:  We have negotiations with the  Chinese that there is much talk about.  What I would urge people to do on  Wall Street is rather than follow in day to day and get all excited and go  up and down on rumors is to let the process take its course.  </p><p> MUI:  The deadline for reaching a deal is March 1st and investors are  hoping for a New Year's resolution.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Ylan Mui, in Washington.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  Phil Blancato joins us now to talk more about the moments that  define the economy and the markets this year.  He is a CEO of Ladenburg  Thalmann Asset Management.  </p><p> Nice to have you here.  Happy holidays.</p><p> PHILIP BLANCATO, CEO, LADENBURG THALMANN ASSET MANAGEMENT:  And to you,  too.</p><p> HERERA:  The market was disappointing for you because you had high  expectations going in.  </p><p> BLANCATO:  Yes.  </p><p> HERERA:  Perhaps rightfully so, the economy was firing on all cylinders.   What do you think happened?</p><p> BLANCATO:  You know, the sentiment changed.  In your earlier statement, you  said the component changes, Chairman Powell's point about a long way from  neutral.  And you look at the underlying economy.  </p><p> And it was still very strong.  But for the first time we saw small little  crack that is got everyone real nervous.  Now, in my opinion, the economy  is still robust.  It's still really power-packed (ph).  </p><p> The chairman said it.  You look at underlying unemployment market it's  really strong.  He is not saying that they're backing off any time soon.  I  support what he said.  But in 2018, what happened towards was the sentiment  change.  </p><p> No one wanted to be the last one in the party when the cops showed up.   They wanted to be out sooner.  </p><p> HERERA:  Also, we hadn't seen volatility like this in a long time.  Do you  anticipate that continuing in the New Year?  Or does the market turn a new  leaf?  </p><p> BLANCATO:  It's funny I'm still in the camp I think when sentiment drives  the volatility.  Volatility has gone back to average.  This is normal to  see the VIX likes this.  </p><p> HERERA:  Yes, absolutely.  </p><p> BLANCATO:  We got lulled into this never lasting upward grinding market.   So, this is kind of normal to me.  A lot of this is going back to averages.   So for me, I still see January as an opportunity.  I'm still a buyer of  stocks.  I still think equities now actually cheaper than they've been in a  long time.  </p><p> So, when the underpinnings of the economy specifically the consumer are  this strong, you got to be a buyer.  So, I think the volatility comes out a  bit, not a lot.  We were staying elevated for a while because the sentiment  doesn't change that much but the January opportunity when the data comes  out about earnings and GDP, I think is a chance to make the money back.  </p><p> HERERA:  What sectors do you think will benefit, given the -- let's say the  environment stays the same as it did in 2018.  We do have valuations at  much more, quote/unquote, normal levels.  What areas do you think might  outperform?</p><p> BLANCATO:  Consider we are moving to a later stage -- only because  inflation and interest rates are going higher.  Usually, utilities are a  place to hide out.  So, that's a safe haven for some folks who want to be  there.  </p><p> I still think financials and technology both offer opportunity.  Why  financials are hammered.  In a rising rate environment, they usually do  well.  Later in the year financials are there.  Tech has sold off a bet and  tech because of the demographic make up, it's hard not to be in the space.  </p><p> HERERA:  On that, happy holidays.  Thanks so much, Phil.  </p><p> BLANCATO:  Thank you.  </p><p> HERERA:  And perhaps one of the biggest changes this year, came in November  with the midterm elections.  </p><p> Eamon Javers is at the White House tonight for us.  </p><p> Good to see you as always, Eamon.  </p><p> EAMON JAVERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  Hi, Sue.  Merry  Christmas.  </p><p> HERERA:  Merry Christmas to you as well.  Lots of changes came with the  results of the mid-terms elections.  Some of it has to do with the tax  laws.  Some of it has to do with the basically health care, because we are  going to have a change in the House.  </p><p> JAVERS:  Yes, absolutely.  The president leading up to November was  predicting there would be a red wave despite pundits suggesting a blue  wave.  In the end, we didn't really get a wave in either direction.  But  Democrats made significant pickups in the House of Representatives and they  were able to snatch control of the House of Representatives away from the  Republicans. </p><p> That means that Nancy Pelosi will be the speaker of the House, we expect  next year and we expect Paul Ryan is retiring and going home.  So, that's a  big change.  And it's going to affect this Trump presidency for the last  two years.  </p><p> It's going to put Democrats in charge of committees on Capitol Hill that  have subpoena power, meaning they can fire up investigations into all sorts  of aspects of the way that the president has been conducting business here  at the 1,600 Pennsylvania avenue.  That's going to make things very, very  difficult for the president in terms of the investigations, let alone  probably a near total impossibility of passing any legislation out of the  House of Representatives that the president wants to seize it.</p><p> HERERA:  You know, one of the things that the Democrats have said that they  want to do when they take over the House is take a look at some of the caps  that were put on state and local deductions.  What do you think the odds  are that they might be successful with that?  </p><p> JAVERS:  I think they might look at that.  And the question is whether  there is Republican interest in going along with that and where the  president ultimately comes down.  You know, the president was talking  before the election about in idea of Pennsylvania 10 percent tax cut that  he and Republicans were going to pursue after the election.  That sounds  like it's not going to happen.  </p><p> Instead, I think you're going to see treasury and other officials here sort  of on the defensive.  One of the things I think you can expect Democrats  are going after right away is the president's tax returns.  I think the  White House and the administration will defend that and try not to release  those but ultimately they may be forced to do that.  And that kind of a  tense atmosphere is going to make it very difficult for run of the mill  legislation.  </p><p> HERERA:  Eamon Javers at the White House.  Eamon, thank you so much.  </p><p> JAVERS:  You bet.  </p><p> HERERA:  And still ahead, the year the housing market went from hot to  cool.  </p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> HERERA:  The holiday season is traditionally the slowest time of year for  the housing market.  But as Diana Olick tells us, the slowdown this year  was particularly sharp.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  At a Sunday open house  in Los Angeles.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I like this.  </p><p> OLICK:  The few buyers who came out were hoping for a holiday gift.  </p><p> JOHN GABOUDIAN, POTENTIAL BUYER:  I read an article online right around  Christmas.  It's a good time to buy a home.  There is less homes on the  market, and less people looking for homes.  </p><p> OLICK:  But John Gaboudian still can't find anything affordable.  </p><p> GABOUDIAN:  We are just trying to find something newer, bigger, better,  without remodeling our home.  And it looks like we might just end up  remodeling our home.  </p><p> OLICK:  And that is the tale unfolding across the nation.  Housing was  superhot at the start of this year, with bidding wars the norm but prices  overheated and then mortgage rates jumped adding insult to injury.  Housing  went from hot to not.  </p><p> DAVID FOGG, KELLER WILLIAMS REALTY:  Clearly, the exuberance that made them  pay really unrealistic prices at the end of last year and the first part of  this year seems to be gone.  </p><p> OLICK:  The average rate on the 30-year fixed started to rise in January  but then leveled off for much of the summer, only to jump again in  September and then cross the 5 percent mark in November.  Home prices have  slowly responded still higher than a year ago but the gains are shrinking.   In California, more sellers are cutting prices as inventory rises.  </p><p> DAVID EDELSTEIN, POTENTIAL BUYER:  It seems the price on this house to me - - I'm not an expert but it does seem low.  </p><p> OLICK:  Unfortunately, home builders are not stepping up as much as hoped.   Housing starts are now at lowest level in over a year.  And builders  continue to put up more expensive homes while so much of the demand is at  the entry level.  </p><p> JOHN BURNS, JOHN BURNS REAL ESTATE CONSULTING:  They just can't get down to  the lowest price points.  And part of it is intentional on their part is  they don't want to go to the most outlying areas where they can get to the  price points because that's just a risky place to be the next time there is  a recession.  </p><p> OLICK:  And for existing home sellers, they now have to realize the sky is  no longer the limit.  </p><p> FOGG:  In a normal market, it takes several weeks or even a month or two to  sell your home.  In a normal market, you get one or two offers not 10 or  20.  And in a normal market, you don't sell your home for $100,000,  $200,000 or $300,000 over list price.  </p><p> OLICK:  In other words, housing is now in a new normal.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Diana Olick in Washington.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  The health care sector saw some changes in 2018 from mergers to  treatments to policy.  We're joined now by Dr. Amit Phull, who's the vice  president of strategy and insights at Doximity.  </p><p> Nice to have you here doctor, welcome.  </p><p> DR. AMIT PHULL, DOXIMITY STRATEGY &amp; INSIGHTS VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you for  having me, Sue.  Nice to meet you.  </p><p> HERERA:  You say one of the number one defining moments in health care was  the awarding of the Nobel Price and it had to do basically with immuno  therapy.  </p><p> Why was that such a watershed event?</p><p> PHULL:  So, it's been many years in the making, but this new treatment  modality actually has the capability of transforming how we treat many of  the deadliest disease sees that currently afflict our society.  I believe  we are at the tip of the iceberg frankly in terms of what may come out of  what is now recognized as a Nobel Prize winning bit of research.  </p><p> HERERA:  Does it also kind of green-light those companies that maybe wanted  to go into that particular area and they now see it perhaps as more  lucrative or certainly more hopeful?  </p><p> PHULL:  Absolutely.  I think we are right at the beginning, frankly, to see  how this plays itself out in the pharmaceutical industry.  And the life  sciences industry will have a lot of movement in this space moving forward.   And as in kind of therapy modality begins to be proven out over time, I  imagine that that activity will just increase.  </p><p> HERERA:  I also was fascinated and I think you mentioned this as well, big  tech really made some inroads in various different ways into the health  care sector.  </p><p> PHULL:  Yes, definitely.  I mean, if you look at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) as some of the main  representatives of big tech, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) actually had an FDA  approval for a device that can monitor heart rate and be utilized in health  care and pretty close to real time.  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), of course, will  touch on has made some interesting moves with regards to artificial  intelligence and be able to scan folks' retinas.  </p><p> And Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has made some interesting acquisitions,  particularly with PillPack being added to the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) family,  in much the way that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime has changed the way a lot  of us interact with shipping and products being sent to us in the near  future, leveraging Amazon's platform and delivery network, we might have a  different relationship with prescription medication.  </p><p> HERERA:  I think there's going to be a lot of changes.  </p><p> Thirdly, you list artificial intelligence as one major factor.  Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) comes to mind with a retinal scan.  But what else are you  watching this year?</p><p> PHULL:  So, if you think about the immunotherapy on the curative, or  treatment end, artificial intelligence specifically some of the work Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) is doing with retinal scans actually will make some headway  in the preventative end of the spectrum.  They've begun to perfect  technology that can actually augment or empower positions to more  accurately diagnose diseases, like diabetic retinopathy and fairly  accurately predict cardiovascular disease risk.  Enhancements on this  technology in the near future will make a profound impact I think in  preventative medicine.  </p><p> HERERA:  All right.  And we are also going to watch Berkshire Hathaway  (NYSE:BRK.A), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) getting  together.  Who knows what that bring?  </p><p> PHULL:  Absolutely.</p><p> HERERA:  Dr. Amit Phull, thank you so much.  </p><p> PHULL:  Thank you for having me.  </p><p> HERERA:  Well, can social media be trusted with your data?  That question  came up time and time again this year as the social media industry came  under fire from Congress and regulators pretty much around the world.  </p><p> Julia Boorstin has the details.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Concerns about the  dangerous of social media platforms exploded in March, with revelations  that political data firm Cambridge Analytica accessed the private  information of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) users, ultimately affecting 87 million  users.  </p><p> Sheryl Sandberg admitting to Facebook's mistakes in an interview on CNBC.  </p><p> SHERYL SANDBERG, FACEBOOK COO:  We have the responsibility to build great  products.  We have the responsibility to treat people's data carefully.  We  have the responsibility to disclose to people when problems occurred.  </p><p> BOORSTIN:  Sandberg's apology didn't stave off congressional scrutiny.   Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg was called to testify on Capitol  Hill in April where he said regulation is inevitable.  </p><p> MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  I'm not the type of person mo thinks that  all regulation is bad.  So I think the internet is becoming increasingly  important in people's lives.  And I think we need to have a full  conversation about what is the right regulation, not whether it should be  or shouldn't be.  </p><p> BOORSTIN:  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) came under attack for both privacy scandals  and for revelations of inauthentic manipulative behavior on its platform,  pulling down hundreds of pages tied to Russia and Iran.  In September,  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) COO Sheryl Sandberg, along with Twitter's CEO Jack  Dorsey were called to testify before Congress.  Amid growing talk of  regulation to protect user data, prevent manipulation and monitor bias on  the platform.  </p><p> SEN. MARK WARNER (D), VIRGINIA:  The era of the Wild West in social media  is coming to an end.  Where we go from here though is an open question.  </p><p> BOORSTIN:  Sandberg and Dorsey focused on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and  Twitter's investment in technology and employees to improve their  platforms.  </p><p> JACK DORSEY, TWITTER CEO:  We have been investing in artificial  intelligence and machine learning models to again recognize the patterns of  behavior, because we believe this is where the greatest leverage will come  from.  </p><p> BOORSTIN:  But Congress headed into the holidays with more concerns.  After  a slow drip of negative headlines about Facebook's mismanagement, two  reports for the Senate Intelligence Committee last week show Russian  attempts to sow discord on social media, both before and after the 2016  election, saying Twitter, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) did  the bare minimum to cooperate with the Senate Intelligence Committee's  investigation.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  Coming up, the correspondent story that kept investors guessing  for most of the year.  </p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> HERERA:  One of the biggest corporate stories focused on Amazon  (NASDAQ:AMZN) and where it would set up its second headquarters.  More than  200 cities bid for the project which promised jobs and capital investment.   Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) made cuts to the list all year.  And then in November,  the winner and in this case winners, were announced.  </p><p> Scott Cohn filed this story.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> SCOTT COHN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The competition was  intense.</p><p> MAYOR RAHM EMANUEL (D), CHICAGO:  All hands on deck.</p><p> COHN:  Sometimes a little weird.  </p><p> REP.-ELECT GREG STANTON (D), ARIZONA:  We might have to start with going to  the state to see if we can get the legislator to change the name to  Phoenix, Amazona.  </p><p> COHN:  Two hundred thirty-eight cities from across the continent entered  the bidding for 50,000 jobs and $5 billion in investment.  The result: a  tie.  </p><p> GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D), NEW YORK:  This was a fierce competition.  I think  it's exciting for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).  I know it's exciting for the state  of New York.  </p><p> MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO (D), NEW YORK:  This certainly consolidates Queens as  a great economic capital and consolidates New York City as a great  international tech hub.  </p><p> COHN:  New York's Long Island City neighborhood gets half the prize, a nod  to a strong tech workforce.  The other half goes to northern Virginia, a  strong workforce as well.  And a strategic location, wedged between Reagan  National Airport and the Pentagon.  </p><p> GOV. RALPH NORTHAM (D), VIRGINIA:  It is performance-based incentive  package that we put on the table.  So, the return on our investment will be  very good.  </p><p> COHN:  And a consolation prize to Nashville, Tennessee, for its strong  economy.  It will get a 5,000-employee operations center.  </p><p> GOV. BILL HASLAM (R), TENNESSEE:  This is the largest jobs announcement in  the history of the state of Tennessee.</p><p> (APPLAUSE) </p><p> HASLAM:  And 5,000 jobs that will average I think I'm safe to say $150,000  in salary.  Said it now they can't take it back.  </p><p> COHN:  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) gave no official explanation for the split  decision.  But in the end, no one city in North America could provide  everything the company wanted.  Most important, 50,000 skilled workers in  one place.  </p><p> The move also allows the company which made $177 billion in revenue last  year to make the most of government subsidies: $1.5 billion from New York  state, $600 million from Virginia, and more than $100 million from  Tennessee.  </p><p> GREG LEROY, GOOD JOBS FIRST EXEC. DIRECTOR:  We are seeing more than $2  billion in subsidies being offered by Virginia and New York for an  expansion the company had to make.  </p><p> COHN:  All the locations will have to work to do to make way for Amazon  (NASDAQ:AMZN) like infrastructure improvements.  Meanwhile, for the 235  cities that didn't make the grade, like Boston, Chicago, Dallas, plenty of  questions about what they did wrong, how they can do better and why they  got into this battle in the first place.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Scott Cohn.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  Thanks for joining us for in special edition of NIGHTLY BUSINESS  REPORT.

I`m Sue Herera. Bill Griffeth is off.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight, we are going to take a look at the year that was, from the stock market to the economy to policy out of Washington. It was a 12-month stretch filled with events that few could have predicted.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA: And the ship be rockin` -- 300 and 400 point market moves are usually eyebrow-raisers. Now, not much. Markets jumped in January, tax cuts in hand until a nasty brew of global tensions led to mounting worries about growth, and steep drops in February.</p><p>Immunity? Not in high fliers like Boeing (NYSE:BA). Not in health care. Not even in tech. Market darling Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) might see a loss for the year.</p><p>Even as markets climbed in January, so did tensions with North Korea, claiming its missiles can reach the United States mainland. Historic face- to-face talks with South Korea and the United States followed, calming nerves for a bit, but for how long as North Korea complains about a constant irritant, economic sanctions.</p><p>To maintain sanctions, the U.S. leans on China, even as their duel over tariffs pinched over time auto makers and parts suppliers, farmers selling pork and soybean, steel and aluminum production, even tech where tariffs cost now top a billion dollars a months. And constant threats of more and higher tariffs are rattling investors. For now, there is a March 1st deadline to reach a trade agreement.</p><p>Closer to home, a reworked NAFTA brought an agreement with Canada and Mexico. But just look around, debt issues hang over Italy`s new government. Brexit is messier than ever in the U.K. And the U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia, murky, following the death of Jamal Khashoggi.</p><p>Oil prices hit a four-year high this fall before dropping more than 30 percent in weeks. And the stock market path is bumpy. Up in September, down by November, and then up a bit, and down in December.</p><p>Tech investors fear government regulations to appease concerns about privacy and data safety that might crimp growth. Overall, this year`s earnings are stellar, up more than 20 percent. But was that a one-time high induced by tax cuts. Next year`s forecasts are still up but by less than 10 percent.</p><p>And the list goes on. Will a Democratic majority in the House change or hinder the president`s agenda? If growth is slowing, will the Fed ease off on interest rate hikes? In housing, sales and construction are slowing down. While mortgage rates topping 5 percent for a while are up.</p><p>Employment, still strong. And consumers are spending. Just ask Macy`s (NYSE:M) McDonald`s (NYSE:MCD) and the auto makers. But is this economy in 2018 as good as it gets?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Some say 2018 was a turning point for the market. Volatility gripped Wall Street early in the year and it made a triumphant return in the final few weeks.</p><p>Bob Pisani takes a look at the market highs and lows.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: It was a rollercoaster year with several 10 percent swings in the market. Here`s the six most important stories of 2018.</p><p>Number six, the tax cuts and the market boost. Earnings grew 24 percent in 2018, half due to tax cuts. It`s the best growth since 2010, but the markets sniffed out global slowing late in the year. Stocks come down 10 percent in the fourth quarter.</p><p>Number five, it`s the return of cash. You know, suddenly, you could get a 2 percent on a bank certificate of deposit. For the first time since 2008, cash and short-term treasuries outperformed a 6040 stock bond portfolio. Cash is up 2 percent this year. The stock bond portfolio is down about 2 percent.</p><p>Number four, the big coin bust. Bitcoin popped out near $20,000 in December of last year and it`s closing out the year near $3,400. What did it combination of endless reports of thefts and break-ins, combined with an SEC that has adamantly refused to approve a bitcoin ETF.</p><p>Number three, the interest rate spike that never happened. Short-term interest rates rose for most of the year, but longer term rates did not. Ten-year treasury yields are about where they were in February. Those betting rates would rise across the board were surprised when inflation remained relatively subdued and concerns about the slowing economy kept long term rates down.</p><p>Number two, China trade and tariffs. Everyone agrees the U.S. should stand up to China on intellectual property thefts, but the market are saying it does not like tariffs as a way to force change in behavior from China.</p><p>And the number one story for 2018, my opinion, the return of volatility. In 2017, the S&amp;P closed up or down 1 percent or more only eight times. In 2018, the S&amp;P closed down or up 1 percent on 57 occasions. Twenty-six of those were down, 31 were up. Wow!</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: The Federal Reserve and its interest rate-raising campaign was the focus for investors for much of the year. And it caused a lot of anxiety.</p><p>Steve Liesman has been covering the central bank for us and the economy, and he joins us tonight from Washington.</p><p>Great to see you, Steve.</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Good to be here, Sue.</p><p>HERERA: Anxiety I think is one word for it but also volatility is another word, not only in the stock market but in the bond market. Correct?</p><p>LIESMAN: That`s right. And I had hair when they had those 18 up or down 1 percent moves and I lost it with the 57. I mean, you had days you would go in and it would be up 300 points and end down 400. So, there was not only day to day but intraday volatility.</p><p>As the market swung wildly, I think one of the big stories this year, Sue, are the two halves of it. I can`t remember a year where we had such buoyant growth up above 3 percent. Remember, we hit an history 3.7 percent low unemployment rate, lowest since 1969.</p><p>We`re doing 200,000 jobs a month regularly, which is fantastic because remember we were only supposed to add 100,000 by population growth. So, really strong. And I can`t remember a year where there was such good economic numbers that created and ended the year with such incredible pessimism about the next one.</p><p>HERERA: And language mattered much more this year than it has in the past. It seems as though investors were parsing those Fed statements much more than they used to.</p><p>LIESMAN: I think that`s right. And I think they`re especially, Sue, parsing the words of the new Fed chairman. It`s well to remember, Jay Powell who has been a governor for a lot of years, only took over at the chairmanship at the beginning of 2018.</p><p>And then in October, I think he stumbled. He made a mistake. He said we are a long way from neutral. This was Jay Powell trying to talk to the lay audience, not financial markets.</p><p>And markets pretty much freaked out about that when he said a long way from neutral. He had to come back a month later with his vice chairman as well and say, no, no, no we are just below the broad range of neutral rates. And that kind of calmed the markets down.</p><p>But as happened last week, this idea that the Fed still wants to raise rates is still a matter of abiding concern and a source of volatility for the market.</p><p>HERERA: We will see what the New Year brings. Thanks, Steve, as always.</p><p>LIESMAN: Thanks.</p><p>HERERA: Steve Liesman in Washington.</p><p>Well, trade and tariffs once viewed at dry topics for investors became a focal point that triggered waves of market volatility and this was the year that brought trade wars. And they became a reality.</p><p>Ylan Mui has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YLAN MUI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The White House celebrating several new deals. Among the trade winds, the U.S. began negotiations with Japan and European Union. There is a new free trade agreement with South Korea and a new deal pending with Canada and Mexico.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It`s my honor to announce that we have successfully completed negotiations on a brand-new deal to terminate and replace NAFTA.</p><p>MUI: That agreement is designed to encourage car companies to pay their workers more and make more of their vehicles in North America. U.S. farmers get more access to Canada`s dairy market and pharmaceutical companies get more protections for certain kinds of new drugs. Still, the deal needs to be approved by Congress.</p><p>President Trump is threatening to cancel NAFTA if they don`t act fast. But Democrats are skeptical.</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D), MINORITY LEADER: What isn`t in it yet is enough enforcement reassurance regarding workers. There has not been a law passed in Mexico in terms of wages and working conditions in Mexico.</p><p>MUI: Meanwhile, Wall Street is focused on trade wars. Tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum, also on $250 billion worth of Chinese products. About half of what we import from them.</p><p>At the G20 summit in Argentina, President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to work on issues like intellectual property theft and forced technology transfers. They called a truce on tariffs during those talks and White House trade adviser Peter Navarro urge investors to be patient.</p><p>PETER NAVARRO, WHITE HOUSE TRADE ADVISOR: We have negotiations with the Chinese that there is much talk about. What I would urge people to do on Wall Street is rather than follow in day to day and get all excited and go up and down on rumors is to let the process take its course.</p><p>MUI: The deadline for reaching a deal is March 1st and investors are hoping for a New Year`s resolution.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Ylan Mui, in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Phil Blancato joins us now to talk more about the moments that define the economy and the markets this year. He is a CEO of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management.</p><p>Nice to have you here. Happy holidays.</p><p>PHILIP BLANCATO, CEO, LADENBURG THALMANN ASSET MANAGEMENT: And to you, too.</p><p>HERERA: The market was disappointing for you because you had high expectations going in.</p><p>BLANCATO: Yes.</p><p>HERERA: Perhaps rightfully so, the economy was firing on all cylinders. What do you think happened?</p><p>BLANCATO: You know, the sentiment changed. In your earlier statement, you said the component changes, Chairman Powell`s point about a long way from neutral. And you look at the underlying economy.</p><p>And it was still very strong. But for the first time we saw small little crack that is got everyone real nervous. Now, in my opinion, the economy is still robust. It`s still really power-packed (ph).</p><p>The chairman said it. You look at underlying unemployment market it`s really strong. He is not saying that they`re backing off any time soon. I support what he said. But in 2018, what happened towards was the sentiment change.</p><p>No one wanted to be the last one in the party when the cops showed up. They wanted to be out sooner.</p><p>HERERA: Also, we hadn`t seen volatility like this in a long time. Do you anticipate that continuing in the New Year? Or does the market turn a new leaf?</p><p>BLANCATO: It`s funny I`m still in the camp I think when sentiment drives the volatility. Volatility has gone back to average. This is normal to see the VIX likes this.</p><p>HERERA: Yes, absolutely.</p><p>BLANCATO: We got lulled into this never lasting upward grinding market. So, this is kind of normal to me. A lot of this is going back to averages. So for me, I still see January as an opportunity. I`m still a buyer of stocks. I still think equities now actually cheaper than they`ve been in a long time.</p><p>So, when the underpinnings of the economy specifically the consumer are this strong, you got to be a buyer. So, I think the volatility comes out a bit, not a lot. We were staying elevated for a while because the sentiment doesn`t change that much but the January opportunity when the data comes out about earnings and GDP, I think is a chance to make the money back.</p><p>HERERA: What sectors do you think will benefit, given the -- let`s say the environment stays the same as it did in 2018. We do have valuations at much more, quote/unquote, normal levels. What areas do you think might outperform?</p><p>BLANCATO: Consider we are moving to a later stage -- only because inflation and interest rates are going higher. Usually, utilities are a place to hide out. So, that`s a safe haven for some folks who want to be there.</p><p>I still think financials and technology both offer opportunity. Why financials are hammered. In a rising rate environment, they usually do well. Later in the year financials are there. Tech has sold off a bet and tech because of the demographic make up, it`s hard not to be in the space.</p><p>HERERA: On that, happy holidays. Thanks so much, Phil.</p><p>BLANCATO: Thank you.</p><p>HERERA: And perhaps one of the biggest changes this year, came in November with the midterm elections.</p><p>Eamon Javers is at the White House tonight for us.</p><p>Good to see you as always, Eamon.</p><p>EAMON JAVERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Hi, Sue. Merry Christmas.</p><p>HERERA: Merry Christmas to you as well. Lots of changes came with the results of the mid-terms elections. Some of it has to do with the tax laws. Some of it has to do with the basically health care, because we are going to have a change in the House.</p><p>JAVERS: Yes, absolutely. The president leading up to November was predicting there would be a red wave despite pundits suggesting a blue wave. In the end, we didn`t really get a wave in either direction. But Democrats made significant pickups in the House of Representatives and they were able to snatch control of the House of Representatives away from the Republicans.</p><p>That means that Nancy Pelosi will be the speaker of the House, we expect next year and we expect Paul Ryan is retiring and going home. So, that`s a big change. And it`s going to affect this Trump presidency for the last two years.</p><p>It`s going to put Democrats in charge of committees on Capitol Hill that have subpoena power, meaning they can fire up investigations into all sorts of aspects of the way that the president has been conducting business here at the 1,600 Pennsylvania avenue. That`s going to make things very, very difficult for the president in terms of the investigations, let alone probably a near total impossibility of passing any legislation out of the House of Representatives that the president wants to seize it.</p><p>HERERA: You know, one of the things that the Democrats have said that they want to do when they take over the House is take a look at some of the caps that were put on state and local deductions. What do you think the odds are that they might be successful with that?</p><p>JAVERS: I think they might look at that. And the question is whether there is Republican interest in going along with that and where the president ultimately comes down. You know, the president was talking before the election about in idea of Pennsylvania 10 percent tax cut that he and Republicans were going to pursue after the election. That sounds like it`s not going to happen.</p><p>Instead, I think you`re going to see treasury and other officials here sort of on the defensive. One of the things I think you can expect Democrats are going after right away is the president`s tax returns. I think the White House and the administration will defend that and try not to release those but ultimately they may be forced to do that. And that kind of a tense atmosphere is going to make it very difficult for run of the mill legislation.</p><p>HERERA: Eamon Javers at the White House. Eamon, thank you so much.</p><p>JAVERS: You bet.</p><p>HERERA: And still ahead, the year the housing market went from hot to cool.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: The holiday season is traditionally the slowest time of year for the housing market. But as Diana Olick tells us, the slowdown this year was particularly sharp.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: At a Sunday open house in Los Angeles.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I like this.</p><p>OLICK: The few buyers who came out were hoping for a holiday gift.</p><p>JOHN GABOUDIAN, POTENTIAL BUYER: I read an article online right around Christmas. It`s a good time to buy a home. There is less homes on the market, and less people looking for homes.</p><p>OLICK: But John Gaboudian still can`t find anything affordable.</p><p>GABOUDIAN: We are just trying to find something newer, bigger, better, without remodeling our home. And it looks like we might just end up remodeling our home.</p><p>OLICK: And that is the tale unfolding across the nation. Housing was superhot at the start of this year, with bidding wars the norm but prices overheated and then mortgage rates jumped adding insult to injury. Housing went from hot to not.</p><p>DAVID FOGG, KELLER WILLIAMS REALTY: Clearly, the exuberance that made them pay really unrealistic prices at the end of last year and the first part of this year seems to be gone.</p><p>OLICK: The average rate on the 30-year fixed started to rise in January but then leveled off for much of the summer, only to jump again in September and then cross the 5 percent mark in November. Home prices have slowly responded still higher than a year ago but the gains are shrinking. In California, more sellers are cutting prices as inventory rises.</p><p>DAVID EDELSTEIN, POTENTIAL BUYER: It seems the price on this house to me - - I`m not an expert but it does seem low.</p><p>OLICK: Unfortunately, home builders are not stepping up as much as hoped. Housing starts are now at lowest level in over a year. And builders continue to put up more expensive homes while so much of the demand is at the entry level.</p><p>JOHN BURNS, JOHN BURNS REAL ESTATE CONSULTING: They just can`t get down to the lowest price points. And part of it is intentional on their part is they don`t want to go to the most outlying areas where they can get to the price points because that`s just a risky place to be the next time there is a recession.</p><p>OLICK: And for existing home sellers, they now have to realize the sky is no longer the limit.</p><p>FOGG: In a normal market, it takes several weeks or even a month or two to sell your home. In a normal market, you get one or two offers not 10 or 20. And in a normal market, you don`t sell your home for $100,000, $200,000 or $300,000 over list price.</p><p>OLICK: In other words, housing is now in a new normal.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: The health care sector saw some changes in 2018 from mergers to treatments to policy. We`re joined now by Dr. Amit Phull, who`s the vice president of strategy and insights at Doximity.</p><p>Nice to have you here doctor, welcome.</p><p>DR. AMIT PHULL, DOXIMITY STRATEGY &amp; INSIGHTS VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you for having me, Sue. Nice to meet you.</p><p>HERERA: You say one of the number one defining moments in health care was the awarding of the Nobel Price and it had to do basically with immuno therapy.</p><p>Why was that such a watershed event?</p><p>PHULL: So, it`s been many years in the making, but this new treatment modality actually has the capability of transforming how we treat many of the deadliest disease sees that currently afflict our society. I believe we are at the tip of the iceberg frankly in terms of what may come out of what is now recognized as a Nobel Prize winning bit of research.</p><p>HERERA: Does it also kind of green-light those companies that maybe wanted to go into that particular area and they now see it perhaps as more lucrative or certainly more hopeful?</p><p>PHULL: Absolutely. I think we are right at the beginning, frankly, to see how this plays itself out in the pharmaceutical industry. And the life sciences industry will have a lot of movement in this space moving forward. And as in kind of therapy modality begins to be proven out over time, I imagine that that activity will just increase.</p><p>HERERA: I also was fascinated and I think you mentioned this as well, big tech really made some inroads in various different ways into the health care sector.</p><p>PHULL: Yes, definitely. I mean, if you look at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) as some of the main representatives of big tech, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) actually had an FDA approval for a device that can monitor heart rate and be utilized in health care and pretty close to real time. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), of course, will touch on has made some interesting moves with regards to artificial intelligence and be able to scan folks` retinas.</p><p>And Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has made some interesting acquisitions, particularly with PillPack being added to the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) family, in much the way that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime has changed the way a lot of us interact with shipping and products being sent to us in the near future, leveraging Amazon`s platform and delivery network, we might have a different relationship with prescription medication.</p><p>HERERA: I think there`s going to be a lot of changes.</p><p>Thirdly, you list artificial intelligence as one major factor. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) comes to mind with a retinal scan. But what else are you watching this year?</p><p>PHULL: So, if you think about the immunotherapy on the curative, or treatment end, artificial intelligence specifically some of the work Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) is doing with retinal scans actually will make some headway in the preventative end of the spectrum. They`ve begun to perfect technology that can actually augment or empower positions to more accurately diagnose diseases, like diabetic retinopathy and fairly accurately predict cardiovascular disease risk. Enhancements on this technology in the near future will make a profound impact I think in preventative medicine.</p><p>HERERA: All right. And we are also going to watch Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) getting together. Who knows what that bring?</p><p>PHULL: Absolutely.</p><p>HERERA: Dr. Amit Phull, thank you so much.</p><p>PHULL: Thank you for having me.</p><p>HERERA: Well, can social media be trusted with your data? That question came up time and time again this year as the social media industry came under fire from Congress and regulators pretty much around the world.</p><p>Julia Boorstin has the details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Concerns about the dangerous of social media platforms exploded in March, with revelations that political data firm Cambridge Analytica accessed the private information of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) users, ultimately affecting 87 million users.</p><p>Sheryl Sandberg admitting to Facebook`s mistakes in an interview on CNBC.</p><p>SHERYL SANDBERG, FACEBOOK COO: We have the responsibility to build great products. We have the responsibility to treat people`s data carefully. We have the responsibility to disclose to people when problems occurred.</p><p>BOORSTIN: Sandberg`s apology didn`t stave off congressional scrutiny. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg was called to testify on Capitol Hill in April where he said regulation is inevitable.</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: I`m not the type of person mo thinks that all regulation is bad. So I think the internet is becoming increasingly important in people`s lives. And I think we need to have a full conversation about what is the right regulation, not whether it should be or shouldn`t be.</p><p>BOORSTIN: Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) came under attack for both privacy scandals and for revelations of inauthentic manipulative behavior on its platform, pulling down hundreds of pages tied to Russia and Iran. In September, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) COO Sheryl Sandberg, along with Twitter`s CEO Jack Dorsey were called to testify before Congress. Amid growing talk of regulation to protect user data, prevent manipulation and monitor bias on the platform.</p><p>SEN. MARK WARNER (D), VIRGINIA: The era of the Wild West in social media is coming to an end. Where we go from here though is an open question.</p><p>BOORSTIN: Sandberg and Dorsey focused on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter`s investment in technology and employees to improve their platforms.</p><p>JACK DORSEY, TWITTER CEO: We have been investing in artificial intelligence and machine learning models to again recognize the patterns of behavior, because we believe this is where the greatest leverage will come from.</p><p>BOORSTIN: But Congress headed into the holidays with more concerns. After a slow drip of negative headlines about Facebook`s mismanagement, two reports for the Senate Intelligence Committee last week show Russian attempts to sow discord on social media, both before and after the 2016 election, saying Twitter, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) did the bare minimum to cooperate with the Senate Intelligence Committee`s investigation.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Coming up, the correspondent story that kept investors guessing for most of the year.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: One of the biggest corporate stories focused on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and where it would set up its second headquarters. More than 200 cities bid for the project which promised jobs and capital investment. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) made cuts to the list all year. And then in November, the winner and in this case winners, were announced.</p><p>Scott Cohn filed this story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SCOTT COHN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The competition was intense.</p><p>MAYOR RAHM EMANUEL (D), CHICAGO: All hands on deck.</p><p>COHN: Sometimes a little weird.</p><p>REP.-ELECT GREG STANTON (D), ARIZONA: We might have to start with going to the state to see if we can get the legislator to change the name to Phoenix, Amazona.</p><p>COHN: Two hundred thirty-eight cities from across the continent entered the bidding for 50,000 jobs and $5 billion in investment. The result: a tie.</p><p>GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D), NEW YORK: This was a fierce competition. I think it`s exciting for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). I know it`s exciting for the state of New York.</p><p>MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO (D), NEW YORK: This certainly consolidates Queens as a great economic capital and consolidates New York City as a great international tech hub.</p><p>COHN: New York`s Long Island City neighborhood gets half the prize, a nod to a strong tech workforce. The other half goes to northern Virginia, a strong workforce as well. And a strategic location, wedged between Reagan National Airport and the Pentagon.</p><p>GOV. RALPH NORTHAM (D), VIRGINIA: It is performance-based incentive package that we put on the table. So, the return on our investment will be very good.</p><p>COHN: And a consolation prize to Nashville, Tennessee, for its strong economy. It will get a 5,000-employee operations center.</p><p>GOV. BILL HASLAM (R), TENNESSEE: This is the largest jobs announcement in the history of the state of Tennessee.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>HASLAM: And 5,000 jobs that will average I think I`m safe to say $150,000 in salary. Said it now they can`t take it back.</p><p>COHN: Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) gave no official explanation for the split decision. But in the end, no one city in North America could provide everything the company wanted. Most important, 50,000 skilled workers in one place.</p><p>The move also allows the company which made $177 billion in revenue last year to make the most of government subsidies: $1.5 billion from New York state, $600 million from Virginia, and more than $100 million from Tennessee.</p><p>GREG LEROY, GOOD JOBS FIRST EXEC. DIRECTOR: We are seeing more than $2 billion in subsidies being offered by Virginia and New York for an expansion the company had to make.</p><p>COHN: All the locations will have to work to do to make way for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) like infrastructure improvements. Meanwhile, for the 235 cities that didn`t make the grade, like Boston, Chicago, Dallas, plenty of questions about what they did wrong, how they can do better and why they got into this battle in the first place.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Scott Cohn.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Thanks for joining us for in special edition of NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.

I'm Sue  Herera.  Bill Griffeth is off.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight, we are going to take a look at the year that was, from the stock  market to the economy to policy out of Washington.  It was a 12-month  stretch filled with events that few could have predicted.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA:  And the ship be rockin' -- 300 and 400 point market moves are  usually eyebrow-raisers.  Now, not much.  Markets jumped in January, tax  cuts in hand until a nasty brew of global tensions led to mounting worries  about growth, and steep drops in February.  </p><p>Immunity?  Not in high fliers like Boeing (NYSE:BA).  Not in health care.   Not even in tech.  Market darling Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) might see a loss for  the year.  </p><p>Even as markets climbed in January, so did tensions with North Korea,  claiming its missiles can reach the United States mainland.  Historic face- to-face talks with South Korea and the United States followed, calming  nerves for a bit, but for how long as North Korea complains about a  constant irritant, economic sanctions.  </p><p>To maintain sanctions, the U.S. leans on China, even as their duel over  tariffs pinched over time auto makers and parts suppliers, farmers selling  pork and soybean, steel and aluminum production, even tech where tariffs  cost now top a billion dollars a months.  And constant threats of more and  higher tariffs are rattling investors.  For now, there is a March 1st  deadline to reach a trade agreement.  </p><p>Closer to home, a reworked NAFTA brought an agreement with Canada and  Mexico.  But just look around, debt issues hang over Italy's new  government.  Brexit is messier than ever in the U.K.  And the U.S.  relationship with Saudi Arabia, murky, following the death of Jamal  Khashoggi.  </p><p>Oil prices hit a four-year high this fall before dropping more than 30  percent in weeks.  And the stock market path is bumpy.  Up in September,  down by November, and then up a bit, and down in December.  </p><p>Tech investors fear government regulations to appease concerns about  privacy and data safety that might crimp growth.  Overall, this year's  earnings are stellar, up more than 20 percent.  But was that a one-time  high induced by tax cuts.  Next year's forecasts are still up but by less  than 10 percent.</p><p>And the list goes on.  Will a Democratic majority in the House change or  hinder the president's agenda?  If growth is slowing, will the Fed ease off  on interest rate hikes?  In housing, sales and construction are slowing  down.  While mortgage rates topping 5 percent for a while are up.  </p><p>Employment, still strong.  And consumers are spending.  Just ask Macy's  (NYSE:M) McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and the auto makers.  But is this economy in  2018 as good as it gets? </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Some say 2018 was a turning point for the market.  Volatility  gripped Wall Street early in the year and it made a triumphant return in  the final few weeks.  </p><p>Bob Pisani takes a look at the market highs and lows.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It was a rollercoaster  year with several 10 percent swings in the market.  Here's the six most  important stories of 2018.  </p><p>Number six, the tax cuts and the market boost.  Earnings grew 24 percent in  2018, half due to tax cuts.  It's the best growth since 2010, but the  markets sniffed out global slowing late in the year.  Stocks come down 10  percent in the fourth quarter.  </p><p>Number five, it's the return of cash.  You know, suddenly, you could get a  2 percent on a bank certificate of deposit.  For the first time since 2008,  cash and short-term treasuries outperformed a 6040 stock bond portfolio.   Cash is up 2 percent this year.  The stock bond portfolio is down about 2  percent.  </p><p>Number four, the big coin bust.  Bitcoin popped out near $20,000 in  December of last year and it's closing out the year near $3,400.  What did  it combination of endless reports of thefts and break-ins, combined with an  SEC that has adamantly refused to approve a bitcoin ETF.  </p><p>Number three, the interest rate spike that never happened.  Short-term  interest rates rose for most of the year, but longer term rates did not.   Ten-year treasury yields are about where they were in February.  Those  betting rates would rise across the board were surprised when inflation  remained relatively subdued and concerns about the slowing economy kept  long term rates down.  </p><p>Number two, China trade and tariffs.  Everyone agrees the U.S. should stand  up to China on intellectual property thefts, but the market are saying it  does not like tariffs as a way to force change in behavior from China.  </p><p>And the number one story for 2018, my opinion, the return of volatility.   In 2017, the S&amp;P closed up or down 1 percent or more only eight times.  In  2018, the S&amp;P closed down or up 1 percent on 57 occasions.  Twenty-six of  those were down, 31 were up.  Wow!  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  The Federal Reserve and its interest rate-raising campaign was the  focus for investors for much of the year.  And it caused a lot of anxiety.  </p><p>Steve Liesman has been covering the central bank for us and the economy,  and he joins us tonight from Washington.  </p><p>Great to see you, Steve.  </p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Good to be here,  Sue.  </p><p>HERERA:  Anxiety I think is one word for it but also volatility is another  word, not only in the stock market but in the bond market.  Correct?  </p><p>LIESMAN:  That's right.  And I had hair when they had those 18 up or down 1  percent moves and I lost it with the 57.  I mean, you had days you would go  in and it would be up 300 points and end down 400.  So, there was not only  day to day but intraday volatility.  </p><p>As the market swung wildly, I think one of the big stories this year, Sue,  are the two halves of it.  I can't remember a year where we had such  buoyant growth up above 3 percent.  Remember, we hit an history 3.7 percent  low unemployment rate, lowest since 1969.  </p><p>We're doing 200,000 jobs a month regularly, which is fantastic because  remember we were only supposed to add 100,000 by population growth.  So,  really strong.  And I can't remember a year where there was such good  economic numbers that created and ended the year with such incredible  pessimism about the next one.  </p><p>HERERA:  And language mattered much more this year than it has in the past.   It seems as though investors were parsing those Fed statements much more  than they used to.  </p><p>LIESMAN:  I think that's right.  And I think they're especially, Sue,  parsing the words of the new Fed chairman.  It's well to remember, Jay  Powell who has been a governor for a lot of years, only took over at the  chairmanship at the beginning of 2018.</p><p>And then in October, I think he stumbled.  He made a mistake.  He said we  are a long way from neutral.  This was Jay Powell trying to talk to the lay  audience, not financial markets.  </p><p>And markets pretty much freaked out about that when he said a long way from  neutral.  He had to come back a month later with his vice chairman as well  and say, no, no, no we are just below the broad range of neutral rates.   And that kind of calmed the markets down.  </p><p>But as happened last week, this idea that the Fed still wants to raise  rates is still a matter of abiding concern and a source of volatility for  the market.  </p><p>HERERA:  We will see what the New Year brings.  Thanks, Steve, as always.  </p><p>LIESMAN:  Thanks.  </p><p>HERERA:  Steve Liesman in Washington.  </p><p>Well, trade and tariffs once viewed at dry topics for investors became a  focal point that triggered waves of market volatility and this was the year  that brought trade wars.  And they became a reality.  </p><p>Ylan Mui has more.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YLAN MUI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The White House  celebrating several new deals.  Among the trade winds, the U.S. began  negotiations with Japan and European Union.  There is a new free trade  agreement with South Korea and a new deal pending with Canada and Mexico.  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It's my honor to announce  that we have successfully completed negotiations on a brand-new deal to  terminate and replace NAFTA.  </p><p>MUI:  That agreement is designed to encourage car companies to pay their  workers more and make more of their vehicles in North America.  U.S.  farmers get more access to Canada's dairy market and pharmaceutical  companies get more protections for certain kinds of new drugs.  Still, the  deal needs to be approved by Congress.  </p><p>President Trump is threatening to cancel NAFTA if they don't act fast.  But  Democrats are skeptical.  </p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D), MINORITY LEADER:  What isn't in it yet is enough  enforcement reassurance regarding workers.  There has not been a law passed  in Mexico in terms of wages and working conditions in Mexico.  </p><p>MUI:  Meanwhile, Wall Street is focused on trade wars.  Tariffs on foreign  steel and aluminum, also on $250 billion worth of Chinese products.  About  half of what we import from them.  </p><p>At the G20 summit in Argentina, President Trump and Chinese President Xi  Jinping agreed to work on issues like intellectual property theft and  forced technology transfers.  They called a truce on tariffs during those  talks and White House trade adviser Peter Navarro urge investors to be  patient.  </p><p>PETER NAVARRO, WHITE HOUSE TRADE ADVISOR:  We have negotiations with the  Chinese that there is much talk about.  What I would urge people to do on  Wall Street is rather than follow in day to day and get all excited and go  up and down on rumors is to let the process take its course.  </p><p>MUI:  The deadline for reaching a deal is March 1st and investors are  hoping for a New Year's resolution.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Ylan Mui, in Washington.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Phil Blancato joins us now to talk more about the moments that  define the economy and the markets this year.  He is a CEO of Ladenburg  Thalmann Asset Management.  </p><p>Nice to have you here.  Happy holidays.</p><p>PHILIP BLANCATO, CEO, LADENBURG THALMANN ASSET MANAGEMENT:  And to you,  too.</p><p>HERERA:  The market was disappointing for you because you had high  expectations going in.  </p><p>BLANCATO:  Yes.  </p><p>HERERA:  Perhaps rightfully so, the economy was firing on all cylinders.   What do you think happened?</p><p>BLANCATO:  You know, the sentiment changed.  In your earlier statement, you  said the component changes, Chairman Powell's point about a long way from  neutral.  And you look at the underlying economy.  </p><p>And it was still very strong.  But for the first time we saw small little  crack that is got everyone real nervous.  Now, in my opinion, the economy  is still robust.  It's still really power-packed (ph).  </p><p>The chairman said it.  You look at underlying unemployment market it's  really strong.  He is not saying that they're backing off any time soon.  I  support what he said.  But in 2018, what happened towards was the sentiment  change.  </p><p>No one wanted to be the last one in the party when the cops showed up.   They wanted to be out sooner.  </p><p>HERERA:  Also, we hadn't seen volatility like this in a long time.  Do you  anticipate that continuing in the New Year?  Or does the market turn a new  leaf?  </p><p>BLANCATO:  It's funny I'm still in the camp I think when sentiment drives  the volatility.  Volatility has gone back to average.  This is normal to  see the VIX likes this.  </p><p>HERERA:  Yes, absolutely.  </p><p>BLANCATO:  We got lulled into this never lasting upward grinding market.   So, this is kind of normal to me.  A lot of this is going back to averages.   So for me, I still see January as an opportunity.  I'm still a buyer of  stocks.  I still think equities now actually cheaper than they've been in a  long time.  </p><p>So, when the underpinnings of the economy specifically the consumer are  this strong, you got to be a buyer.  So, I think the volatility comes out a  bit, not a lot.  We were staying elevated for a while because the sentiment  doesn't change that much but the January opportunity when the data comes  out about earnings and GDP, I think is a chance to make the money back.  </p><p>HERERA:  What sectors do you think will benefit, given the -- let's say the  environment stays the same as it did in 2018.  We do have valuations at  much more, quote/unquote, normal levels.  What areas do you think might  outperform?</p><p>BLANCATO:  Consider we are moving to a later stage -- only because  inflation and interest rates are going higher.  Usually, utilities are a  place to hide out.  So, that's a safe haven for some folks who want to be  there.  </p><p>I still think financials and technology both offer opportunity.  Why  financials are hammered.  In a rising rate environment, they usually do  well.  Later in the year financials are there.  Tech has sold off a bet and  tech because of the demographic make up, it's hard not to be in the space.  </p><p>HERERA:  On that, happy holidays.  Thanks so much, Phil.  </p><p>BLANCATO:  Thank you.  </p><p>HERERA:  And perhaps one of the biggest changes this year, came in November  with the midterm elections.  </p><p>Eamon Javers is at the White House tonight for us.  </p><p>Good to see you as always, Eamon.  </p><p>EAMON JAVERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  Hi, Sue.  Merry  Christmas.  </p><p>HERERA:  Merry Christmas to you as well.  Lots of changes came with the  results of the mid-terms elections.  Some of it has to do with the tax  laws.  Some of it has to do with the basically health care, because we are  going to have a change in the House.  </p><p>JAVERS:  Yes, absolutely.  The president leading up to November was  predicting there would be a red wave despite pundits suggesting a blue  wave.  In the end, we didn't really get a wave in either direction.  But  Democrats made significant pickups in the House of Representatives and they  were able to snatch control of the House of Representatives away from the  Republicans. </p><p>That means that Nancy Pelosi will be the speaker of the House, we expect  next year and we expect Paul Ryan is retiring and going home.  So, that's a  big change.  And it's going to affect this Trump presidency for the last  two years.  </p><p>It's going to put Democrats in charge of committees on Capitol Hill that  have subpoena power, meaning they can fire up investigations into all sorts  of aspects of the way that the president has been conducting business here  at the 1,600 Pennsylvania avenue.  That's going to make things very, very  difficult for the president in terms of the investigations, let alone  probably a near total impossibility of passing any legislation out of the  House of Representatives that the president wants to seize it.</p><p>HERERA:  You know, one of the things that the Democrats have said that they  want to do when they take over the House is take a look at some of the caps  that were put on state and local deductions.  What do you think the odds  are that they might be successful with that?  </p><p>JAVERS:  I think they might look at that.  And the question is whether  there is Republican interest in going along with that and where the  president ultimately comes down.  You know, the president was talking  before the election about in idea of Pennsylvania 10 percent tax cut that  he and Republicans were going to pursue after the election.  That sounds  like it's not going to happen.  </p><p>Instead, I think you're going to see treasury and other officials here sort  of on the defensive.  One of the things I think you can expect Democrats  are going after right away is the president's tax returns.  I think the  White House and the administration will defend that and try not to release  those but ultimately they may be forced to do that.  And that kind of a  tense atmosphere is going to make it very difficult for run of the mill  legislation.  </p><p>HERERA:  Eamon Javers at the White House.  Eamon, thank you so much.  </p><p>JAVERS:  You bet.  </p><p>HERERA:  And still ahead, the year the housing market went from hot to  cool.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  The holiday season is traditionally the slowest time of year for  the housing market.  But as Diana Olick tells us, the slowdown this year  was particularly sharp.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  At a Sunday open house  in Los Angeles.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I like this.  </p><p>OLICK:  The few buyers who came out were hoping for a holiday gift.  </p><p>JOHN GABOUDIAN, POTENTIAL BUYER:  I read an article online right around  Christmas.  It's a good time to buy a home.  There is less homes on the  market, and less people looking for homes.  </p><p>OLICK:  But John Gaboudian still can't find anything affordable.  </p><p>GABOUDIAN:  We are just trying to find something newer, bigger, better,  without remodeling our home.  And it looks like we might just end up  remodeling our home.  </p><p>OLICK:  And that is the tale unfolding across the nation.  Housing was  superhot at the start of this year, with bidding wars the norm but prices  overheated and then mortgage rates jumped adding insult to injury.  Housing  went from hot to not.  </p><p>DAVID FOGG, KELLER WILLIAMS REALTY:  Clearly, the exuberance that made them  pay really unrealistic prices at the end of last year and the first part of  this year seems to be gone.  </p><p>OLICK:  The average rate on the 30-year fixed started to rise in January  but then leveled off for much of the summer, only to jump again in  September and then cross the 5 percent mark in November.  Home prices have  slowly responded still higher than a year ago but the gains are shrinking.   In California, more sellers are cutting prices as inventory rises.  </p><p>DAVID EDELSTEIN, POTENTIAL BUYER:  It seems the price on this house to me - - I'm not an expert but it does seem low.  </p><p>OLICK:  Unfortunately, home builders are not stepping up as much as hoped.   Housing starts are now at lowest level in over a year.  And builders  continue to put up more expensive homes while so much of the demand is at  the entry level.  </p><p>JOHN BURNS, JOHN BURNS REAL ESTATE CONSULTING:  They just can't get down to  the lowest price points.  And part of it is intentional on their part is  they don't want to go to the most outlying areas where they can get to the  price points because that's just a risky place to be the next time there is  a recession.  </p><p>OLICK:  And for existing home sellers, they now have to realize the sky is  no longer the limit.  </p><p>FOGG:  In a normal market, it takes several weeks or even a month or two to  sell your home.  In a normal market, you get one or two offers not 10 or  20.  And in a normal market, you don't sell your home for $100,000,  $200,000 or $300,000 over list price.  </p><p>OLICK:  In other words, housing is now in a new normal.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Diana Olick in Washington.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  The health care sector saw some changes in 2018 from mergers to  treatments to policy.  We're joined now by Dr. Amit Phull, who's the vice  president of strategy and insights at Doximity.  </p><p>Nice to have you here doctor, welcome.  </p><p>DR. AMIT PHULL, DOXIMITY STRATEGY &amp; INSIGHTS VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you for  having me, Sue.  Nice to meet you.  </p><p>HERERA:  You say one of the number one defining moments in health care was  the awarding of the Nobel Price and it had to do basically with immuno  therapy.  </p><p>Why was that such a watershed event?</p><p>PHULL:  So, it's been many years in the making, but this new treatment  modality actually has the capability of transforming how we treat many of  the deadliest disease sees that currently afflict our society.  I believe  we are at the tip of the iceberg frankly in terms of what may come out of  what is now recognized as a Nobel Prize winning bit of research.  </p><p>HERERA:  Does it also kind of green-light those companies that maybe wanted  to go into that particular area and they now see it perhaps as more  lucrative or certainly more hopeful?  </p><p>PHULL:  Absolutely.  I think we are right at the beginning, frankly, to see  how this plays itself out in the pharmaceutical industry.  And the life  sciences industry will have a lot of movement in this space moving forward.   And as in kind of therapy modality begins to be proven out over time, I  imagine that that activity will just increase.  </p><p>HERERA:  I also was fascinated and I think you mentioned this as well, big  tech really made some inroads in various different ways into the health  care sector.  </p><p>PHULL:  Yes, definitely.  I mean, if you look at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) as some of the main  representatives of big tech, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) actually had an FDA  approval for a device that can monitor heart rate and be utilized in health  care and pretty close to real time.  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), of course, will  touch on has made some interesting moves with regards to artificial  intelligence and be able to scan folks' retinas.  </p><p>And Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has made some interesting acquisitions,  particularly with PillPack being added to the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) family,  in much the way that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime has changed the way a lot  of us interact with shipping and products being sent to us in the near  future, leveraging Amazon's platform and delivery network, we might have a  different relationship with prescription medication.  </p><p>HERERA:  I think there's going to be a lot of changes.  </p><p>Thirdly, you list artificial intelligence as one major factor.  Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) comes to mind with a retinal scan.  But what else are you  watching this year?</p><p>PHULL:  So, if you think about the immunotherapy on the curative, or  treatment end, artificial intelligence specifically some of the work Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) is doing with retinal scans actually will make some headway  in the preventative end of the spectrum.  They've begun to perfect  technology that can actually augment or empower positions to more  accurately diagnose diseases, like diabetic retinopathy and fairly  accurately predict cardiovascular disease risk.  Enhancements on this  technology in the near future will make a profound impact I think in  preventative medicine.  </p><p>HERERA:  All right.  And we are also going to watch Berkshire Hathaway  (NYSE:BRK.A), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) getting  together.  Who knows what that bring?  </p><p>PHULL:  Absolutely.</p><p>HERERA:  Dr. Amit Phull, thank you so much.  </p><p>PHULL:  Thank you for having me.  </p><p>HERERA:  Well, can social media be trusted with your data?  That question  came up time and time again this year as the social media industry came  under fire from Congress and regulators pretty much around the world.  </p><p>Julia Boorstin has the details.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Concerns about the  dangerous of social media platforms exploded in March, with revelations  that political data firm Cambridge Analytica accessed the private  information of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) users, ultimately affecting 87 million  users.  </p><p>Sheryl Sandberg admitting to Facebook's mistakes in an interview on CNBC.  </p><p>SHERYL SANDBERG, FACEBOOK COO:  We have the responsibility to build great  products.  We have the responsibility to treat people's data carefully.  We  have the responsibility to disclose to people when problems occurred.  </p><p>BOORSTIN:  Sandberg's apology didn't stave off congressional scrutiny.   Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg was called to testify on Capitol  Hill in April where he said regulation is inevitable.  </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  I'm not the type of person mo thinks that  all regulation is bad.  So I think the internet is becoming increasingly  important in people's lives.  And I think we need to have a full  conversation about what is the right regulation, not whether it should be  or shouldn't be.  </p><p>BOORSTIN:  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) came under attack for both privacy scandals  and for revelations of inauthentic manipulative behavior on its platform,  pulling down hundreds of pages tied to Russia and Iran.  In September,  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) COO Sheryl Sandberg, along with Twitter's CEO Jack  Dorsey were called to testify before Congress.  Amid growing talk of  regulation to protect user data, prevent manipulation and monitor bias on  the platform.  </p><p>SEN. MARK WARNER (D), VIRGINIA:  The era of the Wild West in social media  is coming to an end.  Where we go from here though is an open question.  </p><p>BOORSTIN:  Sandberg and Dorsey focused on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and  Twitter's investment in technology and employees to improve their  platforms.  </p><p>JACK DORSEY, TWITTER CEO:  We have been investing in artificial  intelligence and machine learning models to again recognize the patterns of  behavior, because we believe this is where the greatest leverage will come  from.  </p><p>BOORSTIN:  But Congress headed into the holidays with more concerns.  After  a slow drip of negative headlines about Facebook's mismanagement, two  reports for the Senate Intelligence Committee last week show Russian  attempts to sow discord on social media, both before and after the 2016  election, saying Twitter, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) did  the bare minimum to cooperate with the Senate Intelligence Committee's  investigation.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Coming up, the correspondent story that kept investors guessing  for most of the year.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  One of the biggest corporate stories focused on Amazon  (NASDAQ:AMZN) and where it would set up its second headquarters.  More than  200 cities bid for the project which promised jobs and capital investment.   Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) made cuts to the list all year.  And then in November,  the winner and in this case winners, were announced.  </p><p>Scott Cohn filed this story.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SCOTT COHN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The competition was  intense.</p><p>MAYOR RAHM EMANUEL (D), CHICAGO:  All hands on deck.</p><p>COHN:  Sometimes a little weird.  </p><p>REP.-ELECT GREG STANTON (D), ARIZONA:  We might have to start with going to  the state to see if we can get the legislator to change the name to  Phoenix, Amazona.  </p><p>COHN:  Two hundred thirty-eight cities from across the continent entered  the bidding for 50,000 jobs and $5 billion in investment.  The result: a  tie.  </p><p>GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D), NEW YORK:  This was a fierce competition.  I think  it's exciting for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).  I know it's exciting for the state  of New York.  </p><p>MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO (D), NEW YORK:  This certainly consolidates Queens as  a great economic capital and consolidates New York City as a great  international tech hub.  </p><p>COHN:  New York's Long Island City neighborhood gets half the prize, a nod  to a strong tech workforce.  The other half goes to northern Virginia, a  strong workforce as well.  And a strategic location, wedged between Reagan  National Airport and the Pentagon.  </p><p>GOV. RALPH NORTHAM (D), VIRGINIA:  It is performance-based incentive  package that we put on the table.  So, the return on our investment will be  very good.  </p><p>COHN:  And a consolation prize to Nashville, Tennessee, for its strong  economy.  It will get a 5,000-employee operations center.  </p><p>GOV. BILL HASLAM (R), TENNESSEE:  This is the largest jobs announcement in  the history of the state of Tennessee.</p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>HASLAM:  And 5,000 jobs that will average I think I'm safe to say $150,000  in salary.  Said it now they can't take it back.  </p><p>COHN:  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) gave no official explanation for the split  decision.  But in the end, no one city in North America could provide  everything the company wanted.  Most important, 50,000 skilled workers in  one place.  </p><p>The move also allows the company which made $177 billion in revenue last  year to make the most of government subsidies: $1.5 billion from New York  state, $600 million from Virginia, and more than $100 million from  Tennessee.  </p><p>GREG LEROY, GOOD JOBS FIRST EXEC. DIRECTOR:  We are seeing more than $2  billion in subsidies being offered by Virginia and New York for an  expansion the company had to make.  </p><p>COHN:  All the locations will have to work to do to make way for Amazon  (NASDAQ:AMZN) like infrastructure improvements.  Meanwhile, for the 235  cities that didn't make the grade, like Boston, Chicago, Dallas, plenty of  questions about what they did wrong, how they can do better and why they  got into this battle in the first place.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Scott Cohn.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Thanks for joining us for in special edition of NIGHTLY BUSINESS  REPORT.

Sue is off  tonight.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With the stock market closed this Christmas Day and 2019 wrapping up, it`s  a good time to take a look at the year ahead to figure out what may be in  store for the markets, the economy and your money.  So that`s what we`re  going to do tonight based on what we already know and what the experts  believe are going to happen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So we begin with two reports on things we cover every day.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Steve Liesman will take a look at the economy, but first, Bob Pisani has  the outlook for the stock market from the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Oil stocks bounce,  rates go up and the direct listing craze will peak.</p><p>Here`s three predictions for 2020.</p><p>First, against all odds, energy stocks will outperform the S&amp;P 500.  It`s  been a lost decade for energy investors with oil stocks up to 6 percent in  10 years but a combination of high dividend yields and relatively low  earnings multiples will make several companies much more attractive in  2020.  Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), for example, believes ExxonMobil  (NYSE:XOM) could move up 50 percent to $100 as it sells assets, expands  production and doubles its cash flow by 2025.</p><p>Second, lower rates in 2020?  Not necessarily.  Many central banks don`t  seem to want it.  Shifting political winds in Germany will lead to the  passage of large scale stimulus plans to boost the slower economy.   European bond yields will move back towards positive territory.  That will  force money out of European bonds all while pushing European yields higher  and keeping the bank rally here going.</p><p>Finally, the direct listing craze will peak when Airbnb goes public during  the listing.  It`s all the rage right now.  Private equity investors  disappointed with IPO returns this year are pushing for direct listings to  cut costs and allow employees and private equity to sell shares.</p><p>But no one asked the buy side.  Direct listings Spotify and Slack are both  underperforming the overall market.  And a disappointing Airbnb debut will  convince many that allowing early investors to sell all at once may not be  right for everyone.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Nothing is more  central to the outlook in 2020 than what happens to the trade war, but  depressed growth here at home and around the world this year.  It led the  Federal Reserve to reverse course and cut rates sharply in 2019.</p><p>Here`s what to look out for in 2020.</p><p>First, the trade war should improve somewhat or at least not get worse.  As  the year drew to a close, that seemed to be the case already with the  announcement of a limited U.S.-China phase one deal.  Uncertainties will  remain but businesses will learn to invest and prosper with a constant  rumbling of trade disputes.</p><p>Second, assuming a lot of damage hasn`t already been done that should help  to lead to improved global growth.  That can help U.S. global growth  towards 2.5 percent or a half point above where it likely close out 2019.</p><p>But, third, the Federal Reserve should remain on hold while much of this  plays out.  It could consider raising rates if global growth, also firms  global inflation and other central banks start to hike.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And as Steve just mentioned, trade was one of the defining  economic issues this year.  And even though progress was made, there are  still a number of things yet to be resolved.</p><p>Kayla Tausche takes a look at what 2020 might hold.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The Trump  administration rocks the trade boat in 2019 with unpredictable tariffs and  short-lived truces.  In 2020, international trade will move back towards  the status quo.</p><p>First, China tensions return to a simmer.  Fireworks will fade when the  U.S. and China sign off on a phase one deal in early January.  A second  deal will remain far off.  But if China engages and enforces the first  deal, expect tariffs to be rolled back slowly.</p><p>Second, farm finances will be in focus.  As planting season gets underway,  American farmers will size up the pain of a two-year trade war and the  salve of new business with China, Mexico, Canada and Japan.  Agriculture  Secretary Sunny Purdue says more financial aid will be warranted if the ag  economy doesn`t rebound quickly.</p><p>Third, Europe will be back in the crosshairs.  As President Trump eyes re- election, he`ll hone in on a new target, the E.U., with rising tariffs on  luxury goods, the president`s stamp speeches will be testing ground for new  material on auto tariffs and energy sanctions.  But he`ll pocket those  fights until after November.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Kayla Tausche in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Joining us now to talk about what they see ahead for the economy  and the markets next year, we have Jim O`Sullivan with us.  He is chief  U.S. macro strategist at TD Securities.  John Lynch is chief investment  strategist at LPL Financial.</p><p>Good to see you both.  Thanks for joining us.</p><p>JIM O`SULLIVAN, TD SECURITIES U.S. MACRO STRATEGIST:  Hi, Bill.</p><p>JOHN LYNCH, LPL FINANCIAL CHIEF STRATEGIST:  Thank you.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Jim, let me start with you.  I mean, we laid out here there were  so many walls of worry for the markets in 2019, trade, the Fed, you know,  on and on, slow growth overseas.  But many of those are starting to be  resolved right now.</p><p>What is your outlook for 2020?</p><p>O`SULLIVAN:  Well, I think there will continue to be some anxiety and  volatility along the way but in the end growth will remain modestly  positive.  So, the already record low expansion will continue at least at a  weak pace.  The unemployment rate is already at a 50-year low at 3.5  percent.  So, I think the unemployment rate stays low.</p><p>But -- I mean, I think we haven`t necessarily seen the end of the follow  through, the impact of weaker global growth or trade tensions.  So, for  now, the global backdrop is still pretty weak.  I think in the end the  economy will continue to grow at least modestly.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  John, we`ve already seen a slowdown in hiring to begin with  going into 2020.  What other areas do you see that you`re going to be  watching carefully going into the New Year?</p><p>LYNCH:  Well, I think the most important area -- on the hiring thing, I  think we have to moderate a little bit, right?  Year 11 of the cycle.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p>LYNCH:  I think the most important thing is we get clarity on trade as to  whether or not business resumes investment, because that`s really the key,  I think, if you want to consider businesses investing, that enables  productivity to continue to grow and what the market translation for that  is, markets can be sustained, because last year, we saw price dramatically  outperform earnings.  So, to the degree we have a better year in the stock  market, we really need to see margins sustained.  And if we get further  clarity on business investment that helps productivity, which could  therefore lead to upward business earnings investment.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Jim, we went through -- we`ve gone through a few cycles in the  market in the last couple of years here.  There will be a period of time  when money managers will want to look to growth stocks but then they  shifted to defensive stocks when the trade war was really heating up at  some point.  Now they`ve really migrated back to the growth stocks again.</p><p>What do you think will be the better performers in 2020?</p><p>O`SULLIVAN:  And -- well, I wouldn`t -- I talked more about the economy I  guess than the stock market per se, but I would say the backdrop is such  that the tone is certainly better in terms of people feeling less worried  about recession risks.  But that said, it`s not all clear sailing either, I  would say.  I mean, again, the global backdrop is still on the softer side.</p><p>And trade policy uncertainty hasn`t necessarily gone away either.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p>O`SULLIVAN:  And -- I mean, as far as the stock market and earnings go,  yes, the P was up a lot more than E, and E by many measures was actually  down a lot in the past year.  So, it may be harder to squeeze much earnings  growth out of the E and out of the economy at this point in the cycle.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  But I guess what I`m getting at then is what does that mean for  those companies that are involved in international trade?  You know, those  multi-nationals based here in the United States that have been suffering to  some degree or did for a time because of the trade tensions with China?   What happens now do you think?</p><p>O`SULLIVAN:  Well, I mean, it`s a question of how quickly does global  growth come back or if it comes back.  I mean, certainly, it`s positive  that we have the U.S.-China trade deal.  There`s still uncertainty if  there`s follow through on that.</p><p>And as Kayla mentioned in her piece, there`s some uncertainty about what  happens with Europe as well.  But the global numbers are still on the  softer side.  Certainly, the manufacturing numbers are still on the weaker  side.  So, it`s not as if the signing of the trade deal, assuming it  happens in early January, is suddenly going to cause global growth to snap  back.  I think the backdrop is still on the soft side.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And, John, where do you stand on whether you should look for the  high growth stocks again in the New Year or stick with some of the value  and defensive plays out there?</p><p>LYNCH:  We`re pairing back on growth.  We`re looking at some opportunities  in value.  So, it`s more of an equal weight right now.</p><p>But to your point about those companies benefitting from the resumption of  global trade, if you just look at the earnings forecast for 2020, we`re  looking at 15 percent earnings growth for industrials and the energy space,  two areas that have been affected quite a bit.  And they are two of the  leading sectors.</p><p>And then if you factor in the potential for higher market interest rates,  that would also bode well for the financial sector.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Jim O`Sullivan with TD Securities, John Lynch with LPL Financial  -- thank you again both for joining us.</p><p>O`SULLIVAN:  Thank you, Bill.</p><p>LYNCH:  Thank you, Bill.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  2020 also brings, of course, a presidential election, and the  final year of President Trump`s first term.  What should investors expect?</p><p>Here`s Eamon Javers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EAMON JAVERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  To paraphrase Winston  Churchill, it`s either the beginning of the end of the Trump presidency or  just the end of the beginning as the president ramps up his re-election  campaign.</p><p>Here, three things to watch in 2020.  First, the president survived  impeachment.  Conventional wisdom says an impeachment vote in the House  will be followed by an acquittal in the Senate, meaning the president stays  in office for all of 2020.  But just about everything about the Trump era  has been wildly unpredictable.  So, watch this space.</p><p>Second, legislative letdown.  The president began his first term with  efforts to repeal Obamacare which failed, cut taxes which succeeded and  slashed regulations which he has done.  But there`s not much left on the  president`s legislative agenda.  And Democrats aren`t likely to pass a lot  of the president`s priorities in an election year.  So, don`t count on a  lot of bill signings here in 2020.</p><p>Third, it`s all about that base.  The president will campaign the same way  he governs and the same way he won back in 2016, with a laser focus on his  political base.  For a chief executive who`s never top 46 percent in Gallup  approval ratings, that means he knows he needs every voter he had last time  and he doesn`t have much chance of converting those he didn`t.  That means  we`ll see an emotional, divisive and dramatic election.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Eamon Javers at the White House.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, lawmakers have a big to-do list for  the New Year and one of the issues topping that agenda is regulating big  tech.</p><p>Ylan Mui has been covering that story for us all year.  She`s back with a  look ahead.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YLAN MUI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Big tech was a big target  on both sides of the political aisle this year, and the scrutiny will only  grow as the 2020 elections get closer.</p><p>Watch out for a Capitol Hill crackdown.  The House will wrap up its  antitrust investigation early next year.  Democrats still want the top tech  CEOs to testify, and a source tells me they`re working on new legislation  to ban mega (ph) mergers.</p><p>Over in the Senate, Republicans are trying to build support for a federal  privacy law.  And both parties are raising red flags over Chinese companies  like Huawei and TikTok.</p><p>Meanwhile, regulators are also taking aim, the Federal Trade Commission and  the Justice Department will try to focus their antitrust investigations  into Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). Texas and New York are  leading states in building their own cases against the companies, and  California`s strict new privacy law goes into effect.</p><p>But the most heated rhetoric could come from the campaign trail where big  tech faces an election year tests after the fallout from 2016.  Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB) in particular is feeling the heat over political ads and fakes.   But all the platforms are under pressure to prove they`re safe from  misinformation and from hacking.  They need to show they`ve learned a  lesson from the last election.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Ylan Mui in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Still ahead, one of the biggest corporate stories of 2019 will  likely dominate 2020 as well.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  It was another strong year for the labor market.  2019 brought  the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years, and one of the biggest challenges  that companies faced was finding those skilled workers.</p><p>Here`s Kate Rogers (NYSE:ROG).</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KATE ROGERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  A hot economy led to a  tight market in 2019, with education and health services, leisure and  hospitality and professional and business services leading the pack when it  comes to job gains.</p><p>Here are the three predictions for the labor market in 2020.</p><p>First, workers remain in high demand.  2019 was truly an employee`s market  as companies across sectors named finding and keeping talent a top  challenge.  Expect the trend to continue next year as unemployment remains  historically low.  Baby boomers continue to age out of the work force  leaving an even smaller pool for employers.</p><p>Second, incentives and training continue.  Upskilling or training workers  already employed by a company is a move many employers are making and the  supply of available talent remains low.  Training programs along with  incentives and more robust benefit offerings will be key in attracting and  retaining workers.</p><p>Third, tech continues to change the game.  From manufacturing to retail,  technology is becoming an increasingly important part of the equation for  workers.  Look out for technological advances continuing to shape where and  how employees do their jobs.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Kate Rogers (NYSE:ROG).</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  The real estate market went from hot to cold and then it started  to warm up again, but next year could be a whole new ball game for housing.</p><p>Here`s Diana Olick.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The housing market is  a mix of highs and lows.  So, here`s what to watch in 2020.</p><p>First, the housing shortage will get worse.  The number of homes for sale  is already low and demand is incredibly strong, thanks to improving  employment and the largest generation aging into its home-buying years.   The demand, however, is mostly on the low end where supply is leanest.   That will cause prices to continue to overheat at the entry level, while  prices ease on the higher end where supply is more plentiful.</p><p>Second, mortgage rates will stay low.  Mortgage rates dropped in 2019 and  will likely stay low through 2020 as uncertainty over a trade war and  presidential election year keep investors heavy in the bond market.   Mortgage rates loosely follow the yield on a ten-year treasury.</p><p>The only wild card is mortgage finance reform.  If major changes are made  to the rolls of Fannie and Freddie, rates could finally break higher.</p><p>And third, we`re bullish on the builders.  The combination of a major  housing shortage and low interest rates will keep demand from new housing  high, but single and multi family.  The home builders have been ramping up  production and in 2019, they finally started to pivot to entry-level homes.</p><p>If they can afford to put up even more big sales numbers, we`ll follow.   Their headwinds, though, continue to be high prices for land, labor and  regulatory compliance.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And joining us now with her predictions for the housing market  in the New Year, Daryl Fairweather is back with us.  She`s chief economist  at Redfin.</p><p>Good to see you again.  Welcome back.</p><p>DARYL FAIRWEATHER, REDFIN CHIEF ECONOMIST:  Thank you for having me.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  You know, in the last month or so, we got some pretty positive  news on housing.  You know, housing starts were higher.  The permits were  at a 12-year high.  Builders themselves saw more optimism going into the  New Year.</p><p>Does that necessarily mean that housing looks up that much beginning in  2020?</p><p>FAIRWEATHER:  I think the housing market is going to be much more  competitive in 2020.  Right now, about 1/10 of offers submitted by Redfin  agents based competition.  I think that`s going to go up to 1 in 4, and  that`s going to push prices higher amid low supply.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And therefore, you think we`re going to see the return to  bidding wars in many markets around the country, right?</p><p>FAIRWEATHER:  That`s right.  Bidding wars kind of went away especially in  places where they were really prevalent, like San Francisco, Los Angeles,  Seattle.  We`re going to see a return in bidding wars.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  But that doesn`t help the low end, the starter home buyers right  now where there has been just a dearth of supply in this market.  What`s  the outlook for that do you think?</p><p>FAIRWEATHER:  First-time home buyers are going to have a much harder time.   They`re more likely to lose bidding wars because based on its experience,  it`s people who have been in the housing market, who have the cash to make  all cash offers.  First time home buyers may face less favorable mortgage  conditions that these Fannie and Freddie changes go through.  So, overall,  I think first time home buyers are going to have a much harder time next  year.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And the higher end of the market has struggled because of those  higher prices where, you know, the affordability became an issue.  You`re  talking about higher prices next year.  Won`t that still be a problem?</p><p>FAIRWEATHER:  Home price growth won`t be quite as strong in the luxury end.   We`ve seen markets like San Jose where there are $1 million, $2 million  homes really go down in price this year.  And they`re going to be in  recovery mode next year.  They`ll be looking a little bit stronger, but  days of like 20 percent price growth in these luxury markets are long past.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  What are -- you mentioned the San Jose market.  Let`s talk about  some other local markets around the country.  Like in the Sunbelt, for  example.  Will we see better markets there, next year?</p><p>FAIRWEATHER:  We`re seeing a lot of migration in our Redfin data.  People  looking on the coast into places like Texas, Arizona, other affordable  markets.  The Sunbelt is part of that.</p><p>So, we think those markets are going to be strong.  They tend to be more  affordable.  So, they should do pretty well in 2020.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And what about in the industrial base, in the northern part of  the country?   I mean, you know, there is a revival for sorts going on in  areas like Detroit and other parts of the northern parts of the United  States.  What do you see there?</p><p>FAIRWEATHER:  Larger cities like Cleveland, Detroit, even Buffalo, those  markets will do well.  But some of the more rural parts of the Midwest and  the Northeast, we`ll probably lose people and those markets won`t be as  strong.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Daryl Fairweather, again, with Redfin -- thanks again for  joining us.</p><p>FAIRWEATHER:  Thank you.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  You bet.</p><p>Now, one of the biggest corporate stories this year was Boeing (NYSE:BA)`s  737 MAX.  It`s most likely going to be big news again in the New Year.  At  issue, all of that uncertainty over when the troubled plane will be back in  the air.</p><p>Phil LeBeau has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Next year, Boeing  (NYSE:BA)`s 737 MAX will have three critical moments.  First, expect  recertification early in 2020.  The head of the FAA, Steve Dickson, has  said he won`t approve the MAX until he flies it himself.  And there are  still a number of hurdles to clear before the MAX takes off.</p><p>But most believe it will be recertified in the first couple of months of  next year.  Once that happens, expect airlines to make a big push to  convince fliers the MAX is safe.  Southwest, American, and United have  parked their MAX planes for almost a year.  They know passengers may  hesitate or flat out refuse to board a MAX, so executives of those airlines  will be on MAX flights to reassure their customers the planes are good to  go.</p><p>Once the MAX is back, look for Boeing (NYSE:BA) to slowly ramp up  production.  Yes, the assembly line will be down at the start of the year  but Boeing (NYSE:BA) will likely go to building 42 a month by mid-year.   What about the MAX airplanes that have been built but not yet delivered?   They will eventually take off and go to the airlines that have ordered  them.  But it will take all of 2020 and beyond for Boeing (NYSE:BA) to  clear out the inventory of more than 400 MAX airplanes.</p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Earlier this week, changes at Boeing (NYSE:BA) started with the  ouster of CEO David Muilenburg on Monday.  Current chairman David Calhoun  will officially take over as CEO in January.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Coming up, why the great divide between retail`s winners and  losers may grow in the New Year.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  The consumer definitely powered the economy in 2019.  Spending  was strong because companies kept hiring, but that doesn`t mean that all  retailers reap the rewards.</p><p>Courtney Reagan takes a look now on what the New Year might bring.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  2019 was a  difficult year for retail with clear winners and losers.  Expect the  divergence to continue in 2020.</p><p>First, the tariff divide.  While the country`s tariff schedule continues to  evolve, brands and retailers aren`t waiting to adapt and some will do so  easier than others.  Big retailers like Target (NYSE:TGT), Walmart, and  Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), you scale and influence to keep prices low for  shoppers by insisting the brands they buy from take on whatever higher  costs result.  It will hurt smaller, less powerful players.</p><p>Second, old is new again.  As the retail resell market grows, watch for  more retailers to experiment with new ways of selling merchandise second  hand, as Gen Z focuses on more shopping, watch for retailers to deploy new  consignment options, giving old merchandise second life.</p><p>And third, new CEOs, new strategies.  Many retailers have or will have new  CEOs settle in, in the New Year, including Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond, Nike  (NYSE:NKE), Under Armour (NYSE:UA), Tapestry and Gap (NYSE:GPS).  Investors  wait to see if the new leaders will dramatically shift the strategies in  new directions and then decide if they`re willing to give them a chance to  make change.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Courtney Reagan.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And it`s hard to talk about retail without mentioning ecommerce  and the changing way that people shop.  The fact that most consumers expect  their packages to be delivered ASAP.</p><p>Frank Holland has that story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRANK HOLLAND, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  2019 is on pace to  be another record year for ecommerce, with holiday online sales forecasts  increase as much as 14 percent, according to the National Retail  Federation.  And the trend is expected to continue in 2020.</p><p>Here`s what to watch.</p><p>First, e-commerce exceeds expectations.</p><p>The global e-commerce market could grow to $4 trillion in 2020 according to  UBS, but has the potential to even larger as more retailers offer same day  and next day shipping, along with added curve side pickup options.  Also,  total sales made by smartphones are expected to increase by 32 percent next  year, according to E-Marketer.</p><p>Second, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) acquisitions.</p><p>Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)`s e-commerce empire is built on strong logistics on  the ground and in the air.  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) currently operates about  50 planes and expects to have 70 flying by 2021.  Look for acquisitions in  2020 as it continues to grow its capacity for ground logistics and  delivery.</p><p>And third, drone delivery.</p><p>FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and USP are battling to be the leader in residential drone  deliveries.  Both companies are testing technologies with drug store chains  to deliver prescriptions and retail goods.  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) also have their eyes on the skies when it comes to shipping.   2020 may be the year e-commerce takes flight in a whole new way.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Frank Holland.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And finally tonight, the changing way we all watch television.   New streaming services are everywhere now with more and more content  available at the touch of a button.  What will 2020 bring to this fast- chasing business?</p><p>Well, sit back now and watch Julia Boorstin`s report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  In 2020, we`ll see  the shifting power dynamic between media giants and tech titans battling  for viewers.</p><p>First, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) will lose more subscribers in the U.S. as a  slew of new streaming apps gain traction.</p><p>With NBCUniversal`s Peacock launching in April and HBO Max launching in  May, on top of this year`s new additions of Disney (NYSE:DIS) Plus and  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) TV Plus, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) will face stiff  competition for subscribers here in the U.S., putting pressure on it to  continue investing in content and to focus on international growth.</p><p>Second, ad supported streaming.  With Peacock entering the fray will be the  new front in the streaming wars.  With the ad free subscription business,  Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) pioneered, now crowded, consumers, advertisers and  content creators will shift focus to streaming ad supported content for  free.  NBCUniversal`s Peacock is going up against Viacom (NYSE:VIA)`s Pluto  and independent Tubi and Xumo.</p><p>Third, the success of streaming video will eat into the box office which  will decline next year.</p><p>All that streaming content raising the bar for going to the movies.  And a  declining box office, likely the big name franchises that broke records  this year is likely to put pressure on studios` bottom line.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Thank you for watching the special edition of NIGHTLY BUSINESS  REPORT.  I`m Bill Griffeth.  Merry Christmas, everybody.  We`ll see you  tomorrow.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

Sue is off tonight.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With the stock market closed this Christmas Day and 2019 wrapping up, it`s a good time to take a look at the year ahead to figure out what may be in store for the markets, the economy and your money. So that`s what we`re going to do tonight based on what we already know and what the experts believe are going to happen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So we begin with two reports on things we cover every day.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Steve Liesman will take a look at the economy, but first, Bob Pisani has the outlook for the stock market from the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Oil stocks bounce, rates go up and the direct listing craze will peak.</p><p>Here`s three predictions for 2020.</p><p>First, against all odds, energy stocks will outperform the S&amp;P 500. It`s been a lost decade for energy investors with oil stocks up to 6 percent in 10 years but a combination of high dividend yields and relatively low earnings multiples will make several companies much more attractive in 2020. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), for example, believes ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) could move up 50 percent to $100 as it sells assets, expands production and doubles its cash flow by 2025.</p><p>Second, lower rates in 2020? Not necessarily. Many central banks don`t seem to want it. Shifting political winds in Germany will lead to the passage of large scale stimulus plans to boost the slower economy. European bond yields will move back towards positive territory. That will force money out of European bonds all while pushing European yields higher and keeping the bank rally here going.</p><p>Finally, the direct listing craze will peak when Airbnb goes public during the listing. It`s all the rage right now. Private equity investors disappointed with IPO returns this year are pushing for direct listings to cut costs and allow employees and private equity to sell shares.</p><p>But no one asked the buy side. Direct listings Spotify and Slack are both underperforming the overall market. And a disappointing Airbnb debut will convince many that allowing early investors to sell all at once may not be right for everyone.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Nothing is more central to the outlook in 2020 than what happens to the trade war, but depressed growth here at home and around the world this year. It led the Federal Reserve to reverse course and cut rates sharply in 2019.</p><p>Here`s what to look out for in 2020.</p><p>First, the trade war should improve somewhat or at least not get worse. As the year drew to a close, that seemed to be the case already with the announcement of a limited U.S.-China phase one deal. Uncertainties will remain but businesses will learn to invest and prosper with a constant rumbling of trade disputes.</p><p>Second, assuming a lot of damage hasn`t already been done that should help to lead to improved global growth. That can help U.S. global growth towards 2.5 percent or a half point above where it likely close out 2019.</p><p>But, third, the Federal Reserve should remain on hold while much of this plays out. It could consider raising rates if global growth, also firms global inflation and other central banks start to hike.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And as Steve just mentioned, trade was one of the defining economic issues this year. And even though progress was made, there are still a number of things yet to be resolved.</p><p>Kayla Tausche takes a look at what 2020 might hold.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The Trump administration rocks the trade boat in 2019 with unpredictable tariffs and short-lived truces. In 2020, international trade will move back towards the status quo.</p><p>First, China tensions return to a simmer. Fireworks will fade when the U.S. and China sign off on a phase one deal in early January. A second deal will remain far off. But if China engages and enforces the first deal, expect tariffs to be rolled back slowly.</p><p>Second, farm finances will be in focus. As planting season gets underway, American farmers will size up the pain of a two-year trade war and the salve of new business with China, Mexico, Canada and Japan. Agriculture Secretary Sunny Purdue says more financial aid will be warranted if the ag economy doesn`t rebound quickly.</p><p>Third, Europe will be back in the crosshairs. As President Trump eyes re- election, he`ll hone in on a new target, the E.U., with rising tariffs on luxury goods, the president`s stamp speeches will be testing ground for new material on auto tariffs and energy sanctions. But he`ll pocket those fights until after November.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Kayla Tausche in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Joining us now to talk about what they see ahead for the economy and the markets next year, we have Jim O`Sullivan with us. He is chief U.S. macro strategist at TD Securities. John Lynch is chief investment strategist at LPL Financial.</p><p>Good to see you both. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>JIM O`SULLIVAN, TD SECURITIES U.S. MACRO STRATEGIST: Hi, Bill.</p><p>JOHN LYNCH, LPL FINANCIAL CHIEF STRATEGIST: Thank you.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Jim, let me start with you. I mean, we laid out here there were so many walls of worry for the markets in 2019, trade, the Fed, you know, on and on, slow growth overseas. But many of those are starting to be resolved right now.</p><p>What is your outlook for 2020?</p><p>O`SULLIVAN: Well, I think there will continue to be some anxiety and volatility along the way but in the end growth will remain modestly positive. So, the already record low expansion will continue at least at a weak pace. The unemployment rate is already at a 50-year low at 3.5 percent. So, I think the unemployment rate stays low.</p><p>But -- I mean, I think we haven`t necessarily seen the end of the follow through, the impact of weaker global growth or trade tensions. So, for now, the global backdrop is still pretty weak. I think in the end the economy will continue to grow at least modestly.</p><p>GRIFFETH: John, we`ve already seen a slowdown in hiring to begin with going into 2020. What other areas do you see that you`re going to be watching carefully going into the New Year?</p><p>LYNCH: Well, I think the most important area -- on the hiring thing, I think we have to moderate a little bit, right? Year 11 of the cycle.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Right.</p><p>LYNCH: I think the most important thing is we get clarity on trade as to whether or not business resumes investment, because that`s really the key, I think, if you want to consider businesses investing, that enables productivity to continue to grow and what the market translation for that is, markets can be sustained, because last year, we saw price dramatically outperform earnings. So, to the degree we have a better year in the stock market, we really need to see margins sustained. And if we get further clarity on business investment that helps productivity, which could therefore lead to upward business earnings investment.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Jim, we went through -- we`ve gone through a few cycles in the market in the last couple of years here. There will be a period of time when money managers will want to look to growth stocks but then they shifted to defensive stocks when the trade war was really heating up at some point. Now they`ve really migrated back to the growth stocks again.</p><p>What do you think will be the better performers in 2020?</p><p>O`SULLIVAN: And -- well, I wouldn`t -- I talked more about the economy I guess than the stock market per se, but I would say the backdrop is such that the tone is certainly better in terms of people feeling less worried about recession risks. But that said, it`s not all clear sailing either, I would say. I mean, again, the global backdrop is still on the softer side.</p><p>And trade policy uncertainty hasn`t necessarily gone away either.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Right.</p><p>O`SULLIVAN: And -- I mean, as far as the stock market and earnings go, yes, the P was up a lot more than E, and E by many measures was actually down a lot in the past year. So, it may be harder to squeeze much earnings growth out of the E and out of the economy at this point in the cycle.</p><p>GRIFFETH: But I guess what I`m getting at then is what does that mean for those companies that are involved in international trade? You know, those multi-nationals based here in the United States that have been suffering to some degree or did for a time because of the trade tensions with China? What happens now do you think?</p><p>O`SULLIVAN: Well, I mean, it`s a question of how quickly does global growth come back or if it comes back. I mean, certainly, it`s positive that we have the U.S.-China trade deal. There`s still uncertainty if there`s follow through on that.</p><p>And as Kayla mentioned in her piece, there`s some uncertainty about what happens with Europe as well. But the global numbers are still on the softer side. Certainly, the manufacturing numbers are still on the weaker side. So, it`s not as if the signing of the trade deal, assuming it happens in early January, is suddenly going to cause global growth to snap back. I think the backdrop is still on the soft side.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And, John, where do you stand on whether you should look for the high growth stocks again in the New Year or stick with some of the value and defensive plays out there?</p><p>LYNCH: We`re pairing back on growth. We`re looking at some opportunities in value. So, it`s more of an equal weight right now.</p><p>But to your point about those companies benefitting from the resumption of global trade, if you just look at the earnings forecast for 2020, we`re looking at 15 percent earnings growth for industrials and the energy space, two areas that have been affected quite a bit. And they are two of the leading sectors.</p><p>And then if you factor in the potential for higher market interest rates, that would also bode well for the financial sector.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Jim O`Sullivan with TD Securities, John Lynch with LPL Financial -- thank you again both for joining us.</p><p>O`SULLIVAN: Thank you, Bill.</p><p>LYNCH: Thank you, Bill.</p><p>GRIFFETH: 2020 also brings, of course, a presidential election, and the final year of President Trump`s first term. What should investors expect?</p><p>Here`s Eamon Javers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EAMON JAVERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: To paraphrase Winston Churchill, it`s either the beginning of the end of the Trump presidency or just the end of the beginning as the president ramps up his re-election campaign.</p><p>Here, three things to watch in 2020. First, the president survived impeachment. Conventional wisdom says an impeachment vote in the House will be followed by an acquittal in the Senate, meaning the president stays in office for all of 2020. But just about everything about the Trump era has been wildly unpredictable. So, watch this space.</p><p>Second, legislative letdown. The president began his first term with efforts to repeal Obamacare which failed, cut taxes which succeeded and slashed regulations which he has done. But there`s not much left on the president`s legislative agenda. And Democrats aren`t likely to pass a lot of the president`s priorities in an election year. So, don`t count on a lot of bill signings here in 2020.</p><p>Third, it`s all about that base. The president will campaign the same way he governs and the same way he won back in 2016, with a laser focus on his political base. For a chief executive who`s never top 46 percent in Gallup approval ratings, that means he knows he needs every voter he had last time and he doesn`t have much chance of converting those he didn`t. That means we`ll see an emotional, divisive and dramatic election.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Eamon Javers at the White House.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, lawmakers have a big to-do list for the New Year and one of the issues topping that agenda is regulating big tech.</p><p>Ylan Mui has been covering that story for us all year. She`s back with a look ahead.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YLAN MUI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Big tech was a big target on both sides of the political aisle this year, and the scrutiny will only grow as the 2020 elections get closer.</p><p>Watch out for a Capitol Hill crackdown. The House will wrap up its antitrust investigation early next year. Democrats still want the top tech CEOs to testify, and a source tells me they`re working on new legislation to ban mega (ph) mergers.</p><p>Over in the Senate, Republicans are trying to build support for a federal privacy law. And both parties are raising red flags over Chinese companies like Huawei and TikTok.</p><p>Meanwhile, regulators are also taking aim, the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department will try to focus their antitrust investigations into Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). Texas and New York are leading states in building their own cases against the companies, and California`s strict new privacy law goes into effect.</p><p>But the most heated rhetoric could come from the campaign trail where big tech faces an election year tests after the fallout from 2016. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) in particular is feeling the heat over political ads and fakes. But all the platforms are under pressure to prove they`re safe from misinformation and from hacking. They need to show they`ve learned a lesson from the last election.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Ylan Mui in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Still ahead, one of the biggest corporate stories of 2019 will likely dominate 2020 as well.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: It was another strong year for the labor market. 2019 brought the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years, and one of the biggest challenges that companies faced was finding those skilled workers.</p><p>Here`s Kate Rogers (NYSE:ROG).</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KATE ROGERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: A hot economy led to a tight market in 2019, with education and health services, leisure and hospitality and professional and business services leading the pack when it comes to job gains.</p><p>Here are the three predictions for the labor market in 2020.</p><p>First, workers remain in high demand. 2019 was truly an employee`s market as companies across sectors named finding and keeping talent a top challenge. Expect the trend to continue next year as unemployment remains historically low. Baby boomers continue to age out of the work force leaving an even smaller pool for employers.</p><p>Second, incentives and training continue. Upskilling or training workers already employed by a company is a move many employers are making and the supply of available talent remains low. Training programs along with incentives and more robust benefit offerings will be key in attracting and retaining workers.</p><p>Third, tech continues to change the game. From manufacturing to retail, technology is becoming an increasingly important part of the equation for workers. Look out for technological advances continuing to shape where and how employees do their jobs.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Kate Rogers (NYSE:ROG).</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: The real estate market went from hot to cold and then it started to warm up again, but next year could be a whole new ball game for housing.</p><p>Here`s Diana Olick.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The housing market is a mix of highs and lows. So, here`s what to watch in 2020.</p><p>First, the housing shortage will get worse. The number of homes for sale is already low and demand is incredibly strong, thanks to improving employment and the largest generation aging into its home-buying years. The demand, however, is mostly on the low end where supply is leanest. That will cause prices to continue to overheat at the entry level, while prices ease on the higher end where supply is more plentiful.</p><p>Second, mortgage rates will stay low. Mortgage rates dropped in 2019 and will likely stay low through 2020 as uncertainty over a trade war and presidential election year keep investors heavy in the bond market. Mortgage rates loosely follow the yield on a ten-year treasury.</p><p>The only wild card is mortgage finance reform. If major changes are made to the rolls of Fannie and Freddie, rates could finally break higher.</p><p>And third, we`re bullish on the builders. The combination of a major housing shortage and low interest rates will keep demand from new housing high, but single and multi family. The home builders have been ramping up production and in 2019, they finally started to pivot to entry-level homes.</p><p>If they can afford to put up even more big sales numbers, we`ll follow. Their headwinds, though, continue to be high prices for land, labor and regulatory compliance.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And joining us now with her predictions for the housing market in the New Year, Daryl Fairweather is back with us. She`s chief economist at Redfin.</p><p>Good to see you again. Welcome back.</p><p>DARYL FAIRWEATHER, REDFIN CHIEF ECONOMIST: Thank you for having me.</p><p>GRIFFETH: You know, in the last month or so, we got some pretty positive news on housing. You know, housing starts were higher. The permits were at a 12-year high. Builders themselves saw more optimism going into the New Year.</p><p>Does that necessarily mean that housing looks up that much beginning in 2020?</p><p>FAIRWEATHER: I think the housing market is going to be much more competitive in 2020. Right now, about 1/10 of offers submitted by Redfin agents based competition. I think that`s going to go up to 1 in 4, and that`s going to push prices higher amid low supply.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And therefore, you think we`re going to see the return to bidding wars in many markets around the country, right?</p><p>FAIRWEATHER: That`s right. Bidding wars kind of went away especially in places where they were really prevalent, like San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle. We`re going to see a return in bidding wars.</p><p>GRIFFETH: But that doesn`t help the low end, the starter home buyers right now where there has been just a dearth of supply in this market. What`s the outlook for that do you think?</p><p>FAIRWEATHER: First-time home buyers are going to have a much harder time. They`re more likely to lose bidding wars because based on its experience, it`s people who have been in the housing market, who have the cash to make all cash offers. First time home buyers may face less favorable mortgage conditions that these Fannie and Freddie changes go through. So, overall, I think first time home buyers are going to have a much harder time next year.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And the higher end of the market has struggled because of those higher prices where, you know, the affordability became an issue. You`re talking about higher prices next year. Won`t that still be a problem?</p><p>FAIRWEATHER: Home price growth won`t be quite as strong in the luxury end. We`ve seen markets like San Jose where there are $1 million, $2 million homes really go down in price this year. And they`re going to be in recovery mode next year. They`ll be looking a little bit stronger, but days of like 20 percent price growth in these luxury markets are long past.</p><p>GRIFFETH: What are -- you mentioned the San Jose market. Let`s talk about some other local markets around the country. Like in the Sunbelt, for example. Will we see better markets there, next year?</p><p>FAIRWEATHER: We`re seeing a lot of migration in our Redfin data. People looking on the coast into places like Texas, Arizona, other affordable markets. The Sunbelt is part of that.</p><p>So, we think those markets are going to be strong. They tend to be more affordable. So, they should do pretty well in 2020.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And what about in the industrial base, in the northern part of the country? I mean, you know, there is a revival for sorts going on in areas like Detroit and other parts of the northern parts of the United States. What do you see there?</p><p>FAIRWEATHER: Larger cities like Cleveland, Detroit, even Buffalo, those markets will do well. But some of the more rural parts of the Midwest and the Northeast, we`ll probably lose people and those markets won`t be as strong.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Daryl Fairweather, again, with Redfin -- thanks again for joining us.</p><p>FAIRWEATHER: Thank you.</p><p>GRIFFETH: You bet.</p><p>Now, one of the biggest corporate stories this year was Boeing (NYSE:BA)`s 737 MAX. It`s most likely going to be big news again in the New Year. At issue, all of that uncertainty over when the troubled plane will be back in the air.</p><p>Phil LeBeau has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL LEBEAU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Next year, Boeing (NYSE:BA)`s 737 MAX will have three critical moments. First, expect recertification early in 2020. The head of the FAA, Steve Dickson, has said he won`t approve the MAX until he flies it himself. And there are still a number of hurdles to clear before the MAX takes off.</p><p>But most believe it will be recertified in the first couple of months of next year. Once that happens, expect airlines to make a big push to convince fliers the MAX is safe. Southwest, American, and United have parked their MAX planes for almost a year. They know passengers may hesitate or flat out refuse to board a MAX, so executives of those airlines will be on MAX flights to reassure their customers the planes are good to go.</p><p>Once the MAX is back, look for Boeing (NYSE:BA) to slowly ramp up production. Yes, the assembly line will be down at the start of the year but Boeing (NYSE:BA) will likely go to building 42 a month by mid-year. What about the MAX airplanes that have been built but not yet delivered? They will eventually take off and go to the airlines that have ordered them. But it will take all of 2020 and beyond for Boeing (NYSE:BA) to clear out the inventory of more than 400 MAX airplanes.</p><p>Phil LeBeau, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Earlier this week, changes at Boeing (NYSE:BA) started with the ouster of CEO David Muilenburg on Monday. Current chairman David Calhoun will officially take over as CEO in January.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Coming up, why the great divide between retail`s winners and losers may grow in the New Year.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: The consumer definitely powered the economy in 2019. Spending was strong because companies kept hiring, but that doesn`t mean that all retailers reap the rewards.</p><p>Courtney Reagan takes a look now on what the New Year might bring.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: 2019 was a difficult year for retail with clear winners and losers. Expect the divergence to continue in 2020.</p><p>First, the tariff divide. While the country`s tariff schedule continues to evolve, brands and retailers aren`t waiting to adapt and some will do so easier than others. Big retailers like Target (NYSE:TGT), Walmart, and Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), you scale and influence to keep prices low for shoppers by insisting the brands they buy from take on whatever higher costs result. It will hurt smaller, less powerful players.</p><p>Second, old is new again. As the retail resell market grows, watch for more retailers to experiment with new ways of selling merchandise second hand, as Gen Z focuses on more shopping, watch for retailers to deploy new consignment options, giving old merchandise second life.</p><p>And third, new CEOs, new strategies. Many retailers have or will have new CEOs settle in, in the New Year, including Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond, Nike (NYSE:NKE), Under Armour (NYSE:UA), Tapestry and Gap (NYSE:GPS). Investors wait to see if the new leaders will dramatically shift the strategies in new directions and then decide if they`re willing to give them a chance to make change.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Courtney Reagan.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And it`s hard to talk about retail without mentioning ecommerce and the changing way that people shop. The fact that most consumers expect their packages to be delivered ASAP.</p><p>Frank Holland has that story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRANK HOLLAND, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: 2019 is on pace to be another record year for ecommerce, with holiday online sales forecasts increase as much as 14 percent, according to the National Retail Federation. And the trend is expected to continue in 2020.</p><p>Here`s what to watch.</p><p>First, e-commerce exceeds expectations.</p><p>The global e-commerce market could grow to $4 trillion in 2020 according to UBS, but has the potential to even larger as more retailers offer same day and next day shipping, along with added curve side pickup options. Also, total sales made by smartphones are expected to increase by 32 percent next year, according to E-Marketer.</p><p>Second, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) acquisitions.</p><p>Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)`s e-commerce empire is built on strong logistics on the ground and in the air. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) currently operates about 50 planes and expects to have 70 flying by 2021. Look for acquisitions in 2020 as it continues to grow its capacity for ground logistics and delivery.</p><p>And third, drone delivery.</p><p>FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and USP are battling to be the leader in residential drone deliveries. Both companies are testing technologies with drug store chains to deliver prescriptions and retail goods. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) also have their eyes on the skies when it comes to shipping. 2020 may be the year e-commerce takes flight in a whole new way.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Frank Holland.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And finally tonight, the changing way we all watch television. New streaming services are everywhere now with more and more content available at the touch of a button. What will 2020 bring to this fast- chasing business?</p><p>Well, sit back now and watch Julia Boorstin`s report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: In 2020, we`ll see the shifting power dynamic between media giants and tech titans battling for viewers.</p><p>First, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) will lose more subscribers in the U.S. as a slew of new streaming apps gain traction.</p><p>With NBCUniversal`s Peacock launching in April and HBO Max launching in May, on top of this year`s new additions of Disney (NYSE:DIS) Plus and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) TV Plus, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) will face stiff competition for subscribers here in the U.S., putting pressure on it to continue investing in content and to focus on international growth.</p><p>Second, ad supported streaming. With Peacock entering the fray will be the new front in the streaming wars. With the ad free subscription business, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) pioneered, now crowded, consumers, advertisers and content creators will shift focus to streaming ad supported content for free. NBCUniversal`s Peacock is going up against Viacom (NYSE:VIA)`s Pluto and independent Tubi and Xumo.</p><p>Third, the success of streaming video will eat into the box office which will decline next year.</p><p>All that streaming content raising the bar for going to the movies. And a declining box office, likely the big name franchises that broke records this year is likely to put pressure on studios` bottom line.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Thank you for watching the special edition of NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.

The Dow and S&amp;P crossed at all-time highs as the rally rolls on into years end.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Private push. California is considered the capital of tech world and about to set a new standard for Internet privacy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ringing in the New Year. Art Cashin is considered a legend on Wall Street, a fixture on the New York Stock Exchange. And tonight, he shares his predictions for 2020.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stores and much more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, December 27th.</p><p>And we do bid you good evening, everybody, and welcome. Sue is off tonight.</p><p>Now, every year brings new found optimism. And that sentiment has arrived early on Wall Street. That`s pretty clear. The Dow closed at yet another fresh record today. The S&amp;P also eked out an all-time high, putting it on track for its best year in more than two decades.</p><p>Today, the Dow gained another 23 points, now at 28,645. The Nasdaq slipped a bit from its peak but still remains above 9,000. And the S&amp;P rose by 11 cents. And by the way, it also notched its fifth straight week of gains.</p><p>Now, much of the focus this week has been on the technology sector with the Nasdaq breaking through 9,000 for the first time yesterday. We told you which stocks helped power that index to that level. Tonight, Dominic Chu takes a look at the stocks that could take it even higher.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOMINIC CHU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Stocks like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Nvidia have been helping to push the Nasdaq to outperform over the major U.S. indices. If the bullish trends in markets continues into the year 2020, which Nasdaq stocks are expected to do the heavy lifting?</p><p>Since the Nasdaq is a market valuated weighted index, the biggest companies have most influence over performance. Among the biggest names with market values of at least $100 billion, a handful are expected to produce double- digit gains. According to data compiled by FactSet, eight stocks currently fit the bill. Among them, streaming video giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) where the average analyst target price implies a 10 percent gain.</p><p>Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) will be navigating an increasingly competitive media landscape with a slough of streaming video services going head to head with it in the coming months.</p><p>Semiconductor maker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) has an average analyst target price that implies a gain of 12 percent thanks to the rollout of 5G wireless technology. Social media company Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) could rise by 15 percent if analyst projections are correct. Payment services company PayPal could see a gain of 17 percent in the coming year per those analyst estimates.</p><p>And then there is amazon.com. Analysts say the online retailer could rise by 17 percent next year as well. It`s coming off a record breaking holiday shopping season and while growth is slowing at its Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services could computing division, it`s still one of the biggest players in the industry.</p><p>If the bull market does manage to find more room to run in 2020, those could be among the stocks helping to push the Nasdaq towards the next 10,000 mark.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Dominic Chu.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Lets turn to Clark Kendall to talk about this record-setting market and what he sees in the New Year. He`s president and CEO of his own investment and wealth management firm, Kendall Capital.</p><p>Clark, thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>CLARK KENDALL, KENDALL CAPITAL PRESIDENT &amp; CEO: Bill, thank you for having me on this evening. It`s an honor.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And I hear you`re a bit cautious going into the New Year, yes?</p><p>KENDALL: Well, the markets moved a long way over a short period of time, especially this fourth quarter. And there`s been great divergence between the growth stocks and value stocks. So I think people need to be cautious. Look at the opportunity to rebalance your portfolio.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Yes, I mean, you`re old school clearly. Your advice is just don`t target the indices, look for companies that have of a good value, and have a good product. Is that the idea?</p><p>KENDALL: That`s the idea. And I think sometimes it`s good to know kind of where not to invest. The top 50 stocks now of the S&amp;P500 represent 50 percent of the S&amp;P 500 market cap. They`ve done well.</p><p>We saw the same thing happened 20 years ago, 1999. We saw a concentrated portfolio. I think there`s opportunity in those other 450 stocks of the S&amp;P.</p><p>GRIFFETH: You would think. Give me an example. What`s a company you like right now?</p><p>KENDALL: Well, we like -- as I said, there`s been great divergence for the value in growth stakes. We like things like Taylor Morris Homes. We like things like Lear (NYSE:LEA), the component maker of cars. And also I like the logistics and the -- the XPO Logistics and Werner, the trucking companies.</p><p>I think all the companies are trading 10 times or less cash flow. I think there is great opportunities there.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Now, our old friend Marty Zweig is the man who coined the phrase don`t fight the Fed. You subscribe to that as well. But the Fed really isn`t going to be in the way I would think next year. They`ve already said they don`t plan to do anything with interest rates.</p><p>KENDALL: That`s correct. Jerome Powell basically has said we`re going to have low GDP growth, low interest rates, low unemployment. So, I think we need to be cautious. I think this kind of go, go that we`re paying the premium for the growth stocks, we need to be worried about and I think we need to focus back on fundamentals of just buying good stocks.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Clark Kendall with Kendall Capital, again thanks for joining us. Happy New Year.</p><p>KENDALL: Happy New Year.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Now with tech still in focus, it turns out the sector could be a beneficiary of the trade deal with Mexico and Canada.</p><p>Ylan Mui took a closer look at the agreement and tells us what she found.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YLAN MUI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The USMCA is the first trade agreement with an entire chapter devoted to digital trade. And the tech industry hopes it will be a framework for future deals.</p><p>JASON OXMAN, ITI CEO: Digital trade and physical trade are both very important in the modern economy. And we want to make sure that trade rules, rules that permit the free flow of goods across borders also include the free flow of digital goods as well.</p><p>MUI: The USMCA includes a commitment to never impose tariffs on information as it moves between countries. The also prohibits the U.S. Mexico and Canada from mandating where the information should be stored.</p><p>This provision is critical for cloud service provide providers like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), but also think about connected wind turbine or smart fridges. Companies say that`s essentially to making sure those devices operate seamlessly.</p><p>OXMAN: It`s important to remember that every industry really is the technology industry. This is an important agreement for the tech sector but we also think it`s important for customers of the tech sector, whether it`s agriculture, or medicine. Whether it`s education or financial services all industries benefit from the cross border flow of data.</p><p>MUI: According to a government analysis, the deal is projected to boost the economy by removing uncertainty for businesses. Companies know the rules of the road won`t change. And that confidence could raise GDP by as much as 1.2 percent and create 589,000 jobs.</p><p>But there was some last minute controversy over safeguards for social media companies. Under the agreement, Canada and Mexico have to grant online platforms legal immunity from user posts. And that similar to a provision in U.S. law known as Section 230.</p><p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was initially opposed to including that language in the deal. But eventually she had to back down.</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA (NASDAQ:CA)), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: I mean, I lost. He had 230 in the agreement, which is in my view the wrong way to go. It`s a real gift to big tech.</p><p>MUI: A victory for the he can industry in the House. USMCA passed with broad bipartisan support. The Senate is now expected to take it up in the New Year.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Ylan Mui in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Now trade with China was arguably one of the biggest issues for the market in the 2019. And even though progress was made, there is still a lot of work to be done in the New Year.</p><p>Our Beijing correspondent Eunice Yoon spoke to the experts. She has some predictions for 2020.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Investors will have a lot to watch for in China in 2020. First, while a phase 1 deal is expected to be signed in January, trade negotiations between the U.S. and China will continue as the U.S. presidential election approaches. There will likely be uncertainty over what major American tech companies are allowed to sell to the Chinese and whether Chinese tech firms will be blocked from doing meaningful business in the U.S. second.</p><p>China`s economy will remain in focus. As leaders look for ways to manage the country`s lowest growth in decades, policymakers have indicated they prefer to stabilize the slowdown rather than use policy to reverse it.</p><p>And third, unrest in Hong Kong looks set to stay a sore point for the Chinese leadership in 2020. How Beijing handles the relationship will impact China`s standing in the world and the attractiveness of Hong Kong as a global financial center.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Eunice Yoon in Beijing.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And this year in the housing market, demand for single family rentals really took off demand. And that meant big gains for the big new companies behind millions of rental properties.</p><p>Diana Olick explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: In today`s tight and pricey housing market, more potential buyers are remaining renters, and turning to single family rental homes. Stocks of the major REITs behind these properties like Blackstone, Invitation Homes and American Homes for rent are way up year to date.</p><p>And companies that help investors buy and sell rental homes like RoofStock are also seeing explosive growth.</p><p>GARY BEASLEY, ROOFSTOCK CEO: Actually being able to transact buying and selling homes online is really powerful where you could squeeze out a lot of the friction and cost and pain around buying and selling homes doing it at a much lower cost.</p><p>OLICK: RoofStock launched three years ago but just surpassed $2 billion in rental property transactions. It also helped facilitate $210 million in sales for Invitation Homes. The number of sellers on the site has increased tenfold from last year.</p><p>BEASLEY: You could come to us with say $5,000 and buy a share of a rental home, all the way up to if you have $500 million and you`re a large institution and want to put that to work or sell a large portfolio. We can cater to that as well.</p><p>OLICK: A new index just launched this month shows both current leasing and expected leasing over the next six months at very strong levels. The occupancy rate is also at a solid 96 percent.</p><p>And builders are also turning to market. Putting up some of the first rental only communities like this one in San Antonio from AHB communities, big names like Lennar (NYSE:LEN) are also getting in the game.</p><p>The rental market is benefitting from a severe shortage of existing homes for sales. Millennials who are aging into their parenting years are looking for mores space and neighborhoods with good skills. As it`s harder to find or afford homes, the rental market will reap the rewards.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Still ahead, California about to enact unprecedented privacy protections on the internet and could be a blueprint for others.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Among the many regulatory changes coming in the New Year, firms in California are scrambling to comply with the state`s new privacy law, which aims to reshape the rules of the Internet when it comes to your data.</p><p>Jane Wells is in Los Angeles.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JANE WELLS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: California often tries to set national policy from the West Coast, whether it`s auto emission standards or clean energy, or how to classify workers in the gig economy. Starting January 1st, it sets a new standard for Internet privacy.</p><p>XAVIER BECERRA, CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL: Know that you`re going to have far more control and choice when it comes to your personal information than you`ve ever had.</p><p>ANDREW SHAXTED, FTI CONSULTING SENIOR DIRECTOR: This is a law that`s really unprecedented in the United States.</p><p>WELLS: By January 1st, companies doing business in California will have to make it clear on the home pages in this state what they do with customer data. They`ll also have to be a button there so customers can opt out of those policies. They also have to make it clear how you can find out the data they have on you. Violators will face fines and lawsuits.</p><p>SHAXTED: Many organizations are not going to be ready.</p><p>WELLS: Consultant Andrew Shaxted says some companies may not realize they have to comply. Under the law, any business with $25 million in revenue or which holds data on at least 50,000 customers or which makes half the revenue selling customer data has to obey the law.</p><p>The business doesn`t have to be based in California. You have to have at least one customer here. It`s created a mini boom for the compliance industry.</p><p>SHAXTED: There is governmental figures that place costs at about $50,000 for compliance. All the way up to $2.5 million for compliance for this one law.</p><p>WELLS: Companies have been sending out emails warning Californians that changes are at hand. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) is preparing to change when and how it sends out personalized ads. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) plans to use California`s law as a blueprint for its national privacy policy.</p><p>But Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is reportedly pushing back on what it has to disclose, suggesting that under the letter of the law, it`s technically not selling customer information, just sharing it.</p><p>Finally, what if President Trump who has feuded with California over other policies decides to step in on this one?</p><p>BECERRA: Do not undermine the ability for us in California to protect our consumers over the Internet. And do everything you can to improve on what California is already doing.</p><p>WELLS: As the tech capital of the world tries to protect its citizens from much of its own business model.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Jane Wells, Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: A different California law is pushing for more diversity on corporate boards which has historically been dominated by men. The regulation mandates that public companies have at least one female board member by the end of the year.</p><p>And as Julia Boorstin reports, changes are happening.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The face in the board room is indeed changing. This year, the percentage of first-time directors female is 57 percent up from 42 percent in 2017, according to Spencer Stewart. One organization helping female directors, the BoardList. It matches companies with qualified female board candidates. That organization tells us it sends out corporate searches for female directors more than tripled to 300 in 2019. And it`s not just in California. The BoardList says it sees the California law having a halo effect across the country.</p><p>Now, that halo is extending beyond gender. Diversity is also in focus. The percentage of first time directors that are minorities is 31 percent, up 10 percent from 2017.</p><p>Thanks to new appointments, women now comprise 26 percent of all directors, up from 16 percent back in the year 2009. Some analysts have raised concerns of over-boarding, the ideas that directors could be stretched too thin with too many board seats. The risk was mitigated by proxy advisers, asset managers such as Vanguard and companies placing limits onboard commitments.</p><p>Director of S&amp;P 500 companies serve on two boards on average and that number is unchanged over the last five years.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And one of the biggest issues facing businesses both big and small right now is the possibility of being hacked. As criminals become more sophisticated, the odds of a data breach rise. And that has meant more money being spent to protect corporate networks.</p><p>But some firms are doing it in a different way.</p><p>Here is Kate Rooney.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KATE ROONEY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Capital One and the U.S. military are paying hackers to break into their systems and find flaws before criminals do. It`s called a bug bounty problem. Most of the big tech companies have these programs. Start up HackerOne connects a network of white hat hackers to Fortune 500 companies and to government agencies. The freelancers get paid in exchange for finding vulnerabilities.</p><p>TANNER EMEK, HACKER FOR HIRE: We`re allies, right? We`re not just some sketchy people in their mom`s basements who are, you know, out there to cause damage.</p><p>ROONEY: According to IBM, the average cost of a data breach in the U.S. is 8.2 million. Hacker One CEO Marten Mickos says banks are at risk because of the pay off financial data.</p><p>MARTEN MICKOS, HACKERONE CEO: Neighborhood watch. We come to your house. We look for ways to break in. If we can break in, we tell you. We don`t break in.</p><p>ROONEY: The company is becoming a popular bet for investors. It`s backed by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Marc Benioff.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Kate Rooney.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Michael`s names its new president and CEO, and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\", with the arts and craft retailer announcing that Ashley Buchanan will be taking the reins in the New Year.</p><p>Buchanan comes from Walmart where she was a long time senior executive. And Wall Street cheered this move. Michaels shares jumped 33 percent to $8 even.</p><p>Another executive is leaving Boeing (NYSE:BA). The aerospace company long sometime general council Michael Luttig is retiring next week. Luttig was appointed back in the spring to lead the company`s legal strategy and to be an adviser to the board after the second 737 MAX crash which led to its grounding. That stock was up a fraction today to $330.14.</p><p>Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) is reportedly in discussions to buy video streaming company Xumo. The financial terms of the possible deal were not released. Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) own streaming service called Peacock is set to launch in spring. The shares rose a fraction today to $45.10. And just a reminder Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) is the parent company of NBCUniversal which produces this program.</p><p>Tesla is set to deliver its first Model 3 cars from its new Shanghai facility on Monday. In fact, the first 15 customers to receive them will be Tesla employees. The electric auto maker has agreements now with Chinese lenders to borrow more than $1 billion as it ramps up production in the country. Shares of Tesla fell a fraction today, $430.38</p><p>Spotify is banning political advertisements on its music streaming platform next year as the election season starts heats up. The company says the change will apply to its original and exclusive podcasts. Shares of Spotify were up a fraction today to $153.17.</p><p>All this week, we`ve been getting you ready for the New Year with a week of market monitors. And tonight`s guest is betting on the consumer in 2020. She has three names that she says could benefit from stronger consumer spending.</p><p>We welcome Victoria Fernandez tonight. She`s chief market strategist at Crossmark Global Investments.</p><p>Victoria, good to see you. Thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>VICTORIA FERNANDEZ, CROSSMARK GLOBAL INVESTMENT`S CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST: My pleasure, Bill.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And you`re choosing some brand names.</p><p>First, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). A lot of skepticism on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) the last few years. Slower iPhone sales. Lack of innovation. Slow start to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Plus, the streaming service, and yet the stock sits near at an all-time high.</p><p>You still like it going into the New Year, yes?</p><p>FERNANDEZ: We do like it. We actually just bought it in the portfolio the last few weeks. I think there is a lot of momentum going forward.</p><p>Like you said, a lot of it is based on the consumer. Yes, the phones have not done as well as people had expected, but we`ve got Air Pods that are selling out everywhere with the new 5G service coming, then phones should start to sell better. And really the services will continue to do well.</p><p>The TV Plus was off to a slow start but they`ll be building on that. We hear Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is in talks with MGM, with the PAC 12 to bring sports online. So I think there are some advantages for the stock going forward.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is your second pick. Now, a lot of skepticism about this company for years as well. When were they ever going to turn a profit? And admittedly, this stock has gone sideways essentially for the last 18 months. Why do you like this one going into the New Year?</p><p>FERNANDEZ: Well, and that`s one of the reasons, Bill, right. We have seen the stock move higher and high are it has gone sideways. It`s actually pulled back a little bit lately.</p><p>But we are starting to see some changes in Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Yes, they have their cloud business. They bought Whole Foods, and they went into the food business.</p><p>But one of the most expensive costs for online shoppers has been delivery, at least for the company, right? Target (NYSE:TGT) and Walmart and all those companies are paying a lot of money to do same day or next had-day shipping.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Right.</p><p>FERNANDEZ: And now, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is looking to build out their own delivery service. We think that going forward that can help the stock price.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Finally, electronic payments, very popular these days especially with millennials. A lot of businesses getting into that area. But MasterCard (NYSE:MA) is your choice in the payments area, why?</p><p>FERNANDEZ: It really is. When you look at all of the online things we have going on, it`s not just the online shopping like at Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) we spoke about. But it`s payments, online payments are happening. People do it for their bills, for subscription services, all of that is really growing.</p><p>And behind all that, on the backside, there has to be a credit card. MasterCard (NYSE:MA) has a great balance sheet. They have good cash on their balance sheet and we really see them doing well as the consumer continues to be strong in 2020.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Victoria Fernandez with Crossmark Global Investments -- again, thanks for joining us and happy New Year.</p><p>FERNANDEZ: Same to you.</p><p>GRIFFETH: And coming up, he is known as the dean of Wall Street. And tonight, Art Cashin shares his predictions for 2020.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Art Cashin has been a mainstay on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange more than half a century. He first started there back in 1964. Many consider the director of floor operations for UBS to be a institution by himself, a reassuring voice during booms and busts. His opinions are sought after. His analysis is so valued.</p><p>So, as 2019 comes to a close, our Bob Pisani asked him what he sees in the year ahead.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: We sat down with Art Cashin at Bobby Vans Steakhouse to chat about what`s ahead in 2020. His first prediction, despite a still strong U.S. economy, there will be no Fed rate hikes in 2020.</p><p>ART CASHIN, UBS FLOOR OPERATIONS DIRECTOR: Absolutely no rate hike. Because I think the Fed is somewhat intimidated by the market. And the market, if anything, thinks the Fed is ahead of itself on higher rates.</p><p>PISANI: Prediction 2, the market win streak will continue. The broader indexes will all up in 2020.</p><p>CASHIN: Eight out of nine times that we have had an up year like we had this year, it`s followed by another decent up year, not quite as strong. But notably strong and so I`ll go with history.</p><p>PISANI: Prediction three, stocks may be up, but there will be several periods of volatility, particularly in January, March and July.</p><p>CASHIN: In late January, we`ll get to see if there is going to be a Brexit and how that Johnson got a sweeping move in parliament. And will he in fact push through a no-deal Brexit? That could make the markets very volatile and jumpy.</p><p>The next thing will be the U.S. election. And that will only be a contributor to volatility when we begin to get a handle on who the Democratic nominee will be. So, that to me gives two yard sticks.</p><p>Number one, early March when we will get Super Tuesday and one third of the U.S. populace will vote. And we`ll get to find out where Bloomberg`s strategy is, who looks to be the leader. Has anybody locked it up?</p><p>If not, then it could be a brokered convention. And that date would be in the middle of July when the convention will be.</p><p>PISANI: For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Before we go, a final look at the day on Wall Street. More records, the Dow and S&amp;P at all-time highs. Nasdaq slipped from the peak but still remained above 9,000. In fact, the S&amp;P notched its fifth straight week of gains.</p><p>Finally tonight, before we go we have news to share with you. After nearly seven years and more than 1,700 broadcasts tonight`s episode of NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT produced by CNBC will be our last. It`s been an amazing journey for Sue and me, and for Tyler Mathisen and Susie Gharib before.</p><p>NBR was created almost 41 years ago by Linda O`Brien, who I happen to know is watching with great pride tonight. It`s been an honor for all of us, both in front of, and behind the camera, to bring you the most important business and economic news every night. We want to thank everyone in the public television community for their support.</p><p>But most of all, we couldn`t have done this without you, the viewer.</p><p>So from all of us at NBR, we thank you very much. I`m Bill Griffeth.</p><p>And to close things out, I gladly defer to the man who, for many years, was synonymous with this program, the late great Paul Kangas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PAUL KANGAS, FORMER NBR ANCHOR: Wishing all of you, the best of goodbyes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

The Dow and  S&amp;P crossed at all-time highs as the rally rolls on into years end.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Private push.  California is considered the capital of tech world and about  to set a new standard for Internet privacy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ringing in the New Year.  Art Cashin is considered a legend on Wall Street,  a fixture on the New York Stock Exchange.  And tonight, he shares his  predictions for 2020.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stores and much more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday,  December 27th.</p><p>And we do bid you good evening, everybody, and welcome.  Sue is off  tonight.</p><p>Now, every year brings new found optimism.  And that sentiment has arrived  early on Wall Street.  That`s pretty clear.  The Dow closed at yet another  fresh record today.  The S&amp;P also eked out an all-time high, putting it on  track for its best year in more than two decades.</p><p>Today, the Dow gained another 23 points, now at 28,645.  The Nasdaq slipped  a bit from its peak but still remains above 9,000.  And the S&amp;P rose by 11  cents.  And by the way, it also notched its fifth straight week of gains.</p><p>Now, much of the focus this week has been on the technology sector with the  Nasdaq breaking through 9,000 for the first time yesterday.  We told you  which stocks helped power that index to that level.  Tonight, Dominic Chu  takes a look at the stocks that could take it even higher.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOMINIC CHU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Stocks like Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Nvidia have  been helping to push the Nasdaq to outperform over the major U.S. indices.   If the bullish trends in markets continues into the year 2020, which Nasdaq  stocks are expected to do the heavy lifting?</p><p>Since the Nasdaq is a market valuated weighted index, the biggest companies  have most influence over performance.  Among the biggest names with market  values of at least $100 billion, a handful are expected to produce double- digit gains.  According to data compiled by FactSet, eight stocks currently  fit the bill.  Among them, streaming video giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)  where the average analyst target price implies a 10 percent gain.</p><p>Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) will be navigating an increasingly competitive media  landscape with a slough of streaming video services going head to head with  it in the coming months.</p><p>Semiconductor maker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) has an average analyst target  price that implies a gain of 12 percent thanks to the rollout of 5G  wireless technology.  Social media company Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) could rise  by 15 percent if analyst projections are correct.  Payment services company  PayPal could see a gain of 17 percent in the coming year per those analyst  estimates.</p><p>And then there is amazon.com.  Analysts say the online retailer could rise  by 17 percent next year as well.  It`s coming off a record breaking holiday  shopping season and while growth is slowing at its Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web  Services could computing division, it`s still one of the biggest players in  the industry.</p><p>If the bull market does manage to find more room to run in 2020, those  could be among the stocks helping to push the Nasdaq towards the next  10,000 mark.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Dominic Chu.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Lets turn to Clark Kendall to talk about this record-setting  market and what he sees in the New Year.  He`s president and CEO of his own  investment and wealth management firm, Kendall Capital.</p><p>Clark, thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>CLARK KENDALL, KENDALL CAPITAL PRESIDENT &amp; CEO:  Bill, thank you for having  me on this evening.  It`s an honor.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And I hear you`re a bit cautious going into the New Year, yes?</p><p>KENDALL:  Well, the markets moved a long way over a short period of time,  especially this fourth quarter.  And there`s been great divergence between  the growth stocks and value stocks.  So I think people need to be cautious.   Look at the opportunity to rebalance your portfolio.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Yes, I mean, you`re old school clearly.  Your advice is just  don`t target the indices, look for companies that have of a good value, and  have a good product.  Is that the idea?</p><p>KENDALL:  That`s the idea.  And I think sometimes it`s good to know kind of  where not to invest.  The top 50 stocks now of the S&amp;P500 represent 50  percent of the S&amp;P 500 market cap.  They`ve done well.</p><p>We saw the same thing happened 20 years ago, 1999.  We saw a concentrated  portfolio.  I think there`s opportunity in those other 450 stocks of the  S&amp;P.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  You would think.  Give me an example.  What`s a company you like  right now?</p><p>KENDALL:  Well, we like -- as I said, there`s been great divergence for the  value in growth stakes.  We like things like Taylor Morris Homes.  We like  things like Lear (NYSE:LEA), the component maker of cars.  And also I like  the logistics and the -- the XPO Logistics and Werner, the trucking  companies.</p><p>I think all the companies are trading 10 times or less cash flow.  I think  there is great opportunities there.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Now, our old friend Marty Zweig is the man who coined the phrase  don`t fight the Fed.  You subscribe to that as well.  But the Fed really  isn`t going to be in the way I would think next year.  They`ve already said  they don`t plan to do anything with interest rates.</p><p>KENDALL:  That`s correct.  Jerome Powell basically has said we`re going to  have low GDP growth, low interest rates, low unemployment.  So, I think we  need to be cautious.  I think this kind of go, go that we`re paying the  premium for the growth stocks, we need to be worried about and I think we  need to focus back on fundamentals of just buying good stocks.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Clark Kendall with Kendall Capital, again thanks for joining us.   Happy New Year.</p><p>KENDALL:  Happy New Year.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Now with tech still in focus, it turns out the sector could be a  beneficiary of the trade deal with Mexico and Canada.</p><p>Ylan Mui took a closer look at the agreement and tells us what she found.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YLAN MUI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The USMCA is the first  trade agreement with an entire chapter devoted to digital trade.  And the  tech industry hopes it will be a framework for future deals.</p><p>JASON OXMAN, ITI CEO:  Digital trade and physical trade are both very  important in the modern economy.  And we want to make sure that trade  rules, rules that permit the free flow of goods across borders also include  the free flow of digital goods as well.</p><p>MUI:  The USMCA includes a commitment to never impose tariffs on  information as it moves between countries.  The also prohibits the U.S.  Mexico and Canada from mandating where the information should be stored.</p><p>This provision is critical for cloud service provide providers like Amazon  (NASDAQ:AMZN), but also think about connected wind turbine or smart  fridges.  Companies say that`s essentially to making sure those devices  operate seamlessly.</p><p>OXMAN:  It`s important to remember that every industry really is the  technology industry.  This is an important agreement for the tech sector  but we also think it`s important for customers of the tech sector, whether  it`s agriculture, or medicine.  Whether it`s education or financial  services all industries benefit from the cross border flow of data.</p><p>MUI:  According to a government analysis, the deal is projected to boost  the economy by removing uncertainty for businesses.  Companies know the  rules of the road won`t change.  And that confidence could raise GDP by as  much as 1.2 percent and create 589,000 jobs.</p><p>But there was some last minute controversy over safeguards for social media  companies.  Under the agreement, Canada and Mexico have to grant online  platforms legal immunity from user posts.  And that similar to a provision  in U.S. law known as Section 230.</p><p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was initially opposed to including that language  in the deal.  But eventually she had to back down.</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA (NASDAQ:CA)), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  I mean, I  lost.  He had 230 in the agreement, which is in my view the wrong way to  go.  It`s a real gift to big tech.</p><p>MUI:  A victory for the he can industry in the House.  USMCA passed with  broad bipartisan support.  The Senate is now expected to take it up in the  New Year.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Ylan Mui in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Now trade with China was arguably one of the biggest issues for  the market in the 2019.  And even though progress was made, there is still  a lot of work to be done in the New Year.</p><p>Our Beijing correspondent Eunice Yoon spoke to the experts.  She has some  predictions for 2020.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EUNICE YOON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Investors will have a  lot to watch for in China in 2020.  First, while a phase 1 deal is expected  to be signed in January, trade negotiations between the U.S. and China will  continue as the U.S. presidential election approaches.  There will likely  be uncertainty over what major American tech companies are allowed to sell  to the Chinese and whether Chinese tech firms will be blocked from doing  meaningful business in the U.S. second.</p><p>China`s economy will remain in focus.  As leaders look for ways to manage  the country`s lowest growth in decades, policymakers have indicated they  prefer to stabilize the slowdown rather than use policy to reverse it.</p><p>And third, unrest in Hong Kong looks set to stay a sore point for the  Chinese leadership in 2020.  How Beijing handles the relationship will  impact China`s standing in the world and the attractiveness of Hong Kong as  a global financial center.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Eunice Yoon in Beijing.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And this year in the housing market, demand for single family  rentals really took off demand.  And that meant big gains for the big new  companies behind millions of rental properties.</p><p>Diana Olick explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  In today`s tight and  pricey housing market, more potential buyers are remaining renters, and  turning to single family rental homes.  Stocks of the major REITs behind  these properties like Blackstone, Invitation Homes and American Homes for  rent are way up year to date.</p><p>And companies that help investors buy and sell rental homes like RoofStock  are also seeing explosive growth.</p><p>GARY BEASLEY, ROOFSTOCK CEO:  Actually being able to transact buying and  selling homes online is really powerful where you could squeeze out a lot  of the friction and cost and pain around buying and selling homes doing it  at a much lower cost.</p><p>OLICK:  RoofStock launched three years ago but just surpassed $2 billion in  rental property transactions.  It also helped facilitate $210 million in  sales for Invitation Homes.  The number of sellers on the site has  increased tenfold from last year.</p><p>BEASLEY:  You could come to us with say $5,000 and buy a share of a rental  home, all the way up to if you have $500 million and you`re a large  institution and want to put that to work or sell a large portfolio.  We can  cater to that as well.</p><p>OLICK:  A new index just launched this month shows both current leasing and  expected leasing over the next six months at very strong levels.  The  occupancy rate is also at a solid 96 percent.</p><p>And builders are also turning to market.  Putting up some of the first  rental only communities like this one in San Antonio from AHB communities,  big names like Lennar (NYSE:LEN) are also getting in the game.</p><p>The rental market is benefitting from a severe shortage of existing homes  for sales.  Millennials who are aging into their parenting years are  looking for mores space and neighborhoods with good skills.  As it`s harder  to find or afford homes, the rental market will reap the rewards.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Still ahead, California about to enact unprecedented privacy  protections on the internet and could be a blueprint for others.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Among the many regulatory changes coming in the New Year, firms  in California are scrambling to comply with the state`s new privacy law,  which aims to reshape the rules of the Internet when it comes to your data.</p><p>Jane Wells is in Los Angeles.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JANE WELLS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  California often tries  to set national policy from the West Coast, whether it`s auto emission  standards or clean energy, or how to classify workers in the gig economy.   Starting January 1st, it sets a new standard for Internet privacy.</p><p>XAVIER BECERRA, CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL:  Know that you`re going to  have far more control and choice when it comes to your personal information  than you`ve ever had.</p><p>ANDREW SHAXTED, FTI CONSULTING SENIOR DIRECTOR:  This is a law that`s  really unprecedented in the United States.</p><p>WELLS:  By January 1st, companies doing business in California will have to  make it clear on the home pages in this state what they do with customer  data.  They`ll also have to be a button there so customers can opt out of  those policies.  They also have to make it clear how you can find out the  data they have on you.  Violators will face fines and lawsuits.</p><p>SHAXTED:  Many organizations are not going to be ready.</p><p>WELLS:  Consultant Andrew Shaxted says some companies may not realize they  have to comply.  Under the law, any business with $25 million in revenue or  which holds data on at least 50,000 customers or which makes half the  revenue selling customer data has to obey the law.</p><p>The business doesn`t have to be based in California.  You have to have at  least one customer here.  It`s created a mini boom for the compliance  industry.</p><p>SHAXTED:  There is governmental figures that place costs at about $50,000  for compliance.  All the way up to $2.5 million for compliance for this one  law.</p><p>WELLS:  Companies have been sending out emails warning Californians that  changes are at hand.  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) is preparing to change when and  how it sends out personalized ads.  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) plans to use  California`s law as a blueprint for its national privacy policy.</p><p>But Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is reportedly pushing back on what it has to  disclose, suggesting that under the letter of the law, it`s technically not  selling customer information, just sharing it.</p><p>Finally, what if President Trump who has feuded with California over other  policies decides to step in on this one?</p><p>BECERRA:  Do not undermine the ability for us in California to protect our  consumers over the Internet.  And do everything you can to improve on what  California is already doing.</p><p>WELLS:  As the tech capital of the world tries to protect its citizens from  much of its own business model.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Jane Wells, Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  A different California law is pushing for more diversity on  corporate boards which has historically been dominated by men.  The  regulation mandates that public companies have at least one female board  member by the end of the year.</p><p>And as Julia Boorstin reports, changes are happening.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The face in the  board room is indeed changing.  This year, the percentage of first-time  directors female is 57 percent up from 42 percent in 2017, according to  Spencer Stewart.  One organization helping female directors, the BoardList.   It matches companies with qualified female board candidates.  That  organization tells us it sends out corporate searches for female directors  more than tripled to 300 in 2019.  And it`s not just in California.  The  BoardList says it sees the California law having a halo effect across the  country.</p><p>Now, that halo is extending beyond gender.  Diversity is also in focus.   The percentage of first time directors that are minorities is 31 percent,  up 10 percent from 2017.</p><p>Thanks to new appointments, women now comprise 26 percent of all directors,  up from 16 percent back in the year 2009.  Some analysts have raised  concerns of over-boarding, the ideas that directors could be stretched too  thin with too many board seats.  The risk was mitigated by proxy advisers,  asset managers such as Vanguard and companies placing limits onboard  commitments.</p><p>Director of S&amp;P 500 companies serve on two boards on average and that  number is unchanged over the last five years.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And one of the biggest issues facing businesses both big and  small right now is the possibility of being hacked.  As criminals become  more sophisticated, the odds of a data breach rise.  And that has meant  more money being spent to protect corporate networks.</p><p>But some firms are doing it in a different way.</p><p>Here is Kate Rooney.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KATE ROONEY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Goldman Sachs  (NYSE:GS), Capital One and the U.S. military are paying hackers to break  into their systems and find flaws before criminals do.  It`s called a bug  bounty problem.  Most of the big tech companies have these programs.  Start  up HackerOne connects a network of white hat hackers to Fortune 500  companies and to government agencies.  The freelancers get paid in exchange  for finding vulnerabilities.</p><p>TANNER EMEK, HACKER FOR HIRE:  We`re allies, right?  We`re not just some  sketchy people in their mom`s basements who are, you know, out there to  cause damage.</p><p>ROONEY:  According to IBM, the average cost of a data breach in the U.S. is  8.2 million.  Hacker One CEO Marten Mickos says banks are at risk because  of the pay off financial data.</p><p>MARTEN MICKOS, HACKERONE CEO:  Neighborhood watch.  We come to your house.   We look for ways to break in.  If we can break in, we tell you.  We don`t  break in.</p><p>ROONEY:  The company is becoming a popular bet for investors.  It`s backed  by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Marc Benioff.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Kate Rooney.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Michael`s names its new president and CEO, and that`s where we  begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\", with the arts and craft retailer announcing  that Ashley Buchanan will be taking the reins in the New Year.</p><p>Buchanan comes from Walmart where she was a long time senior executive.   And Wall Street cheered this move.  Michaels shares jumped 33 percent to $8  even.</p><p>Another executive is leaving Boeing (NYSE:BA).  The aerospace company long  sometime general council Michael Luttig is retiring next week.  Luttig was  appointed back in the spring to lead the company`s legal strategy and to be  an adviser to the board after the second 737 MAX crash which led to its  grounding.  That stock was up a fraction today to $330.14.</p><p>Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) is reportedly in discussions to buy video  streaming company Xumo.  The financial terms of the possible deal were not  released.  Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) own streaming service called  Peacock is set to launch in spring.  The shares rose a fraction today to  $45.10.  And just a reminder Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) is the  parent company of NBCUniversal which produces this program.</p><p>Tesla is set to deliver its first Model 3 cars from its new Shanghai  facility on Monday.  In fact, the first 15 customers to receive them will  be Tesla employees.  The electric auto maker has agreements now with  Chinese lenders to borrow more than $1 billion as it ramps up production in  the country.  Shares of Tesla fell a fraction today, $430.38</p><p>Spotify is banning political advertisements on its music streaming platform  next year as the election season starts heats up.  The company says the  change will apply to its original and exclusive podcasts.  Shares of  Spotify were up a fraction today to $153.17.</p><p>All this week, we`ve been getting you ready for the New Year with a week of  market monitors.  And tonight`s guest is betting on the consumer in 2020.   She has three names that she says could benefit from stronger consumer  spending.</p><p>We welcome Victoria Fernandez tonight.  She`s chief market strategist at  Crossmark Global Investments.</p><p>Victoria, good to see you.  Thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>VICTORIA FERNANDEZ, CROSSMARK GLOBAL INVESTMENT`S CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST:   My pleasure, Bill.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And you`re choosing some brand names.</p><p>First, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  A lot of skepticism on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) the  last few years.  Slower iPhone sales.  Lack of innovation.  Slow start to  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Plus, the streaming service, and yet the stock sits  near at an all-time high.</p><p>You still like it going into the New Year, yes?</p><p>FERNANDEZ:  We do like it.  We actually just bought it in the portfolio the  last few weeks.  I think there is a lot of momentum going forward.</p><p>Like you said, a lot of it is based on the consumer.  Yes, the phones have  not done as well as people had expected, but we`ve got Air Pods that are  selling out everywhere with the new 5G service coming, then phones should  start to sell better.  And really the services will continue to do well.</p><p>The TV Plus was off to a slow start but they`ll be building on that.  We  hear Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is in talks with MGM, with the PAC 12 to bring  sports online.  So I think there are some advantages for the stock going  forward.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is your second pick.  Now, a lot of  skepticism about this company for years as well.  When were they ever going  to turn a profit?  And admittedly, this stock has gone sideways essentially  for the last 18 months.  Why do you like this one going into the New Year?</p><p>FERNANDEZ:  Well, and that`s one of the reasons, Bill, right.  We have seen  the stock move higher and high are it has gone sideways.  It`s actually  pulled back a little bit lately.</p><p>But we are starting to see some changes in Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).  Yes, they  have their cloud business.  They bought Whole Foods, and they went into the  food business.</p><p>But one of the most expensive costs for online shoppers has been delivery,  at least for the company, right?  Target (NYSE:TGT) and Walmart and all  those companies are paying a lot of money to do same day or next had-day  shipping.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Right.</p><p>FERNANDEZ:  And now, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is looking to build out their own  delivery service.  We think that going forward that can help the stock  price.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Finally, electronic payments, very popular these days especially  with millennials.  A lot of businesses getting into that area.  But  MasterCard (NYSE:MA) is your choice in the payments area, why?</p><p>FERNANDEZ:  It really is.  When you look at all of the online things we  have going on, it`s not just the online shopping like at Amazon  (NASDAQ:AMZN) we spoke about.  But it`s payments, online payments are  happening.  People do it for their bills, for subscription services, all of  that is really growing.</p><p>And behind all that, on the backside, there has to be a credit card.   MasterCard (NYSE:MA) has a great balance sheet.  They have good cash on  their balance sheet and we really see them doing well as the consumer  continues to be strong in 2020.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Victoria Fernandez with Crossmark Global Investments -- again,  thanks for joining us and happy New Year.</p><p>FERNANDEZ:  Same to you.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And coming up, he is known as the dean of Wall Street.  And  tonight, Art Cashin shares his predictions for 2020.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Art Cashin has been a mainstay on the floor of the New York  Stock Exchange more than half a century.  He first started there back in  1964.  Many consider the director of floor operations for UBS to be a  institution by himself, a reassuring voice during booms and busts.  His  opinions are sought after.  His analysis is so valued.</p><p>So, as 2019 comes to a close, our Bob Pisani asked him what he sees in the  year ahead.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  We sat down with Art  Cashin at Bobby Vans Steakhouse to chat about what`s ahead in 2020.  His  first prediction, despite a still strong U.S. economy, there will be no Fed  rate hikes in 2020.</p><p>ART CASHIN, UBS FLOOR OPERATIONS DIRECTOR:  Absolutely no rate hike.   Because I think the Fed is somewhat intimidated by the market.  And the  market, if anything, thinks the Fed is ahead of itself on higher rates.</p><p>PISANI:  Prediction 2, the market win streak will continue.  The broader  indexes will all up in 2020.</p><p>CASHIN:  Eight out of nine times that we have had an up year like we had  this year, it`s followed by another decent up year, not quite as strong.   But notably strong and so I`ll go with history.</p><p>PISANI:  Prediction three, stocks may be up, but there will be several  periods of volatility, particularly in January, March and July.</p><p>CASHIN:  In late January, we`ll get to see if there is going to be a Brexit  and how that Johnson got a sweeping move in parliament.  And will he in  fact push through a no-deal Brexit?  That could make the markets very  volatile and jumpy.</p><p>The next thing will be the U.S. election.  And that will only be a  contributor to volatility when we begin to get a handle on who the  Democratic nominee will be.  So, that to me gives two yard sticks.</p><p>Number one, early March when we will get Super Tuesday and one third of the  U.S. populace will vote.  And we`ll get to find out where Bloomberg`s  strategy is, who looks to be the leader.  Has anybody locked it up?</p><p>If not, then it could be a brokered convention.  And that date would be in  the middle of July when the convention will be.</p><p>PISANI:  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Before we go, a final look at the day on Wall Street.  More  records, the Dow and S&amp;P at all-time highs.  Nasdaq slipped from the peak  but still remained above 9,000.  In fact, the S&amp;P notched its fifth  straight week of gains.</p><p>Finally tonight, before we go we have news to share with you.  After nearly  seven years and more than 1,700 broadcasts tonight`s episode of NIGHTLY  BUSINESS REPORT produced by CNBC will be our last.  It`s been an amazing  journey for Sue and me, and for Tyler Mathisen and Susie Gharib before.</p><p>NBR was created almost 41 years ago by Linda O`Brien, who I happen to know  is watching with great pride tonight.  It`s been an honor for all of us,  both in front of, and behind the camera, to bring you the most important  business and economic news every night.  We want to thank everyone in the  public television community for their support.</p><p>But most of all, we couldn`t have done this without you, the viewer.</p><p>So from all of us at NBR, we thank you very much.  I`m Bill Griffeth.</p><p>And to close things out, I gladly defer to the man who, for many years, was  synonymous with this program, the late great Paul Kangas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PAUL KANGAS, FORMER NBR ANCHOR:  Wishing all of you, the best of goodbyes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

Investors will be sorry to see 2017 end, as stocks post their best gains  since 2013.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Portfolio picks.  Our market monitor has three stocks for the New Year he  says will have strong earnings growth and come with a good price tag.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> And food for thought.  How one entrepreneur made millions from his love of  flowers, fruit, and chocolate.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> All that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, December  29th.</p><p> Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  Sue Herera has the rest of the year  off.  </p><p> On Wall Street, it is game, set, and match.  And what a match it was.  The  books are closed for 2017.  And for stock investors all around the globe,  virtually no matter the market you were in, you made money this past year - - sometimes lots of it.  </p><p> Here in the U.S., the major indexes set records seemingly every week.  The  Dow and Nasdaq had 71 and 72 record all-time high closes respectively.  No  other year comes close.  The S&amp;P 500 had 62.  And those records led to  numbers like these for 2017.  </p><p> The Dow up 25 percent.  The Nasdaq, 28.  And the S&amp;P 500, 19 percent.  </p><p> But we dug a little deeper and we found some surprises in those numbers.   If you're worried these outsized results might indicate an overheated  market, you're entitled to feel that way.  But consider this, going back to  the Reagan administration that began in 1981, none, none of these gaudy  percentage gains even rank in the top five year by year.  </p><p> This year's Dow comes the closest.  Sixth best year since '81.  In fact,  this wasn't even the Dow's best decade, 2013 was, up 26.5 percent.  It was  also, believe it or not, an eerily calm.  To put it to perspective, 2015  and '16 combined saw the S&amp;P 500 move 1 percent in either direction almost  120 times.  Guess how many this year?  Eight.  </p><p> But the many happy returns weren't confined to just stocks.  Oil closed  above $60 a barrel for the first time in 2 1/2 years and rose more than 12  percent for the year.  And the metals gold and copper also had their best  years since 2010.  </p><p> Now, as for today, stocks kind of ran out of gas at the end.  It shouldn't  come as a surprise.  It is, after all, the fourth straight year the  averages ended the final trading day lower.  The Dow dropped 118 points,  finishing shy of 25,000.  Nasdaq fell 46.  The S&amp;P 500 was off just about  14.  </p><p> Bob Pisani has more on the big year that was.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  As traders look back on  a very unusual year, the big issue is, will all the good news continue into  2018.  There was a lot of it in 2017.  The S&amp;P rose 20 percent, its best  return since 2013.  The U.S. economy grew modestly.  </p><p> But stocks were also helped by a global economic expansion, record earnings  for companies, low volatility, low interest rates, and the expectation of  tax cuts as income at the end of the year.  The big winners were  semiconductors.  They rode the wave of buying in smartphones, smart  appliances, and electric vehicles, as well as homebuilders that rode the  wave of low interest rates, limited supply, and more young people going out  on their own.  </p><p> Commodity stocks like copper manufacturers were also strong because the  global economy improved.  One notable laggard was oil stocks.  Even though  oil moved towards $60 at the end of year to two-year highs, investors who  had been burned by the big drop in oil in 2015 and 2016, they mostly stayed  away.  </p><p> This was also a big year for the global stock market as economies around  the world improved in both developed and emerging markets.  So, Vietnam,  India, Brazil, Hong Kong, saw double digit gains with mid-single digit  gains in much of Europe.  </p><p> The issue for 2018 is, will global growth continue?  And what about  earnings?  They will get a boost next year thanks to tax cuts, but what  happens after that?  </p><p> The final issue is inflation.  It's been relatively contained because wage  growth has been modest.  But with the economy heating up, that may change.   Now, if inflation picks up, the Federal Reserve may raise rates more  aggressively and that could stall out the rally.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MATHISEN:  Well, this past year, the Nasdaq composite outperformed its more  senior index brethren with a nearly 30 percent gain, topping 7,000 for the  first time this year.  </p><p> And as Bertha Coombs tells, big name tech led the way.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  As Mark Twain put  it, history doesn't repeat but it often rhymes.  That's certainly true with  the Nasdaq 100.  It's the only major index up 9 straight years, since the  Great Recession, making for the longest annual win streak since the big  tech breakouts of the 1990s.  </p><p> And just as then, it's the big mega cap tech stocks that are responsible  for the gains.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) have provided the biggest lift to  the overall market and the S&amp;P 500.  And when you add in Alphabet, they  accounted for two-thirds of the Nasdaq 100's 1,500-point gain in 2017.  </p><p> Here is the rhyme part.  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which was a tech  heavyweight back in the '90s, benefiting from its shift to cloud technology  here over the last few years, up for six straight years, seeing its best  annual win streak since the launch of Windows back in 1995.  Consumer names  were the biggest laggards of 2017.  Many like Dish took a hit in the third  quarter due to hurricanes.  Now, auto parts retailer O'Reilly Automotive  (NASDAQ:ORLY), which had ridden the Nasdaq rally to historic highs, down  for the first time in eight years.  </p><p> And Ulta Beauty, which had seen consistently all-time highs for the last  three years, snapping a three-year bull run.  But like a lot of retailers,  both O'Reilly and Ulta pay a tax rate that is above 37 percent.  That's  what they're expecting for the fourth quarter.  In 2018, under the new tax  code, those retailers could see a 16-point drop in their tax rate, which  could result in a big boost to earnings per share, and perhaps could get  their stock back in line with the big tech leaders. </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bertha Coombs at the Nasdaq.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MATHISEN:  Time now for our final market monitor for this week, in fact for  this year.  He's got three domestic picks he says will see a double digit  rise in earnings per share next year, thanks in part to tax reform.  Last  time he was on in June, he picked the S&amp;P Small Cap 600 Index ETF, which is  up 9 percent, iShares Core MSCI (NYSE:MSCI) Emerging Markets ETF up 14  percent.  And DuPont, which merged with Dow Chemicals, to be DowDuPont, it  is up 11 percent.  </p><p> He is Hank Smith, chief investment officer and director with Haverford  Trust.  </p><p> Hank, welcome and happy New Year to you.  </p><p> Be honest now, did you really, really, really think 2017 would be this good  for equities?  </p><p> HANK SMITH, THE HAVERFORD TRUST COMPANY CIO &amp; DIRECTOR:  Oh, I don't think  anyone did.  And it belied the headlines.  The headlines were where all the  volatility was.  There was no volatility in the actual market, as you  pointed out earlier.  You could never have predicted a year like this.  And  if you did, you would have been laughed out of the room.  </p><p> MATTHEWS:  Yes, let's look at your picks for next year, then we'll get some  thoughts more broadly if we have time for next year.  Let's start -- a lot  of them are sort of expose to the consumer and one is a financial.  Let's  begin with of my wife's favorite companies of all because she loves home  goods, T.J.Maxx.  </p><p> SMITH:  Absolutely.  Best in breed management.  Everyone talks about Amazon  (NASDAQ:AMZN) being a disrupter in the retail industry, bricks and mortar.   The fact is T.J.Maxx has been a disrupter for more years than Amazon  (NASDAQ:AMZN), and some of the problems that the other stores because of  T.J.Maxx.  </p><p> Look, consumers love a bargain and they love the treasure hunt.  And it  doesn't what part of the economic cycle we're in.  T.J.Maxx is good for all  seasons.  </p><p> MATTHEWS:  And many people are pointing out, as you do, that tax reform  could help these retailers because they typically have high marginal tax  rates.  </p><p>U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) is your financial pick, why?  </p><p> SMITH:  Again, best in breed management, terrific metrics.  And they have  four tailwinds going into 2018.  One, the tax reform, which will add to  their earnings.  Two, a pickup in GDP growth is good for them.  Three,  deregulation at the margin will be good for them.  </p><p> And finally, again, slightly higher interest rates.  We're not forecasting  dramatically higher interest rates, but slightly higher interest rates will  be good for their net interest margins.  </p><p> Four, wonderful tailwinds, with great management, reasonable valuation.   That should be a good stock for 2018.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  And your final choice, I should point out, is the parent company  of CNBC, which produces NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, it is Comcast  (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS).  Why do you like it?  </p><p> SMITH:  Right.  Well, look, but -- all three, TJX, U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB)  and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) have been relative laggards this  year.  So, I'm not recommending stocks that have already had great moves.   Great management, yes, there is the issue of cable cutting.  </p><p> But they're getting -- that's been more than made up for in their Internet  services where they're getting a lot of traction there.  </p><p> This is a giant.  It's a beast, double digit earnings growth, reasonable  valuation.  It is a good entry point in our opinion.  And we think -- </p><p> MATHISEN:  And one would think with the ability to expense capital  equipment fully next year, that will be a beneficiary of a company like  that.  </p><p> SMITH:  Absolutely.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Hank Smith, we have to leave it there.  Happy New Year.  Thank  you for being with us.  </p><p> SMITH:  Happy New Year.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  You bet.</p><p> As peak shipping season wraps up, President Trump taking shots at the  Postal Service, tweeting today: Why is the United States Post Office, which  is losing many billions of dollars a year while charging Amazon  (NASDAQ:AMZN) and others to little to deliver their packages, making Amazon  (NASDAQ:AMZN) richer, the Post Office dumber and poorer?  Should be  charging much more.</p><p> Now, the president has never been a big fan of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) CEO  Jeff Bezos.  But does he have a point?  </p><p> Morgan Brennan delves into the finances of delivering packages.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The U.S. Postal  Service does make money on package deliveries, but margins are razor-thin  compared to its most profitable business, first class mail.  </p><p> DONALD BROUGHTON, BROUGHTON CAPITAL MANAGING PARTNER:  The bottom line is  the Post Office is subsidized its parcel delivery through its first class  mail for years, for decades really.  That's why it's running at a 20 to 30  percent discount to the rates you're going to see via UPS and FedEx  (NYSE:FDX), and the beneficiary of that, of course, is Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)  or anybody else who uses them for that last mile.</p><p> BRENNAN:  The Postal Service probably should be charging more.  Starting  next year, rates in fact will be going up.  Regulators dictate those  prices.  Critics argue they're still artificially low, something FedEx  (NYSE:FDX) and UPS, for example, have voiced concern about on the Hill.  </p><p> For its part, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) relies heavily on the Postal Service for  the last mile to home.  Two-thirds of its packages are sorted by the  company in its warehouses and handed off to the quasi governmental agency  for final delivery.  It makes sense since the USPS already goes to every  address.  It's less expensive option for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), as well as,  at times, FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and UPS, which also use the agency for some  delivery.  </p><p> TOM FORTE, D.A. DAVIDSON &amp; CO.:  There's clearly a need for a participant  beyond FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and ups which arguably operate a duopoly.  I think  what we're talking about here is getting Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to pay a fair  rate for the service from the Postal Service and then generally speaking,  getting the volume of sales in the Postal Service to be enough for them to  offset their cost.  </p><p> BRENNAN:  Yes, critics say those e-commerce deliveries by the USPS, which  isn't funded by taxpayer money, are being subsidized by the universal  service obligation, which makes the USPS maintain requirements under  congressional edict to ensure all users receive a certain level of service  at a reasonable price.</p><p> But unless Congress passes new legislation, little will likely change,  especially since package delivery is how the Postal Service is reinventing  itself as mail volumes plunge and with them profitability.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Morgan Brennan.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MATHISEN:  Up next, more confusion around that new tax code.  This time, it  could involve your paycheck.  We'll explain.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> MATHISEN:  Well, as many homeowners grapple with whether to prepay their  property taxes before the new tax law kicks in next week, there is also not  a little bit of corporate confusion.  How much to who would from employee  paychecks?  </p><p> Ylan Mui reports.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> YLAN MUI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Republicans want to say  they're ringing in the New Year with a new tax code.  </p><p> REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  Your tax relief is on its  way.  </p><p> MUI:  But it will be at least a couple of w before you see any changes in  your paychecks.  </p><p> Businesses are waiting on the IRS to give them some guidance on how much  money they should be withholding from your wages under the new tax code.   The American Payroll Association called this transition a, quote, herculean  task and said its 17,000 employers that it represents are starting to  panic.  The IRS tried to calm everyone down this week, saying it does plans  to provide companies details on how much to withhold sometime in January.  </p><p> But the big question is whether workers will have to update their W-4's or  even fill out new ones.  W-4 is a form that you submit to your employer  lifting the exemptions I plan to take.  But those exemptions are all going  away under the new tax code.  So does that form even apply anymore?  </p><p> The IRS says workers don't need to make any changes right now.  But it is  possible that millions of employees will need to fill out new W-4's before  the end of 2018.  </p><p> H&amp;R Block (NYSE:HRB) tells us it's getting flooded with questions given the  confusion over all of these changes.  </p><p> KATHY PICKERING, H&amp;R BLOCK TAX INSTITUTE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR:  This is  absolutely crunch time for us.  It's normally crunch time anyway, getting  ready for the filing season.  With a tax change this big, it's really  adding on a whole other level of questions, interest, curiosity.  People  really care about getting it right.  </p><p> MUI:  The danger is that workers could wind up underpaying during the year  and face a huge tax bill come 2019.  In the past, the IRS has waived  penalties associated with underpayment to give households and businesses a  little bit of breathing room during the transition.  No word yet on if the  IRS will do that once more.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Ylan Mui in Washington. </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MATHISEN:  The financial services firm Comerica (NYSE:CMA) is the latest  company to cite the new tax reform law as a way to reward its employees.   Comerica (NYSE:CMA) will raise its minimum wage to $15 an hour, and give  thousand dollar bonuses to about 4,500 workers.  And they won't be alone,  because the minimum wage is rising in several states beginning Monday.  </p><p> Kate Rogers (NYSE:ROG) tells us where.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> KATE ROGERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Workers across the  country will be ringing in the New Year with higher pay thanks to laws or  ballot initiative.  Now, these 18 states are raising their minimum wages  either on December 31st or January 1st.  The highest dollar amount that  will be in Washington state at $11.50 an hour while in Maine workers are at  the highest percentage increase to $10 an hour, that's according to  Employment Policies Institute.  </p><p> There are also 20 localities that are hiking pay.  In Mountain View and  Sunnyvale, California, workers will be paid $15 an hour.  That is over a 15  percent increase from today's rate, while in Seattle, pay will hit $15.40  cents an hour for minimum wage workers.  The federal minimum wage, that is  still stagnant at $7.25 an hour.  That hasn't moved since 2009.  And with  President Trump in office and Republican-controlled Congress, there is  little chance of changing that anytime soon, which is why we're seeing more  states and localities taking matters into their own hands.  </p><p> Currently, these 29 states and Washington, D.C.  They all have wages above  the federal level.  We've seen corporate America take matters into its own  hands to raise wages for workers.  As well, a flurry of companies at the  end of this year announcing increases to their minimum wage in the wake of  the tax bill, including Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), BB&amp;T (NASDAQ:MSDXP)  (NYSE:BBT), Comerica (NYSE:CMA) and many more.  </p><p> Back over to you.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MATHISEN:  Kate Rogers (NYSE:ROG) reporting there.  </p><p> And Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) expects to take a $5 billion profit hit and  that is where we begin this final \"Market Focus\" of the year.  </p><p> The bank said the new tax plan will reduce earnings by $5 billion,  resulting in the company's first quarterly loss in six years.  Now, that is  expected to be a short term largely technical blip for the bank, however,  as it is expected to largely benefit from the lower corporate tax rate over  the next few years.  Shares were off a fraction today at $254.76.  </p><p> Several private equity firms are reportedly interested in buying digital  entertainment company TiVo (NASDAQ:TIVO).  According to the online news  site The Street, a potential deal would value TiVo (NASDAQ:TIVO) at $2.5  billion.  TiVo (NASDAQ:TIVO) shares popped 11 percent to $15.60.  </p><p> IBM says it has reached agreement to resolve a patent lawsuit with  Priceline Group that goes back to 2015.  IBM sued the travel booking  company, alleging that it infringed four key IBM patents and was unwilling  to engage in meaningful discussions about it.  The new agreement lets each  company cross license each other's patent portfolio.  IBM's shares fell a  fraction to $153.42.  Priceline down more than 1 percent at $1,737 and  change.</p><p> Well, the last part of this year is all about predictions for the next.   And being a market prognosticator is a tough business.  For more than five  decades, though, maybe even six on Wall Street, the well-known trader and  director of floor operations for UBS, Art Cashin, has a pretty good track  record over the years.  </p><p> And Bob Pisani is back with a look at how some of Cashin's predictions have  panned out since 2014.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> PISANI:  It's a tough business being a market prognosticator.  But Art  Cashin has had a respectable track record over the years, with usually more  hits than misses.  As we enter 2014, the five-year-old stock mark rally was  continuing, but Cashin was already thinking that profit earnings and  margins were starting to top out.  </p><p> ART CASHIN, DIRECTOR OF FLOOR OPERATIONS, UBS:  They have cut and diced  their way down to record profit margins, followed by record profit margins,  followed by record profit margins.  Now, that can't continue.  My 50-year  history tells me that profit margins revert to the mean.  </p><p> PISANI:  He was a little early.  But the profits recession did indeed come,  but not until later that year and into 2015.  Going into 2015, Cashin's  biggest worry was China.  </p><p> CASHIN:  The People's Bank of China is very concerned.  And they are  looking at doing something to stimulate almost a way to -- I don't want to  use the word force lending, but really promote lending as well as they can.   And they have problems in shadow banking and they have problems with real  estate.  And they'll have to work their way through that.  </p><p> PISANI:  Right again.  China was the biggest story in 2015.  It rocked the  investing world in the late summer with a surprise devaluation of the yuan,  that caused a nearly 10 percent drop in the S&amp;P 500.  </p><p> Going into 2016, the big story was oil.  Many were predicting an imminent  bottom after it dropped more than 60 percent.  But Cashin was still not  convinced.  </p><p> CASHIN:  My gut tells me it will stay low through the first quarter of next  year, maybe a little further.  </p><p> PISANI:  He was right.  Oil continued to drop and bottomed right in the  middle of the first quarter of 2016, then began a slow crawl back.  But you  don't hit it right all the time.  At the end of last year, Cashin was  concerned about the wave of populism that might sweep through Europe after  Donald Trump's election.  </p><p> CASHIN:  It wouldn't take much to get the Italian government fully  destabilized.  We could be back with the Club Med problems with the banks.   Greece is not far from returning to crisis again.  So, the only thing you  can say, I've seen this movie before, and dies, but it's a slightly movie  this time.  </p><p> PISANI:  It didn't quite turn out that way.  While populist parties did  gain in European parliaments, populists were turned back in the top  leadership positions throughout Europe.  </p><p> Still as far as predictions, three out of four isn't bad.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MATHISEN:  And coming up, how an immigrant turned entrepreneur turned his  small business into a half billion dollar international food sensation.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> MATHISEN:  Finally tonight, some of you may have sent an edible arrangement  over the holidays as a gift or maybe even received one.  I sat down  recently with the founder of the company to hear how his strong work ethic  at an early age led him to create a half billion dollar business selling  fruit, but not just any fruit.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> TARIQ FARID, CEO, EDIBLE ARRANGEMENTS:  You're putting a little bit of a  finish on it.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Oh, look at that.  </p><p> Entrepreneur Tariq Farid certainly has reason to celebrate.  </p><p> Cheers.</p><p> T. FARID:  Cheers.</p><p> MATHISEN:  His company, Edible Arrangements, has mushroomed into an  international sensation.  </p><p> How much total revenue?  </p><p> T. FARID:  A little over $600 million.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  It's a success that stems from humble beginnings.  At 12 years  old, Tariq and his family came to the United States from Pakistan, settling  in 1981 in West Haven, Connecticut.  Since money was tight, he and his  siblings had to get busy, fast.  </p><p> T. FARID:  My mother would sit there and, you know, kick us out of bed  every day and say, go work hard.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Tell me about your earliest days as an entrepreneur.  </p><p> T. FARID:  A lady living down the street from me, I would cut her grass and  help her with the lawn.  She goes, honey, if you keep working this hard,  you'll be a millionaire by the time you're 35.  And I liked the ring of  that.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Within a year, Tariq took a job with a local florist, where he  learned the importance of customer service and creative design.  And when  the opportunity arose to buy a defunct floral shop in nearby East Haven,  Connecticut, Tariq moved fast.  With $6,000 borrowed from his father's  boss, Tariq became the owner of Farid's flowers.  </p><p> Who gave you the lease on the shop?  Who's going to sign a lease with a 17- year-old?  </p><p> T. FARID:  I don't think he knew the 17-year-old was going to be actually  running it.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  But he did run it, dividing his time between the shop and  school.  The business grew into three local locations.  More than a decade  later, in 1999, the seed that really took root was his idea, one he had  been toying with for a couple of years: sell fruit arrangements that looked  like flowers.  </p><p> T. FARID:  I used to call it a wow, when a person receives it, when it  arrives at the house, the first thing out of their mouth should be, wow!   That reaction has to be there.  </p><p> SOMIA FARID, EDIBLE ARRANGEMENTS SPECIAL PROJECTS MANAGER:  My favorite  thing about Edible is we're an experienced company.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Somia Farid, Tariq's daughter, is the special projects manager  at Edible Arrangements headquarters in Wallingford, Connecticut.  </p><p> S. FARID:  I've been in the story ever since I was a kid.  I used toed to  hang out at the store after school.  I started taking orders when I was 12  years old.</p><p> MATHISEN:  Still, it wasn't easy for Tariq to transition from flowers to  fruit.  </p><p> T. FARID:  I would go to a supplier and say, hey, can you make me a food- safe floral container, and they were like, get out of here. You know, what  are you taking about?  Why would we do that?  We put flowers in it.</p><p> MATHISEN:  He had to create the company's entire supply chain from scratch.   Everything from child safe skewers to securing what he says is the world's  freshest fruit.  </p><p> By 2000, the business was building real traction, and Tariq began getting  requests to franchise the business.  </p><p> T. FARID:  Somebody saw one and called from Atlanta and said, hey, I just  saw this, and opened one in Atlanta.  Somebody in Atlanta called someone in  New Jersey, and then somebody from New Jersey called and said, hey, I just  saw this, can I buy one for New Jersey.  Next thing I know, I was in North  Ridge, California, opening the eighth store.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  How many stores today?  </p><p> T. FARID:  Thirteen hundred.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Today, Edible Arrangements is available in nine countries, about  60 percent of orders come in online.  But they're fulfilled by local shops.  </p><p> For the Farids, it's been a fruitful journey, and one that continues to  blossom.  </p><p> T. FARID:  There's a lot that goes into it that we've spent the last 18  years perfecting.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Tariq Farid, from immigrant to American dream, getting rich the  old fashioned way, slowly.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MATHISEN:  And man, that fruit dipped in chocolate was good.  </p><p>Edible Arrangements fruit bouquets range in price from about $40 to upwards  of $1,000 for some more extravagant custom displays.  The company focusing  its efforts now on expanding its product line up, to include fruit parfaits  and smoothies and a push to drive brick and mortar sales.  </p><p> Well, that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.

Investors will be sorry to see 2017 end, as stocks post their best gains  since 2013.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Portfolio picks.  Our market monitor has three stocks for the New Year he  says will have strong earnings growth and come with a good price tag.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And food for thought.  How one entrepreneur made millions from his love of  flowers, fruit, and chocolate.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, December  29th.</p><p>Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  Sue Herera has the rest of the year  off.  </p><p>On Wall Street, it is game, set, and match.  And what a match it was.  The  books are closed for 2017.  And for stock investors all around the globe,  virtually no matter the market you were in, you made money this past year - - sometimes lots of it.  </p><p>Here in the U.S., the major indexes set records seemingly every week.  The  Dow and Nasdaq had 71 and 72 record all-time high closes respectively.  No  other year comes close.  The S&amp;P 500 had 62.  And those records led to  numbers like these for 2017.  </p><p>The Dow up 25 percent.  The Nasdaq, 28.  And the S&amp;P 500, 19 percent.  </p><p>But we dug a little deeper and we found some surprises in those numbers.   If you're worried these outsized results might indicate an overheated  market, you're entitled to feel that way.  But consider this, going back to  the Reagan administration that began in 1981, none, none of these gaudy  percentage gains even rank in the top five year by year.  </p><p>This year's Dow comes the closest.  Sixth best year since '81.  In fact,  this wasn't even the Dow's best decade, 2013 was, up 26.5 percent.  It was  also, believe it or not, an eerily calm.  To put it to perspective, 2015  and '16 combined saw the S&amp;P 500 move 1 percent in either direction almost  120 times.  Guess how many this year?  Eight.  </p><p>But the many happy returns weren't confined to just stocks.  Oil closed  above $60 a barrel for the first time in 2 1/2 years and rose more than 12  percent for the year.  And the metals gold and copper also had their best  years since 2010.  </p><p>Now, as for today, stocks kind of ran out of gas at the end.  It shouldn't  come as a surprise.  It is, after all, the fourth straight year the  averages ended the final trading day lower.  The Dow dropped 118 points,  finishing shy of 25,000.  Nasdaq fell 46.  The S&amp;P 500 was off just about  14.  </p><p>Bob Pisani has more on the big year that was.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  As traders look back on  a very unusual year, the big issue is, will all the good news continue into  2018.  There was a lot of it in 2017.  The S&amp;P rose 20 percent, its best  return since 2013.  The U.S. economy grew modestly.  </p><p>But stocks were also helped by a global economic expansion, record earnings  for companies, low volatility, low interest rates, and the expectation of  tax cuts as income at the end of the year.  The big winners were  semiconductors.  They rode the wave of buying in smartphones, smart  appliances, and electric vehicles, as well as homebuilders that rode the  wave of low interest rates, limited supply, and more young people going out  on their own.  </p><p>Commodity stocks like copper manufacturers were also strong because the  global economy improved.  One notable laggard was oil stocks.  Even though  oil moved towards $60 at the end of year to two-year highs, investors who  had been burned by the big drop in oil in 2015 and 2016, they mostly stayed  away.  </p><p>This was also a big year for the global stock market as economies around  the world improved in both developed and emerging markets.  So, Vietnam,  India, Brazil, Hong Kong, saw double digit gains with mid-single digit  gains in much of Europe.  </p><p>The issue for 2018 is, will global growth continue?  And what about  earnings?  They will get a boost next year thanks to tax cuts, but what  happens after that?  </p><p>The final issue is inflation.  It's been relatively contained because wage  growth has been modest.  But with the economy heating up, that may change.   Now, if inflation picks up, the Federal Reserve may raise rates more  aggressively and that could stall out the rally.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, this past year, the Nasdaq composite outperformed its more  senior index brethren with a nearly 30 percent gain, topping 7,000 for the  first time this year.  </p><p>And as Bertha Coombs tells, big name tech led the way.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  As Mark Twain put  it, history doesn't repeat but it often rhymes.  That's certainly true with  the Nasdaq 100.  It's the only major index up 9 straight years, since the  Great Recession, making for the longest annual win streak since the big  tech breakouts of the 1990s.  </p><p>And just as then, it's the big mega cap tech stocks that are responsible  for the gains.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) have provided the biggest lift to  the overall market and the S&amp;P 500.  And when you add in Alphabet, they  accounted for two-thirds of the Nasdaq 100's 1,500-point gain in 2017.  </p><p>Here is the rhyme part.  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which was a tech  heavyweight back in the '90s, benefiting from its shift to cloud technology  here over the last few years, up for six straight years, seeing its best  annual win streak since the launch of Windows back in 1995.  Consumer names  were the biggest laggards of 2017.  Many like Dish took a hit in the third  quarter due to hurricanes.  Now, auto parts retailer O'Reilly Automotive  (NASDAQ:ORLY), which had ridden the Nasdaq rally to historic highs, down  for the first time in eight years.  </p><p>And Ulta Beauty, which had seen consistently all-time highs for the last  three years, snapping a three-year bull run.  But like a lot of retailers,  both O'Reilly and Ulta pay a tax rate that is above 37 percent.  That's  what they're expecting for the fourth quarter.  In 2018, under the new tax  code, those retailers could see a 16-point drop in their tax rate, which  could result in a big boost to earnings per share, and perhaps could get  their stock back in line with the big tech leaders. </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bertha Coombs at the Nasdaq.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Time now for our final market monitor for this week, in fact for  this year.  He's got three domestic picks he says will see a double digit  rise in earnings per share next year, thanks in part to tax reform.  Last  time he was on in June, he picked the S&amp;P Small Cap 600 Index ETF, which is  up 9 percent, iShares Core MSCI (NYSE:MSCI) Emerging Markets ETF up 14  percent.  And DuPont, which merged with Dow Chemicals, to be DowDuPont, it  is up 11 percent.  </p><p>He is Hank Smith, chief investment officer and director with Haverford  Trust.  </p><p>Hank, welcome and happy New Year to you.  </p><p>Be honest now, did you really, really, really think 2017 would be this good  for equities?  </p><p>HANK SMITH, THE HAVERFORD TRUST COMPANY CIO &amp; DIRECTOR:  Oh, I don't think  anyone did.  And it belied the headlines.  The headlines were where all the  volatility was.  There was no volatility in the actual market, as you  pointed out earlier.  You could never have predicted a year like this.  And  if you did, you would have been laughed out of the room.  </p><p>MATTHEWS:  Yes, let's look at your picks for next year, then we'll get some  thoughts more broadly if we have time for next year.  Let's start -- a lot  of them are sort of expose to the consumer and one is a financial.  Let's  begin with of my wife's favorite companies of all because she loves home  goods, T.J.Maxx.  </p><p>SMITH:  Absolutely.  Best in breed management.  Everyone talks about Amazon  (NASDAQ:AMZN) being a disrupter in the retail industry, bricks and mortar.   The fact is T.J.Maxx has been a disrupter for more years than Amazon  (NASDAQ:AMZN), and some of the problems that the other stores because of  T.J.Maxx.  </p><p>Look, consumers love a bargain and they love the treasure hunt.  And it  doesn't what part of the economic cycle we're in.  T.J.Maxx is good for all  seasons.  </p><p>MATTHEWS:  And many people are pointing out, as you do, that tax reform  could help these retailers because they typically have high marginal tax  rates.  </p><p>U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) is your financial pick, why?  </p><p>SMITH:  Again, best in breed management, terrific metrics.  And they have  four tailwinds going into 2018.  One, the tax reform, which will add to  their earnings.  Two, a pickup in GDP growth is good for them.  Three,  deregulation at the margin will be good for them.  </p><p>And finally, again, slightly higher interest rates.  We're not forecasting  dramatically higher interest rates, but slightly higher interest rates will  be good for their net interest margins.  </p><p>Four, wonderful tailwinds, with great management, reasonable valuation.   That should be a good stock for 2018.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  And your final choice, I should point out, is the parent company  of CNBC, which produces NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, it is Comcast  (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS).  Why do you like it?  </p><p>SMITH:  Right.  Well, look, but -- all three, TJX, U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB)  and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) have been relative laggards this  year.  So, I'm not recommending stocks that have already had great moves.   Great management, yes, there is the issue of cable cutting.  </p><p>But they're getting -- that's been more than made up for in their Internet  services where they're getting a lot of traction there.  </p><p>This is a giant.  It's a beast, double digit earnings growth, reasonable  valuation.  It is a good entry point in our opinion.  And we think -- </p><p>MATHISEN:  And one would think with the ability to expense capital  equipment fully next year, that will be a beneficiary of a company like  that.  </p><p>SMITH:  Absolutely.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Hank Smith, we have to leave it there.  Happy New Year.  Thank  you for being with us.  </p><p>SMITH:  Happy New Year.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  You bet.</p><p>As peak shipping season wraps up, President Trump taking shots at the  Postal Service, tweeting today: Why is the United States Post Office, which  is losing many billions of dollars a year while charging Amazon  (NASDAQ:AMZN) and others to little to deliver their packages, making Amazon  (NASDAQ:AMZN) richer, the Post Office dumber and poorer?  Should be  charging much more.</p><p>Now, the president has never been a big fan of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) CEO  Jeff Bezos.  But does he have a point?  </p><p>Morgan Brennan delves into the finances of delivering packages.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The U.S. Postal  Service does make money on package deliveries, but margins are razor-thin  compared to its most profitable business, first class mail.  </p><p>DONALD BROUGHTON, BROUGHTON CAPITAL MANAGING PARTNER:  The bottom line is  the Post Office is subsidized its parcel delivery through its first class  mail for years, for decades really.  That's why it's running at a 20 to 30  percent discount to the rates you're going to see via UPS and FedEx  (NYSE:FDX), and the beneficiary of that, of course, is Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)  or anybody else who uses them for that last mile.</p><p>BRENNAN:  The Postal Service probably should be charging more.  Starting  next year, rates in fact will be going up.  Regulators dictate those  prices.  Critics argue they're still artificially low, something FedEx  (NYSE:FDX) and UPS, for example, have voiced concern about on the Hill.  </p><p>For its part, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) relies heavily on the Postal Service for  the last mile to home.  Two-thirds of its packages are sorted by the  company in its warehouses and handed off to the quasi governmental agency  for final delivery.  It makes sense since the USPS already goes to every  address.  It's less expensive option for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), as well as,  at times, FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and UPS, which also use the agency for some  delivery.  </p><p>TOM FORTE, D.A. DAVIDSON &amp; CO.:  There's clearly a need for a participant  beyond FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and ups which arguably operate a duopoly.  I think  what we're talking about here is getting Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to pay a fair  rate for the service from the Postal Service and then generally speaking,  getting the volume of sales in the Postal Service to be enough for them to  offset their cost.  </p><p>BRENNAN:  Yes, critics say those e-commerce deliveries by the USPS, which  isn't funded by taxpayer money, are being subsidized by the universal  service obligation, which makes the USPS maintain requirements under  congressional edict to ensure all users receive a certain level of service  at a reasonable price.</p><p>But unless Congress passes new legislation, little will likely change,  especially since package delivery is how the Postal Service is reinventing  itself as mail volumes plunge and with them profitability.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Morgan Brennan.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Up next, more confusion around that new tax code.  This time, it  could involve your paycheck.  We'll explain.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, as many homeowners grapple with whether to prepay their  property taxes before the new tax law kicks in next week, there is also not  a little bit of corporate confusion.  How much to who would from employee  paychecks?  </p><p>Ylan Mui reports.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YLAN MUI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Republicans want to say  they're ringing in the New Year with a new tax code.  </p><p>REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  Your tax relief is on its  way.  </p><p>MUI:  But it will be at least a couple of w before you see any changes in  your paychecks.  </p><p>Businesses are waiting on the IRS to give them some guidance on how much  money they should be withholding from your wages under the new tax code.   The American Payroll Association called this transition a, quote, herculean  task and said its 17,000 employers that it represents are starting to  panic.  The IRS tried to calm everyone down this week, saying it does plans  to provide companies details on how much to withhold sometime in January.  </p><p>But the big question is whether workers will have to update their W-4's or  even fill out new ones.  W-4 is a form that you submit to your employer  lifting the exemptions I plan to take.  But those exemptions are all going  away under the new tax code.  So does that form even apply anymore?  </p><p>The IRS says workers don't need to make any changes right now.  But it is  possible that millions of employees will need to fill out new W-4's before  the end of 2018.  </p><p>H&amp;R Block (NYSE:HRB) tells us it's getting flooded with questions given the  confusion over all of these changes.  </p><p>KATHY PICKERING, H&amp;R BLOCK TAX INSTITUTE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR:  This is  absolutely crunch time for us.  It's normally crunch time anyway, getting  ready for the filing season.  With a tax change this big, it's really  adding on a whole other level of questions, interest, curiosity.  People  really care about getting it right.  </p><p>MUI:  The danger is that workers could wind up underpaying during the year  and face a huge tax bill come 2019.  In the past, the IRS has waived  penalties associated with underpayment to give households and businesses a  little bit of breathing room during the transition.  No word yet on if the  IRS will do that once more.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Ylan Mui in Washington. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  The financial services firm Comerica (NYSE:CMA) is the latest  company to cite the new tax reform law as a way to reward its employees.   Comerica (NYSE:CMA) will raise its minimum wage to $15 an hour, and give  thousand dollar bonuses to about 4,500 workers.  And they won't be alone,  because the minimum wage is rising in several states beginning Monday.  </p><p>Kate Rogers (NYSE:ROG) tells us where.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KATE ROGERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Workers across the  country will be ringing in the New Year with higher pay thanks to laws or  ballot initiative.  Now, these 18 states are raising their minimum wages  either on December 31st or January 1st.  The highest dollar amount that  will be in Washington state at $11.50 an hour while in Maine workers are at  the highest percentage increase to $10 an hour, that's according to  Employment Policies Institute.  </p><p>There are also 20 localities that are hiking pay.  In Mountain View and  Sunnyvale, California, workers will be paid $15 an hour.  That is over a 15  percent increase from today's rate, while in Seattle, pay will hit $15.40  cents an hour for minimum wage workers.  The federal minimum wage, that is  still stagnant at $7.25 an hour.  That hasn't moved since 2009.  And with  President Trump in office and Republican-controlled Congress, there is  little chance of changing that anytime soon, which is why we're seeing more  states and localities taking matters into their own hands.  </p><p>Currently, these 29 states and Washington, D.C.  They all have wages above  the federal level.  We've seen corporate America take matters into its own  hands to raise wages for workers.  As well, a flurry of companies at the  end of this year announcing increases to their minimum wage in the wake of  the tax bill, including Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), BB&amp;T (NASDAQ:MSDXP)  (NYSE:BBT), Comerica (NYSE:CMA) and many more.  </p><p>Back over to you.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Kate Rogers (NYSE:ROG) reporting there.  </p><p>And Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) expects to take a $5 billion profit hit and  that is where we begin this final \"Market Focus\" of the year.  </p><p>The bank said the new tax plan will reduce earnings by $5 billion,  resulting in the company's first quarterly loss in six years.  Now, that is  expected to be a short term largely technical blip for the bank, however,  as it is expected to largely benefit from the lower corporate tax rate over  the next few years.  Shares were off a fraction today at $254.76.  </p><p>Several private equity firms are reportedly interested in buying digital  entertainment company TiVo (NASDAQ:TIVO).  According to the online news  site The Street, a potential deal would value TiVo (NASDAQ:TIVO) at $2.5  billion.  TiVo (NASDAQ:TIVO) shares popped 11 percent to $15.60.  </p><p>IBM says it has reached agreement to resolve a patent lawsuit with  Priceline Group that goes back to 2015.  IBM sued the travel booking  company, alleging that it infringed four key IBM patents and was unwilling  to engage in meaningful discussions about it.  The new agreement lets each  company cross license each other's patent portfolio.  IBM's shares fell a  fraction to $153.42.  Priceline down more than 1 percent at $1,737 and  change.</p><p>Well, the last part of this year is all about predictions for the next.   And being a market prognosticator is a tough business.  For more than five  decades, though, maybe even six on Wall Street, the well-known trader and  director of floor operations for UBS, Art Cashin, has a pretty good track  record over the years.  </p><p>And Bob Pisani is back with a look at how some of Cashin's predictions have  panned out since 2014.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PISANI:  It's a tough business being a market prognosticator.  But Art  Cashin has had a respectable track record over the years, with usually more  hits than misses.  As we enter 2014, the five-year-old stock mark rally was  continuing, but Cashin was already thinking that profit earnings and  margins were starting to top out.  </p><p>ART CASHIN, DIRECTOR OF FLOOR OPERATIONS, UBS:  They have cut and diced  their way down to record profit margins, followed by record profit margins,  followed by record profit margins.  Now, that can't continue.  My 50-year  history tells me that profit margins revert to the mean.  </p><p>PISANI:  He was a little early.  But the profits recession did indeed come,  but not until later that year and into 2015.  Going into 2015, Cashin's  biggest worry was China.  </p><p>CASHIN:  The People's Bank of China is very concerned.  And they are  looking at doing something to stimulate almost a way to -- I don't want to  use the word force lending, but really promote lending as well as they can.   And they have problems in shadow banking and they have problems with real  estate.  And they'll have to work their way through that.  </p><p>PISANI:  Right again.  China was the biggest story in 2015.  It rocked the  investing world in the late summer with a surprise devaluation of the yuan,  that caused a nearly 10 percent drop in the S&amp;P 500.  </p><p>Going into 2016, the big story was oil.  Many were predicting an imminent  bottom after it dropped more than 60 percent.  But Cashin was still not  convinced.  </p><p>CASHIN:  My gut tells me it will stay low through the first quarter of next  year, maybe a little further.  </p><p>PISANI:  He was right.  Oil continued to drop and bottomed right in the  middle of the first quarter of 2016, then began a slow crawl back.  But you  don't hit it right all the time.  At the end of last year, Cashin was  concerned about the wave of populism that might sweep through Europe after  Donald Trump's election.  </p><p>CASHIN:  It wouldn't take much to get the Italian government fully  destabilized.  We could be back with the Club Med problems with the banks.   Greece is not far from returning to crisis again.  So, the only thing you  can say, I've seen this movie before, and dies, but it's a slightly movie  this time.  </p><p>PISANI:  It didn't quite turn out that way.  While populist parties did  gain in European parliaments, populists were turned back in the top  leadership positions throughout Europe.  </p><p>Still as far as predictions, three out of four isn't bad.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  And coming up, how an immigrant turned entrepreneur turned his  small business into a half billion dollar international food sensation.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Finally tonight, some of you may have sent an edible arrangement  over the holidays as a gift or maybe even received one.  I sat down  recently with the founder of the company to hear how his strong work ethic  at an early age led him to create a half billion dollar business selling  fruit, but not just any fruit.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TARIQ FARID, CEO, EDIBLE ARRANGEMENTS:  You're putting a little bit of a  finish on it.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Oh, look at that.  </p><p>Entrepreneur Tariq Farid certainly has reason to celebrate.  </p><p>Cheers.</p><p>T. FARID:  Cheers.</p><p>MATHISEN:  His company, Edible Arrangements, has mushroomed into an  international sensation.  </p><p>How much total revenue?  </p><p>T. FARID:  A little over $600 million.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  It's a success that stems from humble beginnings.  At 12 years  old, Tariq and his family came to the United States from Pakistan, settling  in 1981 in West Haven, Connecticut.  Since money was tight, he and his  siblings had to get busy, fast.  </p><p>T. FARID:  My mother would sit there and, you know, kick us out of bed  every day and say, go work hard.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Tell me about your earliest days as an entrepreneur.  </p><p>T. FARID:  A lady living down the street from me, I would cut her grass and  help her with the lawn.  She goes, honey, if you keep working this hard,  you'll be a millionaire by the time you're 35.  And I liked the ring of  that.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Within a year, Tariq took a job with a local florist, where he  learned the importance of customer service and creative design.  And when  the opportunity arose to buy a defunct floral shop in nearby East Haven,  Connecticut, Tariq moved fast.  With $6,000 borrowed from his father's  boss, Tariq became the owner of Farid's flowers.  </p><p>Who gave you the lease on the shop?  Who's going to sign a lease with a 17- year-old?  </p><p>T. FARID:  I don't think he knew the 17-year-old was going to be actually  running it.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  But he did run it, dividing his time between the shop and  school.  The business grew into three local locations.  More than a decade  later, in 1999, the seed that really took root was his idea, one he had  been toying with for a couple of years: sell fruit arrangements that looked  like flowers.  </p><p>T. FARID:  I used to call it a wow, when a person receives it, when it  arrives at the house, the first thing out of their mouth should be, wow!   That reaction has to be there.  </p><p>SOMIA FARID, EDIBLE ARRANGEMENTS SPECIAL PROJECTS MANAGER:  My favorite  thing about Edible is we're an experienced company.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Somia Farid, Tariq's daughter, is the special projects manager  at Edible Arrangements headquarters in Wallingford, Connecticut.  </p><p>S. FARID:  I've been in the story ever since I was a kid.  I used toed to  hang out at the store after school.  I started taking orders when I was 12  years old.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Still, it wasn't easy for Tariq to transition from flowers to  fruit.  </p><p>T. FARID:  I would go to a supplier and say, hey, can you make me a food- safe floral container, and they were like, get out of here. You know, what  are you taking about?  Why would we do that?  We put flowers in it.</p><p>MATHISEN:  He had to create the company's entire supply chain from scratch.   Everything from child safe skewers to securing what he says is the world's  freshest fruit.  </p><p>By 2000, the business was building real traction, and Tariq began getting  requests to franchise the business.  </p><p>T. FARID:  Somebody saw one and called from Atlanta and said, hey, I just  saw this, and opened one in Atlanta.  Somebody in Atlanta called someone in  New Jersey, and then somebody from New Jersey called and said, hey, I just  saw this, can I buy one for New Jersey.  Next thing I know, I was in North  Ridge, California, opening the eighth store.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  How many stores today?  </p><p>T. FARID:  Thirteen hundred.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Today, Edible Arrangements is available in nine countries, about  60 percent of orders come in online.  But they're fulfilled by local shops.  </p><p>For the Farids, it's been a fruitful journey, and one that continues to  blossom.  </p><p>T. FARID:  There's a lot that goes into it that we've spent the last 18  years perfecting.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Tariq Farid, from immigrant to American dream, getting rich the  old fashioned way, slowly.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  And man, that fruit dipped in chocolate was good.  </p><p>Edible Arrangements fruit bouquets range in price from about $40 to upwards  of $1,000 for some more extravagant custom displays.  The company focusing  its efforts now on expanding its product line up, to include fruit parfaits  and smoothies and a push to drive brick and mortar sales.  </p><p>Well, that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.

Investors will be sorry to see 2017 end, as stocks post their best gains since 2013.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Portfolio picks. Our market monitor has three stocks for the New Year he says will have strong earnings growth and come with a good price tag.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And food for thought. How one entrepreneur made millions from his love of flowers, fruit, and chocolate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, December 29th.</p><p>Good evening, everyone, and welcome. Sue Herera has the rest of the year off.</p><p>On Wall Street, it is game, set, and match. And what a match it was. The books are closed for 2017. And for stock investors all around the globe, virtually no matter the market you were in, you made money this past year - - sometimes lots of it.</p><p>Here in the U.S., the major indexes set records seemingly every week. The Dow and Nasdaq had 71 and 72 record all-time high closes respectively. No other year comes close. The S&amp;P 500 had 62. And those records led to numbers like these for 2017.</p><p>The Dow up 25 percent. The Nasdaq, 28. And the S&amp;P 500, 19 percent.</p><p>But we dug a little deeper and we found some surprises in those numbers. If you`re worried these outsized results might indicate an overheated market, you`re entitled to feel that way. But consider this, going back to the Reagan administration that began in 1981, none, none of these gaudy percentage gains even rank in the top five year by year.</p><p>This year`s Dow comes the closest. Sixth best year since `81. In fact, this wasn`t even the Dow`s best decade, 2013 was, up 26.5 percent. It was also, believe it or not, an eerily calm. To put it to perspective, 2015 and `16 combined saw the S&amp;P 500 move 1 percent in either direction almost 120 times. Guess how many this year? Eight.</p><p>But the many happy returns weren`t confined to just stocks. Oil closed above $60 a barrel for the first time in 2 1/2 years and rose more than 12 percent for the year. And the metals gold and copper also had their best years since 2010.</p><p>Now, as for today, stocks kind of ran out of gas at the end. It shouldn`t come as a surprise. It is, after all, the fourth straight year the averages ended the final trading day lower. The Dow dropped 118 points, finishing shy of 25,000. Nasdaq fell 46. The S&amp;P 500 was off just about 14.</p><p>Bob Pisani has more on the big year that was.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: As traders look back on a very unusual year, the big issue is, will all the good news continue into 2018. There was a lot of it in 2017. The S&amp;P rose 20 percent, its best return since 2013. The U.S. economy grew modestly.</p><p>But stocks were also helped by a global economic expansion, record earnings for companies, low volatility, low interest rates, and the expectation of tax cuts as income at the end of the year. The big winners were semiconductors. They rode the wave of buying in smartphones, smart appliances, and electric vehicles, as well as homebuilders that rode the wave of low interest rates, limited supply, and more young people going out on their own.</p><p>Commodity stocks like copper manufacturers were also strong because the global economy improved. One notable laggard was oil stocks. Even though oil moved towards $60 at the end of year to two-year highs, investors who had been burned by the big drop in oil in 2015 and 2016, they mostly stayed away.</p><p>This was also a big year for the global stock market as economies around the world improved in both developed and emerging markets. So, Vietnam, India, Brazil, Hong Kong, saw double digit gains with mid-single digit gains in much of Europe.</p><p>The issue for 2018 is, will global growth continue? And what about earnings? They will get a boost next year thanks to tax cuts, but what happens after that?</p><p>The final issue is inflation. It`s been relatively contained because wage growth has been modest. But with the economy heating up, that may change. Now, if inflation picks up, the Federal Reserve may raise rates more aggressively and that could stall out the rally.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Well, this past year, the Nasdaq composite outperformed its more senior index brethren with a nearly 30 percent gain, topping 7,000 for the first time this year.</p><p>And as Bertha Coombs tells, big name tech led the way.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: As Mark Twain put it, history doesn`t repeat but it often rhymes. That`s certainly true with the Nasdaq 100. It`s the only major index up 9 straight years, since the Great Recession, making for the longest annual win streak since the big tech breakouts of the 1990s.</p><p>And just as then, it`s the big mega cap tech stocks that are responsible for the gains. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) have provided the biggest lift to the overall market and the S&amp;P 500. And when you add in Alphabet, they accounted for two-thirds of the Nasdaq 100`s 1,500-point gain in 2017.</p><p>Here is the rhyme part. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which was a tech heavyweight back in the `90s, benefiting from its shift to cloud technology here over the last few years, up for six straight years, seeing its best annual win streak since the launch of Windows back in 1995. Consumer names were the biggest laggards of 2017. Many like Dish took a hit in the third quarter due to hurricanes. Now, auto parts retailer O`Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ:ORLY), which had ridden the Nasdaq rally to historic highs, down for the first time in eight years.</p><p>And Ulta Beauty, which had seen consistently all-time highs for the last three years, snapping a three-year bull run. But like a lot of retailers, both O`Reilly and Ulta pay a tax rate that is above 37 percent. That`s what they`re expecting for the fourth quarter. In 2018, under the new tax code, those retailers could see a 16-point drop in their tax rate, which could result in a big boost to earnings per share, and perhaps could get their stock back in line with the big tech leaders.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bertha Coombs at the Nasdaq.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Time now for our final market monitor for this week, in fact for this year. He`s got three domestic picks he says will see a double digit rise in earnings per share next year, thanks in part to tax reform. Last time he was on in June, he picked the S&amp;P Small Cap 600 Index ETF, which is up 9 percent, iShares Core MSCI (NYSE:MSCI) Emerging Markets ETF up 14 percent. And DuPont, which merged with Dow Chemicals, to be DowDuPont, it is up 11 percent.</p><p>He is Hank Smith, chief investment officer and director with Haverford Trust.</p><p>Hank, welcome and happy New Year to you.</p><p>Be honest now, did you really, really, really think 2017 would be this good for equities?</p><p>HANK SMITH, THE HAVERFORD TRUST COMPANY CIO &amp; DIRECTOR: Oh, I don`t think anyone did. And it belied the headlines. The headlines were where all the volatility was. There was no volatility in the actual market, as you pointed out earlier. You could never have predicted a year like this. And if you did, you would have been laughed out of the room.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Yes, let`s look at your picks for next year, then we`ll get some thoughts more broadly if we have time for next year. Let`s start -- a lot of them are sort of expose to the consumer and one is a financial. Let`s begin with of my wife`s favorite companies of all because she loves home goods, T.J.Maxx.</p><p>SMITH: Absolutely. Best in breed management. Everyone talks about Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) being a disrupter in the retail industry, bricks and mortar. The fact is T.J.Maxx has been a disrupter for more years than Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and some of the problems that the other stores because of T.J.Maxx.</p><p>Look, consumers love a bargain and they love the treasure hunt. And it doesn`t what part of the economic cycle we`re in. T.J.Maxx is good for all seasons.</p><p>MATTHEWS: And many people are pointing out, as you do, that tax reform could help these retailers because they typically have high marginal tax rates.</p><p>U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) is your financial pick, why?</p><p>SMITH: Again, best in breed management, terrific metrics. And they have four tailwinds going into 2018. One, the tax reform, which will add to their earnings. Two, a pickup in GDP growth is good for them. Three, deregulation at the margin will be good for them.</p><p>And finally, again, slightly higher interest rates. We`re not forecasting dramatically higher interest rates, but slightly higher interest rates will be good for their net interest margins.</p><p>Four, wonderful tailwinds, with great management, reasonable valuation. That should be a good stock for 2018.</p><p>MATHISEN: And your final choice, I should point out, is the parent company of CNBC, which produces NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, it is Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS). Why do you like it?</p><p>SMITH: Right. Well, look, but -- all three, TJX, U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) have been relative laggards this year. So, I`m not recommending stocks that have already had great moves. Great management, yes, there is the issue of cable cutting.</p><p>But they`re getting -- that`s been more than made up for in their Internet services where they`re getting a lot of traction there.</p><p>This is a giant. It`s a beast, double digit earnings growth, reasonable valuation. It is a good entry point in our opinion. And we think --</p><p>MATHISEN: And one would think with the ability to expense capital equipment fully next year, that will be a beneficiary of a company like that.</p><p>SMITH: Absolutely.</p><p>MATHISEN: Hank Smith, we have to leave it there. Happy New Year. Thank you for being with us.</p><p>SMITH: Happy New Year.</p><p>MATHISEN: You bet.</p><p>As peak shipping season wraps up, President Trump taking shots at the Postal Service, tweeting today: Why is the United States Post Office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year while charging Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and others to little to deliver their packages, making Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) richer, the Post Office dumber and poorer? Should be charging much more.</p><p>Now, the president has never been a big fan of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos. But does he have a point?</p><p>Morgan Brennan delves into the finances of delivering packages.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The U.S. Postal Service does make money on package deliveries, but margins are razor-thin compared to its most profitable business, first class mail.</p><p>DONALD BROUGHTON, BROUGHTON CAPITAL MANAGING PARTNER: The bottom line is the Post Office is subsidized its parcel delivery through its first class mail for years, for decades really. That`s why it`s running at a 20 to 30 percent discount to the rates you`re going to see via UPS and FedEx (NYSE:FDX), and the beneficiary of that, of course, is Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or anybody else who uses them for that last mile.</p><p>BRENNAN: The Postal Service probably should be charging more. Starting next year, rates in fact will be going up. Regulators dictate those prices. Critics argue they`re still artificially low, something FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and UPS, for example, have voiced concern about on the Hill.</p><p>For its part, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) relies heavily on the Postal Service for the last mile to home. Two-thirds of its packages are sorted by the company in its warehouses and handed off to the quasi governmental agency for final delivery. It makes sense since the USPS already goes to every address. It`s less expensive option for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), as well as, at times, FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and UPS, which also use the agency for some delivery.</p><p>TOM FORTE, D.A. DAVIDSON &amp; CO.: There`s clearly a need for a participant beyond FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and ups which arguably operate a duopoly. I think what we`re talking about here is getting Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to pay a fair rate for the service from the Postal Service and then generally speaking, getting the volume of sales in the Postal Service to be enough for them to offset their cost.</p><p>BRENNAN: Yes, critics say those e-commerce deliveries by the USPS, which isn`t funded by taxpayer money, are being subsidized by the universal service obligation, which makes the USPS maintain requirements under congressional edict to ensure all users receive a certain level of service at a reasonable price.</p><p>But unless Congress passes new legislation, little will likely change, especially since package delivery is how the Postal Service is reinventing itself as mail volumes plunge and with them profitability.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Morgan Brennan.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Up next, more confusion around that new tax code. This time, it could involve your paycheck. We`ll explain.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN: Well, as many homeowners grapple with whether to prepay their property taxes before the new tax law kicks in next week, there is also not a little bit of corporate confusion. How much to who would from employee paychecks?</p><p>Ylan Mui reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YLAN MUI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Republicans want to say they`re ringing in the New Year with a new tax code.</p><p>REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Your tax relief is on its way.</p><p>MUI: But it will be at least a couple of w before you see any changes in your paychecks.</p><p>Businesses are waiting on the IRS to give them some guidance on how much money they should be withholding from your wages under the new tax code. The American Payroll Association called this transition a, quote, herculean task and said its 17,000 employers that it represents are starting to panic. The IRS tried to calm everyone down this week, saying it does plans to provide companies details on how much to withhold sometime in January.</p><p>But the big question is whether workers will have to update their W-4`s or even fill out new ones. W-4 is a form that you submit to your employer lifting the exemptions I plan to take. But those exemptions are all going away under the new tax code. So does that form even apply anymore?</p><p>The IRS says workers don`t need to make any changes right now. But it is possible that millions of employees will need to fill out new W-4`s before the end of 2018.</p><p>H&amp;R Block (NYSE:HRB) tells us it`s getting flooded with questions given the confusion over all of these changes.</p><p>KATHY PICKERING, H&amp;R BLOCK TAX INSTITUTE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR: This is absolutely crunch time for us. It`s normally crunch time anyway, getting ready for the filing season. With a tax change this big, it`s really adding on a whole other level of questions, interest, curiosity. People really care about getting it right.</p><p>MUI: The danger is that workers could wind up underpaying during the year and face a huge tax bill come 2019. In the past, the IRS has waived penalties associated with underpayment to give households and businesses a little bit of breathing room during the transition. No word yet on if the IRS will do that once more.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Ylan Mui in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: The financial services firm Comerica (NYSE:CMA) is the latest company to cite the new tax reform law as a way to reward its employees. Comerica (NYSE:CMA) will raise its minimum wage to $15 an hour, and give thousand dollar bonuses to about 4,500 workers. And they won`t be alone, because the minimum wage is rising in several states beginning Monday.</p><p>Kate Rogers (NYSE:ROG) tells us where.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KATE ROGERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Workers across the country will be ringing in the New Year with higher pay thanks to laws or ballot initiative. Now, these 18 states are raising their minimum wages either on December 31st or January 1st. The highest dollar amount that will be in Washington state at $11.50 an hour while in Maine workers are at the highest percentage increase to $10 an hour, that`s according to Employment Policies Institute.</p><p>There are also 20 localities that are hiking pay. In Mountain View and Sunnyvale, California, workers will be paid $15 an hour. That is over a 15 percent increase from today`s rate, while in Seattle, pay will hit $15.40 cents an hour for minimum wage workers. The federal minimum wage, that is still stagnant at $7.25 an hour. That hasn`t moved since 2009. And with President Trump in office and Republican-controlled Congress, there is little chance of changing that anytime soon, which is why we`re seeing more states and localities taking matters into their own hands.</p><p>Currently, these 29 states and Washington, D.C. They all have wages above the federal level. We`ve seen corporate America take matters into its own hands to raise wages for workers. As well, a flurry of companies at the end of this year announcing increases to their minimum wage in the wake of the tax bill, including Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), BB&amp;T (NASDAQ:MSDXP) (NYSE:BBT), Comerica (NYSE:CMA) and many more.</p><p>Back over to you.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Kate Rogers (NYSE:ROG) reporting there.</p><p>And Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) expects to take a $5 billion profit hit and that is where we begin this final \"Market Focus\" of the year.</p><p>The bank said the new tax plan will reduce earnings by $5 billion, resulting in the company`s first quarterly loss in six years. Now, that is expected to be a short term largely technical blip for the bank, however, as it is expected to largely benefit from the lower corporate tax rate over the next few years. Shares were off a fraction today at $254.76.</p><p>Several private equity firms are reportedly interested in buying digital entertainment company TiVo (NASDAQ:TIVO). According to the online news site The Street, a potential deal would value TiVo (NASDAQ:TIVO) at $2.5 billion. TiVo (NASDAQ:TIVO) shares popped 11 percent to $15.60.</p><p>IBM says it has reached agreement to resolve a patent lawsuit with Priceline Group that goes back to 2015. IBM sued the travel booking company, alleging that it infringed four key IBM patents and was unwilling to engage in meaningful discussions about it. The new agreement lets each company cross license each other`s patent portfolio. IBM`s shares fell a fraction to $153.42. Priceline down more than 1 percent at $1,737 and change.</p><p>Well, the last part of this year is all about predictions for the next. And being a market prognosticator is a tough business. For more than five decades, though, maybe even six on Wall Street, the well-known trader and director of floor operations for UBS, Art Cashin, has a pretty good track record over the years.</p><p>And Bob Pisani is back with a look at how some of Cashin`s predictions have panned out since 2014.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PISANI: It`s a tough business being a market prognosticator. But Art Cashin has had a respectable track record over the years, with usually more hits than misses. As we enter 2014, the five-year-old stock mark rally was continuing, but Cashin was already thinking that profit earnings and margins were starting to top out.</p><p>ART CASHIN, DIRECTOR OF FLOOR OPERATIONS, UBS: They have cut and diced their way down to record profit margins, followed by record profit margins, followed by record profit margins. Now, that can`t continue. My 50-year history tells me that profit margins revert to the mean.</p><p>PISANI: He was a little early. But the profits recession did indeed come, but not until later that year and into 2015. Going into 2015, Cashin`s biggest worry was China.</p><p>CASHIN: The People`s Bank of China is very concerned. And they are looking at doing something to stimulate almost a way to -- I don`t want to use the word force lending, but really promote lending as well as they can. And they have problems in shadow banking and they have problems with real estate. And they`ll have to work their way through that.</p><p>PISANI: Right again. China was the biggest story in 2015. It rocked the investing world in the late summer with a surprise devaluation of the yuan, that caused a nearly 10 percent drop in the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>Going into 2016, the big story was oil. Many were predicting an imminent bottom after it dropped more than 60 percent. But Cashin was still not convinced.</p><p>CASHIN: My gut tells me it will stay low through the first quarter of next year, maybe a little further.</p><p>PISANI: He was right. Oil continued to drop and bottomed right in the middle of the first quarter of 2016, then began a slow crawl back. But you don`t hit it right all the time. At the end of last year, Cashin was concerned about the wave of populism that might sweep through Europe after Donald Trump`s election.</p><p>CASHIN: It wouldn`t take much to get the Italian government fully destabilized. We could be back with the Club Med problems with the banks. Greece is not far from returning to crisis again. So, the only thing you can say, I`ve seen this movie before, and dies, but it`s a slightly movie this time.</p><p>PISANI: It didn`t quite turn out that way. While populist parties did gain in European parliaments, populists were turned back in the top leadership positions throughout Europe.</p><p>Still as far as predictions, three out of four isn`t bad.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: And coming up, how an immigrant turned entrepreneur turned his small business into a half billion dollar international food sensation.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN: Finally tonight, some of you may have sent an edible arrangement over the holidays as a gift or maybe even received one. I sat down recently with the founder of the company to hear how his strong work ethic at an early age led him to create a half billion dollar business selling fruit, but not just any fruit.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TARIQ FARID, CEO, EDIBLE ARRANGEMENTS: You`re putting a little bit of a finish on it.</p><p>MATHISEN: Oh, look at that.</p><p>Entrepreneur Tariq Farid certainly has reason to celebrate.</p><p>Cheers.</p><p>T. FARID: Cheers.</p><p>MATHISEN: His company, Edible Arrangements, has mushroomed into an international sensation.</p><p>How much total revenue?</p><p>T. FARID: A little over $600 million.</p><p>MATHISEN: It`s a success that stems from humble beginnings. At 12 years old, Tariq and his family came to the United States from Pakistan, settling in 1981 in West Haven, Connecticut. Since money was tight, he and his siblings had to get busy, fast.</p><p>T. FARID: My mother would sit there and, you know, kick us out of bed every day and say, go work hard.</p><p>MATHISEN: Tell me about your earliest days as an entrepreneur.</p><p>T. FARID: A lady living down the street from me, I would cut her grass and help her with the lawn. She goes, honey, if you keep working this hard, you`ll be a millionaire by the time you`re 35. And I liked the ring of that.</p><p>MATHISEN: Within a year, Tariq took a job with a local florist, where he learned the importance of customer service and creative design. And when the opportunity arose to buy a defunct floral shop in nearby East Haven, Connecticut, Tariq moved fast. With $6,000 borrowed from his father`s boss, Tariq became the owner of Farid`s flowers.</p><p>Who gave you the lease on the shop? Who`s going to sign a lease with a 17- year-old?</p><p>T. FARID: I don`t think he knew the 17-year-old was going to be actually running it.</p><p>MATHISEN: But he did run it, dividing his time between the shop and school. The business grew into three local locations. More than a decade later, in 1999, the seed that really took root was his idea, one he had been toying with for a couple of years: sell fruit arrangements that looked like flowers.</p><p>T. FARID: I used to call it a wow, when a person receives it, when it arrives at the house, the first thing out of their mouth should be, wow! That reaction has to be there.</p><p>SOMIA FARID, EDIBLE ARRANGEMENTS SPECIAL PROJECTS MANAGER: My favorite thing about Edible is we`re an experienced company.</p><p>MATHISEN: Somia Farid, Tariq`s daughter, is the special projects manager at Edible Arrangements headquarters in Wallingford, Connecticut.</p><p>S. FARID: I`ve been in the story ever since I was a kid. I used toed to hang out at the store after school. I started taking orders when I was 12 years old.</p><p>MATHISEN: Still, it wasn`t easy for Tariq to transition from flowers to fruit.</p><p>T. FARID: I would go to a supplier and say, hey, can you make me a food- safe floral container, and they were like, get out of here. You know, what are you taking about? Why would we do that? We put flowers in it.</p><p>MATHISEN: He had to create the company`s entire supply chain from scratch. Everything from child safe skewers to securing what he says is the world`s freshest fruit.</p><p>By 2000, the business was building real traction, and Tariq began getting requests to franchise the business.</p><p>T. FARID: Somebody saw one and called from Atlanta and said, hey, I just saw this, and opened one in Atlanta. Somebody in Atlanta called someone in New Jersey, and then somebody from New Jersey called and said, hey, I just saw this, can I buy one for New Jersey. Next thing I know, I was in North Ridge, California, opening the eighth store.</p><p>MATHISEN: How many stores today?</p><p>T. FARID: Thirteen hundred.</p><p>MATHISEN: Today, Edible Arrangements is available in nine countries, about 60 percent of orders come in online. But they`re fulfilled by local shops.</p><p>For the Farids, it`s been a fruitful journey, and one that continues to blossom.</p><p>T. FARID: There`s a lot that goes into it that we`ve spent the last 18 years perfecting.</p><p>MATHISEN: Tariq Farid, from immigrant to American dream, getting rich the old fashioned way, slowly.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: And man, that fruit dipped in chocolate was good.</p><p>Edible Arrangements fruit bouquets range in price from about $40 to upwards of $1,000 for some more extravagant custom displays. The company focusing its efforts now on expanding its product line up, to include fruit parfaits and smoothies and a push to drive brick and mortar sales.</p><p>Well, that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I`m Tyler Mathisen. On behalf of Sue Herera, all of us at NBR, thanks for watching all year. We look forward to having you with us on 2018.

Cisco`s strong results show that old tech companies still have what it takes. While new tech firm Twitter struggles to retain users.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Growing risks. Federal Reserve Chair <person><nameText>Janet Yellen </nameText></person>says the economy faces new challenges but she`s not ready to change course just yet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MATHISEN: And the hack attack at the IRS. The two words taxpayers don`t want to hear as they prepare to file.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Wednesday, February 10th.</p><p>HERERA: Good evening, everyone. Welcome.</p><p>Slowdown? What slowdown? After issuing a downbeat prediction for the most recent quarter, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) reported profits well above what Wall Street was expecting and it didn`t stop there. Cisco`s outlook for the current quarter was upbeat as well. The Dow component increased its dividend and added $15 billion to its buyback.</p><p>The company earned 53 cents a share, 3 cents better than estimates. Revenue for the quarter around $12 billion, a slight decline from a year ago.</p><p>As for the stock, shares took off initially after that report was released. And the results come at a tough time for the tech sector.</p><p>And as Josh Lipton explains, Cisco`s report was being closely watched as a proxy for business spending.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Tech has tanked with the NASDAQ now down more than 10 percent so far this year, a big part of the concern, the global economic slowdown means companies are spending less on technology. That`s why tech investors were so interested to hear from Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), which is seen as a barometer of corporate IT spending.</p><p>SCOTT KESSLER, S&amp;P GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE: It generated $49 billion in revenue in its last fiscal year. So, the bottom line is, it was very big, it remains big, and its earnings report is important for folks that want an updated view as to how the global economy and technology spending are playing out for this kind of company.</p><p>LIPTON: We`ve already heard from two big tech names that set a challenging global economy, and soft IT spending was impacting their business. IBM`s CFO Martin Schroeter called the macro environment mixed, and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) CEO <person><nameText>Brian Krzanich </nameText></person>said macro weakness weighed on the chip makers` results.</p><p>The problem for many tech companies, though, is that global tech spending is expected to grow at only a moderate pace. Business and government purchases of tech goods and services will only grow about 2 percent this year according to Forrester, that`s better than the 3 percent drop suffered last year, but still represents a modest pace of expansion. Analysts say a rising U.S. dollar and weaker economic growth in China and Europe will pressure spending in 2016.</p><p>So, where does that leave tech investors? There`s a good chance that the bad news is already priced in as S&amp;P`s Kessler notes, many of these stocks have already sold off. Now, as a result, S&amp;P recommends investors buy Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), IBM, and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Josh Lipton in San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: From old tech to new -- Twitter which wants to attract more users didn`t. The social media company`s average monthly active users stalled in the fourth quarter, disappointing those who were looking for fresh signs of growth. Twitter earned 16 cents a share and that was better than expected. Revenue is just about in line, $710 million, but it was up strongly from a year ago.</p><p>Now, the stock was volatile after hours initially falling sharply only to rebound soon after.</p><p>Julia Boorstin has more now on Twitter`s results.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Twitter`s quarterly report disappointing investors and sending the stock plummeting because of one key fact. Its users numbers actually declined from the third to fourth quarter, which ended with 305 million monthly active users. The number excludes its SMS fast followers which use the service on more old-fashioned feature phones.</p><p>Though the company met revenue expectations and beat earnings projections, it was the fact it`s been unable to grow that Twitter user base that weighed on the stock. And the fact that it`s Q-1 revenue guidance disappointed expectations didn`t help any. Twitter saying in its letter to shareholders that user trends are improving so far this year, and that marketing efforts are paying, but that failed to reinsure investors.</p><p>Back over to you.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Thank you very much, Julia.</p><p>Rather confusing day on wall street trying to make sense of testimony from Federal Reserve Chair <person><nameText>Janet Yellen. </nameText></person>We`ll have more on what she said a bit later in our program.</p><p>The Dow index gained 187 points mid-morning, but then those gains faded. By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell nearly 100 points to 15,914. The NASDAQ gained 14. The S&amp;P 500 finished basically flat.</p><p>MATHISEN: Well, the worst performing stock on the blue chip Dow index today was Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) Company. It reported record earnings as we told you last night, but falling profit at its media unit dragged down shares. Separately, Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) shares were also lower, much lower after reporting a bigger than expected drop in quarterly revenue and disappointing results at some of its cable networks. Shares of both closed at multi-year lows.</p><p>HERERA: Tim Nollen joins us now to talk more about the ailing media sector. He is senior media analyst at Macquarie Securities.</p><p>Tim, welcome. Nice to have you with us this evening.</p><p>TIM NOLLEN, MACQUARIE SECURITIES, SR. MEDIA ANALYST: You`re welcome. Thank you.</p><p>HERERA: What about the market`s response? Disney`s report was pretty good. Is the market overreacting to some of the concerns out there about the media stocks?</p><p>NOLLEN: I think it`s something of an overreaction for some of these names. I think the justification is that the cord cutting fears are really weighing now. You know, Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) both talked about subscriber declines for the basic TV bundle in the quarter just reported.</p><p>Really everything else in both of their reports was fine. Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) actually met -- actually exceeded guidance and they raised guidance for next year, but it was that one single point I think for both of these companies that was the concern. And it`s a legitimate concern because this has been the primary profit driver of these companies for a long, long time.</p><p>MATHISEN: It`s not just obviously, Tim, Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) or Disney (NYSE:DIS) that was taken out to the woodshed. It was Discovery, it was Viacom (NYSE:VIA) most especially. Talk to me about those two.</p><p>NOLLEN: Well, interestingly on Viacom (NYSE:VIA), you know, yesterday when they reported, they actually reduced their guidance for affiliate fee growth for the remainder of 2016, that was a high single digit growth figure, it`s now a mid to low single digit growth figure.</p><p>And there are actually some reasons behind that which may make sense, foreign exchange. And they include OTT, SVOD sales to Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and the like in that figure. So that may rebound actually next year.</p><p>Time Warner (NYSE:TWX), though, talked about 5 percent growth figure at Turner in the quarter which is maybe just a little bit light, but they`ve got double digit, they`ve got low teens growth in affiliate fees, into 2016 and 2017. So, I think there is some legitimate anxiety, but, you know, there is still growth. Certainly maybe not as high as it was, but Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) has some nice built-in growth.</p><p>And don`t forget, we`re talking about the traditional bundle that has been under pressure, but there are some alternative options. Disney (NYSE:DIS) talked about skinny bundles like Sling TV. Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) talked about HBO Now, the OTT service which has 800,000 subscribers. So, there are some nice offsets there.</p><p>It`s companies like Viacom (NYSE:VIA) that don`t have those options available to them that are really suffering more.</p><p>HERERA: Tim, thank you very much for your insights.</p><p>Tim Nollen with Macquarie Securities.</p><p>NOLLEN: Thank you.</p><p>MATHISEN: And to politics now, Carly Fiorina suspending her presidential campaign after a seventh-place finish in last night`s New Hampshire primary. Chris Christie will also drop out as well after he finished sixth.</p><p>The big winners, of course, were Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders as voters showed their support for anti-establishment candidates.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Tonight, we serve notice to the political and economic establishment of this country that the American people will not continue to accept a corrupt campaign finance system that is undermining American democracy and we will not accept a rigged economy.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE : We are going to make America great again, but we`re going to do it the old-fashioned way. We`re going to beat China, Japan. We`re going to beat Mexico at trade. We`re going to beat all of these countries that are taking so much of our money away from us on a daily basis. It`s not going to happen anymore.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATHISEN: John Harwood covering the story for us.</p><p>John, welcome.</p><p>You know, the other day I asked you when will we get down to the final four? I guess we`re down to the final six right now. Trump seemingly the front-runner for the nomination. Does he have the organization in some of these next states to pull it off?</p><p>JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: No, but I don`t think he`s going to need the organization, Tyler. We`ve seen the power of his message is significant. The attraction he has, especially to working class voters in the Republican Party. He`s pretty powerful.</p><p>Now, we go to South Carolina where we`ll test whether the ideological conservatism of Ted Cruz and the establishment credibility of Jeb Bush, you know, brother of former president who`s still got pretty good numbers down there, and Marco Rubio is going to try to rebound. John Kasich got a lift out of New Hampshire, whether they can compete and slow him down.</p><p>But he`s got a big lead, and his prospects are pretty good at this point, Tyler.</p><p>HERERA: Let`s switch to Bernie Sanders, John. Given the win that he just had, is Hillary Clinton in trouble?</p><p>HARWOOD: She`s in trouble, but not nearly as serious trouble as the rest of the Republican field opposing Trump is. Hillary Clinton remains a solid favorite for the Democratic nomination. The path for Bernie Sanders gets a lot steeper as he gets to states where there are more African-American and Latino voters who are favorable to Hillary Clinton, but he`s definitely lit a fire of enthusiasm.</p><p>He will have a chance. He`ll have some money to test whether he can expand that base of support. The -- you have to say by history the odds are not good, but can`t count him out.</p><p>MATHISEN: He`s attracting some money. He`s got a lot of the youth vote. Let`s talk about money in this campaign. It has not translated into advantage. The two best-financed candidates, Bush and Clinton, are not doing great.</p><p>HARWOOD: Exactly right. And Donald Trump hasn`t spent very much money. It shows that his ability to get press coverage and favorable press coverage, his celebrity, as well as his message, have overpowered the influence of money in the race and the enthusiasm behind Bernie Sanders has overpowered Hillary Clinton`s money, although sanders has had enough to get his own message out.</p><p>You know, we`ve seen for some time, Tyler, the importance of television advertising has been diminishing in the race has social media and other avenues of information have proliferated, made it easier for campaigns to reach voters in other ways. This may be the campaign that kind of breaks the idea that a big bank account is what gets you elected.</p><p>MATHISEN: All right. John, thank you very much. John Harwood reporting tonight from Washington.</p><p>HERERA: Still ahead, does Federal Reserve Chair <person><nameText>Janet Yellen </nameText></person>see things in the economy that others don`t? What she told lawmakers when testifying on Capitol Hill today.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: The federal government reported a budget surplus of more than $55 billion in January. The Treasury Department says that`s an improvement from a year ago and it was helped out by a timing quirk, $42 billion in benefit checks were sent out in December because the regular payment period fell on a weekend.</p><p>MATHISEN: Fed chair <person><nameText>Janet Yellen </nameText></person>told Congress today that growth prospects in the U.S. economy have fallen in recent weeks. She walked a careful line in the first of two days of semiannual testimony on Capitol Hill. She highlighted the strength of the labor market, but said financial and market conditions, including overseas could restrain U.S. growth.</p><p>Hampton Pearson reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p><person><nameText>JANET YELLEN, </nameText></person>FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIR: Thank you.</p><p>HAMPTON PEARSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Federal Reserve Chair <person><nameText>Janet Yellen </nameText></person>told lawmakers continued global economic woes and market volatility might force the Federal Reserve to slow the pace of future rate hike but not right away.</p><p>YELLEN: I want to make clear that monetary policy is not on the preset course, and so, our evaluation of the likely impact of those developments on the economic outlook are in our ability to meet both our employment and inflation objectives. Those are the factors that will govern the future stance of monetary policy.</p><p>PEARSON: The Fed`s semiannual report to Congress raises concerns about China`s economic slowdown and weaker currency, the further decline in oil prices and the strong dollar hurting U.S. exports.</p><p>But the Fed chair told lawmakers strong hiring, rising wages, and more consumer spending could help the U.S. economy weather the storm.</p><p>YELLEN: Ongoing employment gains and faster wage growth should support the growth of real incomes and, therefore, consumer spending. And global economic growth should pick up over time supported by highly accommodative monetary policies abroad.</p><p>PEARSON: But Yellen did admit monetary policymakers have at least studied negative interest rates, which central banks in Japan and Europe have recently used as a policy tool.</p><p>REP. PATRICK MCHENRY (R), NORTH CAROLINA: So, at this point, it`s unclear whether or not the fed does have legal authority to implement negative rates.</p><p>YELLEN: I am not aware of any -- anything that would prevent us from doing it, but I`m saying that we have not fully investigated the legal issues that would -- that still needs to be done.</p><p>PEARSON: Day one of the Fed chair`s congressional testimony ended with no major surprises but also a concession that monetary policymakers are, indeed, closely watching global economic developments.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Hampton Pearson in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: The National Retail Federation expects sales to grow a little bit more than 3 percent this year. That`s higher than the ten-year average and excludes automobiles, gas stations, and restaurants. The industry group cites a strengthening job market and steady consumer confidence and says more spending will shift away from the mall. Consumer spending accounts for about 70 percent of all economic activity.</p><p>MATHISEN: The Supreme Court blocked the White House`s clean power plan. The justices put on hold rules that would curb carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants. The court decisions means the regulations will not go into effect until an appeals court makes its ruling. The White House says it disagrees with the decision.</p><p>HERERA: Also in Washington, the Internal Revenue Service says identity thieves hacked into their system. Their goal was to steal your tax refund.</p><p>Eamon Javers has more on the last thing any taxpayer wants to see during tax season.</p><p>Good to see you, Eamon.</p><p>EAMON JAVERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Hi, Sue.</p><p>This is one of those ones where the IRS said they were able to nip it in the bud. They were able to stop this attack as it was happening. But it really reminds you of just what a huge target the IRS is for hackers around the world. So much financial information, so much personal on the servers at the IRS, hackers really want to get in there and the IRS knows they`re under attack every single day.</p><p>Here`s what happened as far as we know in this latest incident which they revealed last night. They said thieves used previously stolen data to generate what are called E-File PINs, those personal identifying numbers to try to get in there and create and file returns.</p><p>Now, what they said was this involved 464,000 Social Security numbers and said the attack was halted and so, therefore, no data was lost. Now, this was similar to, but a little bit less serious to an attack that happened last summer involving the \"get transcript\" feature of the IRS in which people were trying to hack in and get returns and then use the data on those returns to get bogus refunds.</p><p>The IRS commissioner was on Capitol Hill today and he explained the difference. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN KOSKINEN, IRS COMMISSIONER: I would note that both the get transcript difficulty and the more recent attack in the last couple weeks both were sophisticated forms of identity theft. The criminals already had all of the personal information of the taxpayer that they need. None of those attacks breached our system, itself. They were not cyber breaches in the sense that our database was accessed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAVERS: So, Sue, the key here is the IRS says they were able to stop this one before any major damage was done.</p><p>HERERA: So, you explain what happened here, but what now happens to those -- I think you said 400,000-plus people whose information is out there now?</p><p>JAVERS: Yes, that`s right. The IRS said those were people where the hackers had stolen their information somewhere else and then were using it at the IRS to try to generate these bogus returns. What the IRS said they`re going to do is write letters to all these people telling them, hey, you better pay attention, your information has been stolen, it is out there on the black market, you might want to take cyber security steps to protect yourself.</p><p>MATHISEN: As Butch said to Sundance, Sundance to Butch, who are these guys?</p><p>JAVERS: That`s one of the really good questions here. A lot of people think a lot of this is coming from Russia and Eastern Europe. But attributions in cyber security is so difficult, because they can use computers, drone those computers can be in anywhere in the world. Very hard to tell sometimes.</p><p>HERERA: All right, Eamon. Thank you so much.</p><p>JAVERS: You bet.</p><p>HERERA: Eamon Javers in Washington.</p><p>MATHISEN: The health insurer Humana (NYSE:HUM) sees its quarterly profit drop by nearly a third and that is where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\". The company attributed the steep loss to the cost of its medical insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act, a bright spot, the insurer said its 2016 earnings will be above forecast.</p><p>Last July, Humana (NYSE:HUM) agreed to be acquired by rival Aetna (NYSE:AET) for $37 billion. Shares of Humana (NYSE:HUM) up 1 percent to $161.07.</p><p>Owens Corning (NYSE:OC) (NYSE:GLW) saw its shares rise today after the company increased its quarterly dividend by 6 percent and posted better that expected quarterly profits. The glass and roofing products maker also issued an upbeat outlook for 2016 saying it sees continued growth in its three main business segments. Shares rose over 2.5 percent to $43 even.</p><p>Fitbit which makes health and finance products you wear on your wrist saw its shares bulk up after two prominent stakes in the company were revealed. An SEC filing showed that Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff had taken a 5 percent stake in the company. On another filing disclosed, Vanguard Group now owns a big 9 percent share. Fitbit rose nearly 3 percent to $14.68.</p><p>MATHISEN: Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) says it`s received approval from European regulators to buy rival Office Depot (NYSE:ODP), as long as those companies dismantle all of Office Depot`s European operations in an effort to ease competition concerns. The merger is valued at more than $6 billion.</p><p>The deal still needs approval from the U.S. and from Canada. U.S. regulators have challenged that deal over concerns about competition. Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) was up a penny to $8.41. Office Depot (NYSE:ODP) popped more than 2 percent to $5.03.</p><p>Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is buying back up to $5 billion worth of its shares. The new program would replace the $2 billion buyback the company issued in 2010. Shares of the e-commerce giant rose initially in extended trading after closing up more than a percent today to $490.48.</p><p>And despite issuing a worse than expected loss for its latest quarter, the automaker Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) saw its shares jump in after-hours trading, strong deliveries and guidance for the year. The reasons for the stock move.</p><p>Tesla said it expects to deliver between 80,000 and 90,000 new Model S and Model X vehicles in 2016. The announcement came with news at the company posted a much worse than expected loss in its latest quarter. Shares were down more than 3 percent today to $143.67, but had a strong showing after the bell on that guidance.</p><p>MATHISEN: A sharp drop in interest rates prompted more homeowners to refinance their mortgages last week. The Mortgage Bankers Association reports that total application volume increased more than 9 percent. Behind most of those gains: refinancings. Not new purchases. Purchase apps are still 25 percent higher than they were a year ago.</p><p>HERERA: And a new trend is taking hold in housing. Generations of families are living under one roof. Think \"Downton Abbey\".</p><p>Americans have moved away from the model in the last century, of course, but now, they`re suddenly moving back, which opened up new doors, new designs and new opportunities for the home builders.</p><p>Diana Olick has this all in the family story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Jennifer Michaels never intended to live with her mother, Lucy Abbott.</p><p>But when Michaels sold her house faster than she expected, she and her kids needed somewhere to stay. So, they went to grandma`s.</p><p>Much to all their surprise, they didn`t hate it.</p><p>JENNIFER MICHAELS, MOVED IN WITH MOM: We decided it just was like the perfect fit. And we never left.</p><p>LUCY ABBOTT, LIVES WITH DAUGHTER: I enjoyed the life that the kids bring to you when they`re around you all the time, but we did have our challenges.</p><p>OLICK: The challenge was not a bigger space, but separate spaces.</p><p>ABBOTT: I`m time traveler.</p><p>OLICK: Lucy likes the video games.</p><p>ABBOTT: I`m a gamer and I`m up until 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning. And the kids need their sleep.</p><p>Oh, dear.</p><p>OLICK: So, mother and daughter decided to buy a next gen home by builder Lennar (NYSE:LEN), a leader in this trend. The home has two entrances, separate kitchens, and living areas.</p><p>MICHAELS: I literally have gone three days without seeing her.</p><p>OLICK: Fourteen percent of all U.S. households, that`s 16.5 million, already live multi-generationally.</p><p>JOHN BURNS, JOHN BURNS REAL ESTATE CONSULTING: One of the reasons we`ve seen so much immigration in the last 25 years and other cultures around the world tend to live multi-generationally. That`s caused the numbers to increase substantially.</p><p>OLICK: The recession also played a part, young adults were hit hardest in the job market and some were unable to move out. They`re also delaying marriage, which keeps them home longer.</p><p>On the other end of the spectrum, baby boomers are retiring and downsizing.</p><p>Burns surveyed 20,000 potential home buyers were surveyed and found nearly half would like to accommodate their elderly parents in their next home and almost as many want to live with their adult children.</p><p>MICHAELS: Not at all about the finances. In fact, the house that we were all living in, we`re renting it out so we didn`t even sell it to buy this house. It`s more of a connection between the generations.</p><p>ABBOTT: Grandparents like me are more active. You know, we do more things. We`re healthier. We live longer. So, the relationships with grown-up children can mature.</p><p>OLICK: And so, with the right floor plan --</p><p>ABBOTT: The light bulb went on.</p><p>OLICK: -- families that don`t play together can still stay together.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Grandma the gamer. Got to love that.</p><p>All right. Coming up, deep in the heart of Texas is the priciest ranch ever sold to a sports mogul.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: The owner of the NFL`s Los Angeles Rams is now also the owner of a massive Texas ranch and it`s not his first land-buying rodeo.</p><p>Jane Wells has more on the billionaire behind what`s quite possibly the most expensive ranch ever sold in the U.S.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JANE WELLS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: It`s good to be rich, but with the stock market seesawing and the outlook murky, where does a multibillionaire put his money? Real estate.</p><p>STAN KROENKE, DEVELOPER MAGNATE: It`s great to be here today.</p><p>WELLS: That`s exactly what this developer magnate Dan Kroenke has done. Just a couple weeks ago, he announced approval to move his football team, the Rams, back to Los Angeles, where he is financing a $2 billion state of the art stadium on land he purchased in Inglewood.</p><p>Now, Kroenke has bought an even bigger piece of property. In fact, the largest single ranch in the United States. The Waggoner Ranch in Texas covers six counties, 800 square miles, 535,000 acres.

Cisco's  strong results show that old tech companies still have what it takes.   While new tech firm Twitter struggles to retain users.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Growing risks.  Federal  Reserve Chair Janet Yellen says the economy faces new challenges but she's  not ready to change course just yet.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MATHISEN:  And the hack attack at the IRS.  The two words taxpayers don't  want to hear as they prepare to file.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Wednesday,  February 10th.  </p><p>HERERA:  Good evening, everyone.  Welcome.  </p><p>Slowdown?  What slowdown?  After issuing a downbeat prediction for the most  recent quarter, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) reported profits well above what Wall  Street was expecting and it didn't stop there.  Cisco's outlook for the  current quarter was upbeat as well.  The Dow component increased its  dividend and added $15 billion to its buyback.  </p><p>The company earned 53 cents a share, 3 cents better than estimates.   Revenue for the quarter around $12 billion, a slight decline from a year  ago.  </p><p>As for the stock, shares took off initially after that report was released.   And the results come at a tough time for the tech sector.  </p><p>And as Josh Lipton explains, Cisco's report was being closely watched as a  proxy for business spending.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Tech has tanked with  the NASDAQ now down more than 10 percent so far this year, a big part of  the concern, the global economic slowdown means companies are spending less  on technology.  That's why tech investors were so interested to hear from  Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), which is seen as a barometer of corporate IT spending.  </p><p>SCOTT KESSLER, S&amp;P GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE:  It generated $49 billion in  revenue in its last fiscal year.  So, the bottom line is, it was very big,  it remains big, and its earnings report is important for folks that want an  updated view as to how the global economy and technology spending are  playing out for this kind of company.  </p><p>LIPTON:  We've already heard from two big tech names that set a challenging  global economy, and soft IT spending was impacting their business.  IBM's  CFO Martin Schroeter called the macro environment mixed, and Intel  (NASDAQ:INTC) CEO Brian Krzanich said macro weakness weighed on the chip  makers' results.  </p><p>The problem for many tech companies, though, is that global tech spending  is expected to grow at only a moderate pace.  Business and government  purchases of tech goods and services will only grow about 2 percent this  year according to Forrester, that's better than the 3 percent drop suffered  last year, but still represents a modest pace of expansion.  Analysts say a  rising U.S. dollar and weaker economic growth in China and Europe will  pressure spending in 2016.  </p><p>So, where does that leave tech investors?  There's a good chance that the  bad news is already priced in as S&amp;P's Kessler notes, many of these stocks  have already sold off.  Now, as a result, S&amp;P recommends investors buy  Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), IBM, and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Josh Lipton in San Francisco.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  From old tech to new -- Twitter which wants to attract more  users didn't.  The social media company's average monthly active users  stalled in the fourth quarter, disappointing those who were looking for  fresh signs of growth.  Twitter earned 16 cents a share and that was better  than expected.  Revenue is just about in line, $710 million, but it was up  strongly from a year ago.  </p><p>Now, the stock was volatile after hours initially falling sharply only to  rebound soon after.</p><p>Julia Boorstin has more now on Twitter's results.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Twitter's quarterly  report disappointing investors and sending the stock plummeting because of  one key fact.  Its users numbers actually declined from the third to fourth  quarter, which ended with 305 million monthly active users.  The number  excludes its SMS fast followers which use the service on more old-fashioned  feature phones.  </p><p>Though the company met revenue expectations and beat earnings projections,  it was the fact it's been unable to grow that Twitter user base that  weighed on the stock.  And the fact that it's Q-1 revenue guidance  disappointed expectations didn't help any.  Twitter saying in its letter to  shareholders that user trends are improving so far this year, and that  marketing efforts are paying, but that failed to reinsure investors.  </p><p>Back over to you.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Thank you very much, Julia.  </p><p>Rather confusing day on wall street trying to make sense of testimony from  Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen.  We'll have more on what she said a bit  later in our program.  </p><p>The Dow index gained 187 points mid-morning, but then those gains faded.   By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell nearly 100 points to  15,914.  The NASDAQ gained 14.  The S&amp;P 500 finished basically flat.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, the worst performing stock on the blue chip Dow index  today was Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) Company.  It reported record earnings as  we told you last night, but falling profit at its media unit dragged down  shares.  Separately, Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) shares were also lower, much  lower after reporting a bigger than expected drop in quarterly revenue and  disappointing results at some of its cable networks.  Shares of both closed  at multi-year lows.  </p><p>HERERA:  Tim Nollen joins us now to talk more about the ailing media  sector.  He is senior media analyst at Macquarie Securities.</p><p>Tim, welcome.  Nice to have you with us this evening.</p><p>TIM NOLLEN, MACQUARIE SECURITIES, SR. MEDIA ANALYST:  You're welcome.   Thank you.  </p><p>HERERA:  What about the market's response?  Disney's report was pretty  good.  Is the market overreacting to some of the concerns out there about  the media stocks?  </p><p>NOLLEN:  I think it's something of an overreaction for some of these names.   I think the justification is that the cord cutting fears are really  weighing now.  You know, Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) both  talked about subscriber declines for the basic TV bundle in the quarter  just reported.</p><p>Really everything else in both of their reports was fine.  Time Warner  (NYSE:TWX) actually met -- actually exceeded guidance and they raised  guidance for next year, but it was that one single point I think for both  of these companies that was the concern.  And it's a legitimate concern  because this has been the primary profit driver of these companies for a  long, long time.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  It's not just obviously, Tim, Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) or Disney  (NYSE:DIS) that was taken out to the woodshed.  It was Discovery, it was  Viacom (NYSE:VIA) most especially.  Talk to me about those two.  </p><p>NOLLEN:  Well, interestingly on Viacom (NYSE:VIA), you know, yesterday when  they reported, they actually reduced their guidance for affiliate fee  growth for the remainder of 2016, that was a high single digit growth  figure, it's now a mid to low single digit growth figure.  </p><p>And there are actually some reasons behind that which may make sense,  foreign exchange.  And they include OTT, SVOD sales to Netflix  (NASDAQ:NFLX) and the like in that figure.  So that may rebound actually  next year.  </p><p>Time Warner (NYSE:TWX), though, talked about 5 percent growth figure at  Turner in the quarter which is maybe just a little bit light, but they've  got double digit, they've got low teens growth in affiliate fees, into 2016  and 2017.  So, I think there is some legitimate anxiety, but, you know,  there is still growth.  Certainly maybe not as high as it was, but Time  Warner (NYSE:TWX) has some nice built-in growth.</p><p>And don't forget, we're talking about the traditional bundle that has been  under pressure, but there are some alternative options.  Disney (NYSE:DIS)  talked about skinny bundles like Sling TV.  Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) talked  about HBO Now, the OTT service which has 800,000 subscribers.  So, there  are some nice offsets there.  </p><p>It's companies like Viacom (NYSE:VIA) that don't have those options  available to them that are really suffering more.  </p><p>HERERA:  Tim, thank you very much for your insights.  </p><p>Tim Nollen with Macquarie Securities.</p><p>NOLLEN:  Thank you.</p><p>MATHISEN:  And to politics now, Carly Fiorina suspending her presidential  campaign after a seventh-place finish in last night's New Hampshire  primary.  Chris Christie will also drop out as well after he finished  sixth.  </p><p>The big winners, of course, were Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders as voters  showed their support for anti-establishment candidates.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Tonight, we serve  notice to the political and economic establishment of this country that the  American people will not continue to accept a corrupt campaign finance  system that is undermining American democracy and we will not accept a  rigged economy.  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE : We are going to make America  great again, but we're going to do it the old-fashioned way.  We're going  to beat China, Japan.  We're going to beat Mexico at trade.  We're going to  beat all of these countries that are taking so much of our money away from  us on a daily basis.  It's not going to happen anymore.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATHISEN:  John Harwood covering the story for us.  </p><p>John, welcome.  </p><p>You know, the other day I asked you when will we get down to the final  four?  I guess we're down to the final six right now.  Trump seemingly the  front-runner for the nomination.  Does he have the organization in some of  these next states to pull it off?  </p><p>JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  No, but I don't think  he's going to need the organization, Tyler.  We've seen the power of his  message is significant.  The attraction he has, especially to working class  voters in the Republican Party.  He's pretty powerful.  </p><p>Now, we go to South Carolina where we'll test whether the ideological  conservatism of Ted Cruz and the establishment credibility of Jeb Bush, you  know, brother of former president who's still got pretty good numbers down  there, and Marco Rubio is going to try to rebound.  John Kasich got a lift  out of New Hampshire, whether they can compete and slow him down.  </p><p>But he's got a big lead, and his prospects are pretty good at this point,  Tyler.  </p><p>HERERA:  Let's switch to Bernie Sanders, John.  Given the win that he just  had, is Hillary Clinton in trouble?  </p><p>HARWOOD:  She's in trouble, but not nearly as serious trouble as the rest  of the Republican field opposing Trump is.  Hillary Clinton remains a solid  favorite for the Democratic nomination.  The path for Bernie Sanders gets a  lot steeper as he gets to states where there are more African-American and  Latino voters who are favorable to Hillary Clinton, but he's definitely lit  a fire of enthusiasm.  </p><p>He will have a chance.  He'll have some money to test whether he can expand  that base of support.  The -- you have to say by history the odds are not  good, but can't count him out.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  He's attracting some money.  He's got a lot of the youth vote.   Let's talk about money in this campaign.  It has not translated into  advantage.  The two best-financed candidates, Bush and Clinton, are not  doing great.  </p><p>HARWOOD:  Exactly right.  And Donald Trump hasn't spent very much money.   It shows that his ability to get press coverage and favorable press  coverage, his celebrity, as well as his message, have overpowered the  influence of money in the race and the enthusiasm behind Bernie Sanders has  overpowered Hillary Clinton's money, although sanders has had enough to get  his own message out.  </p><p>You know, we've seen for some time, Tyler, the importance of television  advertising has been diminishing in the race has social media and other  avenues of information have proliferated, made it easier for campaigns to  reach voters in other ways.  This may be the campaign that kind of breaks  the idea that a big bank account is what gets you elected.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  All right.  John, thank you very much.  John Harwood reporting  tonight from Washington.  </p><p>HERERA:  Still ahead, does Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen see things in  the economy that others don't?  What she told lawmakers when testifying on  Capitol Hill today.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  The federal government reported a budget surplus of more than $55  billion in January.  The Treasury Department says that's an improvement  from a year ago and it was helped out by a timing quirk, $42 billion in  benefit checks were sent out in December because the regular payment period  fell on a weekend.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Fed chair Janet Yellen told Congress today that growth prospects  in the U.S. economy have fallen in recent weeks.  She walked a careful line  in the first of two days of semiannual testimony on Capitol Hill.  She  highlighted the strength of the labor market, but said financial and market  conditions, including overseas could restrain U.S. growth.  </p><p>Hampton Pearson reports.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JANET YELLEN, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIR:  Thank you.  </p><p>HAMPTON PEARSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Federal Reserve  Chair Janet Yellen told lawmakers continued global economic woes and market  volatility might force the Federal Reserve to slow the pace of future rate  hike but not right away.  </p><p>YELLEN:  I want to make clear that monetary policy is not on the preset  course, and so, our evaluation of the likely impact of those developments  on the economic outlook are in our ability to meet both our employment and  inflation objectives.  Those are the factors that will govern the future  stance of monetary policy.  </p><p>PEARSON:  The Fed's semiannual report to Congress raises concerns about  China's economic slowdown and weaker currency, the further decline in oil  prices and the strong dollar hurting U.S. exports.  </p><p>But the Fed chair told lawmakers strong hiring, rising wages, and more  consumer spending could help the U.S. economy weather the storm.  </p><p>YELLEN:  Ongoing employment gains and faster wage growth should support the  growth of real incomes and, therefore, consumer spending.  And global  economic growth should pick up over time supported by highly accommodative  monetary policies abroad.  </p><p>PEARSON:  But Yellen did admit monetary policymakers have at least studied  negative interest rates, which central banks in Japan and Europe have  recently used as a policy tool.  </p><p>REP. PATRICK MCHENRY (R), NORTH CAROLINA:  So, at this point, it's unclear  whether or not the fed does have legal authority to implement negative  rates.  </p><p>YELLEN:  I am not aware of any -- anything that would prevent us from doing  it, but I'm saying that we have not fully investigated the legal issues  that would -- that still needs to be done.  </p><p>PEARSON:  Day one of the Fed chair's congressional testimony ended with no  major surprises but also a concession that monetary policymakers are,  indeed, closely watching global economic developments.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Hampton Pearson in Washington.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  The National Retail Federation expects sales to grow a little bit  more than 3 percent this year.  That's higher than the ten-year average and  excludes automobiles, gas stations, and restaurants.  The industry group  cites a strengthening job market and steady consumer confidence and says  more spending will shift away from the mall.  Consumer spending accounts  for about 70 percent of all economic activity.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  The Supreme Court blocked the White House's clean power plan.   The justices put on hold rules that would curb carbon dioxide emissions  from coal-fired power plants.  The court decisions means the regulations  will not go into effect until an appeals court makes its ruling.  The White  House says it disagrees with the decision.  </p><p>HERERA:  Also in Washington, the Internal Revenue Service says identity  thieves hacked into their system.  Their goal was to steal your tax refund.  </p><p>Eamon Javers has more on the last thing any taxpayer wants to see during  tax season.  </p><p>Good to see you, Eamon.</p><p>EAMON JAVERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  Hi, Sue.</p><p>This is one of those ones where the IRS said they were able to nip it in  the bud.  They were able to stop this attack as it was happening.  But it  really reminds you of just what a huge target the IRS is for hackers around  the world.  So much financial information, so much personal on the servers  at the IRS, hackers really want to get in there and the IRS knows they're  under attack every single day.  </p><p>Here's what happened as far as we know in this latest incident which they  revealed last night.  They said thieves used previously stolen data to  generate what are called E-File PINs, those personal identifying numbers to  try to get in there and create and file returns.  </p><p>Now, what they said was this involved 464,000 Social Security numbers and  said the attack was halted and so, therefore, no data was lost.  Now, this  was similar to, but a little bit less serious to an attack that happened  last summer involving the \"get transcript\" feature of the IRS in which  people were trying to hack in and get returns and then use the data on  those returns to get bogus refunds.  </p><p>The IRS commissioner was on Capitol Hill today and he explained the  difference.  Take a listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN KOSKINEN, IRS COMMISSIONER:  I would note that both the get transcript  difficulty and the more recent attack in the last couple weeks both were  sophisticated forms of identity theft.  The criminals already had all of  the personal information of the taxpayer that they need.  None of those  attacks breached our system, itself.  They were not cyber breaches in the  sense that our database was accessed.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAVERS:  So, Sue, the key here is the IRS says they were able to stop this  one before any major damage was done.  </p><p>HERERA:  So, you explain what happened here, but what now happens to those  -- I think you said 400,000-plus people whose information is out there now?  </p><p>JAVERS:  Yes, that's right.  The IRS said those were people where the  hackers had stolen their information somewhere else and then were using it  at the IRS to try to generate these bogus returns.  What the IRS said  they're going to do is write letters to all these people telling them, hey,  you better pay attention, your information has been stolen, it is out there  on the black market, you might want to take cyber security steps to protect  yourself.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  As Butch said to Sundance, Sundance to Butch, who are these  guys?  </p><p>JAVERS:  That's one of the really good questions here.  A lot of people  think a lot of this is coming from Russia and Eastern Europe.  But  attributions in cyber security is so difficult, because they can use  computers, drone those computers can be in anywhere in the world.  Very  hard to tell sometimes.</p><p>HERERA:  All right, Eamon.  Thank you so much.</p><p>JAVERS:  You bet.</p><p>HERERA:  Eamon Javers in Washington.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  The health insurer Humana (NYSE:HUM) sees its quarterly profit  drop by nearly a third and that is where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".   The company attributed the steep loss to the cost of its medical insurance  plans under the Affordable Care Act, a bright spot, the insurer said its  2016 earnings will be above forecast.  </p><p>Last July, Humana (NYSE:HUM) agreed to be acquired by rival Aetna  (NYSE:AET) for $37 billion.  Shares of Humana (NYSE:HUM) up 1 percent to  $161.07.  </p><p>Owens Corning (NYSE:OC) (NYSE:GLW) saw its shares rise today after the  company increased its quarterly dividend by 6 percent and posted better  that expected quarterly profits.  The glass and roofing products maker also  issued an upbeat outlook for 2016 saying it sees continued growth in its  three main business segments.  Shares rose over 2.5 percent to $43 even.  </p><p>Fitbit which makes health and finance products you wear on your wrist saw  its shares bulk up after two prominent stakes in the company were revealed.   An SEC filing showed that Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff had taken a 5 percent  stake in the company.  On another filing disclosed, Vanguard Group now owns  a big 9 percent share.  Fitbit rose nearly 3 percent to $14.68.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) says it's received approval from European  regulators to buy rival Office Depot (NYSE:ODP), as long as those companies  dismantle all of Office Depot's European operations in an effort to ease  competition concerns.  The merger is valued at more than $6 billion.  </p><p>The deal still needs approval from the U.S. and from Canada.  U.S.  regulators have challenged that deal over concerns about competition.   Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) was up a penny to $8.41.  Office Depot (NYSE:ODP)  popped more than 2 percent to $5.03.  </p><p>Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is buying back up to $5 billion worth of its shares.   The new program would replace the $2 billion buyback the company issued in  2010.  Shares of the e-commerce giant rose initially in extended trading  after closing up more than a percent today to $490.48.  </p><p>And despite issuing a worse than expected loss for its latest quarter, the  automaker Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) saw its shares jump in after-hours  trading, strong deliveries and guidance for the year.  The reasons for the  stock move.  </p><p>Tesla said it expects to deliver between 80,000 and 90,000 new Model S and  Model X vehicles in 2016.  The announcement came with news at the company  posted a much worse than expected loss in its latest quarter.  Shares were  down more than 3 percent today to $143.67, but had a strong showing after  the bell on that guidance.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  A sharp drop in interest rates prompted more homeowners to  refinance their mortgages last week.  The Mortgage Bankers Association  reports that total application volume increased more than 9 percent.   Behind most of those gains: refinancings.  Not new purchases.  Purchase  apps are still 25 percent higher than they were a year ago.  </p><p>HERERA:  And a new trend is taking hold in housing.  Generations of  families are living under one roof.  Think \"Downton Abbey\".  </p><p>Americans have moved away from the model in the last century, of course,  but now, they're suddenly moving back, which opened up new doors, new  designs and new opportunities for the home builders.  </p><p>Diana Olick has this all in the family story.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Jennifer Michaels  never intended to live with her mother, Lucy Abbott.  </p><p>But when Michaels sold her house faster than she expected, she and her kids  needed somewhere to stay.  So, they went to grandma's.  </p><p>Much to all their surprise, they didn't hate it.  </p><p>JENNIFER MICHAELS, MOVED IN WITH MOM:  We decided it just was like the  perfect fit.  And we never left.  </p><p>LUCY ABBOTT, LIVES WITH DAUGHTER:  I enjoyed the life that the kids bring  to you when they're around you all the time, but we did have our  challenges.  </p><p>OLICK:  The challenge was not a bigger space, but separate spaces.  </p><p>ABBOTT:  I'm time traveler.  </p><p>OLICK:  Lucy likes the video games.  </p><p>ABBOTT:  I'm a gamer and I'm up until 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning.  And the  kids need their sleep.  </p><p>Oh, dear.  </p><p>OLICK:  So, mother and daughter decided to buy a next gen home by builder  Lennar (NYSE:LEN), a leader in this trend.  The home has two entrances,  separate kitchens, and living areas.  </p><p>MICHAELS:  I literally have gone three days without seeing her.  </p><p>OLICK:  Fourteen percent of all U.S. households, that's 16.5 million,  already live multi-generationally.  </p><p>JOHN BURNS, JOHN BURNS REAL ESTATE CONSULTING:  One of the reasons we've  seen so much immigration in the last 25 years and other cultures around the  world tend to live multi-generationally.  That's caused the numbers to  increase substantially.  </p><p>OLICK:  The recession also played a part, young adults were hit hardest in  the job market and some were unable to move out.  They're also delaying  marriage, which keeps them home longer.  </p><p>On the other end of the spectrum, baby boomers are retiring and downsizing.  </p><p>Burns surveyed 20,000 potential home buyers were surveyed and found nearly  half would like to accommodate their elderly parents in their next home and  almost as many want to live with their adult children.  </p><p>MICHAELS:  Not at all about the finances.  In fact, the house that we were  all living in, we're renting it out so we didn't even sell it to buy this  house.  It's more of a connection between the generations.  </p><p>ABBOTT:  Grandparents like me are more active.  You know, we do more  things.  We're healthier.  We live longer.  So, the relationships with  grown-up children can mature.  </p><p>OLICK:  And so, with the right floor plan -- </p><p>ABBOTT:  The light bulb went on.  </p><p>OLICK:  -- families that don't play together can still stay together.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Diana Olick in Washington.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Grandma the gamer.  Got to love that.  </p><p>All right.  Coming up, deep in the heart of Texas is the priciest ranch  ever sold to a sports mogul.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  The owner of the NFL's Los Angeles Rams is now also the owner of a  massive Texas ranch and it's not his first land-buying rodeo.  </p><p>Jane Wells has more on the billionaire behind what's quite possibly the  most expensive ranch ever sold in the U.S. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JANE WELLS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It's good to be rich,  but with the stock market seesawing and the outlook murky, where does a  multibillionaire put his money?  Real estate.  </p><p>STAN KROENKE, DEVELOPER MAGNATE:  It's great to be here today.  </p><p>WELLS:  That's exactly what this developer magnate Dan Kroenke has done.   Just a couple weeks ago, he announced approval to move his football team,  the Rams, back to Los Angeles, where he is financing a $2 billion state of  the art stadium on land he purchased in Inglewood.  </p><p>Now, Kroenke has bought an even bigger piece of property.  In fact, the  largest single ranch in the United States.  The Waggoner Ranch in Texas  covers six counties, 800 square miles, 535,000 acres.  It's bigger than Los  Angeles and New York City combined.  </p><p>The asking price was $750 million, actual purchase price unknown.  Now, the  ranch has cattle, oil, horses, farmland, and it's been owned by one family  since 1849.  </p><p>Now, the Waggoner heirs say they picked Kroenke because he promised to  preserve what's considered an American treasure, in other words, no  football stadium or team here.  </p><p>Kroenke is married to one of Sam Walton's daughters and together, Forbes  estimates they're worth over $12 billion.  They bought another large ranch  in Montana a few years ago, and now, with the Waggoner Ranch under his  belt, Stan Kroenke owns 1.4 million acres of American ranchland, making him  one of the top five private landowners in the country behind people like  John Malone and Ted Turner.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Jane Wells.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  That's breathtaking.  Six counties.  </p><p>HERERA:  Six counties.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Wow.</p><p>HERERA:  Wow.  We'll keep track of that story for you.  </p><p>That does it for us tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Sue Herera.   Thanks for watching.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  And thanks from me as well.  I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Have a great  evening, everybody.  And we will see you right back here tomorrow night.  </p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

The two words taxpayers don't  want to hear as they prepare to file.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> All that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Wednesday,  February 10th.  </p><p> HERERA:  Good evening, everyone.  Welcome.  </p><p> Slowdown?  What slowdown?  After issuing a downbeat prediction for the most  recent quarter, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) reported profits well above what Wall  Street was expecting and it didn't stop there.  Cisco's outlook for the  current quarter was upbeat as well.  The Dow component increased its  dividend and added $15 billion to its buyback.  </p><p> The company earned 53 cents a share, 3 cents better than estimates.   Revenue for the quarter around $12 billion, a slight decline from a year  ago.  </p><p> As for the stock, shares took off initially after that report was released.   And the results come at a tough time for the tech sector.  </p><p> And as Josh Lipton explains, Cisco's report was being closely watched as a  proxy for business spending.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Tech has tanked with  the NASDAQ now down more than 10 percent so far this year, a big part of  the concern, the global economic slowdown means companies are spending less  on technology.  That's why tech investors were so interested to hear from  Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), which is seen as a barometer of corporate IT spending.  </p><p> SCOTT KESSLER, S&amp;P GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE:  It generated $49 billion in  revenue in its last fiscal year.  So, the bottom line is, it was very big,  it remains big, and its earnings report is important for folks that want an  updated view as to how the global economy and technology spending are  playing out for this kind of company.  </p><p> LIPTON:  We've already heard from two big tech names that set a challenging  global economy, and soft IT spending was impacting their business.  IBM's  CFO Martin Schroeter called the macro environment mixed, and Intel  (NASDAQ:INTC) CEO Brian Krzanich said macro weakness weighed on the chip  makers' results.  </p><p> The problem for many tech companies, though, is that global tech spending  is expected to grow at only a moderate pace.  Business and government  purchases of tech goods and services will only grow about 2 percent this  year according to Forrester, that's better than the 3 percent drop suffered  last year, but still represents a modest pace of expansion.  Analysts say a  rising U.S. dollar and weaker economic growth in China and Europe will  pressure spending in 2016.  </p><p> So, where does that leave tech investors?  There's a good chance that the  bad news is already priced in as S&amp;P's Kessler notes, many of these stocks  have already sold off.  Now, as a result, S&amp;P recommends investors buy  Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), IBM, and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Josh Lipton in San Francisco.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MATHISEN:  From old tech to new -- Twitter which wants to attract more  users didn't.  The social media company's average monthly active users  stalled in the fourth quarter, disappointing those who were looking for  fresh signs of growth.  Twitter earned 16 cents a share and that was better  than expected.  Revenue is just about in line, $710 million, but it was up  strongly from a year ago.  </p><p> Now, the stock was volatile after hours initially falling sharply only to  rebound soon after.</p><p> Julia Boorstin has more now on Twitter's results.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Twitter's quarterly  report disappointing investors and sending the stock plummeting because of  one key fact.  Its users numbers actually declined from the third to fourth  quarter, which ended with 305 million monthly active users.  The number  excludes its SMS fast followers which use the service on more old-fashioned  feature phones.  </p><p> Though the company met revenue expectations and beat earnings projections,  it was the fact it's been unable to grow that Twitter user base that  weighed on the stock.  And the fact that it's Q-1 revenue guidance  disappointed expectations didn't help any.  Twitter saying in its letter to  shareholders that user trends are improving so far this year, and that  marketing efforts are paying, but that failed to reinsure investors.  </p><p> Back over to you.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  Thank you very much, Julia.  </p><p> Rather confusing day on wall street trying to make sense of testimony from  Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen.  We'll have more on what she said a bit  later in our program.  </p><p> The Dow index gained 187 points mid-morning, but then those gains faded.   By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell nearly 100 points to  15,914.  The NASDAQ gained 14.  The S&amp;P 500 finished basically flat.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Well, the worst performing stock on the blue chip Dow index  today was Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) Company.  It reported record earnings as  we told you last night, but falling profit at its media unit dragged down  shares.  Separately, Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) shares were also lower, much  lower after reporting a bigger than expected drop in quarterly revenue and  disappointing results at some of its cable networks.  Shares of both closed  at multi-year lows.  </p><p> HERERA:  Tim Nollen joins us now to talk more about the ailing media  sector.  He is senior media analyst at Macquarie Securities.</p><p> Tim, welcome.  Nice to have you with us this evening.</p><p> TIM NOLLEN, MACQUARIE SECURITIES, SR. MEDIA ANALYST:  You're welcome.   Thank you.  </p><p> HERERA:  What about the market's response?  Disney's report was pretty  good.  Is the market overreacting to some of the concerns out there about  the media stocks?  </p><p> NOLLEN:  I think it's something of an overreaction for some of these names.   I think the justification is that the cord cutting fears are really  weighing now.  You know, Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) both  talked about subscriber declines for the basic TV bundle in the quarter  just reported.</p><p> Really everything else in both of their reports was fine.  Time Warner  (NYSE:TWX) actually met -- actually exceeded guidance and they raised  guidance for next year, but it was that one single point I think for both  of these companies that was the concern.  And it's a legitimate concern  because this has been the primary profit driver of these companies for a  long, long time.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  It's not just obviously, Tim, Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) or Disney  (NYSE:DIS) that was taken out to the woodshed.  It was Discovery, it was  Viacom (NYSE:VIA) most especially.  Talk to me about those two.  </p><p> NOLLEN:  Well, interestingly on Viacom (NYSE:VIA), you know, yesterday when  they reported, they actually reduced their guidance for affiliate fee  growth for the remainder of 2016, that was a high single digit growth  figure, it's now a mid to low single digit growth figure.  </p><p> And there are actually some reasons behind that which may make sense,  foreign exchange.  And they include OTT, SVOD sales to Netflix  (NASDAQ:NFLX) and the like in that figure.  So that may rebound actually  next year.  </p><p> Time Warner (NYSE:TWX), though, talked about 5 percent growth figure at  Turner in the quarter which is maybe just a little bit light, but they've  got double digit, they've got low teens growth in affiliate fees, into 2016  and 2017.  So, I think there is some legitimate anxiety, but, you know,  there is still growth.  Certainly maybe not as high as it was, but Time  Warner (NYSE:TWX) has some nice built-in growth.</p><p> And don't forget, we're talking about the traditional bundle that has been  under pressure, but there are some alternative options.  Disney (NYSE:DIS)  talked about skinny bundles like Sling TV.  Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) talked  about HBO Now, the OTT service which has 800,000 subscribers.  So, there  are some nice offsets there.  </p><p> It's companies like Viacom (NYSE:VIA) that don't have those options  available to them that are really suffering more.  </p><p> HERERA:  Tim, thank you very much for your insights.  </p><p> Tim Nollen with Macquarie Securities.</p><p> NOLLEN:  Thank you.</p><p> MATHISEN:  And to politics now, Carly Fiorina suspending her presidential  campaign after a seventh-place finish in last night's New Hampshire  primary.  Chris Christie will also drop out as well after he finished  sixth.  </p><p> The big winners, of course, were Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders as voters  showed their support for anti-establishment candidates.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Tonight, we serve  notice to the political and economic establishment of this country that the  American people will not continue to accept a corrupt campaign finance  system that is undermining American democracy and we will not accept a  rigged economy.  </p><p> DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE : We are going to make America  great again, but we're going to do it the old-fashioned way.  We're going  to beat China, Japan.  We're going to beat Mexico at trade.  We're going to  beat all of these countries that are taking so much of our money away from  us on a daily basis.  It's not going to happen anymore.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MATHISEN:  John Harwood covering the story for us.  </p><p> John, welcome.  </p><p> You know, the other day I asked you when will we get down to the final  four?  I guess we're down to the final six right now.  Trump seemingly the  front-runner for the nomination.  Does he have the organization in some of  these next states to pull it off?  </p><p> JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  No, but I don't think  he's going to need the organization, Tyler.  We've seen the power of his  message is significant.  The attraction he has, especially to working class  voters in the Republican Party.  He's pretty powerful.  </p><p> Now, we go to South Carolina where we'll test whether the ideological  conservatism of Ted Cruz and the establishment credibility of Jeb Bush, you  know, brother of former president who's still got pretty good numbers down  there, and Marco Rubio is going to try to rebound.  John Kasich got a lift  out of New Hampshire, whether they can compete and slow him down.  </p><p> But he's got a big lead, and his prospects are pretty good at this point,  Tyler.  </p><p> HERERA:  Let's switch to Bernie Sanders, John.  Given the win that he just  had, is Hillary Clinton in trouble?  </p><p> HARWOOD:  She's in trouble, but not nearly as serious trouble as the rest  of the Republican field opposing Trump is.  Hillary Clinton remains a solid  favorite for the Democratic nomination.  The path for Bernie Sanders gets a  lot steeper as he gets to states where there are more African-American and  Latino voters who are favorable to Hillary Clinton, but he's definitely lit  a fire of enthusiasm.  </p><p> He will have a chance.  He'll have some money to test whether he can expand  that base of support.  The -- you have to say by history the odds are not  good, but can't count him out.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  He's attracting some money.  He's got a lot of the youth vote.   Let's talk about money in this campaign.  It has not translated into  advantage.  The two best-financed candidates, Bush and Clinton, are not  doing great.  </p><p> HARWOOD:  Exactly right.  And Donald Trump hasn't spent very much money.   It shows that his ability to get press coverage and favorable press  coverage, his celebrity, as well as his message, have overpowered the  influence of money in the race and the enthusiasm behind Bernie Sanders has  overpowered Hillary Clinton's money, although sanders has had enough to get  his own message out.  </p><p> You know, we've seen for some time, Tyler, the importance of television  advertising has been diminishing in the race has social media and other  avenues of information have proliferated, made it easier for campaigns to  reach voters in other ways.  This may be the campaign that kind of breaks  the idea that a big bank account is what gets you elected.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  All right.  John, thank you very much.  John Harwood reporting  tonight from Washington.  </p><p> HERERA:  Still ahead, does Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen see things in  the economy that others don't?  What she told lawmakers when testifying on  Capitol Hill today.  </p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> HERERA:  The federal government reported a budget surplus of more than $55  billion in January.  The Treasury Department says that's an improvement  from a year ago and it was helped out by a timing quirk, $42 billion in  benefit checks were sent out in December because the regular payment period  fell on a weekend.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Fed chair Janet Yellen told Congress today that growth prospects  in the U.S. economy have fallen in recent weeks.  She walked a careful line  in the first of two days of semiannual testimony on Capitol Hill.  She  highlighted the strength of the labor market, but said financial and market  conditions, including overseas could restrain U.S. growth.  </p><p> Hampton Pearson reports.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> JANET YELLEN, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIR:  Thank you.  </p><p> HAMPTON PEARSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Federal Reserve  Chair Janet Yellen told lawmakers continued global economic woes and market  volatility might force the Federal Reserve to slow the pace of future rate  hike but not right away.  </p><p> YELLEN:  I want to make clear that monetary policy is not on the preset  course, and so, our evaluation of the likely impact of those developments  on the economic outlook are in our ability to meet both our employment and  inflation objectives.  Those are the factors that will govern the future  stance of monetary policy.  </p><p> PEARSON:  The Fed's semiannual report to Congress raises concerns about  China's economic slowdown and weaker currency, the further decline in oil  prices and the strong dollar hurting U.S. exports.  </p><p> But the Fed chair told lawmakers strong hiring, rising wages, and more  consumer spending could help the U.S. economy weather the storm.  </p><p> YELLEN:  Ongoing employment gains and faster wage growth should support the  growth of real incomes and, therefore, consumer spending.  And global  economic growth should pick up over time supported by highly accommodative  monetary policies abroad.  </p><p> PEARSON:  But Yellen did admit monetary policymakers have at least studied  negative interest rates, which central banks in Japan and Europe have  recently used as a policy tool.  </p><p> REP. PATRICK MCHENRY (R), NORTH CAROLINA:  So, at this point, it's unclear  whether or not the fed does have legal authority to implement negative  rates.  </p><p> YELLEN:  I am not aware of any -- anything that would prevent us from doing  it, but I'm saying that we have not fully investigated the legal issues  that would -- that still needs to be done.  </p><p> PEARSON:  Day one of the Fed chair's congressional testimony ended with no  major surprises but also a concession that monetary policymakers are,  indeed, closely watching global economic developments.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Hampton Pearson in Washington.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  The National Retail Federation expects sales to grow a little bit  more than 3 percent this year.  That's higher than the ten-year average and  excludes automobiles, gas stations, and restaurants.  The industry group  cites a strengthening job market and steady consumer confidence and says  more spending will shift away from the mall.  Consumer spending accounts  for about 70 percent of all economic activity.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  The Supreme Court blocked the White House's clean power plan.   The justices put on hold rules that would curb carbon dioxide emissions  from coal-fired power plants.  The court decisions means the regulations  will not go into effect until an appeals court makes its ruling.  The White  House says it disagrees with the decision.  </p><p> HERERA:  Also in Washington, the Internal Revenue Service says identity  thieves hacked into their system.  Their goal was to steal your tax refund.  </p><p> Eamon Javers has more on the last thing any taxpayer wants to see during  tax season.  </p><p> Good to see you, Eamon.</p><p> EAMON JAVERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  Hi, Sue.</p><p> This is one of those ones where the IRS said they were able to nip it in  the bud.  They were able to stop this attack as it was happening.  But it  really reminds you of just what a huge target the IRS is for hackers around  the world.  So much financial information, so much personal on the servers  at the IRS, hackers really want to get in there and the IRS knows they're  under attack every single day.  </p><p> Here's what happened as far as we know in this latest incident which they  revealed last night.  They said thieves used previously stolen data to  generate what are called E-File PINs, those personal identifying numbers to  try to get in there and create and file returns.  </p><p> Now, what they said was this involved 464,000 Social Security numbers and  said the attack was halted and so, therefore, no data was lost.  Now, this  was similar to, but a little bit less serious to an attack that happened  last summer involving the \"get transcript\" feature of the IRS in which  people were trying to hack in and get returns and then use the data on  those returns to get bogus refunds.  </p><p> The IRS commissioner was on Capitol Hill today and he explained the  difference.  Take a listen.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JOHN KOSKINEN, IRS COMMISSIONER:  I would note that both the get transcript  difficulty and the more recent attack in the last couple weeks both were  sophisticated forms of identity theft.  The criminals already had all of  the personal information of the taxpayer that they need.  None of those  attacks breached our system, itself.  They were not cyber breaches in the  sense that our database was accessed.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JAVERS:  So, Sue, the key here is the IRS says they were able to stop this  one before any major damage was done.  </p><p> HERERA:  So, you explain what happened here, but what now happens to those  -- I think you said 400,000-plus people whose information is out there now?  </p><p> JAVERS:  Yes, that's right.  The IRS said those were people where the  hackers had stolen their information somewhere else and then were using it  at the IRS to try to generate these bogus returns.  What the IRS said  they're going to do is write letters to all these people telling them, hey,  you better pay attention, your information has been stolen, it is out there  on the black market, you might want to take cyber security steps to protect  yourself.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  As Butch said to Sundance, Sundance to Butch, who are these  guys?  </p><p> JAVERS:  That's one of the really good questions here.  A lot of people  think a lot of this is coming from Russia and Eastern Europe.  But  attributions in cyber security is so difficult, because they can use  computers, drone those computers can be in anywhere in the world.  Very  hard to tell sometimes.</p><p> HERERA:  All right, Eamon.  Thank you so much.</p><p> JAVERS:  You bet.</p><p> HERERA:  Eamon Javers in Washington.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  The health insurer Humana (NYSE:HUM) sees its quarterly profit  drop by nearly a third and that is where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".   The company attributed the steep loss to the cost of its medical insurance  plans under the Affordable Care Act, a bright spot, the insurer said its  2016 earnings will be above forecast.  </p><p> Last July, Humana (NYSE:HUM) agreed to be acquired by rival Aetna  (NYSE:AET) for $37 billion.  Shares of Humana (NYSE:HUM) up 1 percent to  $161.07.  </p><p>Owens Corning (NYSE:OC) (NYSE:GLW) saw its shares rise today after the  company increased its quarterly dividend by 6 percent and posted better  that expected quarterly profits.  The glass and roofing products maker also  issued an upbeat outlook for 2016 saying it sees continued growth in its  three main business segments.  Shares rose over 2.5 percent to $43 even.  </p><p> Fitbit which makes health and finance products you wear on your wrist saw  its shares bulk up after two prominent stakes in the company were revealed.   An SEC filing showed that Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff had taken a 5 percent  stake in the company.  On another filing disclosed, Vanguard Group now owns  a big 9 percent share.  Fitbit rose nearly 3 percent to $14.68.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) says it's received approval from European  regulators to buy rival Office Depot (NYSE:ODP), as long as those companies  dismantle all of Office Depot's European operations in an effort to ease  competition concerns.  The merger is valued at more than $6 billion.  </p><p> The deal still needs approval from the U.S. and from Canada.  U.S.  regulators have challenged that deal over concerns about competition.   Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) was up a penny to $8.41.  Office Depot (NYSE:ODP)  popped more than 2 percent to $5.03.  </p><p> Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is buying back up to $5 billion worth of its shares.   The new program would replace the $2 billion buyback the company issued in  2010.  Shares of the e-commerce giant rose initially in extended trading  after closing up more than a percent today to $490.48.  </p><p> And despite issuing a worse than expected loss for its latest quarter, the  automaker Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) saw its shares jump in after-hours  trading, strong deliveries and guidance for the year.  The reasons for the  stock move.  </p><p>Tesla said it expects to deliver between 80,000 and 90,000 new Model S and  Model X vehicles in 2016.  The announcement came with news at the company  posted a much worse than expected loss in its latest quarter.  Shares were  down more than 3 percent today to $143.67, but had a strong showing after  the bell on that guidance.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  A sharp drop in interest rates prompted more homeowners to  refinance their mortgages last week.  The Mortgage Bankers Association  reports that total application volume increased more than 9 percent.   Behind most of those gains: refinancings.  Not new purchases.  Purchase  apps are still 25 percent higher than they were a year ago.  </p><p> HERERA:  And a new trend is taking hold in housing.  Generations of  families are living under one roof.  Think \"Downton Abbey\".  </p><p> Americans have moved away from the model in the last century, of course,  but now, they're suddenly moving back, which opened up new doors, new  designs and new opportunities for the home builders.  </p><p> Diana Olick has this all in the family story.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Jennifer Michaels  never intended to live with her mother, Lucy Abbott.  </p><p> But when Michaels sold her house faster than she expected, she and her kids  needed somewhere to stay.  So, they went to grandma's.  </p><p> Much to all their surprise, they didn't hate it.  </p><p> JENNIFER MICHAELS, MOVED IN WITH MOM:  We decided it just was like the  perfect fit.  And we never left.  </p><p> LUCY ABBOTT, LIVES WITH DAUGHTER:  I enjoyed the life that the kids bring  to you when they're around you all the time, but we did have our  challenges.  </p><p> OLICK:  The challenge was not a bigger space, but separate spaces.  </p><p> ABBOTT:  I'm time traveler.  </p><p> OLICK:  Lucy likes the video games.  </p><p> ABBOTT:  I'm a gamer and I'm up until 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning.  And the  kids need their sleep.  </p><p> Oh, dear.  </p><p> OLICK:  So, mother and daughter decided to buy a next gen home by builder  Lennar (NYSE:LEN), a leader in this trend.  The home has two entrances,  separate kitchens, and living areas.  </p><p> MICHAELS:  I literally have gone three days without seeing her.  </p><p> OLICK:  Fourteen percent of all U.S. households, that's 16.5 million,  already live multi-generationally.  </p><p> JOHN BURNS, JOHN BURNS REAL ESTATE CONSULTING:  One of the reasons we've  seen so much immigration in the last 25 years and other cultures around the  world tend to live multi-generationally.  That's caused the numbers to  increase substantially.  </p><p> OLICK:  The recession also played a part, young adults were hit hardest in  the job market and some were unable to move out.  They're also delaying  marriage, which keeps them home longer.  </p><p> On the other end of the spectrum, baby boomers are retiring and downsizing.  </p><p> Burns surveyed 20,000 potential home buyers were surveyed and found nearly  half would like to accommodate their elderly parents in their next home and  almost as many want to live with their adult children.  </p><p> MICHAELS:  Not at all about the finances.  In fact, the house that we were  all living in, we're renting it out so we didn't even sell it to buy this  house.  It's more of a connection between the generations.  </p><p> ABBOTT:  Grandparents like me are more active.  You know, we do more  things.  We're healthier.  We live longer.  So, the relationships with  grown-up children can mature.  </p><p> OLICK:  And so, with the right floor plan -- </p><p> ABBOTT:  The light bulb went on.  </p><p> OLICK:  -- families that don't play together can still stay together.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Diana Olick in Washington.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MATHISEN:  Grandma the gamer.  Got to love that.  </p><p> All right.  Coming up, deep in the heart of Texas is the priciest ranch  ever sold to a sports mogul.  </p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> HERERA:  The owner of the NFL's Los Angeles Rams is now also the owner of a  massive Texas ranch and it's not his first land-buying rodeo.  </p><p> Jane Wells has more on the billionaire behind what's quite possibly the  most expensive ranch ever sold in the U.S.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> JANE WELLS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It's good to be rich,  but with the stock market seesawing and the outlook murky, where does a  multibillionaire put his money?  Real estate.  </p><p> STAN KROENKE, DEVELOPER MAGNATE:  It's great to be here today.  </p><p> WELLS:  That's exactly what this developer magnate Dan Kroenke has done.   Just a couple weeks ago, he announced approval to move his football team,  the Rams, back to Los Angeles, where he is financing a $2 billion state of  the art stadium on land he purchased in Inglewood.  </p><p> Now, Kroenke has bought an even bigger piece of property.  In fact, the  largest single ranch in the United States.  The Waggoner Ranch in Texas  covers six counties, 800 square miles, 535,000 acres.  It's bigger than Los  Angeles and New York City combined.  </p><p> The asking price was $750 million, actual purchase price unknown.  Now, the  ranch has cattle, oil, horses, farmland, and it's been owned by one family  since 1849.  </p><p> Now, the Waggoner heirs say they picked Kroenke because he promised to  preserve what's considered an American treasure, in other words, no  football stadium or team here.  </p><p> Kroenke is married to one of Sam Walton's daughters and together, Forbes  estimates they're worth over $12 billion.  They bought another large ranch  in Montana a few years ago, and now, with the Waggoner Ranch under his  belt, Stan Kroenke owns 1.4 million acres of American ranchland, making him  one of the top five private landowners in the country behind people like  John Malone and Ted Turner.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Jane Wells.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MATHISEN:  That's breathtaking.  Six counties.  </p><p> HERERA:  Six counties.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Wow.</p><p> HERERA:  Wow.  We'll keep track of that story for you.  </p><p> That does it for us tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Sue Herera.   Thanks for watching.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  And thanks from me as well.  I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Have a great  evening, everybody.  And we will see you right back here tomorrow night.  </p><p> END</p><p> Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

Cisco's  strong results show that old tech companies still have what it takes.   While new tech firm Twitter struggles to retain users.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Growing risks.  Federal  Reserve Chair Janet Yellen says the economy faces new challenges but she's  not ready to change course just yet.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MATHISEN:  And the hack attack at the IRS.  The two words taxpayers don't  want to hear as they prepare to file.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Wednesday,  February 10th.  </p><p>HERERA:  Good evening, everyone.  Welcome.  </p><p>Slowdown?  What slowdown?  After issuing a downbeat prediction for the most  recent quarter, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) reported profits well above what Wall  Street was expecting and it didn't stop there.  Cisco's outlook for the  current quarter was upbeat as well.  The Dow component increased its  dividend and added $15 billion to its buyback.  </p><p>The company earned 53 cents a share, 3 cents better than estimates.   Revenue for the quarter around $12 billion, a slight decline from a year  ago.  </p><p>As for the stock, shares took off initially after that report was released.   And the results come at a tough time for the tech sector.  </p><p>And as Josh Lipton explains, Cisco's report was being closely watched as a  proxy for business spending.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Tech has tanked with  the NASDAQ now down more than 10 percent so far this year, a big part of  the concern, the global economic slowdown means companies are spending less  on technology.  That's why tech investors were so interested to hear from  Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), which is seen as a barometer of corporate IT spending.  </p><p>SCOTT KESSLER, S&amp;P GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE:  It generated $49 billion in  revenue in its last fiscal year.  So, the bottom line is, it was very big,  it remains big, and its earnings report is important for folks that want an  updated view as to how the global economy and technology spending are  playing out for this kind of company.  </p><p>LIPTON:  We've already heard from two big tech names that set a challenging  global economy, and soft IT spending was impacting their business.  IBM's  CFO Martin Schroeter called the macro environment mixed, and Intel  (NASDAQ:INTC) CEO Brian Krzanich said macro weakness weighed on the chip  makers' results.  </p><p>The problem for many tech companies, though, is that global tech spending  is expected to grow at only a moderate pace.  Business and government  purchases of tech goods and services will only grow about 2 percent this  year according to Forrester, that's better than the 3 percent drop suffered  last year, but still represents a modest pace of expansion.  Analysts say a  rising U.S. dollar and weaker economic growth in China and Europe will  pressure spending in 2016.  </p><p>So, where does that leave tech investors?  There's a good chance that the  bad news is already priced in as S&amp;P's Kessler notes, many of these stocks  have already sold off.  Now, as a result, S&amp;P recommends investors buy  Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), IBM, and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Josh Lipton in San Francisco.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  From old tech to new -- Twitter which wants to attract more  users didn't.  The social media company's average monthly active users  stalled in the fourth quarter, disappointing those who were looking for  fresh signs of growth.  Twitter earned 16 cents a share and that was better  than expected.  Revenue is just about in line, $710 million, but it was up  strongly from a year ago.  </p><p>Now, the stock was volatile after hours initially falling sharply only to  rebound soon after.</p><p>Julia Boorstin has more now on Twitter's results.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Twitter's quarterly  report disappointing investors and sending the stock plummeting because of  one key fact.  Its users numbers actually declined from the third to fourth  quarter, which ended with 305 million monthly active users.  The number  excludes its SMS fast followers which use the service on more old-fashioned  feature phones.  </p><p>Though the company met revenue expectations and beat earnings projections,  it was the fact it's been unable to grow that Twitter user base that  weighed on the stock.  And the fact that it's Q-1 revenue guidance  disappointed expectations didn't help any.  Twitter saying in its letter to  shareholders that user trends are improving so far this year, and that  marketing efforts are paying, but that failed to reinsure investors.  </p><p>Back over to you.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Thank you very much, Julia.  </p><p>Rather confusing day on wall street trying to make sense of testimony from  Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen.  We'll have more on what she said a bit  later in our program.  </p><p>The Dow index gained 187 points mid-morning, but then those gains faded.   By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell nearly 100 points to  15,914.  The NASDAQ gained 14.  The S&amp;P 500 finished basically flat.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, the worst performing stock on the blue chip Dow index  today was Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) Company.  It reported record earnings as  we told you last night, but falling profit at its media unit dragged down  shares.  Separately, Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) shares were also lower, much  lower after reporting a bigger than expected drop in quarterly revenue and  disappointing results at some of its cable networks.  Shares of both closed  at multi-year lows.  </p><p>HERERA:  Tim Nollen joins us now to talk more about the ailing media  sector.  He is senior media analyst at Macquarie Securities.</p><p>Tim, welcome.  Nice to have you with us this evening.</p><p>TIM NOLLEN, MACQUARIE SECURITIES, SR. MEDIA ANALYST:  You're welcome.   Thank you.  </p><p>HERERA:  What about the market's response?  Disney's report was pretty  good.  Is the market overreacting to some of the concerns out there about  the media stocks?  </p><p>NOLLEN:  I think it's something of an overreaction for some of these names.   I think the justification is that the cord cutting fears are really  weighing now.  You know, Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) both  talked about subscriber declines for the basic TV bundle in the quarter  just reported.</p><p>Really everything else in both of their reports was fine.  Time Warner  (NYSE:TWX) actually met -- actually exceeded guidance and they raised  guidance for next year, but it was that one single point I think for both  of these companies that was the concern.  And it's a legitimate concern  because this has been the primary profit driver of these companies for a  long, long time.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  It's not just obviously, Tim, Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) or Disney  (NYSE:DIS) that was taken out to the woodshed.  It was Discovery, it was  Viacom (NYSE:VIA) most especially.  Talk to me about those two.  </p><p>NOLLEN:  Well, interestingly on Viacom (NYSE:VIA), you know, yesterday when  they reported, they actually reduced their guidance for affiliate fee  growth for the remainder of 2016, that was a high single digit growth  figure, it's now a mid to low single digit growth figure.  </p><p>And there are actually some reasons behind that which may make sense,  foreign exchange.  And they include OTT, SVOD sales to Netflix  (NASDAQ:NFLX) and the like in that figure.  So that may rebound actually  next year.  </p><p>Time Warner (NYSE:TWX), though, talked about 5 percent growth figure at  Turner in the quarter which is maybe just a little bit light, but they've  got double digit, they've got low teens growth in affiliate fees, into 2016  and 2017.  So, I think there is some legitimate anxiety, but, you know,  there is still growth.  Certainly maybe not as high as it was, but Time  Warner (NYSE:TWX) has some nice built-in growth.</p><p>And don't forget, we're talking about the traditional bundle that has been  under pressure, but there are some alternative options.  Disney (NYSE:DIS)  talked about skinny bundles like Sling TV.  Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) talked  about HBO Now, the OTT service which has 800,000 subscribers.  So, there  are some nice offsets there.  </p><p>It's companies like Viacom (NYSE:VIA) that don't have those options  available to them that are really suffering more.  </p><p>HERERA:  Tim, thank you very much for your insights.  </p><p>Tim Nollen with Macquarie Securities.</p><p>NOLLEN:  Thank you.</p><p>MATHISEN:  And to politics now, Carly Fiorina suspending her presidential  campaign after a seventh-place finish in last night's New Hampshire  primary.  Chris Christie will also drop out as well after he finished  sixth.  </p><p>The big winners, of course, were Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders as voters  showed their support for anti-establishment candidates.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Tonight, we serve  notice to the political and economic establishment of this country that the  American people will not continue to accept a corrupt campaign finance  system that is undermining American democracy and we will not accept a  rigged economy.  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE : We are going to make America  great again, but we're going to do it the old-fashioned way.  We're going  to beat China, Japan.  We're going to beat Mexico at trade.  We're going to  beat all of these countries that are taking so much of our money away from  us on a daily basis.  It's not going to happen anymore.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATHISEN:  John Harwood covering the story for us.  </p><p>John, welcome.  </p><p>You know, the other day I asked you when will we get down to the final  four?  I guess we're down to the final six right now.  Trump seemingly the  front-runner for the nomination.  Does he have the organization in some of  these next states to pull it off?  </p><p>JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  No, but I don't think  he's going to need the organization, Tyler.  We've seen the power of his  message is significant.  The attraction he has, especially to working class  voters in the Republican Party.  He's pretty powerful.  </p><p>Now, we go to South Carolina where we'll test whether the ideological  conservatism of Ted Cruz and the establishment credibility of Jeb Bush, you  know, brother of former president who's still got pretty good numbers down  there, and Marco Rubio is going to try to rebound.  John Kasich got a lift  out of New Hampshire, whether they can compete and slow him down.  </p><p>But he's got a big lead, and his prospects are pretty good at this point,  Tyler.  </p><p>HERERA:  Let's switch to Bernie Sanders, John.  Given the win that he just  had, is Hillary Clinton in trouble?  </p><p>HARWOOD:  She's in trouble, but not nearly as serious trouble as the rest  of the Republican field opposing Trump is.  Hillary Clinton remains a solid  favorite for the Democratic nomination.  The path for Bernie Sanders gets a  lot steeper as he gets to states where there are more African-American and  Latino voters who are favorable to Hillary Clinton, but he's definitely lit  a fire of enthusiasm.  </p><p>He will have a chance.  He'll have some money to test whether he can expand  that base of support.  The -- you have to say by history the odds are not  good, but can't count him out.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  He's attracting some money.  He's got a lot of the youth vote.   Let's talk about money in this campaign.  It has not translated into  advantage.  The two best-financed candidates, Bush and Clinton, are not  doing great.  </p><p>HARWOOD:  Exactly right.  And Donald Trump hasn't spent very much money.   It shows that his ability to get press coverage and favorable press  coverage, his celebrity, as well as his message, have overpowered the  influence of money in the race and the enthusiasm behind Bernie Sanders has  overpowered Hillary Clinton's money, although sanders has had enough to get  his own message out.  </p><p>You know, we've seen for some time, Tyler, the importance of television  advertising has been diminishing in the race has social media and other  avenues of information have proliferated, made it easier for campaigns to  reach voters in other ways.  This may be the campaign that kind of breaks  the idea that a big bank account is what gets you elected.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  All right.  John, thank you very much.  John Harwood reporting  tonight from Washington.  </p><p>HERERA:  Still ahead, does Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen see things in  the economy that others don't?  What she told lawmakers when testifying on  Capitol Hill today.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  The federal government reported a budget surplus of more than $55  billion in January.  The Treasury Department says that's an improvement  from a year ago and it was helped out by a timing quirk, $42 billion in  benefit checks were sent out in December because the regular payment period  fell on a weekend.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Fed chair Janet Yellen told Congress today that growth prospects  in the U.S. economy have fallen in recent weeks.  She walked a careful line  in the first of two days of semiannual testimony on Capitol Hill.  She  highlighted the strength of the labor market, but said financial and market  conditions, including overseas could restrain U.S. growth.  </p><p>Hampton Pearson reports.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JANET YELLEN, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIR:  Thank you.  </p><p>HAMPTON PEARSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Federal Reserve  Chair Janet Yellen told lawmakers continued global economic woes and market  volatility might force the Federal Reserve to slow the pace of future rate  hike but not right away.  </p><p>YELLEN:  I want to make clear that monetary policy is not on the preset  course, and so, our evaluation of the likely impact of those developments  on the economic outlook are in our ability to meet both our employment and  inflation objectives.  Those are the factors that will govern the future  stance of monetary policy.  </p><p>PEARSON:  The Fed's semiannual report to Congress raises concerns about  China's economic slowdown and weaker currency, the further decline in oil  prices and the strong dollar hurting U.S. exports.  </p><p>But the Fed chair told lawmakers strong hiring, rising wages, and more  consumer spending could help the U.S. economy weather the storm.  </p><p>YELLEN:  Ongoing employment gains and faster wage growth should support the  growth of real incomes and, therefore, consumer spending.  And global  economic growth should pick up over time supported by highly accommodative  monetary policies abroad.  </p><p>PEARSON:  But Yellen did admit monetary policymakers have at least studied  negative interest rates, which central banks in Japan and Europe have  recently used as a policy tool.  </p><p>REP. PATRICK MCHENRY (R), NORTH CAROLINA:  So, at this point, it's unclear  whether or not the fed does have legal authority to implement negative  rates.  </p><p>YELLEN:  I am not aware of any -- anything that would prevent us from doing  it, but I'm saying that we have not fully investigated the legal issues  that would -- that still needs to be done.  </p><p>PEARSON:  Day one of the Fed chair's congressional testimony ended with no  major surprises but also a concession that monetary policymakers are,  indeed, closely watching global economic developments.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Hampton Pearson in Washington.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  The National Retail Federation expects sales to grow a little bit  more than 3 percent this year.  That's higher than the ten-year average and  excludes automobiles, gas stations, and restaurants.  The industry group  cites a strengthening job market and steady consumer confidence and says  more spending will shift away from the mall.  Consumer spending accounts  for about 70 percent of all economic activity.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  The Supreme Court blocked the White House's clean power plan.   The justices put on hold rules that would curb carbon dioxide emissions  from coal-fired power plants.  The court decisions means the regulations  will not go into effect until an appeals court makes its ruling.  The White  House says it disagrees with the decision.  </p><p>HERERA:  Also in Washington, the Internal Revenue Service says identity  thieves hacked into their system.  Their goal was to steal your tax refund.  </p><p>Eamon Javers has more on the last thing any taxpayer wants to see during  tax season.  </p><p>Good to see you, Eamon.</p><p>EAMON JAVERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  Hi, Sue.</p><p>This is one of those ones where the IRS said they were able to nip it in  the bud.  They were able to stop this attack as it was happening.  But it  really reminds you of just what a huge target the IRS is for hackers around  the world.  So much financial information, so much personal on the servers  at the IRS, hackers really want to get in there and the IRS knows they're  under attack every single day.  </p><p>Here's what happened as far as we know in this latest incident which they  revealed last night.  They said thieves used previously stolen data to  generate what are called E-File PINs, those personal identifying numbers to  try to get in there and create and file returns.  </p><p>Now, what they said was this involved 464,000 Social Security numbers and  said the attack was halted and so, therefore, no data was lost.  Now, this  was similar to, but a little bit less serious to an attack that happened  last summer involving the \"get transcript\" feature of the IRS in which  people were trying to hack in and get returns and then use the data on  those returns to get bogus refunds.  </p><p>The IRS commissioner was on Capitol Hill today and he explained the  difference.  Take a listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN KOSKINEN, IRS COMMISSIONER:  I would note that both the get transcript  difficulty and the more recent attack in the last couple weeks both were  sophisticated forms of identity theft.  The criminals already had all of  the personal information of the taxpayer that they need.  None of those  attacks breached our system, itself.  They were not cyber breaches in the  sense that our database was accessed.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAVERS:  So, Sue, the key here is the IRS says they were able to stop this  one before any major damage was done.  </p><p>HERERA:  So, you explain what happened here, but what now happens to those  -- I think you said 400,000-plus people whose information is out there now?  </p><p>JAVERS:  Yes, that's right.  The IRS said those were people where the  hackers had stolen their information somewhere else and then were using it  at the IRS to try to generate these bogus returns.  What the IRS said  they're going to do is write letters to all these people telling them, hey,  you better pay attention, your information has been stolen, it is out there  on the black market, you might want to take cyber security steps to protect  yourself.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  As Butch said to Sundance, Sundance to Butch, who are these  guys?  </p><p>JAVERS:  That's one of the really good questions here.  A lot of people  think a lot of this is coming from Russia and Eastern Europe.  But  attributions in cyber security is so difficult, because they can use  computers, drone those computers can be in anywhere in the world.  Very  hard to tell sometimes.</p><p>HERERA:  All right, Eamon.  Thank you so much.</p><p>JAVERS:  You bet.</p><p>HERERA:  Eamon Javers in Washington.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  The health insurer Humana (NYSE:HUM) sees its quarterly profit  drop by nearly a third and that is where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".   The company attributed the steep loss to the cost of its medical insurance  plans under the Affordable Care Act, a bright spot, the insurer said its  2016 earnings will be above forecast.  </p><p>Last July, Humana (NYSE:HUM) agreed to be acquired by rival Aetna  (NYSE:AET) for $37 billion.  Shares of Humana (NYSE:HUM) up 1 percent to  $161.07.  </p><p>Owens Corning (NYSE:OC) (NYSE:GLW) saw its shares rise today after the  company increased its quarterly dividend by 6 percent and posted better  that expected quarterly profits.  The glass and roofing products maker also  issued an upbeat outlook for 2016 saying it sees continued growth in its  three main business segments.  Shares rose over 2.5 percent to $43 even.  </p><p>Fitbit which makes health and finance products you wear on your wrist saw  its shares bulk up after two prominent stakes in the company were revealed.   An SEC filing showed that Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff had taken a 5 percent  stake in the company.  On another filing disclosed, Vanguard Group now owns  a big 9 percent share.  Fitbit rose nearly 3 percent to $14.68.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) says it's received approval from European  regulators to buy rival Office Depot (NYSE:ODP), as long as those companies  dismantle all of Office Depot's European operations in an effort to ease  competition concerns.  The merger is valued at more than $6 billion.  </p><p>The deal still needs approval from the U.S. and from Canada.  U.S.  regulators have challenged that deal over concerns about competition.   Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) was up a penny to $8.41.  Office Depot (NYSE:ODP)  popped more than 2 percent to $5.03.  </p><p>Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is buying back up to $5 billion worth of its shares.   The new program would replace the $2 billion buyback the company issued in  2010.  Shares of the e-commerce giant rose initially in extended trading  after closing up more than a percent today to $490.48.  </p><p>And despite issuing a worse than expected loss for its latest quarter, the  automaker Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) saw its shares jump in after-hours  trading, strong deliveries and guidance for the year.  The reasons for the  stock move.  </p><p>Tesla said it expects to deliver between 80,000 and 90,000 new Model S and  Model X vehicles in 2016.  The announcement came with news at the company  posted a much worse than expected loss in its latest quarter.  Shares were  down more than 3 percent today to $143.67, but had a strong showing after  the bell on that guidance.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  A sharp drop in interest rates prompted more homeowners to  refinance their mortgages last week.  The Mortgage Bankers Association  reports that total application volume increased more than 9 percent.   Behind most of those gains: refinancings.  Not new purchases.  Purchase  apps are still 25 percent higher than they were a year ago.  </p><p>HERERA:  And a new trend is taking hold in housing.  Generations of  families are living under one roof.  Think \"Downton Abbey\".  </p><p>Americans have moved away from the model in the last century, of course,  but now, they're suddenly moving back, which opened up new doors, new  designs and new opportunities for the home builders.  </p><p>Diana Olick has this all in the family story.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Jennifer Michaels  never intended to live with her mother, Lucy Abbott.  </p><p>But when Michaels sold her house faster than she expected, she and her kids  needed somewhere to stay.  So, they went to grandma's.  </p><p>Much to all their surprise, they didn't hate it.  </p><p>JENNIFER MICHAELS, MOVED IN WITH MOM:  We decided it just was like the  perfect fit.  And we never left.  </p><p>LUCY ABBOTT, LIVES WITH DAUGHTER:  I enjoyed the life that the kids bring  to you when they're around you all the time, but we did have our  challenges.  </p><p>OLICK:  The challenge was not a bigger space, but separate spaces.  </p><p>ABBOTT:  I'm time traveler.  </p><p>OLICK:  Lucy likes the video games.  </p><p>ABBOTT:  I'm a gamer and I'm up until 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning.  And the  kids need their sleep.  </p><p>Oh, dear.  </p><p>OLICK:  So, mother and daughter decided to buy a next gen home by builder  Lennar (NYSE:LEN), a leader in this trend.  The home has two entrances,  separate kitchens, and living areas.  </p><p>MICHAELS:  I literally have gone three days without seeing her.  </p><p>OLICK:  Fourteen percent of all U.S. households, that's 16.5 million,  already live multi-generationally.  </p><p>JOHN BURNS, JOHN BURNS REAL ESTATE CONSULTING:  One of the reasons we've  seen so much immigration in the last 25 years and other cultures around the  world tend to live multi-generationally.  That's caused the numbers to  increase substantially.  </p><p>OLICK:  The recession also played a part, young adults were hit hardest in  the job market and some were unable to move out.  They're also delaying  marriage, which keeps them home longer.  </p><p>On the other end of the spectrum, baby boomers are retiring and downsizing.  </p><p>Burns surveyed 20,000 potential home buyers were surveyed and found nearly  half would like to accommodate their elderly parents in their next home and  almost as many want to live with their adult children.  </p><p>MICHAELS:  Not at all about the finances.  In fact, the house that we were  all living in, we're renting it out so we didn't even sell it to buy this  house.  It's more of a connection between the generations.  </p><p>ABBOTT:  Grandparents like me are more active.  You know, we do more  things.  We're healthier.  We live longer.  So, the relationships with  grown-up children can mature.  </p><p>OLICK:  And so, with the right floor plan -- </p><p>ABBOTT:  The light bulb went on.  </p><p>OLICK:  -- families that don't play together can still stay together.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Diana Olick in Washington.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Grandma the gamer.  Got to love that.  </p><p>All right.  Coming up, deep in the heart of Texas is the priciest ranch  ever sold to a sports mogul.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  The owner of the NFL's Los Angeles Rams is now also the owner of a  massive Texas ranch and it's not his first land-buying rodeo.  </p><p>Jane Wells has more on the billionaire behind what's quite possibly the  most expensive ranch ever sold in the U.S. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JANE WELLS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It's good to be rich,  but with the stock market seesawing and the outlook murky, where does a  multibillionaire put his money?  Real estate.  </p><p>STAN KROENKE, DEVELOPER MAGNATE:  It's great to be here today.  </p><p>WELLS:  That's exactly what this developer magnate Dan Kroenke has done.   Just a couple weeks ago, he announced approval to move his football team,  the Rams, back to Los Angeles, where he is financing a $2 billion state of  the art stadium on land he purchased in Inglewood.  </p><p>Now, Kroenke has bought an even bigger piece of property.  In fact, the  largest single ranch in the United States.  The Waggoner Ranch in Texas  covers six counties, 800 square miles, 535,000 acres.  It's bigger than Los  Angeles and New York City combined.  </p><p>The asking price was $750 million, actual purchase price unknown.  Now, the  ranch has cattle, oil, horses, farmland, and it's been owned by one family  since 1849.  </p><p>Now, the Waggoner heirs say they picked Kroenke because he promised to  preserve what's considered an American treasure, in other words, no  football stadium or team here.  </p><p>Kroenke is married to one of Sam Walton's daughters and together, Forbes  estimates they're worth over $12 billion.  They bought another large ranch  in Montana a few years ago, and now, with the Waggoner Ranch under his  belt, Stan Kroenke owns 1.4 million acres of American ranchland, making him  one of the top five private landowners in the country behind people like  John Malone and Ted Turner.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Jane Wells.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  That's breathtaking.  Six counties.  </p><p>HERERA:  Six counties.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Wow.</p><p>HERERA:  Wow.  We'll keep track of that story for you.  </p><p>That does it for us tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Sue Herera.   Thanks for watching.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  And thanks from me as well.  I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Have a great  evening, everybody.  And we will see you right back here tomorrow night.  </p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

The  NASDAQ is at its highest level since March 2000 -- just around the time the  dotcom boom went bust.  But today's index is a lot different.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Divorce in aisle 9.   After 16 years together, Costco ditches American Express -- and the stock  suffers a big blow.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  MATHISEN:  Economic ripple.  As Congress calls for a resolution, a new  report puts a number on the amount of economic activity tied to those West  Coast ports and it's big.  </p><p>  All that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday,  February 12th.  </p><p>  HERERA:  Good evening and welcome.  </p><p>  Stocks rally.  The S&amp;P closes in on a record.  The Dow Jones  Industrial Average sees a triple digit gain.  </p><p>  But we begin tonight with the NASDAQ, powered today by a 9 percent  move in Cisco, a deal in the online travel industry, and stocks like Nvidia  and, of course, Apple.  The index is now approaching that famous or  infamous level of 5,000.  </p><p>  The number is synonymous with the dotcom bubble that peaked 15 years  ago in March of 2000 and went bust fast.  </p><p>  But the technology sector is a lot different now than it was back  then.  </p><p>  Bertha Coombs takes a look.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   Health care tech firmInovalon's IPO at the NASDAQ market site today is  representative is what is fueling the new boom in the NASDAQ composite.  </p><p>  Investor appetite for new tech stocks helped push the index within 5  percent of its all time Internet bubble high in March 2000.  But at the  risk of sounding trite, analysts say this new tech boom is different.  </p><p>  ARI WALD, OPPENHEIMER:  In 2000, you had this parabolic move in the  NASDAQ that was following the tail end of this 15-year secular bull market  and now, on the other hand, it's been a much steadier healthy move into  5,000 on what we see as the -- you know, the early stages of a new secular  bull market.  </p><p>  COOMBS:  Among the biggest differences?  Biotechs are now the biggest  driver of gains up 35 percent in 2014 as companies like Gilead have brought  big drugs to markets.  </p><p>  Another big difference?  Tech valuations.  Microsoft, the biggest  weight in the NASDAQ 15 years ago, traded at 70 times earnings.  </p><p>  Today, Apple the biggest driver, is valued at 14 times its forward  earnings after posting the highest quarterly profits of all time.  </p><p>  ERIN GIBBS, S&amp;P CAPITAL IQ:  I see this as a change in that consumers  are spending more on tech versus enterprise.  Microsoft was mainly selling  to businesses.  Now, Apple is obviously a very consumer-focused company,  and we're all basically spending more money on our gadgets.  </p><p>  COOMBS:  While the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow industrials continue to set new  records, the NASDAQ composite has yet to take out that milestone, with big  tech stocks like Microsoft, Cisco and Intel well off their Internet bubble  highs.  </p><p>  Is the NASDAQ returned to 5,000 a reason for tech investors to take  pause?  </p><p>  WALD:  Given really the broad-based leadership that we're seeing  throughout the market, I think a breakout above 5,000 would only lead to  stronger gains for tech stocks.  </p><p>  GIBBS:  From a girl's (ph) perspective and fundamental perspective, I  don't see it being a top at any reason now.  </p><p>  COOMBS (on camera):  The number to watch on the NASDAQ, it's 5,048.   That was the closing high on March 10th, 2000.  The intraday high that day  was 5,138.  </p><p>  From the NASDAQ Market Site, Bertha Coombs, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  MATHISEN:  So, will it be old tech or new tech that gets the NASDAQ to  the next level?</p><p>  Let's ask Brian Blair.  He's managing director with Rosenblatt  Security.  </p><p>  Brian, welcome.  Good to have you with us.</p><p>  It was an interesting day today.  Cisco had a very nice day after its  earnings.  I called that old tech.  Tesla had a rough day after its  earnings.  I call that new tech.  </p><p>  It's too easy to write-off some of those old tech companies, isn't it?  </p><p>  BRIAN BLAIR, ROSENBLATT SECURITY:  It is.  You know, one of the  reasons is because they have large buckets of cash and they're throwing a  lot of money into R&amp;D and finding ways to grow and stay relevant now, and  the best ones are throwing money into what they believe will be the trends  of tomorrow.  </p><p>  But, yes, a lot of those companies, Cisco, Microsoft, still fighting  and staying relevant.  </p><p>  HERERA:  So, where do you find the most opportunity?  A lot of people  thought it would still be biotech this year, but we have seen some of the  biotech stock kind of roll over after massive IPOs last year.  </p><p>  BLAIR:  Right.</p><p>  HERERA:  Where do you still see opportunity?  </p><p>  BLAIR:  Yes, there's still a lot of opportunity in the mobile sector.   Smartphones are still only about 55 percent of the global handset market,  and so, if you think about the global market, there's still a lot of  opportunity to ride the wave of India getting the smartphone, the rest of  China getting 4G, you know, South America, Central America moving on to 4G  networks.  </p><p>  So, that's one big area and I think the Internet itself provides, you  know, a lot of opportunity.  I think there's only about 2.5 billion, maybe  less than half the world's population has Internet access so I think  there's still opportunity there as well.  I think for years to come.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  I don't know whether to call Apple old tech or new tech,  and I would just call it good tech.  As we look at the classic old tech  companies, the Intels, the IBMs, the Microsofts, the Ciscos, which of those  would you call the ones that are -- the Oracles even -- which would you  call the most vulnerable or unprepared for today's new world and which  would you call the ones that are best positioned?  </p><p>  BLAIR:  I think intel actually represents one that's very vulnerable  and I think one that represents in many ways old tech.  You know, if you  think about a lot of the most important trends in technology, a lot of them  related to mobile, to smartphones, to tablets, to wearables, which is a new  and emerging space, you don't see intel.  You really don't see Intel  anywhere.  And that's where a lot of the growth and the volume has been in  the last ten years and Intel has been virtually non-existent.  </p><p>  They've still sell into desktops.  They still sell into servers.  So,  they are still able to put up a nice quarterly number, but they're not  participating in the growth or where I think things are moving  directionally.  So, I would put them on the top of the vulnerability list  in terms of old tech.</p><p>  You know, IBM is another one that's been struggling.  We see them make  comments about investing in, you know, trying to be a part of big data, the  big data trend, cloud computing.  But we don't see it reflected in their  numbers.  And so, I would put those on the top two on the vulnerable list.  </p><p>  On the good list, you know, Microsoft I think is really impressing in  a lot of ways with the future not just in Xbox, but they're showing a new  virtual reality headset called HoloLens.  It's forward thinking.  I think,  you know, they're definitely looking ahead and they're definitely in front  of things.  I would separate them like that.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  All right.  Brian, thank you very much.  Appreciate the  answer.  Brian Blair with Rosenblatt Security.  </p><p>  BLAIR:  You bet.  </p><p>  HERERA:  One Dow component that wasn't up with the rest of the market  was American Express.  In fact, it was down quite a bit.  </p><p>  Shares lost more than 6 percent.  The Dow's worst performer today  after Costco said it would stop accepting American Express credit cards at  its U.S. stores.  </p><p>  Dominic Chu is joining us now with how important the relationship is  between Costco and AmEx.  </p><p>  DOMINIC CHU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It's huge and the  reason why AmEx said you can expect to see earnings and sales way down by  this relationship ending over the next couple of years because believe it  or not, the estimates are that about 8 percent of all spending on American  Express cards comes at Costco U.S. locations.  </p><p>  HERERA: Really?  That high?</p><p>  CHU:  That's how big -- that's how big it is.  </p><p>  And now, Costco is huge.  They sell a lot of stuff.  The National  Retail Federation says they're the world's second biggest retailer in terms  of total revenues.  They sell a lot of stuff.  And right now, over the past  16 years, the only ways you could pay out of Costco were cash, debit card  or an American Express, and then they linked the AmEx to their membership,  meaning that you could have an AmEx card linked to their membership, and  that's a reason why it's so huge.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  So, when will this -- they were negotiating, broken it off  apparently.  AmEx lost the deal with them.  When does the deal end and when  will that revenue stream stop for them?  </p><p>  CHU:  March of 2016.  So, you can continue to use your AmEx card until  March of 2016.  At that point, they're going to be look for a new  replacement.  Of course, the negotiations are ongoing between Costco, any  potential partners.  </p><p>  The big deal is AmEx's relationship in Canada with Costco ended this  past year as well.  They went with Capital One on a MasterCard basis.  So,  that's one of the things people look for. </p><p>  Who's going to replace AmEx?  Could it be Capital One?  Maybe it's  Discover.  Maybe it's another bank using a Visa or MasterCard payment  processer.  That's to be a big deal. </p><p>  HERERA:  All right.  Dom, thanks so much.  We appreciate it.  Dominic  Chu.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  Despite the fall in American Express, stocks did end the  day higher, helped by a cease-fire deal between Russia and Ukraine, along  with higher oil prices, all three major indexes ended in the black for the  day.  The Dow up 110 points, it finished at 17,972, just a few points shy  of 18,000.  NASDAQ up 56, the S&amp;P gained about 20.  </p><p>  HERERA:  And more now on that ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine.   It helped ease investor concerns since anymore trouble in that region could  weigh on Europe's economy.  But not all of those issues between the nations  were ironed out.  </p><p>  Julia Chatterly reports from Brussels.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  JULIA CHATTERLY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Cautious  optimism from E.U. leaders I think here, leaving this meeting about the  peace deal signed between the pro-Russian separatists, Russia and the  Ukraine.  I think the fact that the talks took 17 hours into the early  hours of this morning on two important points.  One, ultimately, they were  pretty tough negotiations and two, the desperation of the lead is behind  them just to get something signed today.  </p><p>  But the billion dollar question now become: will all sides abide by  the cease-fire agreement that begins at midnight on Sunday?  </p><p>  There's plenty of skepticism here behind the scenes given what we've  seen in the past and so that's the spotlight now falling firmly on Russia.  </p><p>  There were no talks here today about further sanctions, but I think  the message is that pressure will remain and that actions speak louder than  words.  We've left a lot of meetings bemoaning the fact that E.U. leaders  can't agree on further sanctions on Russia.  Perhaps that overshadowed and  offset today by the announcement of a collective $40 billion bailout for  Ukraine.</p><p>  But behind the scenes, no illusions of the difficulty of reforming a  country that is for all intents and purposes, at war. </p><p>  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Julia Chatterly in Brussels.</p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  MATHISEN:  Onto the rapidly changing situation in Greece.  Last night,  we told you about reports that an agreement in principle had been reached  between Greece and its eurozone creditors, but that quickly fell apart.  </p><p>  Michelle Caruso-Cabrera tells us now what went wrong and what might  come next.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  MICHELLE CARUSO-CABRERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It  was a night of high drama.  Many participants in yesterday's meeting  believed that they had reached a broad agreement in principle with Greece,  the details to be hammered out at another meeting this coming Monday.  But  at the last minute, Greek finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, refused to  sign the draft statement that they were supposed to release to the public  saying, he couldn't sign it after putting in a call to Athens.  </p><p>  Despite that high profile breakdown, Greek stocks moved higher today  anyway.  Market participants focusing on a leaked draft of what he was  supposed to sign and it showed that the Greeks made concessions that were  unexpected.  The draft statement referred to exploring, quote, \"the  possibility of extending and successfully concluding the present program.\"   That's something Greece previously said it would never do.  And it seems  the crucial step though in order to get continued support for their banks  from the European Central Bank.  </p><p>  Also adding to the optimism, a German newspaper reporting that the ECB  had agreed today to extend even more loans to Greek banks through an  emergency lending program.  In one way, this is bad news.  It shows that  the banks in Greece are still under stress.  </p><p>  On the other hand, market participants say it shows the ECB is still  willing to support the country.  All of Europe's finance ministers meet  again for another negotiating session on Monday.  That day will be key to  see if they can get a solid deal hammered out.  </p><p>  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Michelle Caruso-Cabrera.  </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  HERERA:  Still ahead, negotiations at the West Coast ports are  strained and now members of Congress say they're very concerned.</p><p>  (MUSIC)</p><p>  HERERA:  A big miss for retail sales for the second straight month.   Sales fell more than expected 0.8 percent in January.  Now, part of the  reason can be explained by the falling gas prices, which lowers receipts at  service stations.</p><p>  But as Steve Liesman reports, that's only part of the story.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  A disappointing  retail sales report for January sparking an economic mystery.  If Americans  are saving more on cheap gasoline, and making more because the nation added  a million jobs over the past three months, where's the money going?  Rather  than the half percent decline expected by Wall Street, the government said  spending in America shops fell nearly a full percentage point in January.  </p><p>  There was an expected 9 percent plunge in gasoline station sales, but  sales were also off at department stores, furniture outlets and auto  dealerships.  </p><p>  Did the extra green bucks just vaporize?  Well, that's not the most  likely explanation.  Rather, economists on the case theorize more money is  being saved and used to pay down debt.  A recent Visa report found  consumers hanging on to roughly half of gas savings.  </p><p>  Some of the money could be going to services which accounts for two- thirds of all consumer spending and is not counted in the retail goods  report.  Service spending would include increased spending on health  insurance.  </p><p>  But there's another solution to the mystery: inflation or in this  case, deflation.  The number reports are not adjusted for changes in  prices.  If prices fall, Americans could be buying the same stuff but just  spending less for it.  So, when the government reports inflation adjusted  or real spending when it calculates GDP, spending could show a gain.  </p><p>  Case solved?  Not quite.  Optimists aren't ready to assume consumers  won't spend the gas windfall and they think the real evidence will come in  the months ahead, when the mystery of the missing money is solved at cash  registers around the nation.</p><p>  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Steve Liesman in Dallas.  </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  MATHISEN:  A big threat to the economy is the slowdown at the West  Coast ports.  According to Guggenheim Securities, the L.A. Long Beach port  alone accounts for nearly 40 percent of country's containerized trade and  it's estimated that 12.5 percent of U.S. GDP tied to cargo moving through  those west coast ports.  </p><p>  As we told you last night, work has been suspended again, this time  for four days.  </p><p>  Jane Wells has more.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  JANE WELLS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  On  Thursday, more than 40 container ships were either anchored off the West  Coast or we're circling, waiting for anchorage space, as work loading and  offloading ships again came to a standstill.  </p><p>  ROBERT MCELLRATH, ILWU PRESIDENT:  Do not listen to PMA's (EXPLETIVE  DELETED).  Stay united.  </p><p>  WELLS:  That's how strained negotiations have become between shipping  lines and terminal operators against the union representing longshoremen.   With cargo backed up, the Pacific Maritime Association or PMA representing  employers, said there was no point in hiring crews TO work vessels,  especially since Thursday, Lincoln's birthday, would require higher pay, as  much as $92 an hour for the most senior foreman.  The same pay for this  weekend and Monday's President's Day.  So, no ship work either -- as the  PMA calls the congestion which it blames on dock workers, a strike with  pay.  </p><p>  STEVE GETZUG, PMA SPOKESMAN:  Every time we solve an issue that is  important, they layer on new demands.  The latest one we can't live with.  </p><p>  WELLS:  According to management, the demand it cannot live with is one  by dock workers to be able to unilaterally fire arbitrators.  While the  U.S. economy could suffer as goods take weeks longer than normal to move in  and out of the West Coast, Congress is worried.  </p><p>  REP.KURT SCHRADER (D), OREGON:  Well, this is clearly the greatest  threat our nation faces, notwithstanding the stuff that's going on  overseas.  </p><p>  WELLS:  There would need to be a complete strike or lockout for the  president to be able to force a cooling off period and reopen the ports  under the Taft-Hartley Act.  Work is supposed to continue moving containers  out of the yard and as for negotiations which started last may -- </p><p>  MCELLRATH:  We've been sitting here as I give this speech for five  days waiting for PMA and they haven't shown up yet.  </p><p>  WELLS (on camera):  The PMA says negotiations were resuming today and  the reason that it hasn't met with the union at all this week is because it  says there has been no point; that while management has offered  concessions, the dock workers, quote, \"won't budge.\"</p><p>  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Jane Wells at the port of Los Angeles.  </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  MATHISEN:  The impact of the slowdown is already being felt.   According to Goldman Sachs research, shippers have diverted cargo away from  the West Coast ports even at the expense of increased freight costs and  that's leading to a decline in intermodal volumes for companies like BNSF,  and Union Pacific.  Retailers are also rerouting shipments using air  freight and that is helping companies like FedEx and UPS.  </p><p>  HERERA:  We begin our \"Market Focus\" tonight with disappointing  results from AIG.</p><p>  The insurance giant saw its profit slide, hurt by weak performance in  its corporate category.  The company did announce a buy back about $2.5  billion worth of shares, which adds to the nearly $5 billion in stock that  it bought back last year.  It also declared a dividend of about 12 cents a  share that has a yield of about 1 percent.  </p><p>  After the bell, the shares were volatile.  Before the close, the stock  was up 20 cents to $52.45.</p><p>  It was the opposite story for CBS, which also reported after the  close.  The Tiffany network reported better-than-expected revenue on higher  ad sales, helped by Thursday night football and the ads for the midterm  elections.  That sent shares initially higher in after-hours trading.   Before the close, the shares were up nearly 2 percent to $57.77.</p><p>  Inflation in Brazil and a stronger dollar took a bite out of Avon's  overseas revenue.  The cosmetics maker's results missed analysts' estimates  on both the top and bottom lines.  The company said those currency  fluctuations will continue to weigh on performance this year, as it does  most of its business outside the U.S.  But Avon also told investors it  expects its North American business to turn profitable for the first time  in three years.  Shares rose more than 1 percent to $8.69.</p><p>  MATHISEN:  Kellogg still has the breakfast blues.  The Corn Flakes  maker posted a big quarterly loss and cut its forecast for long-term annual  revenue growth, as cereal sales continue to be quite sluggish.  Shares fell  4.5 percent to $63.30.</p><p>  Apache also posted a quarterly loss as it wrote down the value of its  oil and gas assets.  Revenue lower than expectations also, and it announced  it is slashing its rig count by more than a third in response to crumbling  crude prices.  The stock was down slightly to $64.58.</p><p>  And Time Inc. gave investors a weak sales outlook for 2015, which  weighed on shares in today's trade.  This as the publisher of magazines  like People and Sports Illustrated reported a lower-than-expected quarterly  profit, as it has been dealing with falling circulation and advertising  revenue.  Shares off almost 2 percent.  They settled at $24.49.</p><p>  HERERA:  Expedia is on a shopping spree.  Its latest acquisition,  Orbitz, just a few weeks after buying Travelocity.  The deal is valued at  more than a billion dollars take on bigger rival Priceline.  Orbitz soared  on the news as did Expedia. </p><p>  Simon Hobbs takes a look at how this deal changes the global online  travel industry.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  SIMON HOBBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   Orbitz is one of the smallest online travel industries and would have  struggled in the future against the growing market power of giant rivals  Expedia and Priceline, who spent billions on advertising a new technology.  </p><p>  So, as the saying goes, if you can't beat them, join them.  Expedia  already boasts 13 major brands.  For $1.6 billion in cash, Expedia CEO Dara  Khosrowshahi can now add the Orbitz brands the Orbitz's own CheapTickets,  ebookers and HotelClub.  Those four, he says, will be much more profitable  once he's cut $75 million in cost and gives them access to Expedia's big  stockpile of hotel rooms for sale.  </p><p>  DARA KHOSROWSHAHI, EXPEDIA CEO:  We've got one of the broadest global  inventories out there and we think that the complement to the Orbitz  loyalty program, the bank program that Orbitz has.  We think that's going  to be a terrific combination.  </p><p>  HOBBS (on camera):  The CEO of his target at Orbitz, Barney Harford,  is well-respected.  Over the last two years, he's reinvigorated the  business with better technology and a private label business essentially  running the back office for ad hoc sites like AmEx Travel, but ultimately  without the power of Expedia and Priceline to fit in real time for your  online business, he went for a trade sale.  </p><p>  BARNEY HARFORD, ORBITZ CEO:  People may have tried to write us off in  the past, but I think they can see the continued ongoing growth really  showing through.  </p><p>  HOBBS (voice-over):  It was what remains of Travelocity, that Expedia  bought three weeks ago for $280 million.  Trivago cost Expedia well over  $600 million, but rival Priceline deal's are even bigger.  OpenTable for  $2.4 billion and Kayak for $1.7 billion.  </p><p>  Despite the consolidation, Dara Khosrowshahi rejects the idea that  there's a lack of competition or that the regulators should get involved.  </p><p>  KHOSROWSHAHI:  We compete in a much larger segment in general and  there's lots and lots of competition for that top audience.  </p><p>  HOBBS:  And for travelers shopping online, the CEO of Expedia promises  that all 17 major brands will operate with an independence that ensures  there's still a deal to be had even if they're still all owned by the same  company.  </p><p>  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Simon Hobbs at the New York Stock  Exchange.</p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  MATHISEN:  Coming up, what some local florists are doing to keep  businesses from wilting as competition increases and Valentine's Day  approaches.  </p><p>  (MUSIC)</p><p>  HERERA: Business is blooming for the flower industry but not  necessarily for your local florists.  Increased competition in online  delivery companies are pinching many small business owners.  </p><p>  But as Kate Rogers reports, some old-fashioned mom and pop shops are  finding an edge in order to battle back.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  KATE ROGERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  This  year, more than $2 billion will be spent on flowers for Valentine's Day  alone.  But local florists like Caldwell Flowerland in New Jersey are  seeing increased competition and in some cases losses.  That's because of  big e-commerce players like 1-800-Flowers, FTD and ProFlowers.  </p><p>  In fact, local florists saw their revenue slide nearly 40 percent last  year, according to IBIS, a market research group.  </p><p>  Flowerland, in business 30 years, has also seen its revenue fall.  But  owner Frank Dellisanti says there's a silver lining.  </p><p>  FRANK DELLISANTI, CALDWELL FLOWERLAND OWNER:  It took a little dip,  but it also educated customers where to come back to.  So, it also weeded  out other competitors, too.  </p><p>  ROGERS:  Any way you spin it, there are more options than ever, a new  crop of start-ups are blooming in the flower delivery space.  Angel List  names 30 of them, including Urban Stems and Bloom That, which delivered  bouquets on demand within an hour or so.  Even Whole Foods is getting in on  the action, partnering with grocery delivery start-up Instacart in three  cities.</p><p>  And then, there are the supermarkets and big box stores like Walmart.   Analysts say they could be more detrimental to local florists than  ecommerce.  Dellisanti said he has one thing on the action partnering with  grocery delivery start-up Instacart in 15 cities.  </p><p>  And then, there are these supermarkets and big box stores like  Walmart.  Analysts say they could be more detrimental to local florists  than ecommerce.  </p><p>  Dellisanti says he has one thing, though, that big box stores are  missing: a personal touch.  </p><p>  DELLISANTI:  Yes, we try to keep a year round price and then we try to  keep the consistency and quality.  </p><p>  ROGERS (on camera):  Business here at Flowerland is still pretty good.   In fact, they'll sell about 10,000 of these roses over the Valentine's Day  holiday weekend this year.  But increased competition from other ecommerce  players in the space has hurt other local florists around the country some  of whom have had to close their doors for good.  </p><p>  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Kate Rogers in Caldwell, New Jersey.  </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  MATHISEN:  Kate got the rose from the bachelor.  </p><p>  Finally tonight, three people to fight the odds and one, the $564  million Powerball jackpot.  Two of them are not sitting here tonight.  The  tickets told in Texas, North Carolina, and Puerto Rico.  That's the first  winning Powerball ticket ever sold outside of the continental United  States.</p><p>  If the winners choose the lump sum, the three would split $381 million  before taxes.  </p><p>  We're both here, Sue.  </p><p>  HERERA:  I know, which means we didn't win, but if you're watching,  you probably didn't either.  So, come back here tomorrow night, right?  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  That's right.  We'll see you back here. </p><p>  You're having a couple of days off.  I'll see you when you get back.</p><p>  HERERA:  OK, thanks.</p><p>  That's it for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Sue Herera.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  And I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Have a great evening.  We'll see  you back here tomorrow.</p><p> END</p><p> Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

The NASDAQ is at its highest level since March 2000 -- just around the time the dotcom boom went bust. But today`s index is a lot different.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Divorce in aisle 9. After 16 years together, Costco ditches American Express -- and the stock suffers a big blow.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MATHISEN: Economic ripple. As Congress calls for a resolution, a new report puts a number on the amount of economic activity tied to those West Coast ports and it`s big.</p><p>All that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday, February 12th.</p><p>HERERA: Good evening and welcome.</p><p>Stocks rally. The S&amp;P closes in on a record. The Dow Jones Industrial Average sees a triple digit gain.</p><p>But we begin tonight with the NASDAQ, powered today by a 9 percent move in Cisco, a deal in the online travel industry, and stocks like Nvidia and, of course, Apple. The index is now approaching that famous or infamous level of 5,000.</p><p>The number is synonymous with the dotcom bubble that peaked 15 years ago in March of 2000 and went bust fast.</p><p>But the technology sector is a lot different now than it was back then.</p><p>Bertha Coombs takes a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Health care tech firmInovalon`s IPO at the NASDAQ market site today is representative is what is fueling the new boom in the NASDAQ composite.</p><p>Investor appetite for new tech stocks helped push the index within 5 percent of its all time Internet bubble high in March 2000. But at the risk of sounding trite, analysts say this new tech boom is different.</p><p>ARI WALD, OPPENHEIMER: In 2000, you had this parabolic move in the NASDAQ that was following the tail end of this 15-year secular bull market and now, on the other hand, it`s been a much steadier healthy move into 5,000 on what we see as the -- you know, the early stages of a new secular bull market.</p><p>COOMBS: Among the biggest differences? Biotechs are now the biggest driver of gains up 35 percent in 2014 as companies like Gilead have brought big drugs to markets.</p><p>Another big difference? Tech valuations. Microsoft, the biggest weight in the NASDAQ 15 years ago, traded at 70 times earnings.</p><p>Today, Apple the biggest driver, is valued at 14 times its forward earnings after posting the highest quarterly profits of all time.</p><p>ERIN GIBBS, S&amp;P CAPITAL IQ: I see this as a change in that consumers are spending more on tech versus enterprise. Microsoft was mainly selling to businesses. Now, Apple is obviously a very consumer-focused company, and we`re all basically spending more money on our gadgets.</p><p>COOMBS: While the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow industrials continue to set new records, the NASDAQ composite has yet to take out that milestone, with big tech stocks like Microsoft, Cisco and Intel well off their Internet bubble highs.</p><p>Is the NASDAQ returned to 5,000 a reason for tech investors to take pause?</p><p>WALD: Given really the broad-based leadership that we`re seeing throughout the market, I think a breakout above 5,000 would only lead to stronger gains for tech stocks.</p><p>GIBBS: From a girl`s (ph) perspective and fundamental perspective, I don`t see it being a top at any reason now.</p><p>COOMBS (on camera): The number to watch on the NASDAQ, it`s 5,048. That was the closing high on March 10th, 2000. The intraday high that day was 5,138.</p><p>From the NASDAQ Market Site, Bertha Coombs, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: So, will it be old tech or new tech that gets the NASDAQ to the next level?</p><p>Let`s ask Brian Blair. He`s managing director with Rosenblatt Security.</p><p>Brian, welcome. Good to have you with us.</p><p>It was an interesting day today. Cisco had a very nice day after its earnings. I called that old tech. Tesla had a rough day after its earnings. I call that new tech.</p><p>It`s too easy to write-off some of those old tech companies, isn`t it?</p><p>BRIAN BLAIR, ROSENBLATT SECURITY: It is. You know, one of the reasons is because they have large buckets of cash and they`re throwing a lot of money into R&amp;D and finding ways to grow and stay relevant now, and the best ones are throwing money into what they believe will be the trends of tomorrow.</p><p>But, yes, a lot of those companies, Cisco, Microsoft, still fighting and staying relevant.</p><p>HERERA: So, where do you find the most opportunity? A lot of people thought it would still be biotech this year, but we have seen some of the biotech stock kind of roll over after massive IPOs last year.</p><p>BLAIR: Right.</p><p>HERERA: Where do you still see opportunity?</p><p>BLAIR: Yes, there`s still a lot of opportunity in the mobile sector. Smartphones are still only about 55 percent of the global handset market, and so, if you think about the global market, there`s still a lot of opportunity to ride the wave of India getting the smartphone, the rest of China getting 4G, you know, South America, Central America moving on to 4G networks.</p><p>So, that`s one big area and I think the Internet itself provides, you know, a lot of opportunity. I think there`s only about 2.5 billion, maybe less than half the world`s population has Internet access so I think there`s still opportunity there as well. I think for years to come.</p><p>MATHISEN: I don`t know whether to call Apple old tech or new tech, and I would just call it good tech. As we look at the classic old tech companies, the Intels, the IBMs, the Microsofts, the Ciscos, which of those would you call the ones that are -- the Oracles even -- which would you call the most vulnerable or unprepared for today`s new world and which would you call the ones that are best positioned?</p><p>BLAIR: I think intel actually represents one that`s very vulnerable and I think one that represents in many ways old tech. You know, if you think about a lot of the most important trends in technology, a lot of them related to mobile, to smartphones, to tablets, to wearables, which is a new and emerging space, you don`t see intel. You really don`t see Intel anywhere. And that`s where a lot of the growth and the volume has been in the last ten years and Intel has been virtually non-existent.</p><p>They`ve still sell into desktops. They still sell into servers. So, they are still able to put up a nice quarterly number, but they`re not participating in the growth or where I think things are moving directionally. So, I would put them on the top of the vulnerability list in terms of old tech.</p><p>You know, IBM is another one that`s been struggling. We see them make comments about investing in, you know, trying to be a part of big data, the big data trend, cloud computing. But we don`t see it reflected in their numbers. And so, I would put those on the top two on the vulnerable list.</p><p>On the good list, you know, Microsoft I think is really impressing in a lot of ways with the future not just in Xbox, but they`re showing a new virtual reality headset called HoloLens. It`s forward thinking. I think, you know, they`re definitely looking ahead and they`re definitely in front of things. I would separate them like that.</p><p>MATHISEN: All right. Brian, thank you very much. Appreciate the answer. Brian Blair with Rosenblatt Security.</p><p>BLAIR: You bet.</p><p>HERERA: One Dow component that wasn`t up with the rest of the market was American Express. In fact, it was down quite a bit.</p><p>Shares lost more than 6 percent. The Dow`s worst performer today after Costco said it would stop accepting American Express credit cards at its U.S. stores.</p><p>Dominic Chu is joining us now with how important the relationship is between Costco and AmEx.</p><p>DOMINIC CHU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: It`s huge and the reason why AmEx said you can expect to see earnings and sales way down by this relationship ending over the next couple of years because believe it or not, the estimates are that about 8 percent of all spending on American Express cards comes at Costco U.S. locations.</p><p>HERERA: Really? That high?</p><p>CHU: That`s how big -- that`s how big it is.</p><p>And now, Costco is huge. They sell a lot of stuff. The National Retail Federation says they`re the world`s second biggest retailer in terms of total revenues. They sell a lot of stuff. And right now, over the past 16 years, the only ways you could pay out of Costco were cash, debit card or an American Express, and then they linked the AmEx to their membership, meaning that you could have an AmEx card linked to their membership, and that`s a reason why it`s so huge.</p><p>MATHISEN: So, when will this -- they were negotiating, broken it off apparently. AmEx lost the deal with them. When does the deal end and when will that revenue stream stop for them?</p><p>CHU: March of 2016. So, you can continue to use your AmEx card until March of 2016. At that point, they`re going to be look for a new replacement. Of course, the negotiations are ongoing between Costco, any potential partners.</p><p>The big deal is AmEx`s relationship in Canada with Costco ended this past year as well. They went with Capital One on a MasterCard basis. So, that`s one of the things people look for.</p><p>Who`s going to replace AmEx? Could it be Capital One? Maybe it`s Discover. Maybe it`s another bank using a Visa or MasterCard payment processer. That`s to be a big deal.</p><p>HERERA: All right. Dom, thanks so much. We appreciate it. Dominic Chu.</p><p>MATHISEN: Despite the fall in American Express, stocks did end the day higher, helped by a cease-fire deal between Russia and Ukraine, along with higher oil prices, all three major indexes ended in the black for the day. The Dow up 110 points, it finished at 17,972, just a few points shy of 18,000. NASDAQ up 56, the S&amp;P gained about 20.</p><p>HERERA: And more now on that ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine. It helped ease investor concerns since anymore trouble in that region could weigh on Europe`s economy. But not all of those issues between the nations were ironed out.</p><p>Julia Chatterly reports from Brussels.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA CHATTERLY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Cautious optimism from E.U. leaders I think here, leaving this meeting about the peace deal signed between the pro-Russian separatists, Russia and the Ukraine. I think the fact that the talks took 17 hours into the early hours of this morning on two important points. One, ultimately, they were pretty tough negotiations and two, the desperation of the lead is behind them just to get something signed today.</p><p>But the billion dollar question now become: will all sides abide by the cease-fire agreement that begins at midnight on Sunday?</p><p>There`s plenty of skepticism here behind the scenes given what we`ve seen in the past and so that`s the spotlight now falling firmly on Russia.</p><p>There were no talks here today about further sanctions, but I think the message is that pressure will remain and that actions speak louder than words. We`ve left a lot of meetings bemoaning the fact that E.U. leaders can`t agree on further sanctions on Russia. Perhaps that overshadowed and offset today by the announcement of a collective $40 billion bailout for Ukraine.</p><p>But behind the scenes, no illusions of the difficulty of reforming a country that is for all intents and purposes, at war.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Chatterly in Brussels.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Onto the rapidly changing situation in Greece. Last night, we told you about reports that an agreement in principle had been reached between Greece and its eurozone creditors, but that quickly fell apart.</p><p>Michelle Caruso-Cabrera tells us now what went wrong and what might come next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MICHELLE CARUSO-CABRERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: It was a night of high drama. Many participants in yesterday`s meeting believed that they had reached a broad agreement in principle with Greece, the details to be hammered out at another meeting this coming Monday. But at the last minute, Greek finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, refused to sign the draft statement that they were supposed to release to the public saying, he couldn`t sign it after putting in a call to Athens.</p><p>Despite that high profile breakdown, Greek stocks moved higher today anyway. Market participants focusing on a leaked draft of what he was supposed to sign and it showed that the Greeks made concessions that were unexpected. The draft statement referred to exploring, quote, \"the possibility of extending and successfully concluding the present program.\" That`s something Greece previously said it would never do. And it seems the crucial step though in order to get continued support for their banks from the European Central Bank.</p><p>Also adding to the optimism, a German newspaper reporting that the ECB had agreed today to extend even more loans to Greek banks through an emergency lending program. In one way, this is bad news. It shows that the banks in Greece are still under stress.</p><p>On the other hand, market participants say it shows the ECB is still willing to support the country. All of Europe`s finance ministers meet again for another negotiating session on Monday. That day will be key to see if they can get a solid deal hammered out.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Michelle Caruso-Cabrera.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Still ahead, negotiations at the West Coast ports are strained and now members of Congress say they`re very concerned.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: A big miss for retail sales for the second straight month. Sales fell more than expected 0.8 percent in January. Now, part of the reason can be explained by the falling gas prices, which lowers receipts at service stations.</p><p>But as Steve Liesman reports, that`s only part of the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: A disappointing retail sales report for January sparking an economic mystery. If Americans are saving more on cheap gasoline, and making more because the nation added a million jobs over the past three months, where`s the money going? Rather than the half percent decline expected by Wall Street, the government said spending in America shops fell nearly a full percentage point in January.</p><p>There was an expected 9 percent plunge in gasoline station sales, but sales were also off at department stores, furniture outlets and auto dealerships.</p><p>Did the extra green bucks just vaporize? Well, that`s not the most likely explanation. Rather, economists on the case theorize more money is being saved and used to pay down debt. A recent Visa report found consumers hanging on to roughly half of gas savings.</p><p>Some of the money could be going to services which accounts for two- thirds of all consumer spending and is not counted in the retail goods report. Service spending would include increased spending on health insurance.</p><p>But there`s another solution to the mystery: inflation or in this case, deflation. The number reports are not adjusted for changes in prices. If prices fall, Americans could be buying the same stuff but just spending less for it. So, when the government reports inflation adjusted or real spending when it calculates GDP, spending could show a gain.</p><p>Case solved? Not quite. Optimists aren`t ready to assume consumers won`t spend the gas windfall and they think the real evidence will come in the months ahead, when the mystery of the missing money is solved at cash registers around the nation.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman in Dallas.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: A big threat to the economy is the slowdown at the West Coast ports. According to Guggenheim Securities, the L.A. Long Beach port alone accounts for nearly 40 percent of country`s containerized trade and it`s estimated that 12.5 percent of U.S. GDP tied to cargo moving through those west coast ports.</p><p>As we told you last night, work has been suspended again, this time for four days.</p><p>Jane Wells has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JANE WELLS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): On Thursday, more than 40 container ships were either anchored off the West Coast or we`re circling, waiting for anchorage space, as work loading and offloading ships again came to a standstill.</p><p>ROBERT MCELLRATH, ILWU PRESIDENT: Do not listen to PMA`s (EXPLETIVE DELETED). Stay united.</p><p>WELLS: That`s how strained negotiations have become between shipping lines and terminal operators against the union representing longshoremen. With cargo backed up, the Pacific Maritime Association or PMA representing employers, said there was no point in hiring crews TO work vessels, especially since Thursday, Lincoln`s birthday, would require higher pay, as much as $92 an hour for the most senior foreman. The same pay for this weekend and Monday`s President`s Day. So, no ship work either -- as the PMA calls the congestion which it blames on dock workers, a strike with pay.</p><p>STEVE GETZUG, PMA SPOKESMAN: Every time we solve an issue that is important, they layer on new demands. The latest one we can`t live with.</p><p>WELLS: According to management, the demand it cannot live with is one by dock workers to be able to unilaterally fire arbitrators. While the U.S. economy could suffer as goods take weeks longer than normal to move in and out of the West Coast, Congress is worried.</p><p>REP.KURT SCHRADER (D), OREGON: Well, this is clearly the greatest threat our nation faces, notwithstanding the stuff that`s going on overseas.</p><p>WELLS: There would need to be a complete strike or lockout for the president to be able to force a cooling off period and reopen the ports under the Taft-Hartley Act. Work is supposed to continue moving containers out of the yard and as for negotiations which started last may --</p><p>MCELLRATH: We`ve been sitting here as I give this speech for five days waiting for PMA and they haven`t shown up yet.</p><p>WELLS (on camera): The PMA says negotiations were resuming today and the reason that it hasn`t met with the union at all this week is because it says there has been no point; that while management has offered concessions, the dock workers, quote, \"won`t budge.\"</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Jane Wells at the port of Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: The impact of the slowdown is already being felt. According to Goldman Sachs research, shippers have diverted cargo away from the West Coast ports even at the expense of increased freight costs and that`s leading to a decline in intermodal volumes for companies like BNSF, and Union Pacific. Retailers are also rerouting shipments using air freight and that is helping companies like FedEx and UPS.</p><p>HERERA: We begin our \"Market Focus\" tonight with disappointing results from AIG.</p><p>The insurance giant saw its profit slide, hurt by weak performance in its corporate category. The company did announce a buy back about $2.5 billion worth of shares, which adds to the nearly $5 billion in stock that it bought back last year. It also declared a dividend of about 12 cents a share that has a yield of about 1 percent.</p><p>After the bell, the shares were volatile. Before the close, the stock was up 20 cents to $52.45.</p><p>It was the opposite story for CBS, which also reported after the close. The Tiffany network reported better-than-expected revenue on higher ad sales, helped by Thursday night football and the ads for the midterm elections. That sent shares initially higher in after-hours trading. Before the close, the shares were up nearly 2 percent to $57.77.</p><p>Inflation in Brazil and a stronger dollar took a bite out of Avon`s overseas revenue. The cosmetics maker`s results missed analysts` estimates on both the top and bottom lines. The company said those currency fluctuations will continue to weigh on performance this year, as it does most of its business outside the U.S. But Avon also told investors it expects its North American business to turn profitable for the first time in three years. Shares rose more than 1 percent to $8.69.</p><p>MATHISEN: Kellogg still has the breakfast blues. The Corn Flakes maker posted a big quarterly loss and cut its forecast for long-term annual revenue growth, as cereal sales continue to be quite sluggish. Shares fell 4.5 percent to $63.30.</p><p>Apache also posted a quarterly loss as it wrote down the value of its oil and gas assets. Revenue lower than expectations also, and it announced it is slashing its rig count by more than a third in response to crumbling crude prices. The stock was down slightly to $64.58.</p><p>And Time Inc. gave investors a weak sales outlook for 2015, which weighed on shares in today`s trade. This as the publisher of magazines like People and Sports Illustrated reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit, as it has been dealing with falling circulation and advertising revenue. Shares off almost 2 percent. They settled at $24.49.</p><p>HERERA: Expedia is on a shopping spree. Its latest acquisition, Orbitz, just a few weeks after buying Travelocity. The deal is valued at more than a billion dollars take on bigger rival Priceline. Orbitz soared on the news as did Expedia.</p><p>Simon Hobbs takes a look at how this deal changes the global online travel industry.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SIMON HOBBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Orbitz is one of the smallest online travel industries and would have struggled in the future against the growing market power of giant rivals Expedia and Priceline, who spent billions on advertising a new technology.</p><p>So, as the saying goes, if you can`t beat them, join them. Expedia already boasts 13 major brands. For $1.6 billion in cash, Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshahi can now add the Orbitz brands the Orbitz`s own CheapTickets, ebookers and HotelClub. Those four, he says, will be much more profitable once he`s cut $75 million in cost and gives them access to Expedia`s big stockpile of hotel rooms for sale.</p><p>DARA KHOSROWSHAHI, EXPEDIA CEO: We`ve got one of the broadest global inventories out there and we think that the complement to the Orbitz loyalty program, the bank program that Orbitz has. We think that`s going to be a terrific combination.</p><p>HOBBS (on camera): The CEO of his target at Orbitz, Barney Harford, is well-respected. Over the last two years, he`s reinvigorated the business with better technology and a private label business essentially running the back office for ad hoc sites like AmEx Travel, but ultimately without the power of Expedia and Priceline to fit in real time for your online business, he went for a trade sale.</p><p>BARNEY HARFORD, ORBITZ CEO: People may have tried to write us off in the past, but I think they can see the continued ongoing growth really showing through.</p><p>HOBBS (voice-over): It was what remains of Travelocity, that Expedia bought three weeks ago for $280 million. Trivago cost Expedia well over $600 million, but rival Priceline deal`s are even bigger. OpenTable for $2.4 billion and Kayak for $1.7 billion.</p><p>Despite the consolidation, Dara Khosrowshahi rejects the idea that there`s a lack of competition or that the regulators should get involved.</p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI: We compete in a much larger segment in general and there`s lots and lots of competition for that top audience.</p><p>HOBBS: And for travelers shopping online, the CEO of Expedia promises that all 17 major brands will operate with an independence that ensures there`s still a deal to be had even if they`re still all owned by the same company.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Simon Hobbs at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Coming up, what some local florists are doing to keep businesses from wilting as competition increases and Valentine`s Day approaches.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: Business is blooming for the flower industry but not necessarily for your local florists. Increased competition in online delivery companies are pinching many small business owners.</p><p>But as Kate Rogers reports, some old-fashioned mom and pop shops are finding an edge in order to battle back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KATE ROGERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This year, more than $2 billion will be spent on flowers for Valentine`s Day alone. But local florists like Caldwell Flowerland in New Jersey are seeing increased competition and in some cases losses. That`s because of big e-commerce players like 1-800-Flowers, FTD and ProFlowers.</p><p>In fact, local florists saw their revenue slide nearly 40 percent last year, according to IBIS, a market research group.</p><p>Flowerland, in business 30 years, has also seen its revenue fall. But owner Frank Dellisanti says there`s a silver lining.</p><p>FRANK DELLISANTI, CALDWELL FLOWERLAND OWNER: It took a little dip, but it also educated customers where to come back to. So, it also weeded out other competitors, too.</p><p>ROGERS: Any way you spin it, there are more options than ever, a new crop of start-ups are blooming in the flower delivery space. Angel List names 30 of them, including Urban Stems and Bloom That, which delivered bouquets on demand within an hour or so. Even Whole Foods is getting in on the action, partnering with grocery delivery start-up Instacart in three cities.</p><p>And then, there are the supermarkets and big box stores like Walmart. Analysts say they could be more detrimental to local florists than ecommerce. Dellisanti said he has one thing on the action partnering with grocery delivery start-up Instacart in 15 cities.</p><p>And then, there are these supermarkets and big box stores like Walmart. Analysts say they could be more detrimental to local florists than ecommerce.</p><p>Dellisanti says he has one thing, though, that big box stores are missing: a personal touch.</p><p>DELLISANTI: Yes, we try to keep a year round price and then we try to keep the consistency and quality.</p><p>ROGERS (on camera): Business here at Flowerland is still pretty good. In fact, they`ll sell about 10,000 of these roses over the Valentine`s Day holiday weekend this year. But increased competition from other ecommerce players in the space has hurt other local florists around the country some of whom have had to close their doors for good.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Kate Rogers in Caldwell, New Jersey.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Kate got the rose from the bachelor.</p><p>Finally tonight, three people to fight the odds and one, the $564 million Powerball jackpot. Two of them are not sitting here tonight. The tickets told in Texas, North Carolina, and Puerto Rico. That`s the first winning Powerball ticket ever sold outside of the continental United States.</p><p>If the winners choose the lump sum, the three would split $381 million before taxes.</p><p>We`re both here, Sue.</p><p>HERERA: I know, which means we didn`t win, but if you`re watching, you probably didn`t either. So, come back here tomorrow night, right?</p><p>MATHISEN: That`s right. We`ll see you back here.</p><p>You`re having a couple of days off. I`ll see you when you get back.</p><p>HERERA: OK, thanks.</p><p>That`s it for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Sue Herera.</p><p>MATHISEN: And I`m Tyler Mathisen. Have a great evening. We`ll see you back here tomorrow.</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

The NASDAQ is at its highest level since March 2000 -- just around the time the dotcom boom went bust. But today's index is a lot different.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Divorce in aisle 9. After 16 years together, Costco ditches American Express -- and the stock suffers a big blow.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MATHISEN: Economic ripple. As Congress calls for a resolution, a new report puts a number on the amount of economic activity tied to those West Coast ports and it's big.</p><p>All that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday, February 12th.</p><p>HERERA: Good evening and welcome.</p><p>Stocks rally. The S&amp;P closes in on a record. The Dow Jones Industrial Average sees a triple digit gain.</p><p>But we begin tonight with the NASDAQ, powered today by a 9 percent move in Cisco, a deal in the online travel industry, and stocks like Nvidia and, of course, Apple. The index is now approaching that famous or infamous level of 5,000.</p><p>The number is synonymous with the dotcom bubble that peaked 15 years ago in March of 2000 and went bust fast.</p><p>But the technology sector is a lot different now than it was back then.</p><p>Bertha Coombs takes a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Health care tech firmInovalon's IPO at the NASDAQ market site today is representative is what is fueling the new boom in the NASDAQ composite.</p><p>Investor appetite for new tech stocks helped push the index within 5 percent of its all time Internet bubble high in March 2000. But at the risk of sounding trite, analysts say this new tech boom is different.</p><p>ARI WALD, OPPENHEIMER: In 2000, you had this parabolic move in the NASDAQ that was following the tail end of this 15-year secular bull market and now, on the other hand, it's been a much steadier healthy move into 5,000 on what we see as the -- you know, the early stages of a new secular bull market.</p><p>COOMBS: Among the biggest differences? Biotechs are now the biggest driver of gains up 35 percent in 2014 as companies like Gilead have brought big drugs to markets.</p><p>Another big difference? Tech valuations. Microsoft, the biggest weight in the NASDAQ 15 years ago, traded at 70 times earnings.</p><p>Today, Apple the biggest driver, is valued at 14 times its forward earnings after posting the highest quarterly profits of all time.</p><p>ERIN GIBBS, S&amp;P CAPITAL IQ: I see this as a change in that consumers are spending more on tech versus enterprise. Microsoft was mainly selling to businesses. Now, Apple is obviously a very consumer-focused company, and we're all basically spending more money on our gadgets.</p><p>COOMBS: While the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow industrials continue to set new records, the NASDAQ composite has yet to take out that milestone, with big tech stocks like Microsoft, Cisco and Intel well off their Internet bubble highs.</p><p>Is the NASDAQ returned to 5,000 a reason for tech investors to take pause?</p><p>WALD: Given really the broad-based leadership that we're seeing throughout the market, I think a breakout above 5,000 would only lead to stronger gains for tech stocks.</p><p>GIBBS: From a girl's (ph) perspective and fundamental perspective, I don't see it being a top at any reason now.</p><p>COOMBS (on camera): The number to watch on the NASDAQ, it's 5,048. That was the closing high on March 10th, 2000. The intraday high that day was 5,138.</p><p>From the NASDAQ Market Site, Bertha Coombs, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: So, will it be old tech or new tech that gets the NASDAQ to the next level?</p><p>Let's ask Brian Blair. He's managing director with Rosenblatt Security.</p><p>Brian, welcome. Good to have you with us.</p><p>It was an interesting day today. Cisco had a very nice day after its earnings. I called that old tech. Tesla had a rough day after its earnings. I call that new tech.</p><p>It's too easy to write-off some of those old tech companies, isn't it?</p><p>BRIAN BLAIR, ROSENBLATT SECURITY: It is. You know, one of the reasons is because they have large buckets of cash and they're throwing a lot of money into R&amp;D and finding ways to grow and stay relevant now, and the best ones are throwing money into what they believe will be the trends of tomorrow.</p><p>But, yes, a lot of those companies, Cisco, Microsoft, still fighting and staying relevant.</p><p>HERERA: So, where do you find the most opportunity? A lot of people thought it would still be biotech this year, but we have seen some of the biotech stock kind of roll over after massive IPOs last year.</p><p>BLAIR: Right.</p><p>HERERA: Where do you still see opportunity?</p><p>BLAIR: Yes, there's still a lot of opportunity in the mobile sector. Smartphones are still only about 55 percent of the global handset market, and so, if you think about the global market, there's still a lot of opportunity to ride the wave of India getting the smartphone, the rest of China getting 4G, you know, South America, Central America moving on to 4G networks.</p><p>So, that's one big area and I think the Internet itself provides, you know, a lot of opportunity. I think there's only about 2.5 billion, maybe less than half the world's population has Internet access so I think there's still opportunity there as well. I think for years to come.</p><p>MATHISEN: I don't know whether to call Apple old tech or new tech, and I would just call it good tech. As we look at the classic old tech companies, the Intels, the IBMs, the Microsofts, the Ciscos, which of those would you call the ones that are -- the Oracles even -- which would you call the most vulnerable or unprepared for today's new world and which would you call the ones that are best positioned?</p><p>BLAIR: I think intel actually represents one that's very vulnerable and I think one that represents in many ways old tech. You know, if you think about a lot of the most important trends in technology, a lot of them related to mobile, to smartphones, to tablets, to wearables, which is a new and emerging space, you don't see intel. You really don't see Intel anywhere. And that's where a lot of the growth and the volume has been in the last ten years and Intel has been virtually non-existent.</p><p>They've still sell into desktops. They still sell into servers. So, they are still able to put up a nice quarterly number, but they're not participating in the growth or where I think things are moving directionally. So, I would put them on the top of the vulnerability list in terms of old tech.</p><p>You know, IBM is another one that's been struggling. We see them make comments about investing in, you know, trying to be a part of big data, the big data trend, cloud computing. But we don't see it reflected in their numbers. And so, I would put those on the top two on the vulnerable list.</p><p>On the good list, you know, Microsoft I think is really impressing in a lot of ways with the future not just in Xbox, but they're showing a new virtual reality headset called HoloLens. It's forward thinking. I think, you know, they're definitely looking ahead and they're definitely in front of things. I would separate them like that.</p><p>MATHISEN: All right. Brian, thank you very much. Appreciate the answer. Brian Blair with Rosenblatt Security.</p><p>BLAIR: You bet.</p><p>HERERA: One Dow component that wasn't up with the rest of the market was American Express. In fact, it was down quite a bit.</p><p>Shares lost more than 6 percent. The Dow's worst performer today after Costco said it would stop accepting American Express credit cards at its U.S. stores.</p><p>Dominic Chu is joining us now with how important the relationship is between Costco and AmEx.</p><p>DOMINIC CHU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: It's huge and the reason why AmEx said you can expect to see earnings and sales way down by this relationship ending over the next couple of years because believe it or not, the estimates are that about 8 percent of all spending on American Express cards comes at Costco U.S. locations.</p><p>HERERA: Really? That high?</p><p>CHU: That's how big -- that's how big it is.</p><p>And now, Costco is huge. They sell a lot of stuff. The National Retail Federation says they're the world's second biggest retailer in terms of total revenues. They sell a lot of stuff. And right now, over the past 16 years, the only ways you could pay out of Costco were cash, debit card or an American Express, and then they linked the AmEx to their membership, meaning that you could have an AmEx card linked to their membership, and that's a reason why it's so huge.</p><p>MATHISEN: So, when will this -- they were negotiating, broken it off apparently. AmEx lost the deal with them. When does the deal end and when will that revenue stream stop for them?</p><p>CHU: March of 2016. So, you can continue to use your AmEx card until March of 2016. At that point, they're going to be look for a new replacement. Of course, the negotiations are ongoing between Costco, any potential partners.</p><p>The big deal is AmEx's relationship in Canada with Costco ended this past year as well. They went with Capital One on a MasterCard basis. So, that's one of the things people look for.</p><p>Who's going to replace AmEx? Could it be Capital One? Maybe it's Discover. Maybe it's another bank using a Visa or MasterCard payment processer. That's to be a big deal.</p><p>HERERA: All right. Dom, thanks so much. We appreciate it. Dominic Chu.</p><p>MATHISEN: Despite the fall in American Express, stocks did end the day higher, helped by a cease-fire deal between Russia and Ukraine, along with higher oil prices, all three major indexes ended in the black for the day. The Dow up 110 points, it finished at 17,972, just a few points shy of 18,000. NASDAQ up 56, the S&amp;P gained about 20.</p><p>HERERA: And more now on that ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine. It helped ease investor concerns since anymore trouble in that region could weigh on Europe's economy. But not all of those issues between the nations were ironed out.</p><p>Julia Chatterly reports from Brussels.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA CHATTERLY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Cautious optimism from E.U. leaders I think here, leaving this meeting about the peace deal signed between the pro-Russian separatists, Russia and the Ukraine. I think the fact that the talks took 17 hours into the early hours of this morning on two important points. One, ultimately, they were pretty tough negotiations and two, the desperation of the lead is behind them just to get something signed today.</p><p>But the billion dollar question now become: will all sides abide by the cease-fire agreement that begins at midnight on Sunday?</p><p>There's plenty of skepticism here behind the scenes given what we've seen in the past and so that's the spotlight now falling firmly on Russia.</p><p>There were no talks here today about further sanctions, but I think the message is that pressure will remain and that actions speak louder than words. We've left a lot of meetings bemoaning the fact that E.U. leaders can't agree on further sanctions on Russia. Perhaps that overshadowed and offset today by the announcement of a collective $40 billion bailout for Ukraine.</p><p>But behind the scenes, no illusions of the difficulty of reforming a country that is for all intents and purposes, at war.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Julia Chatterly in Brussels.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Onto the rapidly changing situation in Greece. Last night, we told you about reports that an agreement in principle had been reached between Greece and its eurozone creditors, but that quickly fell apart.</p><p>Michelle Caruso-Cabrera tells us now what went wrong and what might come next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MICHELLE CARUSO-CABRERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: It was a night of high drama. Many participants in yesterday's meeting believed that they had reached a broad agreement in principle with Greece, the details to be hammered out at another meeting this coming Monday. But at the last minute, Greek finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, refused to sign the draft statement that they were supposed to release to the public saying, he couldn't sign it after putting in a call to Athens.</p><p>Despite that high profile breakdown, Greek stocks moved higher today anyway. Market participants focusing on a leaked draft of what he was supposed to sign and it showed that the Greeks made concessions that were unexpected. The draft statement referred to exploring, quote, \"the possibility of extending and successfully concluding the present program.\" That's something Greece previously said it would never do. And it seems the crucial step though in order to get continued support for their banks from the European Central Bank.</p><p>Also adding to the optimism, a German newspaper reporting that the ECB had agreed today to extend even more loans to Greek banks through an emergency lending program. In one way, this is bad news. It shows that the banks in Greece are still under stress.</p><p>On the other hand, market participants say it shows the ECB is still willing to support the country. All of Europe's finance ministers meet again for another negotiating session on Monday. That day will be key to see if they can get a solid deal hammered out.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Michelle Caruso-Cabrera.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Still ahead, negotiations at the West Coast ports are strained and now members of Congress say they're very concerned.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: A big miss for retail sales for the second straight month. Sales fell more than expected 0.8 percent in January. Now, part of the reason can be explained by the falling gas prices, which lowers receipts at service stations.</p><p>But as Steve Liesman reports, that's only part of the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: A disappointing retail sales report for January sparking an economic mystery. If Americans are saving more on cheap gasoline, and making more because the nation added a million jobs over the past three months, where's the money going? Rather than the half percent decline expected by Wall Street, the government said spending in America shops fell nearly a full percentage point in January.</p><p>There was an expected 9 percent plunge in gasoline station sales, but sales were also off at department stores, furniture outlets and auto dealerships.</p><p>Did the extra green bucks just vaporize? Well, that's not the most likely explanation. Rather, economists on the case theorize more money is being saved and used to pay down debt. A recent Visa report found consumers hanging on to roughly half of gas savings.</p><p>Some of the money could be going to services which accounts for two- thirds of all consumer spending and is not counted in the retail goods report. Service spending would include increased spending on health insurance.</p><p>But there's another solution to the mystery: inflation or in this case, deflation. The number reports are not adjusted for changes in prices. If prices fall, Americans could be buying the same stuff but just spending less for it. So, when the government reports inflation adjusted or real spending when it calculates GDP, spending could show a gain.</p><p>Case solved? Not quite. Optimists aren't ready to assume consumers won't spend the gas windfall and they think the real evidence will come in the months ahead, when the mystery of the missing money is solved at cash registers around the nation.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Steve Liesman in Dallas.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: A big threat to the economy is the slowdown at the West Coast ports. According to Guggenheim Securities, the L.A. Long Beach port alone accounts for nearly 40 percent of country's containerized trade and it's estimated that 12.5 percent of U.S. GDP tied to cargo moving through those west coast ports.</p><p>As we told you last night, work has been suspended again, this time for four days.</p><p>Jane Wells has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JANE WELLS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): On Thursday, more than 40 container ships were either anchored off the West Coast or we're circling, waiting for anchorage space, as work loading and offloading ships again came to a standstill.</p><p>ROBERT MCELLRATH, ILWU PRESIDENT: Do not listen to PMA's (EXPLETIVE DELETED). Stay united.</p><p>WELLS: That's how strained negotiations have become between shipping lines and terminal operators against the union representing longshoremen. With cargo backed up, the Pacific Maritime Association or PMA representing employers, said there was no point in hiring crews TO work vessels, especially since Thursday, Lincoln's birthday, would require higher pay, as much as $92 an hour for the most senior foreman. The same pay for this weekend and Monday's President's Day. So, no ship work either -- as the PMA calls the congestion which it blames on dock workers, a strike with pay.</p><p>STEVE GETZUG, PMA SPOKESMAN: Every time we solve an issue that is important, they layer on new demands. The latest one we can't live with.</p><p>WELLS: According to management, the demand it cannot live with is one by dock workers to be able to unilaterally fire arbitrators. While the U.S. economy could suffer as goods take weeks longer than normal to move in and out of the West Coast, Congress is worried.</p><p>REP.KURT SCHRADER (D), OREGON: Well, this is clearly the greatest threat our nation faces, notwithstanding the stuff that's going on overseas.</p><p>WELLS: There would need to be a complete strike or lockout for the president to be able to force a cooling off period and reopen the ports under the Taft-Hartley Act. Work is supposed to continue moving containers out of the yard and as for negotiations which started last may --</p><p>MCELLRATH: We've been sitting here as I give this speech for five days waiting for PMA and they haven't shown up yet.</p><p>WELLS (on camera): The PMA says negotiations were resuming today and the reason that it hasn't met with the union at all this week is because it says there has been no point; that while management has offered concessions, the dock workers, quote, \"won't budge.\"</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Jane Wells at the port of Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: The impact of the slowdown is already being felt. According to Goldman Sachs research, shippers have diverted cargo away from the West Coast ports even at the expense of increased freight costs and that's leading to a decline in intermodal volumes for companies like BNSF, and Union Pacific. Retailers are also rerouting shipments using air freight and that is helping companies like FedEx and UPS.</p><p>HERERA: We begin our \"Market Focus\" tonight with disappointing results from AIG.</p><p>The insurance giant saw its profit slide, hurt by weak performance in its corporate category. The company did announce a buy back about $2.5 billion worth of shares, which adds to the nearly $5 billion in stock that it bought back last year. It also declared a dividend of about 12 cents a share that has a yield of about 1 percent.</p><p>After the bell, the shares were volatile. Before the close, the stock was up 20 cents to $52.45.</p><p>It was the opposite story for CBS, which also reported after the close. The Tiffany network reported better-than-expected revenue on higher ad sales, helped by Thursday night football and the ads for the midterm elections. That sent shares initially higher in after-hours trading. Before the close, the shares were up nearly 2 percent to $57.77.</p><p>Inflation in Brazil and a stronger dollar took a bite out of Avon's overseas revenue. The cosmetics maker's results missed analysts' estimates on both the top and bottom lines. The company said those currency fluctuations will continue to weigh on performance this year, as it does most of its business outside the U.S. But Avon also told investors it expects its North American business to turn profitable for the first time in three years. Shares rose more than 1 percent to $8.69.</p><p>MATHISEN: Kellogg still has the breakfast blues. The Corn Flakes maker posted a big quarterly loss and cut its forecast for long-term annual revenue growth, as cereal sales continue to be quite sluggish. Shares fell 4.5 percent to $63.30.</p><p>Apache also posted a quarterly loss as it wrote down the value of its oil and gas assets. Revenue lower than expectations also, and it announced it is slashing its rig count by more than a third in response to crumbling crude prices. The stock was down slightly to $64.58.</p><p>And Time Inc. gave investors a weak sales outlook for 2015, which weighed on shares in today's trade. This as the publisher of magazines like People and Sports Illustrated reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit, as it has been dealing with falling circulation and advertising revenue. Shares off almost 2 percent. They settled at $24.49.</p><p>HERERA: Expedia is on a shopping spree. Its latest acquisition, Orbitz, just a few weeks after buying Travelocity. The deal is valued at more than a billion dollars take on bigger rival Priceline. Orbitz soared on the news as did Expedia.</p><p>Simon Hobbs takes a look at how this deal changes the global online travel industry.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SIMON HOBBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Orbitz is one of the smallest online travel industries and would have struggled in the future against the growing market power of giant rivals Expedia and Priceline, who spent billions on advertising a new technology.</p><p>So, as the saying goes, if you can't beat them, join them. Expedia already boasts 13 major brands. For $1.6 billion in cash, Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshahi can now add the Orbitz brands the Orbitz's own CheapTickets, ebookers and HotelClub. Those four, he says, will be much more profitable once he's cut $75 million in cost and gives them access to Expedia's big stockpile of hotel rooms for sale.</p><p>DARA KHOSROWSHAHI, EXPEDIA CEO: We've got one of the broadest global inventories out there and we think that the complement to the Orbitz loyalty program, the bank program that Orbitz has. We think that's going to be a terrific combination.</p><p>HOBBS (on camera): The CEO of his target at Orbitz, Barney Harford, is well-respected. Over the last two years, he's reinvigorated the business with better technology and a private label business essentially running the back office for ad hoc sites like AmEx Travel, but ultimately without the power of Expedia and Priceline to fit in real time for your online business, he went for a trade sale.</p><p>BARNEY HARFORD, ORBITZ CEO: People may have tried to write us off in the past, but I think they can see the continued ongoing growth really showing through.</p><p>HOBBS (voice-over): It was what remains of Travelocity, that Expedia bought three weeks ago for $280 million. Trivago cost Expedia well over $600 million, but rival Priceline deal's are even bigger. OpenTable for $2.4 billion and Kayak for $1.7 billion.</p><p>Despite the consolidation, Dara Khosrowshahi rejects the idea that there's a lack of competition or that the regulators should get involved.</p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI: We compete in a much larger segment in general and there's lots and lots of competition for that top audience.</p><p>HOBBS: And for travelers shopping online, the CEO of Expedia promises that all 17 major brands will operate with an independence that ensures there's still a deal to be had even if they're still all owned by the same company.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Simon Hobbs at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Coming up, what some local florists are doing to keep businesses from wilting as competition increases and Valentine's Day approaches.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: Business is blooming for the flower industry but not necessarily for your local florists. Increased competition in online delivery companies are pinching many small business owners.</p><p>But as Kate Rogers reports, some old-fashioned mom and pop shops are finding an edge in order to battle back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KATE ROGERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This year, more than $2 billion will be spent on flowers for Valentine's Day alone. But local florists like Caldwell Flowerland in New Jersey are seeing increased competition and in some cases losses. That's because of big e-commerce players like 1-800-Flowers, FTD and ProFlowers.</p><p>In fact, local florists saw their revenue slide nearly 40 percent last year, according to IBIS, a market research group.</p><p>Flowerland, in business 30 years, has also seen its revenue fall. But owner Frank Dellisanti says there's a silver lining.</p><p>FRANK DELLISANTI, CALDWELL FLOWERLAND OWNER: It took a little dip, but it also educated customers where to come back to. So, it also weeded out other competitors, too.</p><p>ROGERS: Any way you spin it, there are more options than ever, a new crop of start-ups are blooming in the flower delivery space. Angel List names 30 of them, including Urban Stems and Bloom That, which delivered bouquets on demand within an hour or so. Even Whole Foods is getting in on the action, partnering with grocery delivery start-up Instacart in three cities.</p><p>And then, there are the supermarkets and big box stores like Walmart. Analysts say they could be more detrimental to local florists than ecommerce. Dellisanti said he has one thing on the action partnering with grocery delivery start-up Instacart in 15 cities.</p><p>And then, there are these supermarkets and big box stores like Walmart. Analysts say they could be more detrimental to local florists than ecommerce.</p><p>Dellisanti says he has one thing, though, that big box stores are missing: a personal touch.</p><p>DELLISANTI: Yes, we try to keep a year round price and then we try to keep the consistency and quality.</p><p>ROGERS (on camera): Business here at Flowerland is still pretty good. In fact, they'll sell about 10,000 of these roses over the Valentine's Day holiday weekend this year. But increased competition from other ecommerce players in the space has hurt other local florists around the country some of whom have had to close their doors for good.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Kate Rogers in Caldwell, New Jersey.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Kate got the rose from the bachelor.</p><p>Finally tonight, three people to fight the odds and one, the $564 million Powerball jackpot. Two of them are not sitting here tonight. The tickets told in Texas, North Carolina, and Puerto Rico. That's the first winning Powerball ticket ever sold outside of the continental United States.</p><p>If the winners choose the lump sum, the three would split $381 million before taxes.</p><p>We're both here, Sue.</p><p>HERERA: I know, which means we didn't win, but if you're watching, you probably didn't either. So, come back here tomorrow night, right?</p><p>MATHISEN: That's right. We'll see you back here.</p><p>You're having a couple of days off. I'll see you when you get back.</p><p>HERERA: OK, thanks.</p><p>That's it for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Sue Herera.</p><p>MATHISEN: And I'm Tyler Mathisen. Have a great evening.

The index is now approaching that famous or infamous level of 5,000.</p><p>The number is synonymous with the dotcom bubble that peaked 15 years ago in March of 2000 and went bust fast.</p><p>But the technology sector is a lot different now than it was back then.</p><p>Bertha Coombs takes a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Health care tech firmInovalon's IPO at the NASDAQ market site today is representative is what is fueling the new boom in the NASDAQ composite.</p><p>Investor appetite for new tech stocks helped push the index within 5 percent of its all time Internet bubble high in March 2000. But at the risk of sounding trite, analysts say this new tech boom is different.</p><p>ARI WALD, OPPENHEIMER: In 2000, you had this parabolic move in the NASDAQ that was following the tail end of this 15-year secular bull market and now, on the other hand, it's been a much steadier healthy move into 5,000 on what we see as the -- you know, the early stages of a new secular bull market.</p><p>COOMBS: Among the biggest differences? Biotechs are now the biggest driver of gains up 35 percent in 2014 as companies like Gilead have brought big drugs to markets.</p><p>Another big difference? Tech valuations. Microsoft, the biggest weight in the NASDAQ 15 years ago, traded at 70 times earnings.</p><p>Today, Apple the biggest driver, is valued at 14 times its forward earnings after posting the highest quarterly profits of all time.</p><p>ERIN GIBBS, S&amp;P CAPITAL IQ: I see this as a change in that consumers are spending more on tech versus enterprise. Microsoft was mainly selling to businesses. Now, Apple is obviously a very consumer-focused company, and we're all basically spending more money on our gadgets.</p><p>COOMBS: While the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow industrials continue to set new records, the NASDAQ composite has yet to take out that milestone, with big tech stocks like Microsoft, Cisco and Intel well off their Internet bubble highs.</p><p>Is the NASDAQ returned to 5,000 a reason for tech investors to take pause?</p><p>WALD: Given really the broad-based leadership that we're seeing throughout the market, I think a breakout above 5,000 would only lead to stronger gains for tech stocks.</p><p>GIBBS: From a girl's (ph) perspective and fundamental perspective, I don't see it being a top at any reason now.</p><p>COOMBS (on camera): The number to watch on the NASDAQ, it's 5,048. That was the closing high on March 10th, 2000. The intraday high that day was 5,138.</p><p>From the NASDAQ Market Site, Bertha Coombs, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: So, will it be old tech or new tech that gets the NASDAQ to the next level?</p><p>Let's ask Brian Blair. He's managing director with Rosenblatt Security.</p><p>Brian, welcome. Good to have you with us.</p><p>It was an interesting day today. Cisco had a very nice day after its earnings. I called that old tech. Tesla had a rough day after its earnings. I call that new tech.</p><p>It's too easy to write-off some of those old tech companies, isn't it?</p><p>BRIAN BLAIR, ROSENBLATT SECURITY: It is. You know, one of the reasons is because they have large buckets of cash and they're throwing a lot of money into R&amp;D and finding ways to grow and stay relevant now, and the best ones are throwing money into what they believe will be the trends of tomorrow.</p><p>But, yes, a lot of those companies, Cisco, Microsoft, still fighting and staying relevant.</p><p>HERERA: So, where do you find the most opportunity? A lot of people thought it would still be biotech this year, but we have seen some of the biotech stock kind of roll over after massive IPOs last year.</p><p>BLAIR: Right.</p><p>HERERA: Where do you still see opportunity?</p><p>BLAIR: Yes, there's still a lot of opportunity in the mobile sector. Smartphones are still only about 55 percent of the global handset market, and so, if you think about the global market, there's still a lot of opportunity to ride the wave of India getting the smartphone, the rest of China getting 4G, you know, South America, Central America moving on to 4G networks.</p><p>So, that's one big area and I think the Internet itself provides, you know, a lot of opportunity. I think there's only about 2.5 billion, maybe less than half the world's population has Internet access so I think there's still opportunity there as well. I think for years to come.</p><p>MATHISEN: I don't know whether to call Apple old tech or new tech, and I would just call it good tech. As we look at the classic old tech companies, the Intels, the IBMs, the Microsofts, the Ciscos, which of those would you call the ones that are -- the Oracles even -- which would you call the most vulnerable or unprepared for today's new world and which would you call the ones that are best positioned?</p><p>BLAIR: I think intel actually represents one that's very vulnerable and I think one that represents in many ways old tech. You know, if you think about a lot of the most important trends in technology, a lot of them related to mobile, to smartphones, to tablets, to wearables, which is a new and emerging space, you don't see intel. You really don't see Intel anywhere. And that's where a lot of the growth and the volume has been in the last ten years and Intel has been virtually non-existent.</p><p>They've still sell into desktops. They still sell into servers. So, they are still able to put up a nice quarterly number, but they're not participating in the growth or where I think things are moving directionally. So, I would put them on the top of the vulnerability list in terms of old tech.</p><p>You know, IBM is another one that's been struggling. We see them make comments about investing in, you know, trying to be a part of big data, the big data trend, cloud computing. But we don't see it reflected in their numbers. And so, I would put those on the top two on the vulnerable list.</p><p>On the good list, you know, Microsoft I think is really impressing in a lot of ways with the future not just in Xbox, but they're showing a new virtual reality headset called HoloLens. It's forward thinking. I think, you know, they're definitely looking ahead and they're definitely in front of things. I would separate them like that.</p><p>MATHISEN: All right. Brian, thank you very much. Appreciate the answer. Brian Blair with Rosenblatt Security.</p><p>BLAIR: You bet.</p><p>HERERA: One Dow component that wasn't up with the rest of the market was American Express. In fact, it was down quite a bit.</p><p>Shares lost more than 6 percent. The Dow's worst performer today after Costco said it would stop accepting American Express credit cards at its U.S. stores.</p><p>Dominic Chu is joining us now with how important the relationship is between Costco and AmEx.</p><p>DOMINIC CHU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: It's huge and the reason why AmEx said you can expect to see earnings and sales way down by this relationship ending over the next couple of years because believe it or not, the estimates are that about 8 percent of all spending on American Express cards comes at Costco U.S. locations.</p><p>HERERA: Really? That high?</p><p>CHU: That's how big -- that's how big it is.</p><p>And now, Costco is huge. They sell a lot of stuff. The National Retail Federation says they're the world's second biggest retailer in terms of total revenues. They sell a lot of stuff. And right now, over the past 16 years, the only ways you could pay out of Costco were cash, debit card or an American Express, and then they linked the AmEx to their membership, meaning that you could have an AmEx card linked to their membership, and that's a reason why it's so huge.</p><p>MATHISEN: So, when will this -- they were negotiating, broken it off apparently. AmEx lost the deal with them. When does the deal end and when will that revenue stream stop for them?</p><p>CHU: March of 2016. So, you can continue to use your AmEx card until March of 2016. At that point, they're going to be look for a new replacement. Of course, the negotiations are ongoing between Costco, any potential partners.</p><p>The big deal is AmEx's relationship in Canada with Costco ended this past year as well. They went with Capital One on a MasterCard basis. So, that's one of the things people look for.</p><p>Who's going to replace AmEx? Could it be Capital One? Maybe it's Discover. Maybe it's another bank using a Visa or MasterCard payment processer. That's to be a big deal.</p><p>HERERA: All right. Dom, thanks so much. We appreciate it. Dominic Chu.</p><p>MATHISEN: Despite the fall in American Express, stocks did end the day higher, helped by a cease-fire deal between Russia and Ukraine, along with higher oil prices, all three major indexes ended in the black for the day. The Dow up 110 points, it finished at 17,972, just a few points shy of 18,000. NASDAQ up 56, the S&amp;P gained about 20.</p><p>HERERA: And more now on that ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine. It helped ease investor concerns since anymore trouble in that region could weigh on Europe's economy. But not all of those issues between the nations were ironed out.</p><p>Julia Chatterly reports from Brussels.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA CHATTERLY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Cautious optimism from E.U. leaders I think here, leaving this meeting about the peace deal signed between the pro-Russian separatists, Russia and the Ukraine. I think the fact that the talks took 17 hours into the early hours of this morning on two important points. One, ultimately, they were pretty tough negotiations and two, the desperation of the lead is behind them just to get something signed today.</p><p>But the billion dollar question now become: will all sides abide by the cease-fire agreement that begins at midnight on Sunday?</p><p>There's plenty of skepticism here behind the scenes given what we've seen in the past and so that's the spotlight now falling firmly on Russia.</p><p>There were no talks here today about further sanctions, but I think the message is that pressure will remain and that actions speak louder than words. We've left a lot of meetings bemoaning the fact that E.U. leaders can't agree on further sanctions on Russia. Perhaps that overshadowed and offset today by the announcement of a collective $40 billion bailout for Ukraine.</p><p>But behind the scenes, no illusions of the difficulty of reforming a country that is for all intents and purposes, at war.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Julia Chatterly in Brussels.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Onto the rapidly changing situation in Greece. Last night, we told you about reports that an agreement in principle had been reached between Greece and its eurozone creditors, but that quickly fell apart.</p><p>Michelle Caruso-Cabrera tells us now what went wrong and what might come next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MICHELLE CARUSO-CABRERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: It was a night of high drama. Many participants in yesterday's meeting believed that they had reached a broad agreement in principle with Greece, the details to be hammered out at another meeting this coming Monday. But at the last minute, Greek finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, refused to sign the draft statement that they were supposed to release to the public saying, he couldn't sign it after putting in a call to Athens.</p><p>Despite that high profile breakdown, Greek stocks moved higher today anyway. Market participants focusing on a leaked draft of what he was supposed to sign and it showed that the Greeks made concessions that were unexpected. The draft statement referred to exploring, quote, \"the possibility of extending and successfully concluding the present program.\" That's something Greece previously said it would never do. And it seems the crucial step though in order to get continued support for their banks from the European Central Bank.</p><p>Also adding to the optimism, a German newspaper reporting that the ECB had agreed today to extend even more loans to Greek banks through an emergency lending program. In one way, this is bad news. It shows that the banks in Greece are still under stress.</p><p>On the other hand, market participants say it shows the ECB is still willing to support the country. All of Europe's finance ministers meet again for another negotiating session on Monday. That day will be key to see if they can get a solid deal hammered out.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Michelle Caruso-Cabrera.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Still ahead, negotiations at the West Coast ports are strained and now members of Congress say they're very concerned.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: A big miss for retail sales for the second straight month. Sales fell more than expected 0.8 percent in January. Now, part of the reason can be explained by the falling gas prices, which lowers receipts at service stations.</p><p>But as Steve Liesman reports, that's only part of the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: A disappointing retail sales report for January sparking an economic mystery. If Americans are saving more on cheap gasoline, and making more because the nation added a million jobs over the past three months, where's the money going? Rather than the half percent decline expected by Wall Street, the government said spending in America shops fell nearly a full percentage point in January.</p><p>There was an expected 9 percent plunge in gasoline station sales, but sales were also off at department stores, furniture outlets and auto dealerships.</p><p>Did the extra green bucks just vaporize? Well, that's not the most likely explanation. Rather, economists on the case theorize more money is being saved and used to pay down debt. A recent Visa report found consumers hanging on to roughly half of gas savings.</p><p>Some of the money could be going to services which accounts for two- thirds of all consumer spending and is not counted in the retail goods report. Service spending would include increased spending on health insurance.</p><p>But there's another solution to the mystery: inflation or in this case, deflation. The number reports are not adjusted for changes in prices. If prices fall, Americans could be buying the same stuff but just spending less for it. So, when the government reports inflation adjusted or real spending when it calculates GDP, spending could show a gain.</p><p>Case solved? Not quite. Optimists aren't ready to assume consumers won't spend the gas windfall and they think the real evidence will come in the months ahead, when the mystery of the missing money is solved at cash registers around the nation.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Steve Liesman in Dallas.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: A big threat to the economy is the slowdown at the West Coast ports. According to Guggenheim Securities, the L.A. Long Beach port alone accounts for nearly 40 percent of country's containerized trade and it's estimated that 12.5 percent of U.S. GDP tied to cargo moving through those west coast ports.</p><p>As we told you last night, work has been suspended again, this time for four days.</p><p>Jane Wells has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JANE WELLS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): On Thursday, more than 40 container ships were either anchored off the West Coast or we're circling, waiting for anchorage space, as work loading and offloading ships again came to a standstill.</p><p>ROBERT MCELLRATH, ILWU PRESIDENT: Do not listen to PMA's (EXPLETIVE DELETED). Stay united.</p><p>WELLS: That's how strained negotiations have become between shipping lines and terminal operators against the union representing longshoremen. With cargo backed up, the Pacific Maritime Association or PMA representing employers, said there was no point in hiring crews TO work vessels, especially since Thursday, Lincoln's birthday, would require higher pay, as much as $92 an hour for the most senior foreman. The same pay for this weekend and Monday's President's Day. So, no ship work either -- as the PMA calls the congestion which it blames on dock workers, a strike with pay.</p><p>STEVE GETZUG, PMA SPOKESMAN: Every time we solve an issue that is important, they layer on new demands. The latest one we can't live with.</p><p>WELLS: According to management, the demand it cannot live with is one by dock workers to be able to unilaterally fire arbitrators. While the U.S. economy could suffer as goods take weeks longer than normal to move in and out of the West Coast, Congress is worried.</p><p>REP.KURT SCHRADER (D), OREGON: Well, this is clearly the greatest threat our nation faces, notwithstanding the stuff that's going on overseas.</p><p>WELLS: There would need to be a complete strike or lockout for the president to be able to force a cooling off period and reopen the ports under the Taft-Hartley Act. Work is supposed to continue moving containers out of the yard and as for negotiations which started last may --</p><p>MCELLRATH: We've been sitting here as I give this speech for five days waiting for PMA and they haven't shown up yet.</p><p>WELLS (on camera): The PMA says negotiations were resuming today and the reason that it hasn't met with the union at all this week is because it says there has been no point; that while management has offered concessions, the dock workers, quote, \"won't budge.\"</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Jane Wells at the port of Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: The impact of the slowdown is already being felt. According to Goldman Sachs research, shippers have diverted cargo away from the West Coast ports even at the expense of increased freight costs and that's leading to a decline in intermodal volumes for companies like BNSF, and Union Pacific. Retailers are also rerouting shipments using air freight and that is helping companies like FedEx and UPS.</p><p>HERERA: We begin our \"Market Focus\" tonight with disappointing results from AIG.</p><p>The insurance giant saw its profit slide, hurt by weak performance in its corporate category. The company did announce a buy back about $2.5 billion worth of shares, which adds to the nearly $5 billion in stock that it bought back last year. It also declared a dividend of about 12 cents a share that has a yield of about 1 percent.</p><p>After the bell, the shares were volatile. Before the close, the stock was up 20 cents to $52.45.</p><p>It was the opposite story for CBS, which also reported after the close. The Tiffany network reported better-than-expected revenue on higher ad sales, helped by Thursday night football and the ads for the midterm elections. That sent shares initially higher in after-hours trading. Before the close, the shares were up nearly 2 percent to $57.77.</p><p>Inflation in Brazil and a stronger dollar took a bite out of Avon's overseas revenue. The cosmetics maker's results missed analysts' estimates on both the top and bottom lines. The company said those currency fluctuations will continue to weigh on performance this year, as it does most of its business outside the U.S. But Avon also told investors it expects its North American business to turn profitable for the first time in three years. Shares rose more than 1 percent to $8.69.</p><p>MATHISEN: Kellogg still has the breakfast blues. The Corn Flakes maker posted a big quarterly loss and cut its forecast for long-term annual revenue growth, as cereal sales continue to be quite sluggish. Shares fell 4.5 percent to $63.30.</p><p>Apache also posted a quarterly loss as it wrote down the value of its oil and gas assets. Revenue lower than expectations also, and it announced it is slashing its rig count by more than a third in response to crumbling crude prices. The stock was down slightly to $64.58.</p><p>And Time Inc. gave investors a weak sales outlook for 2015, which weighed on shares in today's trade. This as the publisher of magazines like People and Sports Illustrated reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit, as it has been dealing with falling circulation and advertising revenue. Shares off almost 2 percent. They settled at $24.49.</p><p>HERERA: Expedia is on a shopping spree. Its latest acquisition, Orbitz, just a few weeks after buying Travelocity. The deal is valued at more than a billion dollars take on bigger rival Priceline. Orbitz soared on the news as did Expedia.</p><p>Simon Hobbs takes a look at how this deal changes the global online travel industry.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SIMON HOBBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Orbitz is one of the smallest online travel industries and would have struggled in the future against the growing market power of giant rivals Expedia and Priceline, who spent billions on advertising a new technology.</p><p>So, as the saying goes, if you can't beat them, join them. Expedia already boasts 13 major brands. For $1.6 billion in cash, Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshahi can now add the Orbitz brands the Orbitz's own CheapTickets, ebookers and HotelClub. Those four, he says, will be much more profitable once he's cut $75 million in cost and gives them access to Expedia's big stockpile of hotel rooms for sale.</p><p>DARA KHOSROWSHAHI, EXPEDIA CEO: We've got one of the broadest global inventories out there and we think that the complement to the Orbitz loyalty program, the bank program that Orbitz has. We think that's going to be a terrific combination.</p><p>HOBBS (on camera): The CEO of his target at Orbitz, Barney Harford, is well-respected. Over the last two years, he's reinvigorated the business with better technology and a private label business essentially running the back office for ad hoc sites like AmEx Travel, but ultimately without the power of Expedia and Priceline to fit in real time for your online business, he went for a trade sale.</p><p>BARNEY HARFORD, ORBITZ CEO: People may have tried to write us off in the past, but I think they can see the continued ongoing growth really showing through.</p><p>HOBBS (voice-over): It was what remains of Travelocity, that Expedia bought three weeks ago for $280 million. Trivago cost Expedia well over $600 million, but rival Priceline deal's are even bigger. OpenTable for $2.4 billion and Kayak for $1.7 billion.</p><p>Despite the consolidation, Dara Khosrowshahi rejects the idea that there's a lack of competition or that the regulators should get involved.</p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI: We compete in a much larger segment in general and there's lots and lots of competition for that top audience.</p><p>HOBBS: And for travelers shopping online, the CEO of Expedia promises that all 17 major brands will operate with an independence that ensures there's still a deal to be had even if they're still all owned by the same company.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Simon Hobbs at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Coming up, what some local florists are doing to keep businesses from wilting as competition increases and Valentine's Day approaches.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: Business is blooming for the flower industry but not necessarily for your local florists. Increased competition in online delivery companies are pinching many small business owners.</p><p>But as Kate Rogers reports, some old-fashioned mom and pop shops are finding an edge in order to battle back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KATE ROGERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This year, more than $2 billion will be spent on flowers for Valentine's Day alone. But local florists like Caldwell Flowerland in New Jersey are seeing increased competition and in some cases losses. That's because of big e-commerce players like 1-800-Flowers, FTD and ProFlowers.</p><p>In fact, local florists saw their revenue slide nearly 40 percent last year, according to IBIS, a market research group.</p><p>Flowerland, in business 30 years, has also seen its revenue fall. But owner Frank Dellisanti says there's a silver lining.</p><p>FRANK DELLISANTI, CALDWELL FLOWERLAND OWNER: It took a little dip, but it also educated customers where to come back to. So, it also weeded out other competitors, too.</p><p>ROGERS: Any way you spin it, there are more options than ever, a new crop of start-ups are blooming in the flower delivery space. Angel List names 30 of them, including Urban Stems and Bloom That, which delivered bouquets on demand within an hour or so. Even Whole Foods is getting in on the action, partnering with grocery delivery start-up Instacart in three cities.</p><p>And then, there are the supermarkets and big box stores like Walmart. Analysts say they could be more detrimental to local florists than ecommerce. Dellisanti said he has one thing on the action partnering with grocery delivery start-up Instacart in 15 cities.</p><p>And then, there are these supermarkets and big box stores like Walmart. Analysts say they could be more detrimental to local florists than ecommerce.</p><p>Dellisanti says he has one thing, though, that big box stores are missing: a personal touch.</p><p>DELLISANTI: Yes, we try to keep a year round price and then we try to keep the consistency and quality.</p><p>ROGERS (on camera): Business here at Flowerland is still pretty good. In fact, they'll sell about 10,000 of these roses over the Valentine's Day holiday weekend this year. But increased competition from other ecommerce players in the space has hurt other local florists around the country some of whom have had to close their doors for good.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Kate Rogers in Caldwell, New Jersey.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Kate got the rose from the bachelor.</p><p>Finally tonight, three people to fight the odds and one, the $564 million Powerball jackpot. Two of them are not sitting here tonight. The tickets told in Texas, North Carolina, and Puerto Rico. That's the first winning Powerball ticket ever sold outside of the continental United States.</p><p>If the winners choose the lump sum, the three would split $381 million before taxes.</p><p>We're both here, Sue.</p><p>HERERA: I know, which means we didn't win, but if you're watching, you probably didn't either. So, come back here tomorrow night, right?</p><p>MATHISEN: That's right. We'll see you back here.</p><p>You're having a couple of days off. I'll see you when you get back.</p><p>HERERA: OK, thanks.</p><p>That's it for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Sue Herera.</p><p>MATHISEN: And I'm Tyler Mathisen. Have a great evening.

The  NASDAQ is at its highest level since March 2000 -- just around the time the  dotcom boom went bust.  But today's index is a lot different.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Divorce in aisle 9.   After 16 years together, Costco ditches American Express -- and the stock  suffers a big blow.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MATHISEN:  Economic ripple.  As Congress calls for a resolution, a new  report puts a number on the amount of economic activity tied to those West  Coast ports and it's big.  </p><p>All that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday,  February 12th.  </p><p>HERERA:  Good evening and welcome.  </p><p>Stocks rally.  The S&amp;P closes in on a record.  The Dow Jones  Industrial Average sees a triple digit gain.  </p><p>But we begin tonight with the NASDAQ, powered today by a 9 percent  move in Cisco, a deal in the online travel industry, and stocks like Nvidia  and, of course, Apple.  The index is now approaching that famous or  infamous level of 5,000.  </p><p>The number is synonymous with the dotcom bubble that peaked 15 years  ago in March of 2000 and went bust fast.  </p><p>But the technology sector is a lot different now than it was back  then.  </p><p>Bertha Coombs takes a look.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   Health care tech firm Inovalon's IPO at the NASDAQ market site today is  representative is what is fueling the new boom in the NASDAQ composite.  </p><p>Investor appetite for new tech stocks helped push the index within 5  percent of its all time Internet bubble high in March 2000.  But at the  risk of sounding trite, analysts say this new tech boom is different.  </p><p>ARI WALD, OPPENHEIMER:  In 2000, you had this parabolic move in the  NASDAQ that was following the tail end of this 15-year secular bull market  and now, on the other hand, it's been a much steadier healthy move into  5,000 on what we see as the -- you know, the early stages of a new secular  bull market.  </p><p>COOMBS:  Among the biggest differences?  Biotechs are now the biggest  driver of gains up 35 percent in 2014 as companies like Gilead have brought  big drugs to markets.  </p><p>Another big difference?  Tech valuations.  Microsoft, the biggest  weight in the NASDAQ 15 years ago, traded at 70 times earnings.  </p><p>Today, Apple the biggest driver, is valued at 14 times its forward  earnings after posting the highest quarterly profits of all time.  </p><p>ERIN GIBBS, S&amp;P CAPITAL IQ:  I see this as a change in that consumers  are spending more on tech versus enterprise.  Microsoft was mainly selling  to businesses.  Now, Apple is obviously a very consumer-focused company,  and we're all basically spending more money on our gadgets.  </p><p>COOMBS:  While the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow industrials continue to set new  records, the NASDAQ composite has yet to take out that milestone, with big  tech stocks like Microsoft, Cisco and Intel well off their Internet bubble  highs.  </p><p>Is the NASDAQ returned to 5,000 a reason for tech investors to take  pause?  </p><p>WALD:  Given really the broad-based leadership that we're seeing  throughout the market, I think a breakout above 5,000 would only lead to  stronger gains for tech stocks.  </p><p>GIBBS:  From a girl's (ph) perspective and fundamental perspective, I  don't see it being a top at any reason now.  </p><p>COOMBS (on camera):  The number to watch on the NASDAQ, it's 5,048.   That was the closing high on March 10th, 2000.  The intraday high that day  was 5,138.  </p><p>From the NASDAQ Market Site, Bertha Coombs, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  So, will it be old tech or new tech that gets the NASDAQ to  the next level?</p><p>Let's ask Brian Blair.  He's managing director with Rosenblatt  Security.  </p><p>Brian, welcome.  Good to have you with us.</p><p>It was an interesting day today.  Cisco had a very nice day after its  earnings.  I called that old tech.  Tesla had a rough day after its  earnings.  I call that new tech.  </p><p>It's too easy to write-off some of those old tech companies, isn't it?  </p><p>BRIAN BLAIR, ROSENBLATT SECURITY:  It is.  You know, one of the  reasons is because they have large buckets of cash and they're throwing a  lot of money into R&amp;D and finding ways to grow and stay relevant now, and  the best ones are throwing money into what they believe will be the trends  of tomorrow.  </p><p>But, yes, a lot of those companies, Cisco, Microsoft, still fighting  and staying relevant.  </p><p>HERERA:  So, where do you find the most opportunity?  A lot of people  thought it would still be biotech this year, but we have seen some of the  biotech stock kind of roll over after massive IPOs last year.  </p><p>BLAIR:  Right.</p><p>HERERA:  Where do you still see opportunity?  </p><p>BLAIR:  Yes, there's still a lot of opportunity in the mobile sector.   Smartphones are still only about 55 percent of the global handset market,  and so, if you think about the global market, there's still a lot of  opportunity to ride the wave of India getting the smartphone, the rest of  China getting 4G, you know, South America, Central America moving on to 4G  networks.  </p><p>So, that's one big area and I think the Internet itself provides, you  know, a lot of opportunity.  I think there's only about 2.5 billion, maybe  less than half the world's population has Internet access so I think  there's still opportunity there as well.  I think for years to come.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  I don't know whether to call Apple old tech or new tech,  and I would just call it good tech.  As we look at the classic old tech  companies, the Intels, the IBMs, the Microsofts, the Ciscos, which of those  would you call the ones that are -- the Oracles even -- which would you  call the most vulnerable or unprepared for today's new world and which  would you call the ones that are best positioned?  </p><p>BLAIR:  I think intel actually represents one that's very vulnerable  and I think one that represents in many ways old tech.  You know, if you  think about a lot of the most important trends in technology, a lot of them  related to mobile, to smartphones, to tablets, to wearables, which is a new  and emerging space, you don't see intel.  You really don't see Intel  anywhere.  And that's where a lot of the growth and the volume has been in  the last ten years and Intel has been virtually non-existent.  </p><p>They've still sell into desktops.  They still sell into servers.  So,  they are still able to put up a nice quarterly number, but they're not  participating in the growth or where I think things are moving  directionally.  So, I would put them on the top of the vulnerability list  in terms of old tech.</p><p>You know, IBM is another one that's been struggling.  We see them make  comments about investing in, you know, trying to be a part of big data, the  big data trend, cloud computing.  But we don't see it reflected in their  numbers.  And so, I would put those on the top two on the vulnerable list.  </p><p>On the good list, you know, Microsoft I think is really impressing in  a lot of ways with the future not just in Xbox, but they're showing a new  virtual reality headset called HoloLens.  It's forward thinking.  I think,  you know, they're definitely looking ahead and they're definitely in front  of things.  I would separate them like that.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  All right.  Brian, thank you very much.  Appreciate the  answer.  Brian Blair with Rosenblatt Security.  </p><p>BLAIR:  You bet.  </p><p>HERERA:  One Dow component that wasn't up with the rest of the market  was American Express.  In fact, it was down quite a bit.  </p><p>Shares lost more than 6 percent.  The Dow's worst performer today  after Costco said it would stop accepting American Express credit cards at  its U.S. stores.  </p><p>Dominic Chu is joining us now with how important the relationship is  between Costco and AmEx.  </p><p>DOMINIC CHU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It's huge and the  reason why AmEx said you can expect to see earnings and sales way down by  this relationship ending over the next couple of years because believe it  or not, the estimates are that about 8 percent of all spending on American  Express cards comes at Costco U.S. locations.  </p><p>HERERA: Really?  That high?</p><p>CHU:  That's how big -- that's how big it is.  </p><p>And now, Costco is huge.  They sell a lot of stuff.  The National  Retail Federation says they're the world's second biggest retailer in terms  of total revenues.  They sell a lot of stuff.  And right now, over the past  16 years, the only ways you could pay out of Costco were cash, debit card  or an American Express, and then they linked the AmEx to their membership,  meaning that you could have an AmEx card linked to their membership, and  that's a reason why it's so huge.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  So, when will this -- they were negotiating, broken it off  apparently.  AmEx lost the deal with them.  When does the deal end and when  will that revenue stream stop for them?  </p><p>CHU:  March of 2016.  So, you can continue to use your AmEx card until  March of 2016.  At that point, they're going to be look for a new  replacement.  Of course, the negotiations are ongoing between Costco, any  potential partners.  </p><p>The big deal is AmEx's relationship in Canada with Costco ended this  past year as well.  They went with Capital One on a MasterCard basis.  So,  that's one of the things people look for. </p><p>Who's going to replace AmEx?  Could it be Capital One?  Maybe it's  Discover.  Maybe it's another bank using a Visa or MasterCard payment  processer.  That's to be a big deal. </p><p>HERERA:  All right.  Dom, thanks so much.  We appreciate it.  Dominic  Chu.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Despite the fall in American Express, stocks did end the  day higher, helped by a cease-fire deal between Russia and Ukraine, along  with higher oil prices, all three major indexes ended in the black for the  day.  The Dow up 110 points, it finished at 17,972, just a few points shy  of 18,000.  NASDAQ up 56, the S&amp;P gained about 20.  </p><p>HERERA:  And more now on that ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine.   It helped ease investor concerns since anymore trouble in that region could  weigh on Europe's economy.  But not all of those issues between the nations  were ironed out.  </p><p>Julia Chatterly reports from Brussels.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA CHATTERLY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Cautious  optimism from E.U. leaders I think here, leaving this meeting about the  peace deal signed between the pro-Russian separatists, Russia and the  Ukraine.  I think the fact that the talks took 17 hours into the early  hours of this morning on two important points.  One, ultimately, they were  pretty tough negotiations and two, the desperation of the lead is behind  them just to get something signed today.  </p><p>But the billion dollar question now become: will all sides abide by  the cease-fire agreement that begins at midnight on Sunday?  </p><p>There's plenty of skepticism here behind the scenes given what we've  seen in the past and so that's the spotlight now falling firmly on Russia.  </p><p>There were no talks here today about further sanctions, but I think  the message is that pressure will remain and that actions speak louder than  words.  We've left a lot of meetings bemoaning the fact that E.U. leaders  can't agree on further sanctions on Russia.  Perhaps that overshadowed and  offset today by the announcement of a collective $40 billion bailout for  Ukraine.</p><p>But behind the scenes, no illusions of the difficulty of reforming a  country that is for all intents and purposes, at war. </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Julia Chatterly in Brussels.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Onto the rapidly changing situation in Greece.  Last night,  we told you about reports that an agreement in principle had been reached  between Greece and its eurozone creditors, but that quickly fell apart.  </p><p>Michelle Caruso-Cabrera tells us now what went wrong and what might  come next.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MICHELLE CARUSO-CABRERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  It  was a night of high drama.  Many participants in yesterday's meeting  believed that they had reached a broad agreement in principle with Greece,  the details to be hammered out at another meeting this coming Monday.  But  at the last minute, Greek finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, refused to  sign the draft statement that they were supposed to release to the public  saying, he couldn't sign it after putting in a call to Athens.  </p><p>Despite that high profile breakdown, Greek stocks moved higher today  anyway.  Market participants focusing on a leaked draft of what he was  supposed to sign and it showed that the Greeks made concessions that were  unexpected.  The draft statement referred to exploring, quote, \"the  possibility of extending and successfully concluding the present program.\"   That's something Greece previously said it would never do.  And it seems  the crucial step though in order to get continued support for their banks  from the European Central Bank.  </p><p>Also adding to the optimism, a German newspaper reporting that the ECB  had agreed today to extend even more loans to Greek banks through an  emergency lending program.  In one way, this is bad news.  It shows that  the banks in Greece are still under stress.  </p><p>On the other hand, market participants say it shows the ECB is still  willing to support the country.  All of Europe's finance ministers meet  again for another negotiating session on Monday.  That day will be key to  see if they can get a solid deal hammered out.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Michelle Caruso-Cabrera.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Still ahead, negotiations at the West Coast ports are  strained and now members of Congress say they're very concerned.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  A big miss for retail sales for the second straight month.   Sales fell more than expected 0.8 percent in January.  Now, part of the  reason can be explained by the falling gas prices, which lowers receipts at  service stations.</p><p>But as Steve Liesman reports, that's only part of the story.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  A disappointing  retail sales report for January sparking an economic mystery.  If Americans  are saving more on cheap gasoline, and making more because the nation added  a million jobs over the past three months, where's the money going?  Rather  than the half percent decline expected by Wall Street, the government said  spending in America shops fell nearly a full percentage point in January.  </p><p>There was an expected 9 percent plunge in gasoline station sales, but  sales were also off at department stores, furniture outlets and auto  dealerships.  </p><p>Did the extra green bucks just vaporize?  Well, that's not the most  likely explanation.  Rather, economists on the case theorize more money is  being saved and used to pay down debt.  A recent Visa report found  consumers hanging on to roughly half of gas savings.  </p><p>Some of the money could be going to services which accounts for two- thirds of all consumer spending and is not counted in the retail goods  report.  Service spending would include increased spending on health  insurance.  </p><p>But there's another solution to the mystery: inflation or in this  case, deflation.  The number reports are not adjusted for changes in  prices.  If prices fall, Americans could be buying the same stuff but just  spending less for it.  So, when the government reports inflation adjusted  or real spending when it calculates GDP, spending could show a gain.  </p><p>Case solved?  Not quite.  Optimists aren't ready to assume consumers  won't spend the gas windfall and they think the real evidence will come in  the months ahead, when the mystery of the missing money is solved at cash  registers around the nation.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Steve Liesman in Dallas.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  A big threat to the economy is the slowdown at the West  Coast ports.  According to Guggenheim Securities, the L.A. Long Beach port  alone accounts for nearly 40 percent of country's containerized trade and  it's estimated that 12.5 percent of U.S. GDP tied to cargo moving through  those west coast ports.  </p><p>As we told you last night, work has been suspended again, this time  for four days.  </p><p>Jane Wells has more.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JANE WELLS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  On  Thursday, more than 40 container ships were either anchored off the West  Coast or we're circling, waiting for anchorage space, as work loading and  offloading ships again came to a standstill.  </p><p>ROBERT MCELLRATH, ILWU PRESIDENT:  Do not listen to PMA's (EXPLETIVE  DELETED).  Stay united.  </p><p>WELLS:  That's how strained negotiations have become between shipping  lines and terminal operators against the union representing longshoremen.   With cargo backed up, the Pacific Maritime Association or PMA representing  employers, said there was no point in hiring crews TO work vessels,  especially since Thursday, Lincoln's birthday, would require higher pay, as  much as $92 an hour for the most senior foreman.  The same pay for this  weekend and Monday's President's Day.  So, no ship work either -- as the  PMA calls the congestion which it blames on dock workers, a strike with  pay.  </p><p>STEVE GETZUG, PMA SPOKESMAN:  Every time we solve an issue that is  important, they layer on new demands.  The latest one we can't live with.  </p><p>WELLS:  According to management, the demand it cannot live with is one  by dock workers to be able to unilaterally fire arbitrators.  While the  U.S. economy could suffer as goods take weeks longer than normal to move in  and out of the West Coast, Congress is worried.  </p><p>REP.KURT SCHRADER (D), OREGON:  Well, this is clearly the greatest  threat our nation faces, notwithstanding the stuff that's going on  overseas.  </p><p>WELLS:  There would need to be a complete strike or lockout for the  president to be able to force a cooling off period and reopen the ports  under the Taft-Hartley Act.  Work is supposed to continue moving containers  out of the yard and as for negotiations which started last may -- </p><p>MCELLRATH:  We've been sitting here as I give this speech for five  days waiting for PMA and they haven't shown up yet.  </p><p>WELLS (on camera):  The PMA says negotiations were resuming today and  the reason that it hasn't met with the union at all this week is because it  says there has been no point; that while management has offered  concessions, the dock workers, quote, \"won't budge.\"</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Jane Wells at the port of Los Angeles.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  The impact of the slowdown is already being felt.   According to Goldman Sachs research, shippers have diverted cargo away from  the West Coast ports even at the expense of increased freight costs and  that's leading to a decline in intermodal volumes for companies like BNSF,  and Union Pacific.  Retailers are also rerouting shipments using air  freight and that is helping companies like FedEx and UPS.  </p><p>HERERA:  We begin our \"Market Focus\" tonight with disappointing  results from AIG.</p><p>The insurance giant saw its profit slide, hurt by weak performance in  its corporate category.  The company did announce a buy back about $2.5  billion worth of shares, which adds to the nearly $5 billion in stock that  it bought back last year.  It also declared a dividend of about 12 cents a  share that has a yield of about 1 percent.  </p><p>After the bell, the shares were volatile.  Before the close, the stock  was up 20 cents to $52.45.</p><p>It was the opposite story for CBS, which also reported after the  close.  The Tiffany network reported better-than-expected revenue on higher  ad sales, helped by Thursday night football and the ads for the midterm  elections.  That sent shares initially higher in after-hours trading.   Before the close, the shares were up nearly 2 percent to $57.77.</p><p>Inflation in Brazil and a stronger dollar took a bite out of Avon's  overseas revenue.  The cosmetics maker's results missed analysts' estimates  on both the top and bottom lines.  The company said those currency  fluctuations will continue to weigh on performance this year, as it does  most of its business outside the U.S.  But Avon also told investors it  expects its North American business to turn profitable for the first time  in three years.  Shares rose more than 1 percent to $8.69.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Kellogg still has the breakfast blues.  The Corn Flakes  maker posted a big quarterly loss and cut its forecast for long-term annual  revenue growth, as cereal sales continue to be quite sluggish.  Shares fell  4.5 percent to $63.30.</p><p>Apache also posted a quarterly loss as it wrote down the value of its  oil and gas assets.  Revenue lower than expectations also, and it announced  it is slashing its rig count by more than a third in response to crumbling  crude prices.  The stock was down slightly to $64.58.</p><p>And Time Inc. gave investors a weak sales outlook for 2015, which  weighed on shares in today's trade.  This as the publisher of magazines  like People and Sports Illustrated reported a lower-than-expected quarterly  profit, as it has been dealing with falling circulation and advertising  revenue.  Shares off almost 2 percent.  They settled at $24.49.</p><p>HERERA:  Expedia is on a shopping spree.  Its latest acquisition,  Orbitz, just a few weeks after buying Travelocity.  The deal is valued at  more than a billion dollars take on bigger rival Priceline.  Orbitz soared  on the news as did Expedia. </p><p>Simon Hobbs takes a look at how this deal changes the global online  travel industry.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SIMON HOBBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   Orbitz is one of the smallest online travel industries and would have  struggled in the future against the growing market power of giant rivals  Expedia and Priceline, who spent billions on advertising a new technology.  </p><p>So, as the saying goes, if you can't beat them, join them.  Expedia  already boasts 13 major brands.  For $1.6 billion in cash, Expedia CEO Dara  Khosrowshahi can now add the Orbitz brands the Orbitz's own CheapTickets,  ebookers and HotelClub.  Those four, he says, will be much more profitable  once he's cut $75 million in cost and gives them access to Expedia's big  stockpile of hotel rooms for sale.  </p><p>DARA KHOSROWSHAHI, EXPEDIA CEO:  We've got one of the broadest global  inventories out there and we think that the complement to the Orbitz  loyalty program, the bank program that Orbitz has.  We think that's going  to be a terrific combination.  </p><p>HOBBS (on camera):  The CEO of his target at Orbitz, Barney Harford,  is well-respected.  Over the last two years, he's reinvigorated the  business with better technology and a private label business essentially  running the back office for ad hoc sites like AmEx Travel, but ultimately  without the power of Expedia and Priceline to fit in real time for your  online business, he went for a trade sale.  </p><p>BARNEY HARFORD, ORBITZ CEO:  People may have tried to write us off in  the past, but I think they can see the continued ongoing growth really  showing through.  </p><p>HOBBS (voice-over):  It was what remains of Travelocity, that Expedia  bought three weeks ago for $280 million.  Trivago cost Expedia well over  $600 million, but rival Priceline deal's are even bigger.  OpenTable for  $2.4 billion and Kayak for $1.7 billion.  </p><p>Despite the consolidation, Dara Khosrowshahi rejects the idea that  there's a lack of competition or that the regulators should get involved.  </p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI:  We compete in a much larger segment in general and  there's lots and lots of competition for that top audience.  </p><p>HOBBS:  And for travelers shopping online, the CEO of Expedia promises  that all 17 major brands will operate with an independence that ensures  there's still a deal to be had even if they're still all owned by the same  company.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Simon Hobbs at the New York Stock  Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Coming up, what some local florists are doing to keep  businesses from wilting as competition increases and Valentine's Day  approaches.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: Business is blooming for the flower industry but not  necessarily for your local florists.  Increased competition in online  delivery companies are pinching many small business owners.  </p><p>But as Kate Rogers reports, some old-fashioned mom and pop shops are  finding an edge in order to battle back.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KATE ROGERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  This  year, more than $2 billion will be spent on flowers for Valentine's Day  alone.  But local florists like Caldwell Flowerland in New Jersey are  seeing increased competition and in some cases losses.  That's because of  big e-commerce players like 1-800-Flowers, FTD and ProFlowers.  </p><p>In fact, local florists saw their revenue slide nearly 40 percent last  year, according to IBIS, a market research group.  </p><p>Flowerland, in business 30 years, has also seen its revenue fall.  But  owner Frank Dellisanti says there's a silver lining.  </p><p>FRANK DELLISANTI, CALDWELL FLOWERLAND OWNER:  It took a little dip,  but it also educated customers where to come back to.  So, it also weeded  out other competitors, too.  </p><p>ROGERS:  Any way you spin it, there are more options than ever, a new  crop of start-ups are blooming in the flower delivery space.  Angel List  names 30 of them, including Urban Stems and Bloom That, which delivered  bouquets on demand within an hour or so.  Even Whole Foods is getting in on  the action, partnering with grocery delivery start-up Instacart in three  cities.</p><p>And then, there are the supermarkets and big box stores like Walmart.   Analysts say they could be more detrimental to local florists than  ecommerce.  Dellisanti said he has one thing on the action partnering with  grocery delivery start-up Instacart in 15 cities.  </p><p>And then, there are these supermarkets and big box stores like  Walmart.  Analysts say they could be more detrimental to local florists  than ecommerce.  </p><p>Dellisanti says he has one thing, though, that big box stores are  missing: a personal touch.  </p><p>DELLISANTI:  Yes, we try to keep a year round price and then we try to  keep the consistency and quality.  </p><p>ROGERS (on camera):  Business here at Flowerland is still pretty good.   In fact, they'll sell about 10,000 of these roses over the Valentine's Day  holiday weekend this year.  But increased competition from other ecommerce  players in the space has hurt other local florists around the country some  of whom have had to close their doors for good.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Kate Rogers in Caldwell, New Jersey.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Kate got the rose from the bachelor.  </p><p>Finally tonight, three people to fight the odds and one, the $564  million Powerball jackpot.  Two of them are not sitting here tonight.  The  tickets told in Texas, North Carolina, and Puerto Rico.  That's the first  winning Powerball ticket ever sold outside of the continental United  States.</p><p>If the winners choose the lump sum, the three would split $381 million  before taxes.  </p><p>We're both here, Sue.  </p><p>HERERA:  I know, which means we didn't win, but if you're watching,  you probably didn't either.  So, come back here tomorrow night, right?  </p><p>MATHISEN:  That's right.  We'll see you back here. </p><p>You're having a couple of days off.  I'll see you when you get back.</p><p>HERERA:  OK, thanks.</p><p>That's it for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Sue Herera.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  And I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Have a great evening.  We'll see  you back here tomorrow.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

The S&amp;P 500 closes at a new high, so do small cap stocks and the Dow Jones industrial average break through 18,000 for the first time this year. Are there more big gains ahead and where should you put your money now?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fighting cyber crime. It is one of the biggest threats to business. And today, at a summit in Silicon Valley, <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>urged cooperation with the private sector to make the Internet safe.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, February 13th.</p><p>Good evening, everyone. I`m Tyler Mathisen. Sue Herera is off tonight.</p><p>Well, the bulls are back on Wall Street turning Friday the 13th into a lucky day. The S&amp;P 500 ends the week at an all-time high. The blue chip Dow index breaks above 18,000 for the first time this year. And not to be outdone, small caps also finished the day at a record. Strong economic data out of Europe gave the markets a lift early on and hopes that Greece and its creditors will reach some sort of deal when they talks resume on Monday.</p><p>At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose nearly 47 points to 18,019, NASDAQ gained 36 points to a fresh 15-year high, and the S&amp;P 500 was up 8. For the week, the Dow rose 1 percent. The NASDAQ up more than 3 percent, best week since last October, and the S&amp;P 500 gained 2 percent.</p><p>The energy sector was helped by a 3 percent rise in West Texas crude. It is now up nearly 20 percent from its lows last month. Brent Crude back up above $60 a barrel, actually, above $61 for the first time this year. Both benchmarks have now risen for three consecutive weeks.</p><p>What`s behind the broad based run-up and is a sign the bulls will stay in control?</p><p>Dominic Chu reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOMINIC CHU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It may not feel like it for many investors but we are once again at record high levels in the stock market, at least when you look at the S&amp;P 500. The broader large cap stock index set a record intraday high today, led by energy stocks, which rallied in the back of high oil prices, and a whole slew of other companies that hit record highs as well, including coffee giant Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), home improvement retailer Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and toy maker Hasbro (NYSE:HAS).</p><p>So, will this upward move continue, and will it get more people interested in buying stocks? Uncertainty about global risks holding some investors back, but if that changes, that could help the bull run continue.</p><p>ROBERT PAVLIK, BOSTON PRIVATE WEALTH: Right now, we have some possible resolutions to things. We have Russia agreeing to a ceasefire with the Ukraine. We have the Greeks talking to the ECB and the E.U. trying to renegotiate their debt package. We have the Chinese reducing reserve requirements, and trying to expand their global economy.</p><p>CHU: And it`s not just overseas developments to keep an eye on. If the U.S. economy continues to gradually improve, that`s an upside catalyst as well.</p><p>DARIN RICHARDS, AKT WEALTH ADVISORS CIO: Our employment rate continues to move lower. The consumer is in a great spot. Consumer confidence is very high. And we could see, I think, additional spending on the retail side, which again, consumer spending is 70 percent of our economy.</p><p>CHU (on camera): Of course, those are the positive takes. The more cautious in the marketplace point out the fragility of the global economic recovery and they say that markets are priced for perfection. Meaning, if anything upsets the balance, we could be set up for more volatility ahead.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Dominic Chu.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Here to talk more about the record-setting day on Wall Street and his stock picks is this week`s market monitor, Eric Marshall, president and portfolio manager of Hodges Capital Management, the Dallas- based fund group that runs more than $2 billion.</p><p>Welcome, Eric. Good to have you with us.</p><p>How do you explain the market turnaround these past couple of weeks?</p><p>ERIC MARSHALL, HODGES CAPITAL MANAGEMENT PRESIDENT: Well, I think it`s really been a response to the commodity and some of the volatility that we`ve seen in currency markets and so forth, just kind of settling down. We`ve gotten into earnings season, corporate earnings and the outlooks that we`re hearing from companies are relatively positive, and I think it`s been a normal, you know, one step back, two steps forward.</p><p>MATHISEN: What`s it like down there in Dallas, not really the epicenter of the energy world in Texas, I guess you`d say Houston is, but you`re very close to it. A lot of the economy is dependent on it. What are people saying?</p><p>MARSHALL: Well, you know, in Dallas and in north Texas, we really haven`t seen much of an impact of lower oil prices. If you look at the Texas economy, it`s much more diversified than it was back in the early `80s when we had the big oil bust. And so, in Dallas, we haven`t seen it, and anecdotally, you hear some things from Houston but hasn`t had as big of an impact yet.</p><p>MATHISEN: Uh-huh. You know, we were speaking a couple of weeks ago here internally that we wanted to have somebody on who follows small cap stocks as we focused a lot on the blue chips and here, lo and behold, we have you on a night when the rustle is at a record high. Why? Make the case for small caps this year and I suspect that one of the arguments is that they are less prone to be whip-sawed by currency moves.</p><p>MARSHALL: Yes. We, you know, at the Hodges Funds, we don`t get too caught up in the absolute level of any market index. But within small caps, you can always find secular growth opportunities in just any type of market and to your point, they are more domestic-centric. Meaning that they have less foreign exchange exposure, they have more simplified capital structures.</p><p>So, I think it`s really a good place for active portfolio management where you can get in there and do some individual stock picking.</p><p>MATHISEN: Let`s go through some of your individual stocks beginning with Eagle Materials (NYSE:EXP). You mentioned last time you were here about a year ago, what`s been going on there? It`s down a little since then.</p><p>MARSHALL: Yes. They`re a manufacturer of cement and gypsum and wallboard. Both of those have seen very good demand, very good pricing power. The prices of both of those commodities have been rising, as the housing market and construction market continues to improve in different areas of the country.</p><p>And we really like the earnings profile of the company, the earnings power over the next couple of years. They do have a segment of their business that`s relatively small that does provide frack sand to the oil and gas industry. And as a result of that, that`s the reason why the stock is down over the past year.</p><p>But we really think you`re buying the long-term cement and gypsum wallboard business. You get the rest of the business for free at these price levels.</p><p>MATHISEN: All right. So, that`s the reason it`s been stuck in the mud there.</p><p>Jarden (NYSE:JAH) Corporation trading now at $51 and change.</p><p>MARSHALL: Yes, and this is more of a mid cap stock than a small cap stock, but it`s one we like here. They do over $8 billion in revenues and they are consumer product company. They own brands like Coleman, camping equipment, Rawlings, sporting goods. They have Mr. Coffee. They bought Yankee Candle Company here about a year and a half ago and they have a number of other brands.</p><p>And they`re seeing very good organic revenue growth in these areas, as well as some acquisition opportunities. The company throws off a lot of cash flow. They`ve been aggressively buying back their stock with that cash. And it only trades about 15 times for earnings.</p><p>MATHISEN: Quick thought on Swift Transportation, big trucker.</p><p>MARSHALL: Yes. This is another area -- when you look at the trucking business, it hasn`t been very good over the last ten years. And they`re starting to see pricing power with some of the long haul truckers, and Swift is really well-positioned to take advantage of that. They`ve started to raise prices for the first time in about 10 years. And we think with a lot of the driver shortages and lack of investment this space, we think they`re going to be very well positioned to take advantage of these trends over the next couple of years.</p><p>MATHISEN: All right. Eric, thank you very much. Have a great weekend. We appreciate it.</p><p>MARSHALL: Thank you, Tyler.</p><p>MATHISEN: Eric Marshall with Hodges Capital Management.</p><p>Well, despite higher stock prices, the sentiment unexpectedly fell in February for the first time in seven months. This is according to University of Michigan`s preliminary sentiment index. The drop in sentiment due in part apparently to the recent rise in gasoline prices, energy workers concerns about possible job losses and even the harsh winter weather in the Northeast and parts of the Midwest.</p><p>Now to what the White House calls a defining challenge of the 21st century: Cyber crime. <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>held a summit in Silicon Valley with chief executives from companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Walgreens, urging the private sector and the government to work together to make the Internet and business safer.</p><p>But as Eamon Javers reports, some big tech CEOs were no-shows.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EAMON JAVERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A clash of cultures today at Stanford University in tech-centric Silicon Valley as some of the top federal cyber security officials came here for President Obama`s cyber security summit. Raising eyebrows, some of the biggest names in technology were conspicuous no-shows, including the CEOs of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO). Silicon Valley insiders attribute the snub to continuing fallout from the Edward Snowden NSA spying revelations.</p><p>Despite that bit of tension between the East and West Coast, the president signed an executive order to encourage more cooperation between the private sector and government. And he told his audience the country needs to come together to deal with a common problem.</p><p><person><nameText>BARACK OBAMA, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Foreign governments and criminals are probing these systems every single day. We only have to think of real life examples. Air traffic control system going down and disrupting flights, or blackouts that plunge cities into darkness. To imagine what a set of systemic cyber attacks might do. So, this is also a matter of public safety.</p><p>JAVERS: Also here, Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).</p><p>TIM COOK, APPLE CEO: If those of us in positions of responsibility fail to do everything in our power to protect the right of privacy, we risk something far more valuable than money. We risk our way of life.</p><p>JAVERS (on camera): Part of that clash of cultures between the government guys and the techies is the arms race to recruit top technology talent. Federal officials here say they know they can`t compete with the Googles and the Facebooks of the world directly on salary, but they said they find ways to work around that.</p><p>ED LOWERY, U.S. SECRET SERVICE ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: We have a lot of imbeds. We put agents out here in the Silicon Valley working with the technology companies. We leverage what they can do. And again, I don`t -- the government is never is going to be able to match the pay scale, obviously, but there are plenty of patriots out there who want to be in law enforcement.</p><p>JAVERS (voice-over): For the president today, this visit to heart of the technology community, to the president it was all about bridging the differences between government and the private sector.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Eamon Javers in Stanford.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (NYSE:V) both announcing plans to expand their security features for online shopping. Visa (NYSE:V) plans to do away with traditional account numbers and instead use a unique series of numbers that can authorize payments. MasterCard (NYSE:MA), which plans to spend more than $20 million on its initiative, will let customers verify transactions using voice and fingerprints. MasterCard (NYSE:MA) plans to launch that program in the spring.</p><p>Now to the West Coast port labor dispute and Conagra. It became the latest company to blame its weak profit forecast on the traffic congestion out there. The package food company said the slowdown is hurting some products it exports. Shares of the company off 4 percent.</p><p>And as the slowdown drags on at the West Coast ports, one sector most at risk: retail. We may learn more about the extent of the impact when retailers begin reporting earnings next week, including the world`s biggest, Walmart.</p><p>As Courtney Reagan tells us, investors will pay close attention.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Consumers may be looking forward to ditching winter coats for spring apparel, but retailers are having trouble getting that spring merchandise in stores. As disputes over labor contracts continue, the West Coast ports responsible for nearly 40 percent of all U.S. cargo are shut down for a second straight weekend, which means merchandise is stuck at sea or in containers, far from the intended retail destination.</p><p>RICHARD JAFFE, STIFEL NICOLAUS RESEARCH ANALYST: I see some stores that are out of balance, still featuring what I`ll call winter and holiday goods when at this time of year, that should be relegated to the back racks on sale and the front should be all fresh new merchandise. So, the balance isn`t right.</p><p>REAGAN: Target (NYSE:TGT), Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), Michael Kors and Ralph Lauren are among the retailers that have brought in orders early to protect inventory levels and are using other points of entry and distribution to get merchandise into and through the country. Container volume at L.A., Long Beach and Oakland ports dropped 25 percent or more in January from the year prior, but despite the lower volume, the journal of commerce said some West Coast shipments that normally take two to six days to unload are now taking up to three weeks.</p><p>(on camera): Circumventing West Coast ports helps get merchandise on the shelves but it comes at a cost, up to $7 billion this year, according to some estimates. Getting cargo from Asia to the East Coast takes longer and adds to expense. Air freight is also more expensive. Both back-up plans crimping profit margins.</p><p>(voice-over): As retailers reroute goods from Asia to East Coast parts, Stifel analyst Richard Jaffe points out overflow puts those ports at max capacity.</p><p>JAFFE: The doomsday scenario, the product comes in late. The season therefore shortened. Retailers have to accelerate sales using discounts. The consumer benefits with discounted prices, but the retailers suffer because short and credit discounts.</p><p>REAGAN: Credit Suisse says brands diversified points of distribution including Nike (NYSE:NKE), Tumi, and VF Corp. should be more insulated in the short-term while Lululemon and Deckers cold suffer more because of concentrated West Coast distribution.</p><p>While contingencies are working to avoid a material impact on business, if an extended shutdown or strike occurs, industry-wide consensus, no retailer goes unaffected.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Courtney Reagan.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Still ahead, how the steep drop in crude prices in recent months has one city on edge, wondering if its housing rebound could fall apart.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN: The number of U.S. oil rigs continues to fall according to Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI). Drillers idled 98 rigs this week bringing the rig count down 30 percent since October, a very steep fall there. Some look to rig counts as a leading indicator of production since they are used to drill new wells. U.S. oil production overall remains at multi-decade highs.</p><p>Now to Texas, the state driven by a strong energy focused economy. It is suddenly now feeling the impact of oil prices that are now about half their year-ago levels, though up from their lows. Layoffs being announced at big energy firms and if the unemployment rate rises, the Houston housing market could eventually feel a bit of a chill.</p><p>Diana Olick has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): David Hopkins sold his Houston-area home last fall for top dollar. He says he timed the market just right.</p><p>DAVID HOPKINS, HOME SELLER: I feel really glad. I`m like that guy that sold his oil company last year. He`s feeling pretty good too. I feel the same way.</p><p>OLICK: Both home sales and prices hit record levels in Houston last year fueled by a booming energy sector. With oil prices now cut in half, Houston is already losing jobs, the primary driver for housing.</p><p>MICHELLE MORANO: Now that oil prices are down, things haven`t completely changed but let`s just say that things have come to more a stall.</p><p>OLICK: It will take significant time for the drop in oil prices to trickle down to Houston`s housing market. In previous oil downturns, it`s taken eight months to two years for job losses to factor into home prices. But all eyes are on Houston now with the oil industry accounting for about 5.6 percent of its jobs. This especially because it was the nation`s hottest housing market barely a year ago and is still growing. Single family Houston home sales jumped 6 percent in January from a year ago and prices hit a record high up 7 percent from a year ago.</p><p>The only problem now is supply, barely 2.5 months due to all the demand.</p><p>This as builders start to get careful. KB Home`s CEO last month said the builder had pulled out of a couple of land transactions in the fourth quarter because of, quote, \"sensitivity\" there. But they claim they are not seeing any pullback yet by consumers.</p><p>RICK SHARGA, AUCTION.COM: Because it hasn`t been hit yet doesn`t mean it`s not going to happen. So, I think patience is the buzz word. We`re expecting that Houston will cool down significantly on the residential side.</p><p>OLICK (on camera): Just for context, energy has really pushed housing recently. According to Trulia, in the seven large metros where oil-related jobs are at least 2 percent of the total, home prices rose 10.5 percent year over year last year. That`s a lot faster than the rest of the nation. Now the reverse is in play.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: For more on the state of housing in Houston, head to our Web site, NBR.com.</p><p>Well, powerhouse brands help bolster VF Corp`s results. And that is where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The parent of brands like the North Face and Vans reported results that matched on both the top and bottom lines. Profit did fall from last year, as the company booked a write-down on the value of some of its brands and the company warned investors about negative effects from currency fluctuations for 2015. But revenue still rose on strength in its outdoor and action sports division. I know no kid in my town who doesn`t own a North Face jacket. Shares popped 6 percent to $75.26.</p><p>Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) is jacking up its dividend by 12 percent to 37 cents a share. The new payout will be made to shareholders in March. The yield on the dividend is up more than 1.5 percent. Shares spiked initially in after-hours trading. Before the close, the stock was up a fraction to $79.41.</p><p>And Smucker -- J.M. Smucker (NYSE:SJM) that would be -- reported mixed results today, with revenue missing estimates. The owner of Folgers coffee said weakness in its coffee business weighed on results, but it`s expecting business to get caffeinated again this year as prices stabilize. Shares were up more than 1 percent to $113.89.</p><p>And Alibaba has received a request for information from the SEC. The agency is looking for information related to its interaction with a Chinese regulator. Alibaba says it`s cooperating with the request. Shares fell initially in after-hours trading. Before the bell, the stock was up 2 percent to $89.05.</p><p>A rising economic tide lifts all boats and that is especially true for the boating industry as the economy improves and people feel better about making big purchases. Boat manufacturers expecting solid sales growth this year and they`re kicking off their season as they so often do in Miami where thousands of boats are on display at two separate shows.</p><p>Morgan Brennan is there.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A big weekend for boat enthusiasts as more than a hundred thousand people descend in Miami for two annual boat shows. Brokers say business is finally recovering.</p><p>MARK ELLIOTT: Over the last two years, we`ve seen slow improvement and it`s directly related to the stock market. As the stock market inches up, our phone calls increase. So, with the stock market being in chartered territory and demand pent up, people are buying yachts.</p><p>BRENNAN: And it`s not just luxury, but water crafts. The National Marine Manufacturers Association estimates sales of new recreational boats grew as much as 8 percent last year and it expects that momentum to continue.</p><p>THOM DAMMRICH, NATIONAL MARINE MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION: As we look out over the next few years, we think we`ve got three or more years of pretty good growth in new boat sales.</p><p>BRENNAN: That`s good news for an industry rocked by the recession. When new sales plunged to 60 percent and one third of retailers closed up shop. Since then, to recapture consumers, companies have had to change their strategies rolling out new models at lower price points.</p><p>Industry leader Brunswick (NYSE:BC) Corporation says demand comes from both ends of the consumer spectrum.</p><p>DUSTY MCCOY, BRUNSWICK CORP. CEO: A lot of bigger models completely sold out over a year and then pontoons, fishing boats which tend to be smaller, different income level have also now begun to reach prerecession level. So, at one at the end market, the other end, market is very powerful, very strong and growing very much.</p><p>BRENNAN (on camera): So, what`s fueling demand for all of these boats? An improving labor market, rising consumer confidence and increasing disposable income thanks in part to lower gas prices.</p><p>(voice-over): But for now here in Miami, people are buying boats and with thousands to choose from, from inflatables to runabouts to yachts, there`s something here for everyone.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Morgan Brennan in Miami.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Coming up, money and marriage. Why planning a different kind of date this Valentine`s Day could lead to not only marital bliss but also financial harmony.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN: The window to enroll in health care under the Affordable Care Act quickly closing. Midnight Sunday is the deadline for coverage this year and those who don`t enroll may be subject to a penalty. Federal officials say they`ve seen a big pick-up in traffic on the healthcare.gov Web site over the past few days.</p><p>Well, 2014 was a rough year for Atlantic City but this year, so far, off to a more encouraging start. Casino revenue for January was up almost 19 percent compared with a year ago, even though they`ve shut down a lot of casinos. Part of the reason is less competition for the eight casinos that are still there.</p><p>Well, looking for a Valentine`s Day gift for your significant other? You might want to forget the flowers and chocolate and instead plan a date -- a money date -- because as Sharon Epperson tells us, that could be the most valuable gift of all.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SHARON EPPERSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Mark and Evan Elkowitz have been married for 18 years. They like to talk about everything, even money.</p><p>MARC ELKOWITZ, HUSBAND: We certainly have conversations about money.</p><p>EVAN ELKOWITZ, WIFE: Sometimes they`re not called conversations.</p><p>MARC ELKOWITZ: Sometimes, they are more like avoiding injury than conversation.</p><p>EPPERSON: Like many couples, they have occasional arguments about money, too.</p><p>ELLEN ROGIN, AUTHOR: Many people weren`t brought up learning how to talk about money with their partners. So, maybe your parents didn`t talk about money in front of you or maybe didn`t even talk about money at all, or they thought about it.</p><p>EPPERSON (voice-over): It`s a crucial conversation to have. But nearly 40 percent of couples in a Citi Double Cash survey said they haven`t set aside time to talk about their finances in the past year. About 30 percent wish they discussed it more.</p><p>ROGIN: Yes, scheduling a time to get together, it can be a fun, like, go out and have a date. It doesn`t have to be something hard and boring to sit and talk about.</p><p>EVAN ELKOWITZ: I think planning a date in general is a hard thing.</p><p>MARC ELKOWITZ: A fun date, let alone an accounting date.</p><p>EVAN ELKOWITZ: Right.</p><p>EPPERSON: The Elkowitzes find the time to have their money talks in other ways. They divide and conquer when it comes to managing the family finances.</p><p>EVAN ELKOWITZ: I pay all the bills, by the way. Yes, I pay all the bills.</p><p>EPPERSON: Marc, a plastic surgeon, the primary bred winner, while Evan, a personal stylist, handles everyday spending.</p><p>MARC ELKOWITZ: It stresses me out. I don`t want to know. I`d rather be in the OR taking care of stuff than look at a phone bill.</p><p>EVAN ELKOWITZ: A phone bill isn`t bad.</p><p>MARC ELKOWITZ: Or a credit card bill.</p><p>EPPERSON: The Elkowitzes try to strike a balance that keeps both of them involved and honest about what they own and what they owe.</p><p>But when it comes to love and money, not all couples are as transparent. In the Citi survey, nearly one in four in a committed relationship admit they have a private account that their significant other doesn`t know about. Yet many more admits they would prefer if their significant other discuss finances more often.</p><p>ROGIN: You really need to come clean with your money. So, if you have a secret, whether a hidden account or debt that`s out there or spending that you`re not telling your partner about, maybe you spend cash that they don`t know what you spend money about, or you hide bags in your trunk or in the back of your closet, and come clean, because it`s really hard to have marital bliss if there`s not financial harmony.</p><p>EPPERSON: Money advice to whether those challenging times for better or worse.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Sharon Epperson.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.

The  S&amp;P 500 closes at a new high, so do small cap stocks and the Dow Jones  industrial average break through 18,000 for the first time this year.  Are  there more big gains ahead and where should you put your money now?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fighting cyber crime.  It is one of the biggest threats to business.   And today, at a summit in Silicon Valley, President Obama urged cooperation  with the private sector to make the Internet safe.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday,  February 13th.</p><p>Good evening, everyone.  I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Sue Herera is off  tonight.  </p><p>Well, the bulls are back on Wall Street turning Friday the 13th into a  lucky day.  The S&amp;P 500 ends the week at an all-time high.  The blue chip  Dow index breaks above 18,000 for the first time this year.  And not to be  outdone, small caps also finished the day at a record.  Strong economic  data out of Europe gave the markets a lift early on and hopes that Greece  and its creditors will reach some sort of deal when they talks resume on  Monday.  </p><p>At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose nearly 47 points  to 18,019, NASDAQ gained 36 points to a fresh 15-year high, and the S&amp;P 500  was up 8.  For the week, the Dow rose 1 percent.  The NASDAQ up more than 3  percent, best week since last October, and the S&amp;P 500 gained 2 percent.  </p><p>The energy sector was helped by a 3 percent rise in West Texas crude.   It is now up nearly 20 percent from its lows last month.  Brent Crude back  up above $60 a barrel, actually, above $61 for the first time this year.   Both benchmarks have now risen for three consecutive weeks.  </p><p>What's behind the broad based run-up and is a sign the bulls will stay  in control?  </p><p>Dominic Chu reports.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOMINIC CHU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  It  may not feel like it for many investors but we are once again at record  high levels in the stock market, at least when you look at the S&amp;P 500.   The broader large cap stock index set a record intraday high today, led by  energy stocks, which rallied in the back of high oil prices, and a whole  slew of other companies that hit record highs as well, including coffee  giant Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), home improvement retailer Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) and toy maker Hasbro (NYSE:HAS).  </p><p>So, will this upward move continue, and will it get more people  interested in buying stocks?  Uncertainty about global risks holding some  investors back, but if that changes, that could help the bull run continue.  </p><p>ROBERT PAVLIK, BOSTON PRIVATE WEALTH:  Right now, we have some  possible resolutions to things.  We have Russia agreeing to a ceasefire  with the Ukraine.  We have the Greeks talking to the ECB and the E.U.  trying to renegotiate their debt package.  We have the Chinese reducing  reserve requirements, and trying to expand their global economy.  </p><p>CHU:  And it's not just overseas developments to keep an eye on.  If  the U.S. economy continues to gradually improve, that's an upside catalyst  as well.  </p><p>DARIN RICHARDS, AKT WEALTH ADVISORS CIO:  Our employment rate  continues to move lower.  The consumer is in a great spot.  Consumer  confidence is very high.  And we could see, I think, additional spending on  the retail side, which again, consumer spending is 70 percent of our  economy.  </p><p>CHU (on camera):  Of course, those are the positive takes.  The more  cautious in the marketplace point out the fragility of the global economic  recovery and they say that markets are priced for perfection.  Meaning, if  anything upsets the balance, we could be set up for more volatility ahead.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Dominic Chu.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Here to talk more about the record-setting day on Wall  Street and his stock picks is this week's market monitor, Eric Marshall,  president and portfolio manager of Hodges Capital Management, the Dallas- based fund group that runs more than $2 billion.  </p><p>Welcome, Eric.  Good to have you with us.  </p><p>How do you explain the market turnaround these past couple of weeks?  </p><p>ERIC MARSHALL, HODGES CAPITAL MANAGEMENT PRESIDENT:  Well, I think  it's really been a response to the commodity and some of the volatility  that we've seen in currency markets and so forth, just kind of settling  down.  We've gotten into earnings season, corporate earnings and the  outlooks that we're hearing from companies are relatively positive, and I  think it's been a normal, you know, one step back, two steps forward.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  What's it like down there in Dallas, not really the  epicenter of the energy world in Texas, I guess you'd say Houston is, but  you're very close to it.  A lot of the economy is dependent on it.  What  are people saying?  </p><p>MARSHALL:  Well, you know, in Dallas and in north Texas, we really  haven't seen much of an impact of lower oil prices.  If you look at the  Texas economy, it's much more diversified than it was back in the early  '80s when we had the big oil bust.  And so, in Dallas, we haven't seen it,  and anecdotally, you hear some things from Houston but hasn't had as big of  an impact yet. </p><p>MATHISEN:  Uh-huh.  You know, we were speaking a couple of weeks ago  here internally that we wanted to have somebody on who follows small cap  stocks as we focused a lot on the blue chips and here, lo and behold, we  have you on a night when the rustle is at a record high.  Why?  Make the  case for small caps this year and I suspect that one of the arguments is  that they are less prone to be whip-sawed by currency moves.  </p><p>MARSHALL:  Yes.  We, you know, at the Hodges Funds, we don't get too  caught up in the absolute level of any market index.  But within small  caps, you can always find secular growth opportunities in just any type of  market and to your point, they are more domestic-centric.  Meaning that  they have less foreign exchange exposure, they have more simplified capital  structures.  </p><p>So, I think it's really a good place for active portfolio management  where you can get in there and do some individual stock picking.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Let's go through some of your individual stocks beginning  with Eagle Materials (NYSE:EXP).  You mentioned last time you were here  about a year ago, what's been going on there?  It's down a little since  then.  </p><p>MARSHALL:  Yes.  They're a manufacturer of cement and gypsum and  wallboard.  Both of those have seen very good demand, very good pricing  power.  The prices of both of those commodities have been rising, as the  housing market and construction market continues to improve in different  areas of the country.  </p><p>And we really like the earnings profile of the company, the earnings  power over the next couple of years.  They do have a segment of their  business that's relatively small that does provide frack sand to the oil  and gas industry.  And as a result of that, that's the reason why the stock  is down over the past year.  </p><p>But we really think you're buying the long-term cement and gypsum  wallboard business.  You get the rest of the business for free at these  price levels.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  All right.  So, that's the reason it's been stuck in the  mud there.  </p><p>Jarden (NYSE:JAH) Corporation trading now at $51 and change.  </p><p>MARSHALL:  Yes, and this is more of a mid cap stock than a small cap  stock, but it's one we like here.  They do over $8 billion in revenues and  they are consumer product company.  They own brands like Coleman, camping  equipment, Rawlings, sporting goods.  They have Mr. Coffee.  They bought  Yankee Candle Company here about a year and a half ago and they have a  number of other brands.  </p><p>And they're seeing very good organic revenue growth in these areas, as  well as some acquisition opportunities.  The company throws off a lot of  cash flow.  They've been aggressively buying back their stock with that  cash.  And it only trades about 15 times for earnings.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Quick thought on Swift Transportation, big trucker.  </p><p>MARSHALL:  Yes.  This is another area -- when you look at the trucking  business, it hasn't been very good over the last ten years.  And they're  starting to see pricing power with some of the long haul truckers, and  Swift is really well-positioned to take advantage of that.  They've started  to raise prices for the first time in about 10 years.  And we think with a  lot of the driver shortages and lack of investment this space, we think  they're going to be very well positioned to take advantage of these trends  over the next couple of years.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  All right.  Eric, thank you very much.  Have a great  weekend.  We appreciate it.  </p><p>MARSHALL:  Thank you, Tyler.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Eric Marshall with Hodges Capital Management.  </p><p>Well, despite higher stock prices, the sentiment unexpectedly fell in  February for the first time in seven months.  This is according to  University of Michigan's preliminary sentiment index.  The drop in  sentiment due in part apparently to the recent rise in gasoline prices,  energy workers concerns about possible job losses and even the harsh winter  weather in the Northeast and parts of the Midwest.  </p><p>Now to what the White House calls a defining challenge of the 21st  century: Cyber crime.  President Obama held a summit in Silicon Valley with  chief executives from companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Bank of America  (NYSE:BAC), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Walgreens, urging the private sector  and the government to work together to make the Internet and business  safer.  </p><p>But as Eamon Javers reports, some big tech CEOs were no-shows.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EAMON JAVERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A  clash of cultures today at Stanford University in tech-centric Silicon  Valley as some of the top federal cyber security officials came here for  President Obama's cyber security summit.  Raising eyebrows, some of the  biggest names in technology were conspicuous no-shows, including the CEOs  of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO).   Silicon Valley insiders attribute the snub to continuing fallout from the  Edward Snowden NSA spying revelations.  </p><p>Despite that bit of tension between the East and West Coast, the  president signed an executive order to encourage more cooperation between  the private sector and government.  And he told his audience the country  needs to come together to deal with a common problem.  </p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Foreign governments and  criminals are probing these systems every single day.  We only have to  think of real life examples.  Air traffic control system going down and  disrupting flights, or blackouts that plunge cities into darkness.  To  imagine what a set of systemic cyber attacks might do.  So, this is also a  matter of public safety.  </p><p>JAVERS:  Also here, Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  </p><p>TIM COOK, APPLE CEO:  If those of us in positions of responsibility  fail to do everything in our power to protect the right of privacy, we risk  something far more valuable than money.  We risk our way of life.  </p><p>JAVERS (on camera):  Part of that clash of cultures between the  government guys and the techies is the arms race to recruit top technology  talent.  Federal officials here say they know they can't compete with the  Googles and the Facebooks of the world directly on salary, but they said  they find ways to work around that.  </p><p>ED LOWERY, U.S. SECRET SERVICE ASSISTANT DIRECTOR:  We have a lot of  imbeds.  We put agents out here in the Silicon Valley working with the  technology companies.  We leverage what they can do.  And again, I don't --  the government is never is going to be able to match the pay scale,  obviously, but there are plenty of patriots out there who want to be in law  enforcement.  </p><p>JAVERS (voice-over):  For the president today, this visit to heart of  the technology community, to the president it was all about bridging the  differences between government and the private sector.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Eamon Javers in Stanford.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (NYSE:V) both announcing  plans to expand their security features for online shopping.  Visa (NYSE:V)  plans to do away with traditional account numbers and instead use a unique  series of numbers that can authorize payments.  MasterCard (NYSE:MA), which  plans to spend more than $20 million on its initiative, will let customers  verify transactions using voice and fingerprints.  MasterCard (NYSE:MA)  plans to launch that program in the spring.  </p><p>Now to the West Coast port labor dispute and Conagra.  It became the  latest company to blame its weak profit forecast on the traffic congestion  out there.  The package food company said the slowdown is hurting some  products it exports.  Shares of the company off 4 percent.  </p><p>And as the slowdown drags on at the West Coast ports, one sector most  at risk: retail.  We may learn more about the extent of the impact when  retailers begin reporting earnings next week, including the world's  biggest, Walmart.  </p><p>As Courtney Reagan tells us, investors will pay close attention.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   Consumers may be looking forward to ditching winter coats for spring  apparel, but retailers are having trouble getting that spring merchandise  in stores.  As disputes over labor contracts continue, the West Coast ports  responsible for nearly 40 percent of all U.S. cargo are shut down for a  second straight weekend, which means merchandise is stuck at sea or in  containers, far from the intended retail destination.  </p><p>RICHARD JAFFE, STIFEL NICOLAUS RESEARCH ANALYST:  I see some stores  that are out of balance, still featuring what I'll call winter and holiday  goods when at this time of year, that should be relegated to the back racks  on sale and the front should be all fresh new merchandise.  So, the balance  isn't right.  </p><p>REAGAN:  Target (NYSE:TGT), Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), Michael Kors and  Ralph Lauren are among the retailers that have brought in orders early to  protect inventory levels and are using other points of entry and  distribution to get merchandise into and through the country.  Container  volume at L.A., Long Beach and Oakland ports dropped 25 percent or more in  January from the year prior, but despite the lower volume, the journal of  commerce said some West Coast shipments that normally take two to six days  to unload are now taking up to three weeks.  </p><p>(on camera):  Circumventing West Coast ports helps get merchandise on  the shelves but it comes at a cost, up to $7 billion this year, according  to some estimates.  Getting cargo from Asia to the East Coast takes longer  and adds to expense.  Air freight is also more expensive.  Both back-up  plans crimping profit margins.  </p><p>(voice-over):  As retailers reroute goods from Asia to East Coast  parts, Stifel analyst Richard Jaffe points out overflow puts those ports at  max capacity.  </p><p>JAFFE:  The doomsday scenario, the product comes in late.  The season  therefore shortened.  Retailers have to accelerate sales using discounts.   The consumer benefits with discounted prices, but the retailers suffer  because short and credit discounts.  </p><p>REAGAN:  Credit Suisse says brands diversified points of distribution  including Nike (NYSE:NKE), Tumi, and VF Corp. should be more insulated in  the short-term while Lululemon and Deckers cold suffer more because of  concentrated West Coast distribution.  </p><p>While contingencies are working to avoid a material impact on  business, if an extended shutdown or strike occurs, industry-wide  consensus, no retailer goes unaffected.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Courtney Reagan.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Still ahead, how the steep drop in crude prices in recent  months has one city on edge, wondering if its housing rebound could fall  apart.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN:  The number of U.S. oil rigs continues to fall according to  Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI).  Drillers idled 98 rigs this week bringing the rig  count down 30 percent since October, a very steep fall there.  Some look to  rig counts as a leading indicator of production since they are used to  drill new wells.  U.S. oil production overall remains at multi-decade  highs.  </p><p>Now to Texas, the state driven by a strong energy focused economy.  It  is suddenly now feeling the impact of oil prices that are now about half  their year-ago levels, though up from their lows.  Layoffs being announced  at big energy firms and if the unemployment rate rises, the Houston housing  market could eventually feel a bit of a chill.  </p><p>Diana Olick has more.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   David Hopkins sold his Houston-area home last fall for top dollar.  He says  he timed the market just right.  </p><p>DAVID HOPKINS, HOME SELLER:  I feel really glad.  I'm like that guy  that sold his oil company last year.  He's feeling pretty good too.  I feel  the same way.  </p><p>OLICK:  Both home sales and prices hit record levels in Houston last  year fueled by a booming energy sector.  With oil prices now cut in half,  Houston is already losing jobs, the primary driver for housing.  </p><p>MICHELLE MORANO:  Now that oil prices are down, things haven't  completely changed but let's just say that things have come to more a  stall.  </p><p>OLICK:  It will take significant time for the drop in oil prices to  trickle down to Houston's housing market.  In previous oil downturns, it's  taken eight months to two years for job losses to factor into home prices.   But all eyes are on Houston now with the oil industry accounting for about  5.6 percent of its jobs.  This especially because it was the nation's  hottest housing market barely a year ago and is still growing.  Single  family Houston home sales jumped 6 percent in January from a year ago and  prices hit a record high up 7 percent from a year ago.  </p><p>The only problem now is supply, barely 2.5 months due to all the  demand.  </p><p>This as builders start to get careful.  KB Home's CEO last month said  the builder had pulled out of a couple of land transactions in the fourth  quarter because of, quote, \"sensitivity\" there.  But they claim they are  not seeing any pullback yet by consumers.  </p><p>RICK SHARGA, AUCTION.COM:  Because it hasn't been hit yet doesn't mean  it's not going to happen.  So, I think patience is the buzz word.  We're  expecting that Houston will cool down significantly on the residential  side.  </p><p>OLICK (on camera):  Just for context, energy has really pushed housing  recently.  According to Trulia, in the seven large metros where oil-related  jobs are at least 2 percent of the total, home prices rose 10.5 percent  year over year last year.  That's a lot faster than the rest of the nation.   Now the reverse is in play.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Diana Olick in Washington.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  For more on the state of housing in Houston, head to our  Web site, NBR.com.  </p><p>Well, powerhouse brands help bolster VF Corp's results.  And that is  where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The parent of brands like the North Face and Vans reported results  that matched on both the top and bottom lines.  Profit did fall from last  year, as the company booked a write-down on the value of some of its brands  and the company warned investors about negative effects from currency  fluctuations for 2015.  But revenue still rose on strength in its outdoor  and action sports division.  I know no kid in my town who doesn't own a  North Face jacket.  Shares popped 6 percent to $75.26.</p><p>Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) is jacking up its dividend by 12 percent to 37  cents a share.  The new payout will be made to shareholders in March.  The  yield on the dividend is up more than 1.5 percent.  Shares spiked initially  in after-hours trading.  Before the close, the stock was up a fraction to  $79.41.</p><p>And Smucker -- J.M. Smucker (NYSE:SJM) that would be -- reported mixed  results today, with revenue missing estimates.  The owner of Folgers coffee  said weakness in its coffee business weighed on results, but it's expecting  business to get caffeinated again this year as prices stabilize.  Shares  were up more than 1 percent to $113.89.</p><p>And Alibaba has received a request for information from the SEC.  The  agency is looking for information related to its interaction with a Chinese  regulator.  Alibaba says it's cooperating with the request.  Shares fell  initially in after-hours trading.  Before the bell, the stock was up 2  percent to $89.05.</p><p>A rising economic tide lifts all boats and that is especially true for  the boating industry as the economy improves and people feel better about  making big purchases.  Boat manufacturers expecting solid sales growth this  year and they're kicking off their season as they so often do in Miami  where thousands of boats are on display at two separate shows. </p><p>Morgan Brennan is there.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A  big weekend for boat enthusiasts as more than a hundred thousand people  descend in Miami for two annual boat shows.  Brokers say business is  finally recovering.  </p><p>MARK ELLIOTT:  Over the last two years, we've seen slow improvement  and it's directly related to the stock market.  As the stock market inches  up, our phone calls increase.  So, with the stock market being in chartered  territory and demand pent up, people are buying yachts.  </p><p>BRENNAN:  And it's not just luxury, but water crafts.  The National  Marine Manufacturers Association estimates sales of new recreational boats  grew as much as 8 percent last year and it expects that momentum to  continue.  </p><p>THOM DAMMRICH, NATIONAL MARINE MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION:  As we look  out over the next few years, we think we've got three or more years of  pretty good growth in new boat sales.  </p><p>BRENNAN:  That's good news for an industry rocked by the recession.   When new sales plunged to 60 percent and one third of retailers closed up  shop.  Since then, to recapture consumers, companies have had to change  their strategies rolling out new models at lower price points. </p><p>Industry leader Brunswick (NYSE:BC) Corporation says demand comes from  both ends of the consumer spectrum.  </p><p>DUSTY MCCOY, BRUNSWICK CORP. CEO:  A lot of bigger models completely  sold out over a year and then pontoons, fishing boats which tend to be  smaller, different income level have also now begun to reach prerecession  level.  So, at one at the end market, the other end, market is very  powerful, very strong and growing very much.  </p><p>BRENNAN (on camera):  So, what's fueling demand for all of these  boats?  An improving labor market, rising consumer confidence and  increasing disposable income thanks in part to lower gas prices.  </p><p>(voice-over):  But for now here in Miami, people are buying boats and  with thousands to choose from, from inflatables to runabouts to yachts,  there's something here for everyone.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Morgan Brennan in Miami.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Coming up, money and marriage.  Why planning a different  kind of date this Valentine's Day could lead to not only marital bliss but  also financial harmony.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN:  The window to enroll in health care under the Affordable  Care Act quickly closing.  Midnight Sunday is the deadline for coverage  this year and those who don't enroll may be subject to a penalty.  Federal  officials say they've seen a big pick-up in traffic on the healthcare.gov  Web site over the past few days.  </p><p>Well, 2014 was a rough year for Atlantic City but this year, so far,  off to a more encouraging start.  Casino revenue for January was up almost  19 percent compared with a year ago, even though they've shut down a lot of  casinos.  Part of the reason is less competition for the eight casinos that  are still there.  </p><p>Well, looking for a Valentine's Day gift for your significant other?   You might want to forget the flowers and chocolate and instead plan a date  -- a money date -- because as Sharon Epperson tells us, that could be the  most valuable gift of all.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SHARON EPPERSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   Mark and Evan Elkowitz have been married for 18 years.  They like to talk  about everything, even money.  </p><p>MARC ELKOWITZ, HUSBAND:  We certainly have conversations about money.  </p><p>EVAN ELKOWITZ, WIFE:  Sometimes they're not called conversations.  </p><p>MARC ELKOWITZ:  Sometimes, they are more like avoiding injury than  conversation.  </p><p>EPPERSON:  Like many couples, they have occasional arguments about  money, too. </p><p>ELLEN ROGIN, AUTHOR:  Many people weren't brought up learning how to  talk about money with their partners.  So, maybe your parents didn't talk  about money in front of you or maybe didn't even talk about money at all,  or they thought about it.  </p><p>EPPERSON (voice-over):  It's a crucial conversation to have.  But  nearly 40 percent of couples in a Citi Double Cash survey said they haven't  set aside time to talk about their finances in the past year.  About 30  percent wish they discussed it more.  </p><p>ROGIN:  Yes, scheduling a time to get together, it can be a fun, like,  go out and have a date.  It doesn't have to be something hard and boring to  sit and talk about.  </p><p>EVAN ELKOWITZ:  I think planning a date in general is a hard thing.  </p><p>MARC ELKOWITZ:  A fun date, let alone an accounting date.  </p><p>EVAN ELKOWITZ:  Right.</p><p>EPPERSON:  The Elkowitzes find the time to have their money talks in  other ways.  They divide and conquer when it comes to managing the family  finances.</p><p>EVAN ELKOWITZ:  I pay all the bills, by the way.  Yes, I pay all the  bills.  </p><p>EPPERSON:  Marc, a plastic surgeon, the primary bred winner, while  Evan, a personal stylist, handles everyday spending.  </p><p>MARC ELKOWITZ:  It stresses me out.  I don't want to know.  I'd rather  be in the OR taking care of stuff than look at a phone bill.  </p><p>EVAN ELKOWITZ:  A phone bill isn't bad.  </p><p>MARC ELKOWITZ:  Or a credit card bill.  </p><p>EPPERSON:  The Elkowitzes try to strike a balance that keeps both of  them involved and honest about what they own and what they owe.  </p><p>But when it comes to love and money, not all couples are as  transparent.  In the Citi survey, nearly one in four in a committed  relationship admit they have a private account that their significant other  doesn't know about.  Yet many more admits they would prefer if their  significant other discuss finances more often.  </p><p>ROGIN:  You really need to come clean with your money.  So, if you  have a secret, whether a hidden account or debt that's out there or  spending that you're not telling your partner about, maybe you spend cash  that they don't know what you spend money about, or you hide bags in your  trunk or in the back of your closet, and come clean, because it's really  hard to have marital bliss if there's not financial harmony.  </p><p>EPPERSON:  Money advice to whether those challenging times for better  or worse.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Sharon Epperson.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I'm Tyler  Mathisen.  Thanks for watching.  Have a great long weekend, everyone, and  we'll see you back here Monday for a special holiday edition of NIGHTLY  BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

The  S&amp;P 500 closes at a new high, so do small cap stocks and the Dow Jones  industrial average break through 18,000 for the first time this year.  Are  there more big gains ahead and where should you put your money now?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Fighting cyber crime.  It is one of the biggest threats to business.   And today, at a summit in Silicon Valley, President Obama urged cooperation  with the private sector to make the Internet safe.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  All that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday,  February 13th.</p><p>  Good evening, everyone.  I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Sue Herera is off  tonight.  </p><p>  Well, the bulls are back on Wall Street turning Friday the 13th into a  lucky day.  The S&amp;P 500 ends the week at an all-time high.  The blue chip  Dow index breaks above 18,000 for the first time this year.  And not to be  outdone, small caps also finished the day at a record.  Strong economic  data out of Europe gave the markets a lift early on and hopes that Greece  and its creditors will reach some sort of deal when they talks resume on  Monday.  </p><p>  At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose nearly 47 points  to 18,019, NASDAQ gained 36 points to a fresh 15-year high, and the S&amp;P 500  was up 8.  For the week, the Dow rose 1 percent.  The NASDAQ up more than 3  percent, best week since last October, and the S&amp;P 500 gained 2 percent.  </p><p>  The energy sector was helped by a 3 percent rise in West Texas crude.   It is now up nearly 20 percent from its lows last month.  Brent Crude back  up above $60 a barrel, actually, above $61 for the first time this year.   Both benchmarks have now risen for three consecutive weeks.  </p><p>  What's behind the broad based run-up and is a sign the bulls will stay  in control?  </p><p>  Dominic Chu reports.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  DOMINIC CHU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  It  may not feel like it for many investors but we are once again at record  high levels in the stock market, at least when you look at the S&amp;P 500.   The broader large cap stock index set a record intraday high today, led by  energy stocks, which rallied in the back of high oil prices, and a whole  slew of other companies that hit record highs as well, including coffee  giant Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), home improvement retailer Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) and toy maker Hasbro (NYSE:HAS).  </p><p>  So, will this upward move continue, and will it get more people  interested in buying stocks?  Uncertainty about global risks holding some  investors back, but if that changes, that could help the bull run continue.  </p><p>  ROBERT PAVLIK, BOSTON PRIVATE WEALTH:  Right now, we have some  possible resolutions to things.  We have Russia agreeing to a ceasefire  with the Ukraine.  We have the Greeks talking to the ECB and the E.U.  trying to renegotiate their debt package.  We have the Chinese reducing  reserve requirements, and trying to expand their global economy.  </p><p>  CHU:  And it's not just overseas developments to keep an eye on.  If  the U.S. economy continues to gradually improve, that's an upside catalyst  as well.  </p><p>  DARIN RICHARDS, AKT WEALTH ADVISORS CIO:  Our employment rate  continues to move lower.  The consumer is in a great spot.  Consumer  confidence is very high.  And we could see, I think, additional spending on  the retail side, which again, consumer spending is 70 percent of our  economy.  </p><p>  CHU (on camera):  Of course, those are the positive takes.  The more  cautious in the marketplace point out the fragility of the global economic  recovery and they say that markets are priced for perfection.  Meaning, if  anything upsets the balance, we could be set up for more volatility ahead.  </p><p>  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Dominic Chu.  </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  MATHISEN:  Here to talk more about the record-setting day on Wall  Street and his stock picks is this week's market monitor, Eric Marshall,  president and portfolio manager of Hodges Capital Management, the Dallas- based fund group that runs more than $2 billion.  </p><p>  Welcome, Eric.  Good to have you with us.  </p><p>  How do you explain the market turnaround these past couple of weeks?  </p><p>  ERIC MARSHALL, HODGES CAPITAL MANAGEMENT PRESIDENT:  Well, I think  it's really been a response to the commodity and some of the volatility  that we've seen in currency markets and so forth, just kind of settling  down.  We've gotten into earnings season, corporate earnings and the  outlooks that we're hearing from companies are relatively positive, and I  think it's been a normal, you know, one step back, two steps forward.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  What's it like down there in Dallas, not really the  epicenter of the energy world in Texas, I guess you'd say Houston is, but  you're very close to it.  A lot of the economy is dependent on it.  What  are people saying?  </p><p>  MARSHALL:  Well, you know, in Dallas and in north Texas, we really  haven't seen much of an impact of lower oil prices.  If you look at the  Texas economy, it's much more diversified than it was back in the early  '80s when we had the big oil bust.  And so, in Dallas, we haven't seen it,  and anecdotally, you hear some things from Houston but hasn't had as big of  an impact yet. </p><p>  MATHISEN:  Uh-huh.  You know, we were speaking a couple of weeks ago  here internally that we wanted to have somebody on who follows small cap  stocks as we focused a lot on the blue chips and here, lo and behold, we  have you on a night when the rustle is at a record high.  Why?  Make the  case for small caps this year and I suspect that one of the arguments is  that they are less prone to be whip-sawed by currency moves.  </p><p>  MARSHALL:  Yes.  We, you know, at the Hodges Funds, we don't get too  caught up in the absolute level of any market index.  But within small  caps, you can always find secular growth opportunities in just any type of  market and to your point, they are more domestic-centric.  Meaning that  they have less foreign exchange exposure, they have more simplified capital  structures.  </p><p>  So, I think it's really a good place for active portfolio management  where you can get in there and do some individual stock picking.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  Let's go through some of your individual stocks beginning  with Eagle Materials (NYSE:EXP).  You mentioned last time you were here  about a year ago, what's been going on there?  It's down a little since  then.  </p><p>  MARSHALL:  Yes.  They're a manufacturer of cement and gypsum and  wallboard.  Both of those have seen very good demand, very good pricing  power.  The prices of both of those commodities have been rising, as the  housing market and construction market continues to improve in different  areas of the country.  </p><p>  And we really like the earnings profile of the company, the earnings  power over the next couple of years.  They do have a segment of their  business that's relatively small that does provide frack sand to the oil  and gas industry.  And as a result of that, that's the reason why the stock  is down over the past year.  </p><p>  But we really think you're buying the long-term cement and gypsum  wallboard business.  You get the rest of the business for free at these  price levels.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  All right.  So, that's the reason it's been stuck in the  mud there.  </p><p>  Jarden (NYSE:JAH) Corporation trading now at $51 and change.  </p><p>  MARSHALL:  Yes, and this is more of a mid cap stock than a small cap  stock, but it's one we like here.  They do over $8 billion in revenues and  they are consumer product company.  They own brands like Coleman, camping  equipment, Rawlings, sporting goods.  They have Mr. Coffee.  They bought  Yankee Candle Company here about a year and a half ago and they have a  number of other brands.  </p><p>  And they're seeing very good organic revenue growth in these areas, as  well as some acquisition opportunities.  The company throws off a lot of  cash flow.  They've been aggressively buying back their stock with that  cash.  And it only trades about 15 times for earnings.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  Quick thought on Swift Transportation, big trucker.  </p><p>  MARSHALL:  Yes.  This is another area -- when you look at the trucking  business, it hasn't been very good over the last ten years.  And they're  starting to see pricing power with some of the long haul truckers, and  Swift is really well-positioned to take advantage of that.  They've started  to raise prices for the first time in about 10 years.  And we think with a  lot of the driver shortages and lack of investment this space, we think  they're going to be very well positioned to take advantage of these trends  over the next couple of years.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  All right.  Eric, thank you very much.  Have a great  weekend.  We appreciate it.  </p><p>  MARSHALL:  Thank you, Tyler.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  Eric Marshall with Hodges Capital Management.  </p><p>  Well, despite higher stock prices, the sentiment unexpectedly fell in  February for the first time in seven months.  This is according to  University of Michigan's preliminary sentiment index.  The drop in  sentiment due in part apparently to the recent rise in gasoline prices,  energy workers concerns about possible job losses and even the harsh winter  weather in the Northeast and parts of the Midwest.  </p><p>  Now to what the White House calls a defining challenge of the 21st  century: Cyber crime.  President Obama held a summit in Silicon Valley with  chief executives from companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Bank of America  (NYSE:BAC), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Walgreens, urging the private sector  and the government to work together to make the Internet and business  safer.  </p><p>  But as Eamon Javers reports, some big tech CEOs were no-shows.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  EAMON JAVERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A  clash of cultures today at Stanford University in tech-centric Silicon  Valley as some of the top federal cyber security officials came here for  President Obama's cyber security summit.  Raising eyebrows, some of the  biggest names in technology were conspicuous no-shows, including the CEOs  of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO).   Silicon Valley insiders attribute the snub to continuing fallout from the  Edward Snowden NSA spying revelations.  </p><p>  Despite that bit of tension between the East and West Coast, the  president signed an executive order to encourage more cooperation between  the private sector and government.  And he told his audience the country  needs to come together to deal with a common problem.  </p><p>  BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Foreign governments and  criminals are probing these systems every single day.  We only have to  think of real life examples.  Air traffic control system going down and  disrupting flights, or blackouts that plunge cities into darkness.  To  imagine what a set of systemic cyber attacks might do.  So, this is also a  matter of public safety.  </p><p>  JAVERS:  Also here, Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  </p><p>  TIM COOK, APPLE CEO:  If those of us in positions of responsibility  fail to do everything in our power to protect the right of privacy, we risk  something far more valuable than money.  We risk our way of life.  </p><p>  JAVERS (on camera):  Part of that clash of cultures between the  government guys and the techies is the arms race to recruit top technology  talent.  Federal officials here say they know they can't compete with the  Googles and the Facebooks of the world directly on salary, but they said  they find ways to work around that.  </p><p>  ED LOWERY, U.S. SECRET SERVICE ASSISTANT DIRECTOR:  We have a lot of  imbeds.  We put agents out here in the Silicon Valley working with the  technology companies.  We leverage what they can do.  And again, I don't --  the government is never is going to be able to match the pay scale,  obviously, but there are plenty of patriots out there who want to be in law  enforcement.  </p><p>  JAVERS (voice-over):  For the president today, this visit to heart of  the technology community, to the president it was all about bridging the  differences between government and the private sector.  </p><p>  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Eamon Javers in Stanford.  </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  MATHISEN:  MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (NYSE:V) both announcing  plans to expand their security features for online shopping.  Visa (NYSE:V)  plans to do away with traditional account numbers and instead use a unique  series of numbers that can authorize payments.  MasterCard (NYSE:MA), which  plans to spend more than $20 million on its initiative, will let customers  verify transactions using voice and fingerprints.  MasterCard (NYSE:MA)  plans to launch that program in the spring.  </p><p>  Now to the West Coast port labor dispute and Conagra.  It became the  latest company to blame its weak profit forecast on the traffic congestion  out there.  The package food company said the slowdown is hurting some  products it exports.  Shares of the company off 4 percent.  </p><p>  And as the slowdown drags on at the West Coast ports, one sector most  at risk: retail.  We may learn more about the extent of the impact when  retailers begin reporting earnings next week, including the world's  biggest, Walmart.  </p><p>  As Courtney Reagan tells us, investors will pay close attention.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   Consumers may be looking forward to ditching winter coats for spring  apparel, but retailers are having trouble getting that spring merchandise  in stores.  As disputes over labor contracts continue, the West Coast ports  responsible for nearly 40 percent of all U.S. cargo are shut down for a  second straight weekend, which means merchandise is stuck at sea or in  containers, far from the intended retail destination.  </p><p>  RICHARD JAFFE, STIFEL NICOLAUS RESEARCH ANALYST:  I see some stores  that are out of balance, still featuring what I'll call winter and holiday  goods when at this time of year, that should be relegated to the back racks  on sale and the front should be all fresh new merchandise.  So, the balance  isn't right.  </p><p>  REAGAN:  Target (NYSE:TGT), Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), Michael Kors and  Ralph Lauren are among the retailers that have brought in orders early to  protect inventory levels and are using other points of entry and  distribution to get merchandise into and through the country.  Container  volume at L.A., Long Beach and Oakland ports dropped 25 percent or more in  January from the year prior, but despite the lower volume, the journal of  commerce said some West Coast shipments that normally take two to six days  to unload are now taking up to three weeks.  </p><p>  (on camera):  Circumventing West Coast ports helps get merchandise on  the shelves but it comes at a cost, up to $7 billion this year, according  to some estimates.  Getting cargo from Asia to the East Coast takes longer  and adds to expense.  Air freight is also more expensive.  Both back-up  plans crimping profit margins.  </p><p>  (voice-over):  As retailers reroute goods from Asia to East Coast  parts, Stifel analyst Richard Jaffe points out overflow puts those ports at  max capacity.  </p><p>  JAFFE:  The doomsday scenario, the product comes in late.  The season  therefore shortened.  Retailers have to accelerate sales using discounts.   The consumer benefits with discounted prices, but the retailers suffer  because short and credit discounts.  </p><p>  REAGAN:  Credit Suisse says brands diversified points of distribution  including Nike (NYSE:NKE), Tumi, and VF Corp. should be more insulated in  the short-term while Lululemon and Deckers cold suffer more because of  concentrated West Coast distribution.  </p><p>  While contingencies are working to avoid a material impact on  business, if an extended shutdown or strike occurs, industry-wide  consensus, no retailer goes unaffected.  </p><p>  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Courtney Reagan.  </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  MATHISEN:  Still ahead, how the steep drop in crude prices in recent  months has one city on edge, wondering if its housing rebound could fall  apart.  </p><p>  (MUSIC)</p><p>  MATHISEN:  The number of U.S. oil rigs continues to fall according to  Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI).  Drillers idled 98 rigs this week bringing the rig  count down 30 percent since October, a very steep fall there.  Some look to  rig counts as a leading indicator of production since they are used to  drill new wells.  U.S. oil production overall remains at multi-decade  highs.  </p><p>  Now to Texas, the state driven by a strong energy focused economy.  It  is suddenly now feeling the impact of oil prices that are now about half  their year-ago levels, though up from their lows.  Layoffs being announced  at big energy firms and if the unemployment rate rises, the Houston housing  market could eventually feel a bit of a chill.  </p><p>  Diana Olick has more.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   David Hopkins sold his Houston-area home last fall for top dollar.  He says  he timed the market just right.  </p><p>  DAVID HOPKINS, HOME SELLER:  I feel really glad.  I'm like that guy  that sold his oil company last year.  He's feeling pretty good too.  I feel  the same way.  </p><p>  OLICK:  Both home sales and prices hit record levels in Houston last  year fueled by a booming energy sector.  With oil prices now cut in half,  Houston is already losing jobs, the primary driver for housing.  </p><p>  MICHELLE MORANO:  Now that oil prices are down, things haven't  completely changed but let's just say that things have come to more a  stall.  </p><p>  OLICK:  It will take significant time for the drop in oil prices to  trickle down to Houston's housing market.  In previous oil downturns, it's  taken eight months to two years for job losses to factor into home prices.   But all eyes are on Houston now with the oil industry accounting for about  5.6 percent of its jobs.  This especially because it was the nation's  hottest housing market barely a year ago and is still growing.  Single  family Houston home sales jumped 6 percent in January from a year ago and  prices hit a record high up 7 percent from a year ago.  </p><p>  The only problem now is supply, barely 2.5 months due to all the  demand.  </p><p>  This as builders start to get careful.  KB Home's CEO last month said  the builder had pulled out of a couple of land transactions in the fourth  quarter because of, quote, \"sensitivity\" there.  But they claim they are  not seeing any pullback yet by consumers.  </p><p>  RICK SHARGA, AUCTION.COM:  Because it hasn't been hit yet doesn't mean  it's not going to happen.  So, I think patience is the buzz word.  We're  expecting that Houston will cool down significantly on the residential  side.  </p><p>  OLICK (on camera):  Just for context, energy has really pushed housing  recently.  According to Trulia, in the seven large metros where oil-related  jobs are at least 2 percent of the total, home prices rose 10.5 percent  year over year last year.  That's a lot faster than the rest of the nation.   Now the reverse is in play.  </p><p>  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Diana Olick in Washington.  </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  MATHISEN:  For more on the state of housing in Houston, head to our  Web site, NBR.com.  </p><p>  Well, powerhouse brands help bolster VF Corp's results.  And that is  where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".</p><p>  The parent of brands like the North Face and Vans reported results  that matched on both the top and bottom lines.  Profit did fall from last  year, as the company booked a write-down on the value of some of its brands  and the company warned investors about negative effects from currency  fluctuations for 2015.  But revenue still rose on strength in its outdoor  and action sports division.  I know no kid in my town who doesn't own a  North Face jacket.  Shares popped 6 percent to $75.26.</p><p>  Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) is jacking up its dividend by 12 percent to 37  cents a share.  The new payout will be made to shareholders in March.  The  yield on the dividend is up more than 1.5 percent.  Shares spiked initially  in after-hours trading.  Before the close, the stock was up a fraction to  $79.41.</p><p>  And Smucker -- J.M. Smucker (NYSE:SJM) that would be -- reported mixed  results today, with revenue missing estimates.  The owner of Folgers coffee  said weakness in its coffee business weighed on results, but it's expecting  business to get caffeinated again this year as prices stabilize.  Shares  were up more than 1 percent to $113.89.</p><p>  And Alibaba has received a request for information from the SEC.  The  agency is looking for information related to its interaction with a Chinese  regulator.  Alibaba says it's cooperating with the request.  Shares fell  initially in after-hours trading.  Before the bell, the stock was up 2  percent to $89.05.</p><p>  A rising economic tide lifts all boats and that is especially true for  the boating industry as the economy improves and people feel better about  making big purchases.  Boat manufacturers expecting solid sales growth this  year and they're kicking off their season as they so often do in Miami  where thousands of boats are on display at two separate shows. </p><p>  Morgan Brennan is there.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A  big weekend for boat enthusiasts as more than a hundred thousand people  descend in Miami for two annual boat shows.  Brokers say business is  finally recovering.  </p><p>  MARK ELLIOTT:  Over the last two years, we've seen slow improvement  and it's directly related to the stock market.  As the stock market inches  up, our phone calls increase.  So, with the stock market being in chartered  territory and demand pent up, people are buying yachts.  </p><p>  BRENNAN:  And it's not just luxury, but water crafts.  The National  Marine Manufacturers Association estimates sales of new recreational boats  grew as much as 8 percent last year and it expects that momentum to  continue.  </p><p>  THOM DAMMRICH, NATIONAL MARINE MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION:  As we look  out over the next few years, we think we've got three or more years of  pretty good growth in new boat sales.  </p><p>  BRENNAN:  That's good news for an industry rocked by the recession.   When new sales plunged to 60 percent and one third of retailers closed up  shop.  Since then, to recapture consumers, companies have had to change  their strategies rolling out new models at lower price points. </p><p>  Industry leader Brunswick (NYSE:BC) Corporation says demand comes from  both ends of the consumer spectrum.  </p><p>  DUSTY MCCOY, BRUNSWICK CORP. CEO:  A lot of bigger models completely  sold out over a year and then pontoons, fishing boats which tend to be  smaller, different income level have also now begun to reach prerecession  level.  So, at one at the end market, the other end, market is very  powerful, very strong and growing very much.  </p><p>  BRENNAN (on camera):  So, what's fueling demand for all of these  boats?  An improving labor market, rising consumer confidence and  increasing disposable income thanks in part to lower gas prices.  </p><p>  (voice-over):  But for now here in Miami, people are buying boats and  with thousands to choose from, from inflatables to runabouts to yachts,  there's something here for everyone.  </p><p>  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Morgan Brennan in Miami.  </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  MATHISEN:  Coming up, money and marriage.  Why planning a different  kind of date this Valentine's Day could lead to not only marital bliss but  also financial harmony.  </p><p>  (MUSIC)</p><p>  MATHISEN:  The window to enroll in health care under the Affordable  Care Act quickly closing.  Midnight Sunday is the deadline for coverage  this year and those who don't enroll may be subject to a penalty.  Federal  officials say they've seen a big pick-up in traffic on the healthcare.gov  Web site over the past few days.  </p><p>  Well, 2014 was a rough year for Atlantic City but this year, so far,  off to a more encouraging start.  Casino revenue for January was up almost  19 percent compared with a year ago, even though they've shut down a lot of  casinos.  Part of the reason is less competition for the eight casinos that  are still there.  </p><p>  Well, looking for a Valentine's Day gift for your significant other?   You might want to forget the flowers and chocolate and instead plan a date  -- a money date -- because as Sharon Epperson tells us, that could be the  most valuable gift of all.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  SHARON EPPERSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   Mark and Evan Elkowitz have been married for 18 years.  They like to talk  about everything, even money.  </p><p>  MARC ELKOWITZ, HUSBAND:  We certainly have conversations about money.  </p><p>  EVAN ELKOWITZ, WIFE:  Sometimes they're not called conversations.  </p><p>  MARC ELKOWITZ:  Sometimes, they are more like avoiding injury than  conversation.  </p><p>  EPPERSON:  Like many couples, they have occasional arguments about  money, too. </p><p>  ELLEN ROGIN, AUTHOR:  Many people weren't brought up learning how to  talk about money with their partners.  So, maybe your parents didn't talk  about money in front of you or maybe didn't even talk about money at all,  or they thought about it.  </p><p>  EPPERSON (voice-over):  It's a crucial conversation to have.  But  nearly 40 percent of couples in a Citi Double Cash survey said they haven't  set aside time to talk about their finances in the past year.  About 30  percent wish they discussed it more.  </p><p>  ROGIN:  Yes, scheduling a time to get together, it can be a fun, like,  go out and have a date.  It doesn't have to be something hard and boring to  sit and talk about.  </p><p>  EVAN ELKOWITZ:  I think planning a date in general is a hard thing.  </p><p>  MARC ELKOWITZ:  A fun date, let alone an accounting date.  </p><p>  EVAN ELKOWITZ:  Right.</p><p>  EPPERSON:  The Elkowitzes find the time to have their money talks in  other ways.  They divide and conquer when it comes to managing the family  finances.</p><p>  EVAN ELKOWITZ:  I pay all the bills, by the way.  Yes, I pay all the  bills.  </p><p>  EPPERSON:  Marc, a plastic surgeon, the primary bred winner, while  Evan, a personal stylist, handles everyday spending.  </p><p>  MARC ELKOWITZ:  It stresses me out.  I don't want to know.  I'd rather  be in the OR taking care of stuff than look at a phone bill.  </p><p>  EVAN ELKOWITZ:  A phone bill isn't bad.  </p><p>  MARC ELKOWITZ:  Or a credit card bill.  </p><p>  EPPERSON:  The Elkowitzes try to strike a balance that keeps both of  them involved and honest about what they own and what they owe.  </p><p>  But when it comes to love and money, not all couples are as  transparent.  In the Citi survey, nearly one in four in a committed  relationship admit they have a private account that their significant other  doesn't know about.  Yet many more admits they would prefer if their  significant other discuss finances more often.  </p><p>  ROGIN:  You really need to come clean with your money.  So, if you  have a secret, whether a hidden account or debt that's out there or  spending that you're not telling your partner about, maybe you spend cash  that they don't know what you spend money about, or you hide bags in your  trunk or in the back of your closet, and come clean, because it's really  hard to have marital bliss if there's not financial harmony.  </p><p>  EPPERSON:  Money advice to whether those challenging times for better  or worse.  </p><p>  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Sharon Epperson.  </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  MATHISEN:  And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I'm Tyler  Mathisen.  Thanks for watching.  Have a great long weekend, everyone, and  we'll see you back here Monday for a special holiday edition of NIGHTLY  BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p> END</p><p> Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

The S&amp;P 500 closes at a new high, so do small cap stocks and the Dow Jones industrial average break through 18,000 for the first time this year. Are there more big gains ahead and where should you put your money now?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fighting cyber crime. It is one of the biggest threats to business. And today, at a summit in Silicon Valley, President Obama urged cooperation with the private sector to make the Internet safe.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, February 13th.</p><p>Good evening, everyone. I'm Tyler Mathisen. Sue Herera is off tonight.</p><p>Well, the bulls are back on Wall Street turning Friday the 13th into a lucky day. The S&amp;P 500 ends the week at an all-time high. The blue chip Dow index breaks above 18,000 for the first time this year. And not to be outdone, small caps also finished the day at a record. Strong economic data out of Europe gave the markets a lift early on and hopes that Greece and its creditors will reach some sort of deal when they talks resume on Monday.</p><p>At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose nearly 47 points to 18,019, NASDAQ gained 36 points to a fresh 15-year high, and the S&amp;P 500 was up 8. For the week, the Dow rose 1 percent. The NASDAQ up more than 3 percent, best week since last October, and the S&amp;P 500 gained 2 percent.</p><p>The energy sector was helped by a 3 percent rise in West Texas crude. It is now up nearly 20 percent from its lows last month. Brent Crude back up above $60 a barrel, actually, above $61 for the first time this year. Both benchmarks have now risen for three consecutive weeks.</p><p>What's behind the broad based run-up and is a sign the bulls will stay in control?</p><p>Dominic Chu reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOMINIC CHU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It may not feel like it for many investors but we are once again at record high levels in the stock market, at least when you look at the S&amp;P 500. The broader large cap stock index set a record intraday high today, led by energy stocks, which rallied in the back of high oil prices, and a whole slew of other companies that hit record highs as well, including coffee giant Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), home improvement retailer Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and toy maker Hasbro (NYSE:HAS).</p><p>So, will this upward move continue, and will it get more people interested in buying stocks? Uncertainty about global risks holding some investors back, but if that changes, that could help the bull run continue.</p><p>ROBERT PAVLIK, BOSTON PRIVATE WEALTH: Right now, we have some possible resolutions to things. We have Russia agreeing to a ceasefire with the Ukraine. We have the Greeks talking to the ECB and the E.U. trying to renegotiate their debt package. We have the Chinese reducing reserve requirements, and trying to expand their global economy.</p><p>CHU: And it's not just overseas developments to keep an eye on. If the U.S. economy continues to gradually improve, that's an upside catalyst as well.</p><p>DARIN RICHARDS, AKT WEALTH ADVISORS CIO: Our employment rate continues to move lower. The consumer is in a great spot. Consumer confidence is very high. And we could see, I think, additional spending on the retail side, which again, consumer spending is 70 percent of our economy.</p><p>CHU (on camera): Of course, those are the positive takes. The more cautious in the marketplace point out the fragility of the global economic recovery and they say that markets are priced for perfection. Meaning, if anything upsets the balance, we could be set up for more volatility ahead.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Dominic Chu.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Here to talk more about the record-setting day on Wall Street and his stock picks is this week's market monitor, Eric Marshall, president and portfolio manager of Hodges Capital Management, the Dallas- based fund group that runs more than $2 billion.</p><p>Welcome, Eric. Good to have you with us.</p><p>How do you explain the market turnaround these past couple of weeks?</p><p>ERIC MARSHALL, HODGES CAPITAL MANAGEMENT PRESIDENT: Well, I think it's really been a response to the commodity and some of the volatility that we've seen in currency markets and so forth, just kind of settling down. We've gotten into earnings season, corporate earnings and the outlooks that we're hearing from companies are relatively positive, and I think it's been a normal, you know, one step back, two steps forward.</p><p>MATHISEN: What's it like down there in Dallas, not really the epicenter of the energy world in Texas, I guess you'd say Houston is, but you're very close to it. A lot of the economy is dependent on it. What are people saying?</p><p>MARSHALL: Well, you know, in Dallas and in north Texas, we really haven't seen much of an impact of lower oil prices. If you look at the Texas economy, it's much more diversified than it was back in the early '80s when we had the big oil bust. And so, in Dallas, we haven't seen it, and anecdotally, you hear some things from Houston but hasn't had as big of an impact yet.</p><p>MATHISEN: Uh-huh. You know, we were speaking a couple of weeks ago here internally that we wanted to have somebody on who follows small cap stocks as we focused a lot on the blue chips and here, lo and behold, we have you on a night when the rustle is at a record high. Why? Make the case for small caps this year and I suspect that one of the arguments is that they are less prone to be whip-sawed by currency moves.</p><p>MARSHALL: Yes. We, you know, at the Hodges Funds, we don't get too caught up in the absolute level of any market index. But within small caps, you can always find secular growth opportunities in just any type of market and to your point, they are more domestic-centric. Meaning that they have less foreign exchange exposure, they have more simplified capital structures.</p><p>So, I think it's really a good place for active portfolio management where you can get in there and do some individual stock picking.</p><p>MATHISEN: Let's go through some of your individual stocks beginning with Eagle Materials (NYSE:EXP). You mentioned last time you were here about a year ago, what's been going on there? It's down a little since then.</p><p>MARSHALL: Yes. They're a manufacturer of cement and gypsum and wallboard. Both of those have seen very good demand, very good pricing power. The prices of both of those commodities have been rising, as the housing market and construction market continues to improve in different areas of the country.</p><p>And we really like the earnings profile of the company, the earnings power over the next couple of years. They do have a segment of their business that's relatively small that does provide frack sand to the oil and gas industry. And as a result of that, that's the reason why the stock is down over the past year.</p><p>But we really think you're buying the long-term cement and gypsum wallboard business. You get the rest of the business for free at these price levels.</p><p>MATHISEN: All right. So, that's the reason it's been stuck in the mud there.</p><p>Jarden (NYSE:JAH) Corporation trading now at $51 and change.</p><p>MARSHALL: Yes, and this is more of a mid cap stock than a small cap stock, but it's one we like here. They do over $8 billion in revenues and they are consumer product company. They own brands like Coleman, camping equipment, Rawlings, sporting goods. They have Mr. Coffee. They bought Yankee Candle Company here about a year and a half ago and they have a number of other brands.</p><p>And they're seeing very good organic revenue growth in these areas, as well as some acquisition opportunities. The company throws off a lot of cash flow. They've been aggressively buying back their stock with that cash. And it only trades about 15 times for earnings.</p><p>MATHISEN: Quick thought on Swift Transportation, big trucker.</p><p>MARSHALL: Yes. This is another area -- when you look at the trucking business, it hasn't been very good over the last ten years. And they're starting to see pricing power with some of the long haul truckers, and Swift is really well-positioned to take advantage of that. They've started to raise prices for the first time in about 10 years. And we think with a lot of the driver shortages and lack of investment this space, we think they're going to be very well positioned to take advantage of these trends over the next couple of years.</p><p>MATHISEN: All right. Eric, thank you very much. Have a great weekend. We appreciate it.</p><p>MARSHALL: Thank you, Tyler.</p><p>MATHISEN: Eric Marshall with Hodges Capital Management.</p><p>Well, despite higher stock prices, the sentiment unexpectedly fell in February for the first time in seven months. This is according to University of Michigan's preliminary sentiment index. The drop in sentiment due in part apparently to the recent rise in gasoline prices, energy workers concerns about possible job losses and even the harsh winter weather in the Northeast and parts of the Midwest.</p><p>Now to what the White House calls a defining challenge of the 21st century: Cyber crime. President Obama held a summit in Silicon Valley with chief executives from companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Walgreens, urging the private sector and the government to work together to make the Internet and business safer.</p><p>But as Eamon Javers reports, some big tech CEOs were no-shows.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EAMON JAVERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A clash of cultures today at Stanford University in tech-centric Silicon Valley as some of the top federal cyber security officials came here for President Obama's cyber security summit. Raising eyebrows, some of the biggest names in technology were conspicuous no-shows, including the CEOs of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO). Silicon Valley insiders attribute the snub to continuing fallout from the Edward Snowden NSA spying revelations.</p><p>Despite that bit of tension between the East and West Coast, the president signed an executive order to encourage more cooperation between the private sector and government. And he told his audience the country needs to come together to deal with a common problem.</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Foreign governments and criminals are probing these systems every single day. We only have to think of real life examples. Air traffic control system going down and disrupting flights, or blackouts that plunge cities into darkness. To imagine what a set of systemic cyber attacks might do. So, this is also a matter of public safety.</p><p>JAVERS: Also here, Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).</p><p>TIM COOK, APPLE CEO: If those of us in positions of responsibility fail to do everything in our power to protect the right of privacy, we risk something far more valuable than money. We risk our way of life.</p><p>JAVERS (on camera): Part of that clash of cultures between the government guys and the techies is the arms race to recruit top technology talent. Federal officials here say they know they can't compete with the Googles and the Facebooks of the world directly on salary, but they said they find ways to work around that.</p><p>ED LOWERY, U.S. SECRET SERVICE ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: We have a lot of imbeds. We put agents out here in the Silicon Valley working with the technology companies. We leverage what they can do. And again, I don't -- the government is never is going to be able to match the pay scale, obviously, but there are plenty of patriots out there who want to be in law enforcement.</p><p>JAVERS (voice-over): For the president today, this visit to heart of the technology community, to the president it was all about bridging the differences between government and the private sector.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Eamon Javers in Stanford.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (NYSE:V) both announcing plans to expand their security features for online shopping. Visa (NYSE:V) plans to do away with traditional account numbers and instead use a unique series of numbers that can authorize payments. MasterCard (NYSE:MA), which plans to spend more than $20 million on its initiative, will let customers verify transactions using voice and fingerprints. MasterCard (NYSE:MA) plans to launch that program in the spring.</p><p>Now to the West Coast port labor dispute and Conagra. It became the latest company to blame its weak profit forecast on the traffic congestion out there. The package food company said the slowdown is hurting some products it exports. Shares of the company off 4 percent.</p><p>And as the slowdown drags on at the West Coast ports, one sector most at risk: retail. We may learn more about the extent of the impact when retailers begin reporting earnings next week, including the world's biggest, Walmart.</p><p>As Courtney Reagan tells us, investors will pay close attention.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Consumers may be looking forward to ditching winter coats for spring apparel, but retailers are having trouble getting that spring merchandise in stores. As disputes over labor contracts continue, the West Coast ports responsible for nearly 40 percent of all U.S. cargo are shut down for a second straight weekend, which means merchandise is stuck at sea or in containers, far from the intended retail destination.</p><p>RICHARD JAFFE, STIFEL NICOLAUS RESEARCH ANALYST: I see some stores that are out of balance, still featuring what I'll call winter and holiday goods when at this time of year, that should be relegated to the back racks on sale and the front should be all fresh new merchandise. So, the balance isn't right.</p><p>REAGAN: Target (NYSE:TGT), Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), Michael Kors and Ralph Lauren are among the retailers that have brought in orders early to protect inventory levels and are using other points of entry and distribution to get merchandise into and through the country. Container volume at L.A., Long Beach and Oakland ports dropped 25 percent or more in January from the year prior, but despite the lower volume, the journal of commerce said some West Coast shipments that normally take two to six days to unload are now taking up to three weeks.</p><p>(on camera): Circumventing West Coast ports helps get merchandise on the shelves but it comes at a cost, up to $7 billion this year, according to some estimates. Getting cargo from Asia to the East Coast takes longer and adds to expense. Air freight is also more expensive. Both back-up plans crimping profit margins.</p><p>(voice-over): As retailers reroute goods from Asia to East Coast parts, Stifel analyst Richard Jaffe points out overflow puts those ports at max capacity.</p><p>JAFFE: The doomsday scenario, the product comes in late. The season therefore shortened. Retailers have to accelerate sales using discounts. The consumer benefits with discounted prices, but the retailers suffer because short and credit discounts.</p><p>REAGAN: Credit Suisse says brands diversified points of distribution including Nike (NYSE:NKE), Tumi, and VF Corp. should be more insulated in the short-term while Lululemon and Deckers cold suffer more because of concentrated West Coast distribution.</p><p>While contingencies are working to avoid a material impact on business, if an extended shutdown or strike occurs, industry-wide consensus, no retailer goes unaffected.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Courtney Reagan.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Still ahead, how the steep drop in crude prices in recent months has one city on edge, wondering if its housing rebound could fall apart.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN: The number of U.S. oil rigs continues to fall according to Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI). Drillers idled 98 rigs this week bringing the rig count down 30 percent since October, a very steep fall there. Some look to rig counts as a leading indicator of production since they are used to drill new wells. U.S. oil production overall remains at multi-decade highs.</p><p>Now to Texas, the state driven by a strong energy focused economy. It is suddenly now feeling the impact of oil prices that are now about half their year-ago levels, though up from their lows. Layoffs being announced at big energy firms and if the unemployment rate rises, the Houston housing market could eventually feel a bit of a chill.</p><p>Diana Olick has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): David Hopkins sold his Houston-area home last fall for top dollar. He says he timed the market just right.</p><p>DAVID HOPKINS, HOME SELLER: I feel really glad. I'm like that guy that sold his oil company last year. He's feeling pretty good too. I feel the same way.</p><p>OLICK: Both home sales and prices hit record levels in Houston last year fueled by a booming energy sector. With oil prices now cut in half, Houston is already losing jobs, the primary driver for housing.</p><p>MICHELLE MORANO: Now that oil prices are down, things haven't completely changed but let's just say that things have come to more a stall.</p><p>OLICK: It will take significant time for the drop in oil prices to trickle down to Houston's housing market. In previous oil downturns, it's taken eight months to two years for job losses to factor into home prices. But all eyes are on Houston now with the oil industry accounting for about 5.6 percent of its jobs. This especially because it was the nation's hottest housing market barely a year ago and is still growing. Single family Houston home sales jumped 6 percent in January from a year ago and prices hit a record high up 7 percent from a year ago.</p><p>The only problem now is supply, barely 2.5 months due to all the demand.</p><p>This as builders start to get careful. KB Home's CEO last month said the builder had pulled out of a couple of land transactions in the fourth quarter because of, quote, \"sensitivity\" there. But they claim they are not seeing any pullback yet by consumers.</p><p>RICK SHARGA, AUCTION.COM: Because it hasn't been hit yet doesn't mean it's not going to happen. So, I think patience is the buzz word. We're expecting that Houston will cool down significantly on the residential side.</p><p>OLICK (on camera): Just for context, energy has really pushed housing recently. According to Trulia, in the seven large metros where oil-related jobs are at least 2 percent of the total, home prices rose 10.5 percent year over year last year. That's a lot faster than the rest of the nation. Now the reverse is in play.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: For more on the state of housing in Houston, head to our Web site, NBR.com.</p><p>Well, powerhouse brands help bolster VF Corp's results. And that is where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The parent of brands like the North Face and Vans reported results that matched on both the top and bottom lines. Profit did fall from last year, as the company booked a write-down on the value of some of its brands and the company warned investors about negative effects from currency fluctuations for 2015. But revenue still rose on strength in its outdoor and action sports division. I know no kid in my town who doesn't own a North Face jacket. Shares popped 6 percent to $75.26.</p><p>Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) is jacking up its dividend by 12 percent to 37 cents a share. The new payout will be made to shareholders in March. The yield on the dividend is up more than 1.5 percent. Shares spiked initially in after-hours trading. Before the close, the stock was up a fraction to $79.41.</p><p>And Smucker -- J.M. Smucker (NYSE:SJM) that would be -- reported mixed results today, with revenue missing estimates. The owner of Folgers coffee said weakness in its coffee business weighed on results, but it's expecting business to get caffeinated again this year as prices stabilize. Shares were up more than 1 percent to $113.89.</p><p>And Alibaba has received a request for information from the SEC. The agency is looking for information related to its interaction with a Chinese regulator. Alibaba says it's cooperating with the request. Shares fell initially in after-hours trading. Before the bell, the stock was up 2 percent to $89.05.</p><p>A rising economic tide lifts all boats and that is especially true for the boating industry as the economy improves and people feel better about making big purchases. Boat manufacturers expecting solid sales growth this year and they're kicking off their season as they so often do in Miami where thousands of boats are on display at two separate shows.</p><p>Morgan Brennan is there.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A big weekend for boat enthusiasts as more than a hundred thousand people descend in Miami for two annual boat shows. Brokers say business is finally recovering.</p><p>MARK ELLIOTT: Over the last two years, we've seen slow improvement and it's directly related to the stock market. As the stock market inches up, our phone calls increase. So, with the stock market being in chartered territory and demand pent up, people are buying yachts.</p><p>BRENNAN: And it's not just luxury, but water crafts. The National Marine Manufacturers Association estimates sales of new recreational boats grew as much as 8 percent last year and it expects that momentum to continue.</p><p>THOM DAMMRICH, NATIONAL MARINE MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION: As we look out over the next few years, we think we've got three or more years of pretty good growth in new boat sales.</p><p>BRENNAN: That's good news for an industry rocked by the recession. When new sales plunged to 60 percent and one third of retailers closed up shop. Since then, to recapture consumers, companies have had to change their strategies rolling out new models at lower price points.</p><p>Industry leader Brunswick (NYSE:BC) Corporation says demand comes from both ends of the consumer spectrum.</p><p>DUSTY MCCOY, BRUNSWICK CORP. CEO: A lot of bigger models completely sold out over a year and then pontoons, fishing boats which tend to be smaller, different income level have also now begun to reach prerecession level. So, at one at the end market, the other end, market is very powerful, very strong and growing very much.</p><p>BRENNAN (on camera): So, what's fueling demand for all of these boats? An improving labor market, rising consumer confidence and increasing disposable income thanks in part to lower gas prices.</p><p>(voice-over): But for now here in Miami, people are buying boats and with thousands to choose from, from inflatables to runabouts to yachts, there's something here for everyone.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Morgan Brennan in Miami.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Coming up, money and marriage. Why planning a different kind of date this Valentine's Day could lead to not only marital bliss but also financial harmony.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN: The window to enroll in health care under the Affordable Care Act quickly closing. Midnight Sunday is the deadline for coverage this year and those who don't enroll may be subject to a penalty. Federal officials say they've seen a big pick-up in traffic on the healthcare.gov Web site over the past few days.</p><p>Well, 2014 was a rough year for Atlantic City but this year, so far, off to a more encouraging start. Casino revenue for January was up almost 19 percent compared with a year ago, even though they've shut down a lot of casinos. Part of the reason is less competition for the eight casinos that are still there.</p><p>Well, looking for a Valentine's Day gift for your significant other? You might want to forget the flowers and chocolate and instead plan a date -- a money date -- because as Sharon Epperson tells us, that could be the most valuable gift of all.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SHARON EPPERSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Mark and Evan Elkowitz have been married for 18 years. They like to talk about everything, even money.</p><p>MARC ELKOWITZ, HUSBAND: We certainly have conversations about money.</p><p>EVAN ELKOWITZ, WIFE: Sometimes they're not called conversations.</p><p>MARC ELKOWITZ: Sometimes, they are more like avoiding injury than conversation.</p><p>EPPERSON: Like many couples, they have occasional arguments about money, too.</p><p>ELLEN ROGIN, AUTHOR: Many people weren't brought up learning how to talk about money with their partners. So, maybe your parents didn't talk about money in front of you or maybe didn't even talk about money at all, or they thought about it.</p><p>EPPERSON (voice-over): It's a crucial conversation to have. But nearly 40 percent of couples in a Citi Double Cash survey said they haven't set aside time to talk about their finances in the past year. About 30 percent wish they discussed it more.</p><p>ROGIN: Yes, scheduling a time to get together, it can be a fun, like, go out and have a date. It doesn't have to be something hard and boring to sit and talk about.</p><p>EVAN ELKOWITZ: I think planning a date in general is a hard thing.</p><p>MARC ELKOWITZ: A fun date, let alone an accounting date.</p><p>EVAN ELKOWITZ: Right.</p><p>EPPERSON: The Elkowitzes find the time to have their money talks in other ways. They divide and conquer when it comes to managing the family finances.</p><p>EVAN ELKOWITZ: I pay all the bills, by the way. Yes, I pay all the bills.</p><p>EPPERSON: Marc, a plastic surgeon, the primary bred winner, while Evan, a personal stylist, handles everyday spending.</p><p>MARC ELKOWITZ: It stresses me out. I don't want to know. I'd rather be in the OR taking care of stuff than look at a phone bill.</p><p>EVAN ELKOWITZ: A phone bill isn't bad.</p><p>MARC ELKOWITZ: Or a credit card bill.</p><p>EPPERSON: The Elkowitzes try to strike a balance that keeps both of them involved and honest about what they own and what they owe.</p><p>But when it comes to love and money, not all couples are as transparent. In the Citi survey, nearly one in four in a committed relationship admit they have a private account that their significant other doesn't know about. Yet many more admits they would prefer if their significant other discuss finances more often.</p><p>ROGIN: You really need to come clean with your money. So, if you have a secret, whether a hidden account or debt that's out there or spending that you're not telling your partner about, maybe you spend cash that they don't know what you spend money about, or you hide bags in your trunk or in the back of your closet, and come clean, because it's really hard to have marital bliss if there's not financial harmony.</p><p>EPPERSON: Money advice to whether those challenging times for better or worse.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Sharon Epperson.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I'm Tyler Mathisen. Thanks for watching.

The  S&amp;P 500 closes at a new high, so do small cap stocks and the Dow Jones  industrial average break through 18,000 for the first time this year.  Are  there more big gains ahead and where should you put your money now?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Fighting cyber crime.  It is one of the biggest threats to business.   And today, at a summit in Silicon Valley, President Obama urged cooperation  with the private sector to make the Internet safe.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  All that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday,  February 13th.</p><p>  Good evening, everyone.  I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Sue Herera is off  tonight.  </p><p>  Well, the bulls are back on Wall Street turning Friday the 13th into a  lucky day.  The S&amp;P 500 ends the week at an all-time high.  The blue chip  Dow index breaks above 18,000 for the first time this year.  And not to be  outdone, small caps also finished the day at a record.  Strong economic  data out of Europe gave the markets a lift early on and hopes that Greece  and its creditors will reach some sort of deal when they talks resume on  Monday.  </p><p>  At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose nearly 47 points  to 18,019, NASDAQ gained 36 points to a fresh 15-year high, and the S&amp;P 500  was up 8.  For the week, the Dow rose 1 percent.  The NASDAQ up more than 3  percent, best week since last October, and the S&amp;P 500 gained 2 percent.  </p><p>  The energy sector was helped by a 3 percent rise in West Texas crude.   It is now up nearly 20 percent from its lows last month.  Brent Crude back  up above $60 a barrel, actually, above $61 for the first time this year.   Both benchmarks have now risen for three consecutive weeks.  </p><p>  What's behind the broad based run-up and is a sign the bulls will stay  in control?  </p><p>  Dominic Chu reports.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  DOMINIC CHU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  It  may not feel like it for many investors but we are once again at record  high levels in the stock market, at least when you look at the S&amp;P 500.   The broader large cap stock index set a record intraday high today, led by  energy stocks, which rallied in the back of high oil prices, and a whole  slew of other companies that hit record highs as well, including coffee  giant Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), home improvement retailer Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) and toy maker Hasbro (NYSE:HAS).  </p><p>  So, will this upward move continue, and will it get more people  interested in buying stocks?  Uncertainty about global risks holding some  investors back, but if that changes, that could help the bull run continue.  </p><p>  ROBERT PAVLIK, BOSTON PRIVATE WEALTH:  Right now, we have some  possible resolutions to things.  We have Russia agreeing to a ceasefire  with the Ukraine.  We have the Greeks talking to the ECB and the E.U.  trying to renegotiate their debt package.  We have the Chinese reducing  reserve requirements, and trying to expand their global economy.  </p><p>  CHU:  And it's not just overseas developments to keep an eye on.  If  the U.S. economy continues to gradually improve, that's an upside catalyst  as well.  </p><p>  DARIN RICHARDS, AKT WEALTH ADVISORS CIO:  Our employment rate  continues to move lower.  The consumer is in a great spot.  Consumer  confidence is very high.  And we could see, I think, additional spending on  the retail side, which again, consumer spending is 70 percent of our  economy.  </p><p>  CHU (on camera):  Of course, those are the positive takes.  The more  cautious in the marketplace point out the fragility of the global economic  recovery and they say that markets are priced for perfection.  Meaning, if  anything upsets the balance, we could be set up for more volatility ahead.  </p><p>  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Dominic Chu.  </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  MATHISEN:  Here to talk more about the record-setting day on Wall  Street and his stock picks is this week's market monitor, Eric Marshall,  president and portfolio manager of Hodges Capital Management, the Dallas- based fund group that runs more than $2 billion.  </p><p>  Welcome, Eric.  Good to have you with us.  </p><p>  How do you explain the market turnaround these past couple of weeks?  </p><p>  ERIC MARSHALL, HODGES CAPITAL MANAGEMENT PRESIDENT:  Well, I think  it's really been a response to the commodity and some of the volatility  that we've seen in currency markets and so forth, just kind of settling  down.  We've gotten into earnings season, corporate earnings and the  outlooks that we're hearing from companies are relatively positive, and I  think it's been a normal, you know, one step back, two steps forward.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  What's it like down there in Dallas, not really the  epicenter of the energy world in Texas, I guess you'd say Houston is, but  you're very close to it.  A lot of the economy is dependent on it.  What  are people saying?  </p><p>  MARSHALL:  Well, you know, in Dallas and in north Texas, we really  haven't seen much of an impact of lower oil prices.  If you look at the  Texas economy, it's much more diversified than it was back in the early  '80s when we had the big oil bust.  And so, in Dallas, we haven't seen it,  and anecdotally, you hear some things from Houston but hasn't had as big of  an impact yet. </p><p>  MATHISEN:  Uh-huh.  You know, we were speaking a couple of weeks ago  here internally that we wanted to have somebody on who follows small cap  stocks as we focused a lot on the blue chips and here, lo and behold, we  have you on a night when the rustle is at a record high.  Why?  Make the  case for small caps this year and I suspect that one of the arguments is  that they are less prone to be whip-sawed by currency moves.  </p><p>  MARSHALL:  Yes.  We, you know, at the Hodges Funds, we don't get too  caught up in the absolute level of any market index.  But within small  caps, you can always find secular growth opportunities in just any type of  market and to your point, they are more domestic-centric.  Meaning that  they have less foreign exchange exposure, they have more simplified capital  structures.  </p><p>  So, I think it's really a good place for active portfolio management  where you can get in there and do some individual stock picking.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  Let's go through some of your individual stocks beginning  with Eagle Materials (NYSE:EXP).  You mentioned last time you were here  about a year ago, what's been going on there?  It's down a little since  then.  </p><p>  MARSHALL:  Yes.  They're a manufacturer of cement and gypsum and  wallboard.  Both of those have seen very good demand, very good pricing  power.  The prices of both of those commodities have been rising, as the  housing market and construction market continues to improve in different  areas of the country.  </p><p>  And we really like the earnings profile of the company, the earnings  power over the next couple of years.  They do have a segment of their  business that's relatively small that does provide frack sand to the oil  and gas industry.  And as a result of that, that's the reason why the stock  is down over the past year.  </p><p>  But we really think you're buying the long-term cement and gypsum  wallboard business.  You get the rest of the business for free at these  price levels.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  All right.  So, that's the reason it's been stuck in the  mud there.  </p><p>  Jarden (NYSE:JAH) Corporation trading now at $51 and change.  </p><p>  MARSHALL:  Yes, and this is more of a mid cap stock than a small cap  stock, but it's one we like here.  They do over $8 billion in revenues and  they are consumer product company.  They own brands like Coleman, camping  equipment, Rawlings, sporting goods.  They have Mr. Coffee.  They bought  Yankee Candle Company here about a year and a half ago and they have a  number of other brands.  </p><p>  And they're seeing very good organic revenue growth in these areas, as  well as some acquisition opportunities.  The company throws off a lot of  cash flow.  They've been aggressively buying back their stock with that  cash.  And it only trades about 15 times for earnings.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  Quick thought on Swift Transportation, big trucker.  </p><p>  MARSHALL:  Yes.  This is another area -- when you look at the trucking  business, it hasn't been very good over the last ten years.  And they're  starting to see pricing power with some of the long haul truckers, and  Swift is really well-positioned to take advantage of that.  They've started  to raise prices for the first time in about 10 years.  And we think with a  lot of the driver shortages and lack of investment this space, we think  they're going to be very well positioned to take advantage of these trends  over the next couple of years.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  All right.  Eric, thank you very much.  Have a great  weekend.  We appreciate it.  </p><p>  MARSHALL:  Thank you, Tyler.  </p><p>  MATHISEN:  Eric Marshall with Hodges Capital Management.  </p><p>  Well, despite higher stock prices, the sentiment unexpectedly fell in  February for the first time in seven months.  This is according to  University of Michigan's preliminary sentiment index.  The drop in  sentiment due in part apparently to the recent rise in gasoline prices,  energy workers concerns about possible job losses and even the harsh winter  weather in the Northeast and parts of the Midwest.  </p><p>  Now to what the White House calls a defining challenge of the 21st  century: Cyber crime.  President Obama held a summit in Silicon Valley with  chief executives from companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Bank of America  (NYSE:BAC), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Walgreens, urging the private sector  and the government to work together to make the Internet and business  safer.  </p><p>  But as Eamon Javers reports, some big tech CEOs were no-shows.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  EAMON JAVERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A  clash of cultures today at Stanford University in tech-centric Silicon  Valley as some of the top federal cyber security officials came here for  President Obama's cyber security summit.  Raising eyebrows, some of the  biggest names in technology were conspicuous no-shows, including the CEOs  of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO).   Silicon Valley insiders attribute the snub to continuing fallout from the  Edward Snowden NSA spying revelations.  </p><p>  Despite that bit of tension between the East and West Coast, the  president signed an executive order to encourage more cooperation between  the private sector and government.  And he told his audience the country  needs to come together to deal with a common problem.  </p><p>  BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Foreign governments and  criminals are probing these systems every single day.  We only have to  think of real life examples.  Air traffic control system going down and  disrupting flights, or blackouts that plunge cities into darkness.  To  imagine what a set of systemic cyber attacks might do.  So, this is also a  matter of public safety.  </p><p>  JAVERS:  Also here, Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  </p><p>  TIM COOK, APPLE CEO:  If those of us in positions of responsibility  fail to do everything in our power to protect the right of privacy, we risk  something far more valuable than money.  We risk our way of life.  </p><p>  JAVERS (on camera):  Part of that clash of cultures between the  government guys and the techies is the arms race to recruit top technology  talent.  Federal officials here say they know they can't compete with the  Googles and the Facebooks of the world directly on salary, but they said  they find ways to work around that.  </p><p>  ED LOWERY, U.S. SECRET SERVICE ASSISTANT DIRECTOR:  We have a lot of  imbeds.  We put agents out here in the Silicon Valley working with the  technology companies.  We leverage what they can do.  And again, I don't --  the government is never is going to be able to match the pay scale,  obviously, but there are plenty of patriots out there who want to be in law  enforcement.  </p><p>  JAVERS (voice-over):  For the president today, this visit to heart of  the technology community, to the president it was all about bridging the  differences between government and the private sector.  </p><p>  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Eamon Javers in Stanford.  </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  MATHISEN:  MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (NYSE:V) both announcing  plans to expand their security features for online shopping.  Visa (NYSE:V)  plans to do away with traditional account numbers and instead use a unique  series of numbers that can authorize payments.  MasterCard (NYSE:MA), which  plans to spend more than $20 million on its initiative, will let customers  verify transactions using voice and fingerprints.  MasterCard (NYSE:MA)  plans to launch that program in the spring.  </p><p>  Now to the West Coast port labor dispute and Conagra.  It became the  latest company to blame its weak profit forecast on the traffic congestion  out there.  The package food company said the slowdown is hurting some  products it exports.  Shares of the company off 4 percent.  </p><p>  And as the slowdown drags on at the West Coast ports, one sector most  at risk: retail.  We may learn more about the extent of the impact when  retailers begin reporting earnings next week, including the world's  biggest, Walmart.  </p><p>  As Courtney Reagan tells us, investors will pay close attention.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   Consumers may be looking forward to ditching winter coats for spring  apparel, but retailers are having trouble getting that spring merchandise  in stores.  As disputes over labor contracts continue, the West Coast ports  responsible for nearly 40 percent of all U.S. cargo are shut down for a  second straight weekend, which means merchandise is stuck at sea or in  containers, far from the intended retail destination.  </p><p>  RICHARD JAFFE, STIFEL NICOLAUS RESEARCH ANALYST:  I see some stores  that are out of balance, still featuring what I'll call winter and holiday  goods when at this time of year, that should be relegated to the back racks  on sale and the front should be all fresh new merchandise.  So, the balance  isn't right.  </p><p>  REAGAN:  Target (NYSE:TGT), Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), Michael Kors and  Ralph Lauren are among the retailers that have brought in orders early to  protect inventory levels and are using other points of entry and  distribution to get merchandise into and through the country.  Container  volume at L.A., Long Beach and Oakland ports dropped 25 percent or more in  January from the year prior, but despite the lower volume, the journal of  commerce said some West Coast shipments that normally take two to six days  to unload are now taking up to three weeks.  </p><p>  (on camera):  Circumventing West Coast ports helps get merchandise on  the shelves but it comes at a cost, up to $7 billion this year, according  to some estimates.  Getting cargo from Asia to the East Coast takes longer  and adds to expense.  Air freight is also more expensive.  Both back-up  plans crimping profit margins.  </p><p>  (voice-over):  As retailers reroute goods from Asia to East Coast  parts, Stifel analyst Richard Jaffe points out overflow puts those ports at  max capacity.  </p><p>  JAFFE:  The doomsday scenario, the product comes in late.  The season  therefore shortened.  Retailers have to accelerate sales using discounts.   The consumer benefits with discounted prices, but the retailers suffer  because short and credit discounts.  </p><p>  REAGAN:  Credit Suisse says brands diversified points of distribution  including Nike (NYSE:NKE), Tumi, and VF Corp. should be more insulated in  the short-term while Lululemon and Deckers cold suffer more because of  concentrated West Coast distribution.  </p><p>  While contingencies are working to avoid a material impact on  business, if an extended shutdown or strike occurs, industry-wide  consensus, no retailer goes unaffected.  </p><p>  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Courtney Reagan.  </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  MATHISEN:  Still ahead, how the steep drop in crude prices in recent  months has one city on edge, wondering if its housing rebound could fall  apart.  </p><p>  (MUSIC)</p><p>  MATHISEN:  The number of U.S. oil rigs continues to fall according to  Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI).  Drillers idled 98 rigs this week bringing the rig  count down 30 percent since October, a very steep fall there.  Some look to  rig counts as a leading indicator of production since they are used to  drill new wells.  U.S. oil production overall remains at multi-decade  highs.  </p><p>  Now to Texas, the state driven by a strong energy focused economy.  It  is suddenly now feeling the impact of oil prices that are now about half  their year-ago levels, though up from their lows.  Layoffs being announced  at big energy firms and if the unemployment rate rises, the Houston housing  market could eventually feel a bit of a chill.  </p><p>  Diana Olick has more.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   David Hopkins sold his Houston-area home last fall for top dollar.  He says  he timed the market just right.  </p><p>  DAVID HOPKINS, HOME SELLER:  I feel really glad.  I'm like that guy  that sold his oil company last year.  He's feeling pretty good too.  I feel  the same way.  </p><p>  OLICK:  Both home sales and prices hit record levels in Houston last  year fueled by a booming energy sector.  With oil prices now cut in half,  Houston is already losing jobs, the primary driver for housing.  </p><p>  MICHELLE MORANO:  Now that oil prices are down, things haven't  completely changed but let's just say that things have come to more a  stall.  </p><p>  OLICK:  It will take significant time for the drop in oil prices to  trickle down to Houston's housing market.  In previous oil downturns, it's  taken eight months to two years for job losses to factor into home prices.   But all eyes are on Houston now with the oil industry accounting for about  5.6 percent of its jobs.  This especially because it was the nation's  hottest housing market barely a year ago and is still growing.  Single  family Houston home sales jumped 6 percent in January from a year ago and  prices hit a record high up 7 percent from a year ago.  </p><p>  The only problem now is supply, barely 2.5 months due to all the  demand.  </p><p>  This as builders start to get careful.  KB Home's CEO last month said  the builder had pulled out of a couple of land transactions in the fourth  quarter because of, quote, \"sensitivity\" there.  But they claim they are  not seeing any pullback yet by consumers.  </p><p>  RICK SHARGA, AUCTION.COM:  Because it hasn't been hit yet doesn't mean  it's not going to happen.  So, I think patience is the buzz word.  We're  expecting that Houston will cool down significantly on the residential  side.  </p><p>  OLICK (on camera):  Just for context, energy has really pushed housing  recently.  According to Trulia, in the seven large metros where oil-related  jobs are at least 2 percent of the total, home prices rose 10.5 percent  year over year last year.  That's a lot faster than the rest of the nation.   Now the reverse is in play.  </p><p>  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Diana Olick in Washington.  </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  MATHISEN:  For more on the state of housing in Houston, head to our  Web site, NBR.com.  </p><p>  Well, powerhouse brands help bolster VF Corp's results.  And that is  where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".</p><p>  The parent of brands like the North Face and Vans reported results  that matched on both the top and bottom lines.  Profit did fall from last  year, as the company booked a write-down on the value of some of its brands  and the company warned investors about negative effects from currency  fluctuations for 2015.  But revenue still rose on strength in its outdoor  and action sports division.  I know no kid in my town who doesn't own a  North Face jacket.  Shares popped 6 percent to $75.26.</p><p>  Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) is jacking up its dividend by 12 percent to 37  cents a share.  The new payout will be made to shareholders in March.  The  yield on the dividend is up more than 1.5 percent.  Shares spiked initially  in after-hours trading.  Before the close, the stock was up a fraction to  $79.41.</p><p>  And Smucker -- J.M. Smucker (NYSE:SJM) that would be -- reported mixed  results today, with revenue missing estimates.  The owner of Folgers coffee  said weakness in its coffee business weighed on results, but it's expecting  business to get caffeinated again this year as prices stabilize.  Shares  were up more than 1 percent to $113.89.</p><p>  And Alibaba has received a request for information from the SEC.  The  agency is looking for information related to its interaction with a Chinese  regulator.  Alibaba says it's cooperating with the request.  Shares fell  initially in after-hours trading.  Before the bell, the stock was up 2  percent to $89.05.</p><p>  A rising economic tide lifts all boats and that is especially true for  the boating industry as the economy improves and people feel better about  making big purchases.  Boat manufacturers expecting solid sales growth this  year and they're kicking off their season as they so often do in Miami  where thousands of boats are on display at two separate shows. </p><p>  Morgan Brennan is there.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A  big weekend for boat enthusiasts as more than a hundred thousand people  descend in Miami for two annual boat shows.  Brokers say business is  finally recovering.  </p><p>  MARK ELLIOTT:  Over the last two years, we've seen slow improvement  and it's directly related to the stock market.  As the stock market inches  up, our phone calls increase.  So, with the stock market being in chartered  territory and demand pent up, people are buying yachts.  </p><p>  BRENNAN:  And it's not just luxury, but water crafts.  The National  Marine Manufacturers Association estimates sales of new recreational boats  grew as much as 8 percent last year and it expects that momentum to  continue.  </p><p>  THOM DAMMRICH, NATIONAL MARINE MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION:  As we look  out over the next few years, we think we've got three or more years of  pretty good growth in new boat sales.  </p><p>  BRENNAN:  That's good news for an industry rocked by the recession.   When new sales plunged to 60 percent and one third of retailers closed up  shop.  Since then, to recapture consumers, companies have had to change  their strategies rolling out new models at lower price points. </p><p>  Industry leader Brunswick (NYSE:BC) Corporation says demand comes from  both ends of the consumer spectrum.  </p><p>  DUSTY MCCOY, BRUNSWICK CORP. CEO:  A lot of bigger models completely  sold out over a year and then pontoons, fishing boats which tend to be  smaller, different income level have also now begun to reach prerecession  level.  So, at one at the end market, the other end, market is very  powerful, very strong and growing very much.  </p><p>  BRENNAN (on camera):  So, what's fueling demand for all of these  boats?  An improving labor market, rising consumer confidence and  increasing disposable income thanks in part to lower gas prices.  </p><p>  (voice-over):  But for now here in Miami, people are buying boats and  with thousands to choose from, from inflatables to runabouts to yachts,  there's something here for everyone.  </p><p>  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Morgan Brennan in Miami.  </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  MATHISEN:  Coming up, money and marriage.  Why planning a different  kind of date this Valentine's Day could lead to not only marital bliss but  also financial harmony.  </p><p>  (MUSIC)</p><p>  MATHISEN:  The window to enroll in health care under the Affordable  Care Act quickly closing.  Midnight Sunday is the deadline for coverage  this year and those who don't enroll may be subject to a penalty.  Federal  officials say they've seen a big pick-up in traffic on the healthcare.gov  Web site over the past few days.  </p><p>  Well, 2014 was a rough year for Atlantic City but this year, so far,  off to a more encouraging start.  Casino revenue for January was up almost  19 percent compared with a year ago, even though they've shut down a lot of  casinos.  Part of the reason is less competition for the eight casinos that  are still there.  </p><p>  Well, looking for a Valentine's Day gift for your significant other?   You might want to forget the flowers and chocolate and instead plan a date  -- a money date -- because as Sharon Epperson tells us, that could be the  most valuable gift of all.  </p><p>  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  SHARON EPPERSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   Mark and Evan Elkowitz have been married for 18 years.  They like to talk  about everything, even money.  </p><p>  MARC ELKOWITZ, HUSBAND:  We certainly have conversations about money.  </p><p>  EVAN ELKOWITZ, WIFE:  Sometimes they're not called conversations.  </p><p>  MARC ELKOWITZ:  Sometimes, they are more like avoiding injury than  conversation.  </p><p>  EPPERSON:  Like many couples, they have occasional arguments about  money, too. </p><p>  ELLEN ROGIN, AUTHOR:  Many people weren't brought up learning how to  talk about money with their partners.  So, maybe your parents didn't talk  about money in front of you or maybe didn't even talk about money at all,  or they thought about it.  </p><p>  EPPERSON (voice-over):  It's a crucial conversation to have.  But  nearly 40 percent of couples in a Citi Double Cash survey said they haven't  set aside time to talk about their finances in the past year.  About 30  percent wish they discussed it more.  </p><p>  ROGIN:  Yes, scheduling a time to get together, it can be a fun, like,  go out and have a date.  It doesn't have to be something hard and boring to  sit and talk about.  </p><p>  EVAN ELKOWITZ:  I think planning a date in general is a hard thing.  </p><p>  MARC ELKOWITZ:  A fun date, let alone an accounting date.  </p><p>  EVAN ELKOWITZ:  Right.</p><p>  EPPERSON:  The Elkowitzes find the time to have their money talks in  other ways.  They divide and conquer when it comes to managing the family  finances.</p><p>  EVAN ELKOWITZ:  I pay all the bills, by the way.  Yes, I pay all the  bills.  </p><p>  EPPERSON:  Marc, a plastic surgeon, the primary bred winner, while  Evan, a personal stylist, handles everyday spending.  </p><p>  MARC ELKOWITZ:  It stresses me out.  I don't want to know.  I'd rather  be in the OR taking care of stuff than look at a phone bill.  </p><p>  EVAN ELKOWITZ:  A phone bill isn't bad.  </p><p>  MARC ELKOWITZ:  Or a credit card bill.  </p><p>  EPPERSON:  The Elkowitzes try to strike a balance that keeps both of  them involved and honest about what they own and what they owe.  </p><p>  But when it comes to love and money, not all couples are as  transparent.  In the Citi survey, nearly one in four in a committed  relationship admit they have a private account that their significant other  doesn't know about.  Yet many more admits they would prefer if their  significant other discuss finances more often.  </p><p>  ROGIN:  You really need to come clean with your money.  So, if you  have a secret, whether a hidden account or debt that's out there or  spending that you're not telling your partner about, maybe you spend cash  that they don't know what you spend money about, or you hide bags in your  trunk or in the back of your closet, and come clean, because it's really  hard to have marital bliss if there's not financial harmony.  </p><p>  EPPERSON:  Money advice to whether those challenging times for better  or worse.  </p><p>  For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Sharon Epperson.  </p><p>  (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>  MATHISEN:  And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I'm Tyler  Mathisen.  Thanks for watching.  Have a great long weekend, everyone, and  we'll see you back here Monday for a special holiday edition of NIGHTLY  BUSINESS REPORT.</p><p> END</p><p> Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

The S&amp;P 500 closes at a new high, so do small cap stocks and the Dow Jones industrial average break through 18,000 for the first time this year. Are there more big gains ahead and where should you put your money now?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fighting cyber crime. It is one of the biggest threats to business. And today, at a summit in Silicon Valley, President Obama urged cooperation with the private sector to make the Internet safe.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, February 13th.</p><p>Good evening, everyone. I'm Tyler Mathisen. Sue Herera is off tonight.</p><p>Well, the bulls are back on Wall Street turning Friday the 13th into a lucky day. The S&amp;P 500 ends the week at an all-time high. The blue chip Dow index breaks above 18,000 for the first time this year. And not to be outdone, small caps also finished the day at a record. Strong economic data out of Europe gave the markets a lift early on and hopes that Greece and its creditors will reach some sort of deal when they talks resume on Monday.</p><p>At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose nearly 47 points to 18,019, NASDAQ gained 36 points to a fresh 15-year high, and the S&amp;P 500 was up 8. For the week, the Dow rose 1 percent. The NASDAQ up more than 3 percent, best week since last October, and the S&amp;P 500 gained 2 percent.</p><p>The energy sector was helped by a 3 percent rise in West Texas crude. It is now up nearly 20 percent from its lows last month. Brent Crude back up above $60 a barrel, actually, above $61 for the first time this year. Both benchmarks have now risen for three consecutive weeks.</p><p>What's behind the broad based run-up and is a sign the bulls will stay in control?</p><p>Dominic Chu reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOMINIC CHU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It may not feel like it for many investors but we are once again at record high levels in the stock market, at least when you look at the S&amp;P 500. The broader large cap stock index set a record intraday high today, led by energy stocks, which rallied in the back of high oil prices, and a whole slew of other companies that hit record highs as well, including coffee giant Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), home improvement retailer Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and toy maker Hasbro (NYSE:HAS).</p><p>So, will this upward move continue, and will it get more people interested in buying stocks? Uncertainty about global risks holding some investors back, but if that changes, that could help the bull run continue.</p><p>ROBERT PAVLIK, BOSTON PRIVATE WEALTH: Right now, we have some possible resolutions to things. We have Russia agreeing to a ceasefire with the Ukraine. We have the Greeks talking to the ECB and the E.U. trying to renegotiate their debt package. We have the Chinese reducing reserve requirements, and trying to expand their global economy.</p><p>CHU: And it's not just overseas developments to keep an eye on. If the U.S. economy continues to gradually improve, that's an upside catalyst as well.</p><p>DARIN RICHARDS, AKT WEALTH ADVISORS CIO: Our employment rate continues to move lower. The consumer is in a great spot. Consumer confidence is very high. And we could see, I think, additional spending on the retail side, which again, consumer spending is 70 percent of our economy.</p><p>CHU (on camera): Of course, those are the positive takes. The more cautious in the marketplace point out the fragility of the global economic recovery and they say that markets are priced for perfection. Meaning, if anything upsets the balance, we could be set up for more volatility ahead.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Dominic Chu.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Here to talk more about the record-setting day on Wall Street and his stock picks is this week's market monitor, Eric Marshall, president and portfolio manager of Hodges Capital Management, the Dallas- based fund group that runs more than $2 billion.</p><p>Welcome, Eric. Good to have you with us.</p><p>How do you explain the market turnaround these past couple of weeks?</p><p>ERIC MARSHALL, HODGES CAPITAL MANAGEMENT PRESIDENT: Well, I think it's really been a response to the commodity and some of the volatility that we've seen in currency markets and so forth, just kind of settling down. We've gotten into earnings season, corporate earnings and the outlooks that we're hearing from companies are relatively positive, and I think it's been a normal, you know, one step back, two steps forward.</p><p>MATHISEN: What's it like down there in Dallas, not really the epicenter of the energy world in Texas, I guess you'd say Houston is, but you're very close to it. A lot of the economy is dependent on it. What are people saying?</p><p>MARSHALL: Well, you know, in Dallas and in north Texas, we really haven't seen much of an impact of lower oil prices. If you look at the Texas economy, it's much more diversified than it was back in the early '80s when we had the big oil bust. And so, in Dallas, we haven't seen it, and anecdotally, you hear some things from Houston but hasn't had as big of an impact yet.</p><p>MATHISEN: Uh-huh. You know, we were speaking a couple of weeks ago here internally that we wanted to have somebody on who follows small cap stocks as we focused a lot on the blue chips and here, lo and behold, we have you on a night when the rustle is at a record high. Why? Make the case for small caps this year and I suspect that one of the arguments is that they are less prone to be whip-sawed by currency moves.</p><p>MARSHALL: Yes. We, you know, at the Hodges Funds, we don't get too caught up in the absolute level of any market index. But within small caps, you can always find secular growth opportunities in just any type of market and to your point, they are more domestic-centric. Meaning that they have less foreign exchange exposure, they have more simplified capital structures.</p><p>So, I think it's really a good place for active portfolio management where you can get in there and do some individual stock picking.</p><p>MATHISEN: Let's go through some of your individual stocks beginning with Eagle Materials (NYSE:EXP). You mentioned last time you were here about a year ago, what's been going on there? It's down a little since then.</p><p>MARSHALL: Yes. They're a manufacturer of cement and gypsum and wallboard. Both of those have seen very good demand, very good pricing power. The prices of both of those commodities have been rising, as the housing market and construction market continues to improve in different areas of the country.</p><p>And we really like the earnings profile of the company, the earnings power over the next couple of years. They do have a segment of their business that's relatively small that does provide frack sand to the oil and gas industry. And as a result of that, that's the reason why the stock is down over the past year.</p><p>But we really think you're buying the long-term cement and gypsum wallboard business. You get the rest of the business for free at these price levels.</p><p>MATHISEN: All right. So, that's the reason it's been stuck in the mud there.</p><p>Jarden (NYSE:JAH) Corporation trading now at $51 and change.</p><p>MARSHALL: Yes, and this is more of a mid cap stock than a small cap stock, but it's one we like here. They do over $8 billion in revenues and they are consumer product company. They own brands like Coleman, camping equipment, Rawlings, sporting goods. They have Mr. Coffee. They bought Yankee Candle Company here about a year and a half ago and they have a number of other brands.</p><p>And they're seeing very good organic revenue growth in these areas, as well as some acquisition opportunities. The company throws off a lot of cash flow. They've been aggressively buying back their stock with that cash. And it only trades about 15 times for earnings.</p><p>MATHISEN: Quick thought on Swift Transportation, big trucker.</p><p>MARSHALL: Yes. This is another area -- when you look at the trucking business, it hasn't been very good over the last ten years. And they're starting to see pricing power with some of the long haul truckers, and Swift is really well-positioned to take advantage of that. They've started to raise prices for the first time in about 10 years. And we think with a lot of the driver shortages and lack of investment this space, we think they're going to be very well positioned to take advantage of these trends over the next couple of years.</p><p>MATHISEN: All right. Eric, thank you very much. Have a great weekend. We appreciate it.</p><p>MARSHALL: Thank you, Tyler.</p><p>MATHISEN: Eric Marshall with Hodges Capital Management.</p><p>Well, despite higher stock prices, the sentiment unexpectedly fell in February for the first time in seven months. This is according to University of Michigan's preliminary sentiment index. The drop in sentiment due in part apparently to the recent rise in gasoline prices, energy workers concerns about possible job losses and even the harsh winter weather in the Northeast and parts of the Midwest.</p><p>Now to what the White House calls a defining challenge of the 21st century: Cyber crime. President Obama held a summit in Silicon Valley with chief executives from companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Walgreens, urging the private sector and the government to work together to make the Internet and business safer.</p><p>But as Eamon Javers reports, some big tech CEOs were no-shows.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EAMON JAVERS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A clash of cultures today at Stanford University in tech-centric Silicon Valley as some of the top federal cyber security officials came here for President Obama's cyber security summit. Raising eyebrows, some of the biggest names in technology were conspicuous no-shows, including the CEOs of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO). Silicon Valley insiders attribute the snub to continuing fallout from the Edward Snowden NSA spying revelations.</p><p>Despite that bit of tension between the East and West Coast, the president signed an executive order to encourage more cooperation between the private sector and government. And he told his audience the country needs to come together to deal with a common problem.</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Foreign governments and criminals are probing these systems every single day. We only have to think of real life examples. Air traffic control system going down and disrupting flights, or blackouts that plunge cities into darkness. To imagine what a set of systemic cyber attacks might do. So, this is also a matter of public safety.</p><p>JAVERS: Also here, Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).</p><p>TIM COOK, APPLE CEO: If those of us in positions of responsibility fail to do everything in our power to protect the right of privacy, we risk something far more valuable than money. We risk our way of life.</p><p>JAVERS (on camera): Part of that clash of cultures between the government guys and the techies is the arms race to recruit top technology talent. Federal officials here say they know they can't compete with the Googles and the Facebooks of the world directly on salary, but they said they find ways to work around that.</p><p>ED LOWERY, U.S. SECRET SERVICE ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: We have a lot of imbeds. We put agents out here in the Silicon Valley working with the technology companies. We leverage what they can do. And again, I don't -- the government is never is going to be able to match the pay scale, obviously, but there are plenty of patriots out there who want to be in law enforcement.</p><p>JAVERS (voice-over): For the president today, this visit to heart of the technology community, to the president it was all about bridging the differences between government and the private sector.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Eamon Javers in Stanford.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (NYSE:V) both announcing plans to expand their security features for online shopping. Visa (NYSE:V) plans to do away with traditional account numbers and instead use a unique series of numbers that can authorize payments. MasterCard (NYSE:MA), which plans to spend more than $20 million on its initiative, will let customers verify transactions using voice and fingerprints. MasterCard (NYSE:MA) plans to launch that program in the spring.</p><p>Now to the West Coast port labor dispute and Conagra. It became the latest company to blame its weak profit forecast on the traffic congestion out there. The package food company said the slowdown is hurting some products it exports. Shares of the company off 4 percent.</p><p>And as the slowdown drags on at the West Coast ports, one sector most at risk: retail. We may learn more about the extent of the impact when retailers begin reporting earnings next week, including the world's biggest, Walmart.</p><p>As Courtney Reagan tells us, investors will pay close attention.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Consumers may be looking forward to ditching winter coats for spring apparel, but retailers are having trouble getting that spring merchandise in stores. As disputes over labor contracts continue, the West Coast ports responsible for nearly 40 percent of all U.S. cargo are shut down for a second straight weekend, which means merchandise is stuck at sea or in containers, far from the intended retail destination.</p><p>RICHARD JAFFE, STIFEL NICOLAUS RESEARCH ANALYST: I see some stores that are out of balance, still featuring what I'll call winter and holiday goods when at this time of year, that should be relegated to the back racks on sale and the front should be all fresh new merchandise. So, the balance isn't right.</p><p>REAGAN: Target (NYSE:TGT), Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), Michael Kors and Ralph Lauren are among the retailers that have brought in orders early to protect inventory levels and are using other points of entry and distribution to get merchandise into and through the country. Container volume at L.A., Long Beach and Oakland ports dropped 25 percent or more in January from the year prior, but despite the lower volume, the journal of commerce said some West Coast shipments that normally take two to six days to unload are now taking up to three weeks.</p><p>(on camera): Circumventing West Coast ports helps get merchandise on the shelves but it comes at a cost, up to $7 billion this year, according to some estimates. Getting cargo from Asia to the East Coast takes longer and adds to expense. Air freight is also more expensive. Both back-up plans crimping profit margins.</p><p>(voice-over): As retailers reroute goods from Asia to East Coast parts, Stifel analyst Richard Jaffe points out overflow puts those ports at max capacity.</p><p>JAFFE: The doomsday scenario, the product comes in late. The season therefore shortened. Retailers have to accelerate sales using discounts. The consumer benefits with discounted prices, but the retailers suffer because short and credit discounts.</p><p>REAGAN: Credit Suisse says brands diversified points of distribution including Nike (NYSE:NKE), Tumi, and VF Corp. should be more insulated in the short-term while Lululemon and Deckers cold suffer more because of concentrated West Coast distribution.</p><p>While contingencies are working to avoid a material impact on business, if an extended shutdown or strike occurs, industry-wide consensus, no retailer goes unaffected.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Courtney Reagan.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Still ahead, how the steep drop in crude prices in recent months has one city on edge, wondering if its housing rebound could fall apart.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN: The number of U.S. oil rigs continues to fall according to Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI). Drillers idled 98 rigs this week bringing the rig count down 30 percent since October, a very steep fall there. Some look to rig counts as a leading indicator of production since they are used to drill new wells. U.S. oil production overall remains at multi-decade highs.</p><p>Now to Texas, the state driven by a strong energy focused economy. It is suddenly now feeling the impact of oil prices that are now about half their year-ago levels, though up from their lows. Layoffs being announced at big energy firms and if the unemployment rate rises, the Houston housing market could eventually feel a bit of a chill.</p><p>Diana Olick has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): David Hopkins sold his Houston-area home last fall for top dollar. He says he timed the market just right.</p><p>DAVID HOPKINS, HOME SELLER: I feel really glad. I'm like that guy that sold his oil company last year. He's feeling pretty good too. I feel the same way.</p><p>OLICK: Both home sales and prices hit record levels in Houston last year fueled by a booming energy sector. With oil prices now cut in half, Houston is already losing jobs, the primary driver for housing.</p><p>MICHELLE MORANO: Now that oil prices are down, things haven't completely changed but let's just say that things have come to more a stall.</p><p>OLICK: It will take significant time for the drop in oil prices to trickle down to Houston's housing market. In previous oil downturns, it's taken eight months to two years for job losses to factor into home prices. But all eyes are on Houston now with the oil industry accounting for about 5.6 percent of its jobs. This especially because it was the nation's hottest housing market barely a year ago and is still growing. Single family Houston home sales jumped 6 percent in January from a year ago and prices hit a record high up 7 percent from a year ago.</p><p>The only problem now is supply, barely 2.5 months due to all the demand.</p><p>This as builders start to get careful. KB Home's CEO last month said the builder had pulled out of a couple of land transactions in the fourth quarter because of, quote, \"sensitivity\" there. But they claim they are not seeing any pullback yet by consumers.</p><p>RICK SHARGA, AUCTION.COM: Because it hasn't been hit yet doesn't mean it's not going to happen. So, I think patience is the buzz word. We're expecting that Houston will cool down significantly on the residential side.</p><p>OLICK (on camera): Just for context, energy has really pushed housing recently. According to Trulia, in the seven large metros where oil-related jobs are at least 2 percent of the total, home prices rose 10.5 percent year over year last year. That's a lot faster than the rest of the nation. Now the reverse is in play.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: For more on the state of housing in Houston, head to our Web site, NBR.com.</p><p>Well, powerhouse brands help bolster VF Corp's results. And that is where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The parent of brands like the North Face and Vans reported results that matched on both the top and bottom lines. Profit did fall from last year, as the company booked a write-down on the value of some of its brands and the company warned investors about negative effects from currency fluctuations for 2015. But revenue still rose on strength in its outdoor and action sports division. I know no kid in my town who doesn't own a North Face jacket. Shares popped 6 percent to $75.26.</p><p>Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) is jacking up its dividend by 12 percent to 37 cents a share. The new payout will be made to shareholders in March. The yield on the dividend is up more than 1.5 percent. Shares spiked initially in after-hours trading. Before the close, the stock was up a fraction to $79.41.</p><p>And Smucker -- J.M. Smucker (NYSE:SJM) that would be -- reported mixed results today, with revenue missing estimates. The owner of Folgers coffee said weakness in its coffee business weighed on results, but it's expecting business to get caffeinated again this year as prices stabilize. Shares were up more than 1 percent to $113.89.</p><p>And Alibaba has received a request for information from the SEC. The agency is looking for information related to its interaction with a Chinese regulator. Alibaba says it's cooperating with the request. Shares fell initially in after-hours trading. Before the bell, the stock was up 2 percent to $89.05.</p><p>A rising economic tide lifts all boats and that is especially true for the boating industry as the economy improves and people feel better about making big purchases. Boat manufacturers expecting solid sales growth this year and they're kicking off their season as they so often do in Miami where thousands of boats are on display at two separate shows.</p><p>Morgan Brennan is there.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A big weekend for boat enthusiasts as more than a hundred thousand people descend in Miami for two annual boat shows. Brokers say business is finally recovering.</p><p>MARK ELLIOTT: Over the last two years, we've seen slow improvement and it's directly related to the stock market. As the stock market inches up, our phone calls increase. So, with the stock market being in chartered territory and demand pent up, people are buying yachts.</p><p>BRENNAN: And it's not just luxury, but water crafts. The National Marine Manufacturers Association estimates sales of new recreational boats grew as much as 8 percent last year and it expects that momentum to continue.</p><p>THOM DAMMRICH, NATIONAL MARINE MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION: As we look out over the next few years, we think we've got three or more years of pretty good growth in new boat sales.</p><p>BRENNAN: That's good news for an industry rocked by the recession. When new sales plunged to 60 percent and one third of retailers closed up shop. Since then, to recapture consumers, companies have had to change their strategies rolling out new models at lower price points.</p><p>Industry leader Brunswick (NYSE:BC) Corporation says demand comes from both ends of the consumer spectrum.</p><p>DUSTY MCCOY, BRUNSWICK CORP. CEO: A lot of bigger models completely sold out over a year and then pontoons, fishing boats which tend to be smaller, different income level have also now begun to reach prerecession level. So, at one at the end market, the other end, market is very powerful, very strong and growing very much.</p><p>BRENNAN (on camera): So, what's fueling demand for all of these boats? An improving labor market, rising consumer confidence and increasing disposable income thanks in part to lower gas prices.</p><p>(voice-over): But for now here in Miami, people are buying boats and with thousands to choose from, from inflatables to runabouts to yachts, there's something here for everyone.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Morgan Brennan in Miami.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Coming up, money and marriage. Why planning a different kind of date this Valentine's Day could lead to not only marital bliss but also financial harmony.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN: The window to enroll in health care under the Affordable Care Act quickly closing. Midnight Sunday is the deadline for coverage this year and those who don't enroll may be subject to a penalty. Federal officials say they've seen a big pick-up in traffic on the healthcare.gov Web site over the past few days.</p><p>Well, 2014 was a rough year for Atlantic City but this year, so far, off to a more encouraging start. Casino revenue for January was up almost 19 percent compared with a year ago, even though they've shut down a lot of casinos. Part of the reason is less competition for the eight casinos that are still there.</p><p>Well, looking for a Valentine's Day gift for your significant other? You might want to forget the flowers and chocolate and instead plan a date -- a money date -- because as Sharon Epperson tells us, that could be the most valuable gift of all.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SHARON EPPERSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Mark and Evan Elkowitz have been married for 18 years. They like to talk about everything, even money.</p><p>MARC ELKOWITZ, HUSBAND: We certainly have conversations about money.</p><p>EVAN ELKOWITZ, WIFE: Sometimes they're not called conversations.</p><p>MARC ELKOWITZ: Sometimes, they are more like avoiding injury than conversation.</p><p>EPPERSON: Like many couples, they have occasional arguments about money, too.</p><p>ELLEN ROGIN, AUTHOR: Many people weren't brought up learning how to talk about money with their partners. So, maybe your parents didn't talk about money in front of you or maybe didn't even talk about money at all, or they thought about it.</p><p>EPPERSON (voice-over): It's a crucial conversation to have. But nearly 40 percent of couples in a Citi Double Cash survey said they haven't set aside time to talk about their finances in the past year. About 30 percent wish they discussed it more.</p><p>ROGIN: Yes, scheduling a time to get together, it can be a fun, like, go out and have a date. It doesn't have to be something hard and boring to sit and talk about.</p><p>EVAN ELKOWITZ: I think planning a date in general is a hard thing.</p><p>MARC ELKOWITZ: A fun date, let alone an accounting date.</p><p>EVAN ELKOWITZ: Right.</p><p>EPPERSON: The Elkowitzes find the time to have their money talks in other ways. They divide and conquer when it comes to managing the family finances.</p><p>EVAN ELKOWITZ: I pay all the bills, by the way. Yes, I pay all the bills.</p><p>EPPERSON: Marc, a plastic surgeon, the primary bred winner, while Evan, a personal stylist, handles everyday spending.</p><p>MARC ELKOWITZ: It stresses me out. I don't want to know. I'd rather be in the OR taking care of stuff than look at a phone bill.</p><p>EVAN ELKOWITZ: A phone bill isn't bad.</p><p>MARC ELKOWITZ: Or a credit card bill.</p><p>EPPERSON: The Elkowitzes try to strike a balance that keeps both of them involved and honest about what they own and what they owe.</p><p>But when it comes to love and money, not all couples are as transparent. In the Citi survey, nearly one in four in a committed relationship admit they have a private account that their significant other doesn't know about. Yet many more admits they would prefer if their significant other discuss finances more often.</p><p>ROGIN: You really need to come clean with your money. So, if you have a secret, whether a hidden account or debt that's out there or spending that you're not telling your partner about, maybe you spend cash that they don't know what you spend money about, or you hide bags in your trunk or in the back of your closet, and come clean, because it's really hard to have marital bliss if there's not financial harmony.</p><p>EPPERSON: Money advice to whether those challenging times for better or worse.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Sharon Epperson.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I'm Tyler Mathisen. Thanks for watching.

Stocks power  ahead to new records on the back of earnings, and the shoulders of Wal-Mart  (NYSE:WMT).  So, how healthy really are consumers and retailers? </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CONTESSA BREWER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Growth threat.  Non-bank  lenders have grabbed a huge share of mortgage business but that growth may  be at risk.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MATHISEN:  And back to the future.  As online tools grow, we'll show you  why the hottest new organizational app might just be the pen and paper.</p><p>All that and more for Tuesday, February 21st.</p><p>Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  I'm Tyler Mathisen.</p><p>BREWER:  And I'm Contessa Brewer, in for Sue Herera.</p><p>Investors kicked off the holiday weekend style with all three major indices  finishing in a record territory helps my earnings and energy.  All three  are up more than ten percent since the election.  Today, the Dow 118 points  up to 20,743.  The NASDAQ added the 27, and the S&amp;P 500 tackled -- look at  this -- ending up 14 points.  Energy shares higher thanks to a one-percent  game in oil.</p><p>MATHISEN:  And Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) was one of the key drivers in the Dow  today and in stocks in general.  Earnings at the world's largest retailer  fell in the holiday quarter but so what?  They beat those all-important  Wall Street estimates.  On the other hand, sales came in a little bit below  forecasts even though they were -- get this -- a whopping $131 billion.</p><p>But here's what caught investors eyes: same-store sales in the U.S. rose at  the fastest clip since 2012, and that is what sent the stock up 3 percent.</p><p>Courtney Reagan has more on Wal-Mart's big quarter.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The world's  largest retailer had a pretty good holiday quarter.  Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT)  U.S. sales where the bulk of its sales come from grew at the strongest rate  in more than four years and e-commerce is making up a bigger share of those  sales.  The discounter saw strong traffic in stores and even though food  prices continue to fall, grocery sales were positive, which is important  for Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) grocery represents more than half of total sales  and it's a big traffic driver.</p><p>The discounter did acknowledge sales have been slower than expected to  start the year, which it chalks up to the delay in tax refund versus last  year.</p><p>JAN ROGERS KNIFFEN, J. ROGERS KNIFFEN WORLDWIDE ENTEPRISES:  I'm positive  on Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) right now.  I've had them in the question mark  phase.  I've said they're doing all the right things but it's hard to get  it for the bottom line.</p><p>Unfortunately, they're competing with a really, really tough business than  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).</p><p>REAGAN:  Investing in e-commerce remains a top priority for Wal-Mart  (NYSE:WMT) as it spends billions of dollars to catch up to Amazon  (NASDAQ:AMZN) online.  Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) says it's free two-day shipping  on orders of $35 or more has led to a nice uptick in e-commerce in the  three weeks since it launched.</p><p>Interestingly over the weekend, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) quietly dropped its  free shipping threshold back down to $35.</p><p>I spoke to Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) chief financial officer Brett Biggs.  And  when I asked how Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) is thinking about a potential border  adjustment tax, Biggs explained, \"We are pro-tax reform for anything that  will help with jobs and help consumers.\"  He went on to say, \"We do have  concerns that the border adjustment tax has the probability of increasing  prices.  It is concerning to us.\"</p><p>Biggs added, \"The devil is in the details, so it's too difficult to  speculate on any potential impact.\"  </p><p>So, for now, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) guidance assumes the tax and regulatory  landscape stays as is.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Courtney Reagan.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREWER:  Fellow Dow component Home Depot (NYSE:HD) had a strong quarter  blowing past Wall Street expectations as the housing market remains strong.   The home-improvement retailer also hiked its dividend 29 percent to 89  cents a share.  That's up from 69 cents.</p><p>Home Depot (NYSE:HD) wasn't finish there.  Nope.  It said it's buying back  $15 billion worth of shares. </p><p>Put that all together, and you have shares up 2 percent to an all-time  high.</p><p>MATHISEN:  And now to Macy's and a different kind of retail result.  The  company's profits fell more than 10 percent and its same-store sales  slumped, with the company telling investors to brace for another year of  the same.  Earlier this month, the reports surface that Hudson Bay had  approached Macy's (NYSE:M) about a possible takeover.</p><p>But despite the results today, Macy CEO is betting on the consumer and says  his company has to be ready.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TERRY LUNDGREN, MACY'S CHAIRMAN AND CEO:  Consumers have money.  They're  spending their money.  They're spending it in different places than in  stores like ours in mall-based stores.  But -- and they're spending it with  us online.  </p><p>But still, at the end of the day, the consumer has the money once they  spent their money on these various categories, they've got to be ready to  come back to ours.  And when they do, we've got to be in position to take  advantage, particularly in our stores.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Macy's shares flat on the day.</p><p>BREWER:  On Friday, we told you one of the biggest deals ever was closed  and now call it a deal undone.  Kraft (NYSE:KFT) Heinz dropped its $143  billion takeover bid for rival consumer goods giant Unilever (NYSE:UN).   The deal broke up when the offer became public and it was clear Unilever  (NYSE:UN) was not interested in a tie-up.  Kraft (NYSE:KFT) shares lost  about 2 percent on the day.</p><p>MATHISEN:  And another deal we told you about last week that it might  happen actually did.  Burger King's parents Restaurant Brands will buy the  chicken chain Popeyes for nearly $2 billion.  That's a lot of wings.  </p><p>Both companies taking off on the news.  Restaurant Brands up about seven  percent and Popeyes spreading higher by nearly twenty percent.</p><p>BREWER:  Consumer staple companies particularly food companies are having a  hard time growing.  So, they're working on new strategies to find a way to  do that.</p><p>Sara Eisen is in Boca Raton, Florida, with a look at some innovative  approaches.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SARA EISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Big food has a big  growth problem.  That's why companies from General Mills (NYSE:GIS) to  Conagra are rolling out new innovations for longtime household brands to  meet changing consumer taste.  Like Oreo and Ritz Crackers maker Mondelez  launching a new brand called Vea, no artificial ingredients and GMO-free.</p><p>IRENE ROSENFELD, MONDELEZ CEO:  Consumers still want indulgence I think I  think there's always a sense that all everybody's moving over to what well- being.  We certainly on are more indulgent brands, we're continuing to  evolve them with products like Oreo Thins, with products like Bubbly  Chocolate and making sure that we have portion control packages.  So,  there's all sorts of ways to meet the consumers needs.</p><p>But at the end of the day, there's no question it is a trend everywhere in  the world and as the world's largest snacking company, we intend to  capitalize on.</p><p>EISEN:  Ingredion supplies ingredients to many of these companies and sees  the health trend evolving.</p><p>What's really working right now?  What are some insights you can give us?</p><p>ILENE GORDON, INGREDION CEO:  People want a protein in different ways and  certainly meat protein has been evidence in the past.  Soy protein has been  around.  So, I think vegetable protein is going to be the next trend where  consumers want that in the crackers, in their pasta, in their rice, and we  at Ingredion are really participating with our customers to formulate that.</p><p>EISEN:  Besides falling behind on big food trends like healthier and  fresher eating, companies have grappled with slower growth both abroad and  here in the U.S.  And they have yet to see any meaningful boost in spending  despite the strong jump and consumer confidence after the election.</p><p>TOM HAYES, TYSON FOODS CEO:  What we see is in the second quarter of the  year is usually a difficult time for us, because consumers are coming out  the holidays.  The holiday period, based on our product portfolio, is a  huge, huge period for us.  So, right now, we're not necessarily seeing that  play through.  But certainly, you know, confidence is building and helps  the restaurant business, our food service business is starting to gain some  momentum.  And overall, you know, of course, people are going to focus more  on brands to the extent that they're more confident.  That's always good  for us.</p><p>EISEN:  Companies are also adapting to any potential policy changes from  Washington on trade taxes and regulation.  </p><p>For the meat industry, for example, China and Mexico are big buyers of U.S.  poultry, beef and pork.  So, executives are watching nervously, bracing for  any heated rhetoric and a slowdown in trade.</p><p>But despite the growth problems, overall food stocks have been great  investments lately.  They're considered safe.  They pay big dividends and  they've been a hot space for deal-making.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Sara Eisen in Boca.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  So, what do all of these results from retailers, deal news, and  so forth tell us about the state of the consumer and retail today?</p><p>Jan Kniffen knows.  He's the CEO of the retail research firm J. Rogers  (NYSE:ROG) Kniffen Worldwide Enterprises and he's with us now to discuss.</p><p>Let's start, Jan, with Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), which is not exactly been a big  market participants, a driver of the market until today.  How did they get  their mojo back?</p><p>JAN KNIFFEN, J. ROGERS KNIFFEN WORLDWIDE ENTERPRISES:  They worked really  hard at it.  They've done retailing pretty darn well.  They've got better  in stocks.  They've fixed the supply chain.  They've made the stores more  shoppable.</p><p>They've actually done what they've been needing to do for a long time,  which was just get back to the fundamentals making the consumer happier.   But the other thing they've done is they've done a really good job of  getting online, and they've done it without costing themselves bottom line.  </p><p>The biggest problem but we thought they might have was that as they  transferred more and more online, that it would cost them at the bottom  line.  It hasn't done that.  So, people were pretty excited about that.   They had good, solid store for store sales numbers and they didn't wreck  their earnings to get there.  </p><p>So, this looks like Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) has turned the corner and I think  they were up 29 percent online, with a really big number, and that tells  you what Jets doing for them and what their own business is doing for them.   That's what they've got to do to be competitive with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).</p><p>BREWER:  And they are really giving Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) a run for their  money.  In fact, there was news today about Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) now  dumping back from of its cost on those items what they have -- what you  have to pay on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in order to get free shipping if you're  not a prime member.</p><p>So, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) looking at Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) with a skeptical  eye, but Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) itself it's not only seeing a big jump in  online, it saw a big jump in same-store sales.  How do they do that?  What  kind of it experience do you see that's drawing customers in?</p><p>KNIFFEN:  Well, they actually have up traffic.  I think that up traffic was  like one-point-four percent, and, boy, that's hard to get in the current  environment.  So, not only did they get up store for store comps.  They  actually had more people coming to the store and most stores are not seeing  that.  </p><p>And they've done that because they've made the store a better place to buy.   They've got a better assortment of products.  They've got much better  business in the grocery than they've had in the past.  They're doing pick  up at the store, drive-in, loaded in your car and more than 500 stores now.</p><p>So, they really made themselves much more attractive to the customer and  the customer finally have started responding, which is what they've been  waiting to see.</p><p>MATHISEN:  So, my sense is that the consumer is pretty healthy.  Incomes  are stable or rising.  Unemployment is low and so forth.  </p><p>But when we were talking, Jan, right after the holidays, we all sort of  universally agreed that the mall base stores and their holiday results were  kind of meh.  Here, you got Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Home Depot (NYSE:HD)  not going to cover off the ball, take it out a little, broaden it out a  little bit, are others doing as well?  Macy's sure isn't.</p><p>KNIFFEN:  Well, you know, the two you just named are not mall-based stores  and they're also not dealing in exactly the same space.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Good point.</p><p>KNIFFEN:  If you look at people who are dealing in apparel as of Amazon  (NASDAQ:AMZN) became the biggest apparel seller in the country last year,  apparel really got hurt, and apparel continuing to deflate where we've seen  a slowdown in food inflation.</p><p>And Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is in another category all by itself, right?  It's  clearly best-in-class of what it does but it's also selling a product where  everybody is doing things to their home.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Right.</p><p>KNIFFEN:  Plus, we're seeing housing turns do really well.</p><p>But people are nesting too.  They want to do more for the house they're  currently in and they'd rather do that and sit home and ordering Domino's  than go out and shop.  And that's hurting everybody else.  So it's great  for Home Depot (NYSE:HD).</p><p>BREWER:  Yes.  By the way, Home Depot's offering that experience to the  shoppers too because they're offering the kids workshop at the beginning of  the month.  They offer how-to programs for people who come in.  And you top  that off with the branding and the knowledge and you're making loyal  customers out of the people who might just venture into you went there.</p><p>KNIFFEN:  And experiential is where we are.</p><p>BREWER:  Yes.</p><p>KNIFFEN:  If you can get the customer to want to come to your store to do  something, they may buy something while they're there.  And that's kind of  what we've come down to.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, have fun in Las Vegas, Jan.</p><p>KNIFFEN:  It's always fun.  I love magic.</p><p>MATHISEN:  See you, man.  Jan Kniffen with J. Rogers (NYSE:ROG) Kniffen  Worldwide.</p><p>BREWER:  Earlier, we mentioned Home Depot's massive stock buyback and while  the repurchases generally help to lift earnings, Bob Pisani tells us  they're not necessarily a cure-all.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Home Depot (NYSE:HD)  had great learning for what really moved the stock to an historic high  today was the announcement that they were hiking the dividend 29 percent  and buying back $15 billion in stock.  That's nearly nine percent of the  shares outstanding.</p><p>Home Depot (NYSE:HD) was already what I call a buyback monster.  Since  2003, they cut their shares outstanding in a half from $2.36 billion to  $1.21 billion shares.  And they're not alone.  A lot of companies have  drastically cut shares outstanding in an effort to boost earnings.  </p><p>For example, since 1997, IBM has cut its shares outstanding in half.  Exxon  has cut their shares by 42 percent since 2000.  Big tech names like Intel  (NASDAQ:INTC) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) have also cut their shares  outstanding by about 30 percent since 2001.</p><p>The buybacks are not a panacea for stock growth.  IBM has woefully  underperformed the S&amp;P 500 in the last five years because they've been  beset by growth issues.  Its revenues from its online businesses were  shrinking and there wasn't revenues from newer businesses like artificial  intelligence replacing it. </p><p>The lesson here is no amount of financial engineering like buying back  shares can replace management's inability to grow the businesses.  </p><p>Home Depot (NYSE:HD) grows their business.  The stock goes up.  IBM has  troubles growing their business.  The stock has trouble going up.  Buybacks  are not a panacea for stock growth.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Coming up, why the president's agenda could be troublesome for  the companies that issue most of the nation's mortgages.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN:  CEOs of more than a dozen companies including Boeing (NYSE:BA),  Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) have called on  lawmakers to overall the corporate tax code.  In a letter to the House and  Senate leadership, the chief executives argued a so-called \"border  adjustment tax\" will make the U.S. products more competitive overseas.   This comes following last week's meeting at the White House with the topic  execs from the retail industry who say the opposite.  They say this type of  tax would raise their costs and likely prices for consumers.</p><p>BREWER:  Canada's foreign minister says any renegotiating of the North  American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, would be between Canada, the U.S. and  Mexico, and not negotiated individually.</p><p>And as Kayla Tausche tells us, that it's all been not to talk so far.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  President Trump's  100-day action plan list renegotiating NAFTA as a top priority.  But it  could be months before official talks with Canada and Mexico begin.  By law  passed in 2015, the White House must notify in writing the House Ways and  means and Senate finance committee of a negotiation period beginning that  last 90 days.  The two branches then have that time to set their agenda  before the U.S. approaches Canada and Mexico.</p><p>Aides from both committees confirmed that no such letter has been sent as  of this week's recess.  Meanwhile, Mexico has already begun its  renegotiation clock.</p><p>The president and his team have met more casually with the relevant parties  earlier this month, but a senior administration official says it will  pursue the proper channels to renegotiate with Congress once a U.S. trade  representative is installed.  No hearing yet for that nominee, Robert  Lighthizer.</p><p>In the meantime, NAFTA remains a key pillar of Trump's economic talking  points.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We're going to have  tremendous trade deals all over the world, but they're going to be  bilateral or as we would say, one-on-one.  None of these deals will we get  caught in a quicksand, where we get mired in and we can't do anything about  it, like by the way, NAFTA and so many others.</p><p>TAUSCHE:  Canada's foreign minister on Tuesday struck down the notion that  a new NAFTA could actually be two deals, one with each country, saying any  negotiations would involve all three.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Kayla Tausche, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Lumber Liquidators post on a narrower loss and shares take off,  and that is where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The results easily beat analyst expectations.  The beleaguered hardwood  flooring retailer said a rise in same-store sales helped overall revenue  top street estimates.  The company also said it remains committed to  returning the profitability.  Shares pop 17 percent to $17.98.</p><p>The railroad company CSX (NYSE:CSX) said it would cut a thousand management  position through what it called an involuntary separation program.  The  layoffs are expected to be concentrated in the company's Jacksonville,  Florida, headquarter operations and the company also said its CEO and  president are expected to retire at the end of May.  CSX (NYSE:CSX) shares  up 37 cents to $48.91.</p><p>Shares of Community Health Systems (NYSE:CYH) took off today following the  hospital operator's better-than-expected earnings and revenue report came  out yesterday.  Community Health said it has divested more than 20  hospitals in the latest quarter and will continue to focus its efforts on  reducing its debt load.  Shares soared more than 33 percent to $9.23.</p><p>BREWER:  Self-driving technology company Mobileye has inked another deal  with an automaker.  Last week, we told you the company signed an agreement  with Volkswagen.  And today, Mobileye and luxury car company BMW said that  Mobileye's data generation technology will be available in BMW's models.   Mobileye shares rose 1 percent to $46.12.</p><p>Horizon confirmed it would buy Yahoo's core assets at a discount.  We told  last week that the two companies were reportedly in talks to revise the  takeover price following Yahoo's two data breaches.  Well, now, Verizon  (NYSE:VZ) said it will pay about $4.5 billion for Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO).   That is $350 million less than its initial offer.  That's my kind of  bargain.  Verizon (NYSE:VZ) shares were up a fraction to $49.43, while  shares of Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO) rose 40 cents to $49.50.</p><p>And Boeing (NYSE:BA) has received an order from a private Chinese carrier  for five of its Dreamliner jet.  That deal is valued at more than $1  billion.  Boeing (NYSE:BA) shares rose more than 1 1/2 percent to $175.56.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) has fired four of its senior managers as  part of the fraudulent accounts scandal that has rocked the bank since last  year.  None of those executives will get a bonus and they will forfeit all  of their unvested equity awards and vested outstanding options.</p><p>The move is part of the company board of directors' independent  investigation into the bank sales practices.  Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) was  fined in September nearly $200 million for creating some 2 million  fraudulent accounts.  And the bank's former CEO, John Stumpf, resigned in  October.</p><p>BREWER:  Tighter regulation on the banks led to the rise of a whole new  group of companies like Quicken and Loan Depot, who grabbed a huge chunk of  the mortgage market.  </p><p>But as Diana Olick tell us, if President Trump is able to roll back some of  the regulation, those non-bank lenders will feel a pinch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  At a recent meeting  with his employees, the CEO of Loan Depot had some sobering word.</p><p>ANTHONY HSIEH, LOAN DEPOT CEO:  Everything that we're doing today  unfortunately will change.  </p><p>OLICK:  Anthony Hsieh was talking technology but he could have said the  same for regulation in the mortgage market.  The Trump administration has  signaled it will roll back stringent safeguards put in place following the  financial crisis.  Those rules in addition to billions of dollars in  lawsuits and fine cause the big banks to pull back on home loan lending,  opening the door for non-bank lenders like Loan Depot, Quicken and Caliber  Home Loan.</p><p>HSIEH:  In one since, we really don't want any changes because of what it  really does it creates the barrier to entry.  It just makes life more  difficult.</p><p>OLICK:  For the past six years, there had been a staggering takeover by  non-bank lenders, especially in government insured FHA lending.  They went  from just ten percent of new originations in 2010 to half the market today.   But if the Trump administration loosen regulations on big bank and stop  suing for every single loan infraction, the big banks could move back in  and the nonbanks could face stiffer competition.</p><p>The CEO of Caliber Home Loans who used to run Citi Mortgage sees another  threat.</p><p>SANJIV DAS, CALIBER HOME LOANS CEO:  I do expect that the regional banks  would step up their exposure to lending a lot more, because the U.S.  consumer is still very strong, home buying is very strong, and everybody  has to show growth for their shareholders and investors.</p><p>OLICK:  Whether banks large or local move back in or not, one thing is  certain.  Higher mortgage rates will shrink demand for all home loans,  especially refinances.  And that means all lenders will be competing for an  ever-smaller pool of business.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  And coming up, why the good old-fashioned a planner day is back,  sort of.  We'll explain.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>BREWER:  Here's what to watch on Wednesday.  On the housing front, sales in  January of existing homes are expected to tick higher.  As for earnings,  one of Wall Street's darlings, Tesla, is expected to release its quarterly  results.  And the markets will pick apart the minutes of this month's  Federal Reserve meeting.  That's what to watch for tomorrow.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, at a time when seemingly everything is done online,  millennials are starting to schedule their lives in a very old school way,  with the notebook.  In fact, sales of traditional journals and notebooks  have taken off over the past year.  </p><p>And as Jane Wells tells us, what's old is new again.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MOLLIE CRAVEN, BULLET JOURNAL OWNER:  This is this week.</p><p>JANE WELLS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Mollie Craven is a 30- something marketing professional who discovered the hottest new app for  organizing her life is a notebook.  </p><p>CRAVEN:  I wanted to kind of get more religious and ritualistic about my  planning and my list making.</p><p>WELLS:  Everything old is new again as millennials are taking pen to paper.   They call it bullet journaling.  Hundreds of thousands of images have been  posted on Instagram from simple to elaborate.  There's even a how-to video.</p><p>RYDER CARROLL, BULLETJOURNAL.COM:  We keep track of things.</p><p>WELLS:  That's Ryder Carroll, an app designer in Brooklyn who has led the  bullet journal movement.  He says apps like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Calendar  are great, but limited.</p><p>CARROLL:  And what I really like about bullet train was really important to  me is that all kind of goes into one place.  It's like one tool.</p><p>WELLS:  But it's so easy now to schedule your life, go to the dentist and  put down your goals.  And an app and if you fail to do something, you can  just cut and paste it over to the next week or delete all evidence of  failure.</p><p>Physically writing something down makes it permanent.  It takes more time  and perhaps leads to better results, at least that's the idea.</p><p>CRAVEN:  It does give me time to sit down and think about what's coming up  and plan a little bit more effectively.  However, I don't think I've been  doing it long enough to really see the improvement yet.</p><p>WELLS:  Even so, sales by publicly traded notebook maker Moleskine rose 12  percent in the U.S. last year.  Ryder Carroll is selling a bullet journal  made by Leuchtturm, a 100-year-old German company started back when people  used to write.  He says there's one other benefit.</p><p>CARROLL:  The Bullet Journal by its very nature of the analog forces you to  disconnect.  It forces you not to be online, and that's also really  powerful thing.</p><p>WELLS:  However, digital apps do have one advantage lose your device and  your info is stored in the Cloud.  Lose your notebook and it's gone  forever.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Jane Wells, Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREWER:  Next up, manual typewriters.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Yes, I'm not that organized digitally or on paper.

Stocks power  ahead to new records on the back of earnings, and the shoulders of Wal-Mart  (NYSE:WMT).  So, how healthy really are consumers and retailers? </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CONTESSA BREWER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Growth threat.  Non-bank  lenders have grabbed a huge share of mortgage business but that growth may  be at risk.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MATHISEN:  And back to the future.  As online tools grow, we'll show you  why the hottest new organizational app might just be the pen and paper.</p><p>All that and more for Tuesday, February 21st.</p><p>Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  I'm Tyler Mathisen.</p><p>BREWER:  And I'm Contessa Brewer, in for Sue Herera.</p><p>Investors kicked off the holiday weekend style with all three major indices  finishing in a record territory helps my earnings and energy.  All three  are up more than ten percent since the election.  Today, the Dow 118 points  up to 20,743.  The NASDAQ added the 27, and the S&amp;P 500 tackled -- look at  this -- ending up 14 points.  Energy shares higher thanks to a one-percent  game in oil.</p><p>MATHISEN:  And Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) was one of the key drivers in the Dow  today and in stocks in general.  Earnings at the world's largest retailer  fell in the holiday quarter but so what?  They beat those all-important  Wall Street estimates.  On the other hand, sales came in a little bit below  forecasts even though they were -- get this -- a whopping $131 billion.</p><p>But here's what caught investors eyes: same-store sales in the U.S. rose at  the fastest clip since 2012, and that is what sent the stock up 3 percent.</p><p>Courtney Reagan has more on Wal-Mart's big quarter.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The world's  largest retailer had a pretty good holiday quarter.  Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT)  U.S. sales where the bulk of its sales come from grew at the strongest rate  in more than four years and e-commerce is making up a bigger share of those  sales.  The discounter saw strong traffic in stores and even though food  prices continue to fall, grocery sales were positive, which is important  for Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) grocery represents more than half of total sales  and it's a big traffic driver.</p><p>The discounter did acknowledge sales have been slower than expected to  start the year, which it chalks up to the delay in tax refund versus last  year.</p><p>JAN ROGERS KNIFFEN, J. ROGERS KNIFFEN WORLDWIDE ENTEPRISES:  I'm positive  on Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) right now.  I've had them in the question mark  phase.  I've said they're doing all the right things but it's hard to get  it for the bottom line.</p><p>Unfortunately, they're competing with a really, really tough business than  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).</p><p>REAGAN:  Investing in e-commerce remains a top priority for Wal-Mart  (NYSE:WMT) as it spends billions of dollars to catch up to Amazon  (NASDAQ:AMZN) online.  Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) says it's free two-day shipping  on orders of $35 or more has led to a nice uptick in e-commerce in the  three weeks since it launched.</p><p>Interestingly over the weekend, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) quietly dropped its  free shipping threshold back down to $35.</p><p>I spoke to Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) chief financial officer Brett Biggs.  And  when I asked how Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) is thinking about a potential border  adjustment tax, Biggs explained, \"We are pro-tax reform for anything that  will help with jobs and help consumers.\"  He went on to say, \"We do have  concerns that the border adjustment tax has the probability of increasing  prices.  It is concerning to us.\"</p><p>Biggs added, \"The devil is in the details, so it's too difficult to  speculate on any potential impact.\"  </p><p>So, for now, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) guidance assumes the tax and regulatory  landscape stays as is.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Courtney Reagan.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREWER:  Fellow Dow component Home Depot (NYSE:HD) had a strong quarter  blowing past Wall Street expectations as the housing market remains strong.   The home-improvement retailer also hiked its dividend 29 percent to 89  cents a share.  That's up from 69 cents.</p><p>Home Depot (NYSE:HD) wasn't finish there.  Nope.  It said it's buying back  $15 billion worth of shares. </p><p>Put that all together, and you have shares up 2 percent to an all-time  high.</p><p>MATHISEN:  And now to Macy's and a different kind of retail result.  The  company's profits fell more than 10 percent and its same-store sales  slumped, with the company telling investors to brace for another year of  the same.  Earlier this month, the reports surface that Hudson Bay had  approached Macy's (NYSE:M) about a possible takeover.</p><p>But despite the results today, Macy CEO is betting on the consumer and says  his company has to be ready.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TERRY LUNDGREN, MACY'S CHAIRMAN AND CEO:  Consumers have money.  They're  spending their money.  They're spending it in different places than in  stores like ours in mall-based stores.  But -- and they're spending it with  us online.  </p><p>But still, at the end of the day, the consumer has the money once they  spent their money on these various categories, they've got to be ready to  come back to ours.  And when they do, we've got to be in position to take  advantage, particularly in our stores.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Macy's shares flat on the day.</p><p>BREWER:  On Friday, we told you one of the biggest deals ever was closed  and now call it a deal undone.  Kraft (NYSE:KFT) Heinz dropped its $143  billion takeover bid for rival consumer goods giant Unilever (NYSE:UN).   The deal broke up when the offer became public and it was clear Unilever  (NYSE:UN) was not interested in a tie-up.  Kraft (NYSE:KFT) shares lost  about 2 percent on the day.</p><p>MATHISEN:  And another deal we told you about last week that it might  happen actually did.  Burger King's parents Restaurant Brands will buy the  chicken chain Popeyes for nearly $2 billion.  That's a lot of wings.  </p><p>Both companies taking off on the news.  Restaurant Brands up about seven  percent and Popeyes spreading higher by nearly twenty percent.</p><p>BREWER:  Consumer staple companies particularly food companies are having a  hard time growing.  So, they're working on new strategies to find a way to  do that.</p><p>Sara Eisen is in Boca Raton, Florida, with a look at some innovative  approaches.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SARA EISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Big food has a big  growth problem.  That's why companies from General Mills (NYSE:GIS) to  Conagra are rolling out new innovations for longtime household brands to  meet changing consumer taste.  Like Oreo and Ritz Crackers maker Mondelez  launching a new brand called Vea, no artificial ingredients and GMO-free.</p><p>IRENE ROSENFELD, MONDELEZ CEO:  Consumers still want indulgence I think I  think there's always a sense that all everybody's moving over to what well- being.  We certainly on are more indulgent brands, we're continuing to  evolve them with products like Oreo Thins, with products like Bubbly  Chocolate and making sure that we have portion control packages.  So,  there's all sorts of ways to meet the consumers needs.</p><p>But at the end of the day, there's no question it is a trend everywhere in  the world and as the world's largest snacking company, we intend to  capitalize on.</p><p>EISEN:  Ingredion supplies ingredients to many of these companies and sees  the health trend evolving.</p><p>What's really working right now?  What are some insights you can give us?</p><p>ILENE GORDON, INGREDION CEO:  People want a protein in different ways and  certainly meat protein has been evidence in the past.  Soy protein has been  around.  So, I think vegetable protein is going to be the next trend where  consumers want that in the crackers, in their pasta, in their rice, and we  at Ingredion are really participating with our customers to formulate that.</p><p>EISEN:  Besides falling behind on big food trends like healthier and  fresher eating, companies have grappled with slower growth both abroad and  here in the U.S.  And they have yet to see any meaningful boost in spending  despite the strong jump and consumer confidence after the election.</p><p>TOM HAYES, TYSON FOODS CEO:  What we see is in the second quarter of the  year is usually a difficult time for us, because consumers are coming out  the holidays.  The holiday period, based on our product portfolio, is a  huge, huge period for us.  So, right now, we're not necessarily seeing that  play through.  But certainly, you know, confidence is building and helps  the restaurant business, our food service business is starting to gain some  momentum.  And overall, you know, of course, people are going to focus more  on brands to the extent that they're more confident.  That's always good  for us.</p><p>EISEN:  Companies are also adapting to any potential policy changes from  Washington on trade taxes and regulation.  </p><p>For the meat industry, for example, China and Mexico are big buyers of U.S.  poultry, beef and pork.  So, executives are watching nervously, bracing for  any heated rhetoric and a slowdown in trade.</p><p>But despite the growth problems, overall food stocks have been great  investments lately.  They're considered safe.  They pay big dividends and  they've been a hot space for deal-making.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Sara Eisen in Boca.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  So, what do all of these results from retailers, deal news, and  so forth tell us about the state of the consumer and retail today?</p><p>Jan Kniffen knows.  He's the CEO of the retail research firm J. Rogers  (NYSE:ROG) Kniffen Worldwide Enterprises and he's with us now to discuss.</p><p>Let's start, Jan, with Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), which is not exactly been a big  market participants, a driver of the market until today.  How did they get  their mojo back?</p><p>JAN KNIFFEN, J. ROGERS KNIFFEN WORLDWIDE ENTERPRISES:  They worked really  hard at it.  They've done retailing pretty darn well.  They've got better  in stocks.  They've fixed the supply chain.  They've made the stores more  shoppable.</p><p>They've actually done what they've been needing to do for a long time,  which was just get back to the fundamentals making the consumer happier.   But the other thing they've done is they've done a really good job of  getting online, and they've done it without costing themselves bottom line.  </p><p>The biggest problem but we thought they might have was that as they  transferred more and more online, that it would cost them at the bottom  line.  It hasn't done that.  So, people were pretty excited about that.   They had good, solid store for store sales numbers and they didn't wreck  their earnings to get there.  </p><p>So, this looks like Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) has turned the corner and I think  they were up 29 percent online, with a really big number, and that tells  you what Jets doing for them and what their own business is doing for them.   That's what they've got to do to be competitive with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).</p><p>BREWER:  And they are really giving Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) a run for their  money.  In fact, there was news today about Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) now  dumping back from of its cost on those items what they have -- what you  have to pay on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in order to get free shipping if you're  not a prime member.</p><p>So, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) looking at Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) with a skeptical  eye, but Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) itself it's not only seeing a big jump in  online, it saw a big jump in same-store sales.  How do they do that?  What  kind of it experience do you see that's drawing customers in?</p><p>KNIFFEN:  Well, they actually have up traffic.  I think that up traffic was  like one-point-four percent, and, boy, that's hard to get in the current  environment.  So, not only did they get up store for store comps.  They  actually had more people coming to the store and most stores are not seeing  that.  </p><p>And they've done that because they've made the store a better place to buy.   They've got a better assortment of products.  They've got much better  business in the grocery than they've had in the past.  They're doing pick  up at the store, drive-in, loaded in your car and more than 500 stores now.</p><p>So, they really made themselves much more attractive to the customer and  the customer finally have started responding, which is what they've been  waiting to see.</p><p>MATHISEN:  So, my sense is that the consumer is pretty healthy.  Incomes  are stable or rising.  Unemployment is low and so forth.  </p><p>But when we were talking, Jan, right after the holidays, we all sort of  universally agreed that the mall base stores and their holiday results were  kind of meh.  Here, you got Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Home Depot (NYSE:HD)  not going to cover off the ball, take it out a little, broaden it out a  little bit, are others doing as well?  Macy's sure isn't.</p><p>KNIFFEN:  Well, you know, the two you just named are not mall-based stores  and they're also not dealing in exactly the same space.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Good point.</p><p>KNIFFEN:  If you look at people who are dealing in apparel as of Amazon  (NASDAQ:AMZN) became the biggest apparel seller in the country last year,  apparel really got hurt, and apparel continuing to deflate where we've seen  a slowdown in food inflation.</p><p>And Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is in another category all by itself, right?  It's  clearly best-in-class of what it does but it's also selling a product where  everybody is doing things to their home.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Right.</p><p>KNIFFEN:  Plus, we're seeing housing turns do really well.</p><p>But people are nesting too.  They want to do more for the house they're  currently in and they'd rather do that and sit home and ordering Domino's  than go out and shop.  And that's hurting everybody else.  So it's great  for Home Depot (NYSE:HD).</p><p>BREWER:  Yes.  By the way, Home Depot's offering that experience to the  shoppers too because they're offering the kids workshop at the beginning of  the month.  They offer how-to programs for people who come in.  And you top  that off with the branding and the knowledge and you're making loyal  customers out of the people who might just venture into you went there.</p><p>KNIFFEN:  And experiential is where we are.</p><p>BREWER:  Yes.</p><p>KNIFFEN:  If you can get the customer to want to come to your store to do  something, they may buy something while they're there.  And that's kind of  what we've come down to.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, have fun in Las Vegas, Jan.</p><p>KNIFFEN:  It's always fun.  I love magic.</p><p>MATHISEN:  See you, man.  Jan Kniffen with J. Rogers (NYSE:ROG) Kniffen  Worldwide.</p><p>BREWER:  Earlier, we mentioned Home Depot's massive stock buyback and while  the repurchases generally help to lift earnings, Bob Pisani tells us  they're not necessarily a cure-all.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Home Depot (NYSE:HD)  had great learning for what really moved the stock to an historic high  today was the announcement that they were hiking the dividend 29 percent  and buying back $15 billion in stock.  That's nearly nine percent of the  shares outstanding.</p><p>Home Depot (NYSE:HD) was already what I call a buyback monster.  Since  2003, they cut their shares outstanding in a half from $2.36 billion to  $1.21 billion shares.  And they're not alone.  A lot of companies have  drastically cut shares outstanding in an effort to boost earnings.  </p><p>For example, since 1997, IBM has cut its shares outstanding in half.  Exxon  has cut their shares by 42 percent since 2000.  Big tech names like Intel  (NASDAQ:INTC) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) have also cut their shares  outstanding by about 30 percent since 2001.</p><p>The buybacks are not a panacea for stock growth.  IBM has woefully  underperformed the S&amp;P 500 in the last five years because they've been  beset by growth issues.  Its revenues from its online businesses were  shrinking and there wasn't revenues from newer businesses like artificial  intelligence replacing it. </p><p>The lesson here is no amount of financial engineering like buying back  shares can replace management's inability to grow the businesses.  </p><p>Home Depot (NYSE:HD) grows their business.  The stock goes up.  IBM has  troubles growing their business.  The stock has trouble going up.  Buybacks  are not a panacea for stock growth.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Coming up, why the president's agenda could be troublesome for  the companies that issue most of the nation's mortgages.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN:  CEOs of more than a dozen companies including Boeing (NYSE:BA),  Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) have called on  lawmakers to overall the corporate tax code.  In a letter to the House and  Senate leadership, the chief executives argued a so-called \"border  adjustment tax\" will make the U.S. products more competitive overseas.   This comes following last week's meeting at the White House with the topic  execs from the retail industry who say the opposite.  They say this type of  tax would raise their costs and likely prices for consumers.</p><p>BREWER:  Canada's foreign minister says any renegotiating of the North  American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, would be between Canada, the U.S. and  Mexico, and not negotiated individually.</p><p>And as Kayla Tausche tells us, that it's all been not to talk so far.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  President Trump's  100-day action plan list renegotiating NAFTA as a top priority.  But it  could be months before official talks with Canada and Mexico begin.  By law  passed in 2015, the White House must notify in writing the House Ways and  means and Senate finance committee of a negotiation period beginning that  last 90 days.  The two branches then have that time to set their agenda  before the U.S. approaches Canada and Mexico.</p><p>Aides from both committees confirmed that no such letter has been sent as  of this week's recess.  Meanwhile, Mexico has already begun its  renegotiation clock.</p><p>The president and his team have met more casually with the relevant parties  earlier this month, but a senior administration official says it will  pursue the proper channels to renegotiate with Congress once a U.S. trade  representative is installed.  No hearing yet for that nominee, Robert  Lighthizer.</p><p>In the meantime, NAFTA remains a key pillar of Trump's economic talking  points.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We're going to have  tremendous trade deals all over the world, but they're going to be  bilateral or as we would say, one-on-one.  None of these deals will we get  caught in a quicksand, where we get mired in and we can't do anything about  it, like by the way, NAFTA and so many others.</p><p>TAUSCHE:  Canada's foreign minister on Tuesday struck down the notion that  a new NAFTA could actually be two deals, one with each country, saying any  negotiations would involve all three.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Kayla Tausche, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Lumber Liquidators post on a narrower loss and shares take off,  and that is where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The results easily beat analyst expectations.  The beleaguered hardwood  flooring retailer said a rise in same-store sales helped overall revenue  top street estimates.  The company also said it remains committed to  returning the profitability.  Shares pop 17 percent to $17.98.</p><p>The railroad company CSX (NYSE:CSX) said it would cut a thousand management  position through what it called an involuntary separation program.  The  layoffs are expected to be concentrated in the company's Jacksonville,  Florida, headquarter operations and the company also said its CEO and  president are expected to retire at the end of May.  CSX (NYSE:CSX) shares  up 37 cents to $48.91.</p><p>Shares of Community Health Systems (NYSE:CYH) took off today following the  hospital operator's better-than-expected earnings and revenue report came  out yesterday.  Community Health said it has divested more than 20  hospitals in the latest quarter and will continue to focus its efforts on  reducing its debt load.  Shares soared more than 33 percent to $9.23.</p><p>BREWER:  Self-driving technology company Mobileye has inked another deal  with an automaker.  Last week, we told you the company signed an agreement  with Volkswagen.  And today, Mobileye and luxury car company BMW said that  Mobileye's data generation technology will be available in BMW's models.   Mobileye shares rose 1 percent to $46.12.</p><p>Horizon confirmed it would buy Yahoo's core assets at a discount.  We told  last week that the two companies were reportedly in talks to revise the  takeover price following Yahoo's two data breaches.  Well, now, Verizon  (NYSE:VZ) said it will pay about $4.5 billion for Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO).   That is $350 million less than its initial offer.  That's my kind of  bargain.  Verizon (NYSE:VZ) shares were up a fraction to $49.43, while  shares of Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO) rose 40 cents to $49.50.</p><p>And Boeing (NYSE:BA) has received an order from a private Chinese carrier  for five of its Dreamliner jet.  That deal is valued at more than $1  billion.  Boeing (NYSE:BA) shares rose more than 1 1/2 percent to $175.56.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) has fired four of its senior managers as  part of the fraudulent accounts scandal that has rocked the bank since last  year.  None of those executives will get a bonus and they will forfeit all  of their unvested equity awards and vested outstanding options.</p><p>The move is part of the company board of directors' independent  investigation into the bank sales practices.  Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) was  fined in September nearly $200 million for creating some 2 million  fraudulent accounts.  And the bank's former CEO, John Stumpf, resigned in  October.</p><p>BREWER:  Tighter regulation on the banks led to the rise of a whole new  group of companies like Quicken and Loan Depot, who grabbed a huge chunk of  the mortgage market.  </p><p>But as Diana Olick tell us, if President Trump is able to roll back some of  the regulation, those non-bank lenders will feel a pinch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  At a recent meeting  with his employees, the CEO of Loan Depot had some sobering word.</p><p>ANTHONY HSIEH, LOAN DEPOT CEO:  Everything that we're doing today  unfortunately will change.  </p><p>OLICK:  Anthony Hsieh was talking technology but he could have said the  same for regulation in the mortgage market.  The Trump administration has  signaled it will roll back stringent safeguards put in place following the  financial crisis.  Those rules in addition to billions of dollars in  lawsuits and fine cause the big banks to pull back on home loan lending,  opening the door for non-bank lenders like Loan Depot, Quicken and Caliber  Home Loan.</p><p>HSIEH:  In one since, we really don't want any changes because of what it  really does it creates the barrier to entry.  It just makes life more  difficult.</p><p>OLICK:  For the past six years, there had been a staggering takeover by  non-bank lenders, especially in government insured FHA lending.  They went  from just ten percent of new originations in 2010 to half the market today.   But if the Trump administration loosen regulations on big bank and stop  suing for every single loan infraction, the big banks could move back in  and the nonbanks could face stiffer competition.</p><p>The CEO of Caliber Home Loans who used to run Citi Mortgage sees another  threat.</p><p>SANJIV DAS, CALIBER HOME LOANS CEO:  I do expect that the regional banks  would step up their exposure to lending a lot more, because the U.S.  consumer is still very strong, home buying is very strong, and everybody  has to show growth for their shareholders and investors.</p><p>OLICK:  Whether banks large or local move back in or not, one thing is  certain.  Higher mortgage rates will shrink demand for all home loans,  especially refinances.  And that means all lenders will be competing for an  ever-smaller pool of business.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  And coming up, why the good old-fashioned a planner day is back,  sort of.  We'll explain.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>BREWER:  Here's what to watch on Wednesday.  On the housing front, sales in  January of existing homes are expected to tick higher.  As for earnings,  one of Wall Street's darlings, Tesla, is expected to release its quarterly  results.  And the markets will pick apart the minutes of this month's  Federal Reserve meeting.  That's what to watch for tomorrow.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, at a time when seemingly everything is done online,  millennials are starting to schedule their lives in a very old school way,  with the notebook.  In fact, sales of traditional journals and notebooks  have taken off over the past year.  </p><p>And as Jane Wells tells us, what's old is new again.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MOLLIE CRAVEN, BULLET JOURNAL OWNER:  This is this week.</p><p>JANE WELLS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Mollie Craven is a 30- something marketing professional who discovered the hottest new app for  organizing her life is a notebook.  </p><p>CRAVEN:  I wanted to kind of get more religious and ritualistic about my  planning and my list making.</p><p>WELLS:  Everything old is new again as millennials are taking pen to paper.   They call it bullet journaling.  Hundreds of thousands of images have been  posted on Instagram from simple to elaborate.  There's even a how-to video.</p><p>RYDER CARROLL, BULLETJOURNAL.COM:  We keep track of things.</p><p>WELLS:  That's Ryder Carroll, an app designer in Brooklyn who has led the  bullet journal movement.  He says apps like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Calendar  are great, but limited.</p><p>CARROLL:  And what I really like about bullet train was really important to  me is that all kind of goes into one place.  It's like one tool.</p><p>WELLS:  But it's so easy now to schedule your life, go to the dentist and  put down your goals.  And an app and if you fail to do something, you can  just cut and paste it over to the next week or delete all evidence of  failure.</p><p>Physically writing something down makes it permanent.  It takes more time  and perhaps leads to better results, at least that's the idea.</p><p>CRAVEN:  It does give me time to sit down and think about what's coming up  and plan a little bit more effectively.  However, I don't think I've been  doing it long enough to really see the improvement yet.</p><p>WELLS:  Even so, sales by publicly traded notebook maker Moleskine rose 12  percent in the U.S. last year.  Ryder Carroll is selling a bullet journal  made by Leuchtturm, a 100-year-old German company started back when people  used to write.  He says there's one other benefit.</p><p>CARROLL:  The Bullet Journal by its very nature of the analog forces you to  disconnect.  It forces you not to be online, and that's also really  powerful thing.</p><p>WELLS:  However, digital apps do have one advantage lose your device and  your info is stored in the Cloud.  Lose your notebook and it's gone  forever.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Jane Wells, Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREWER:  Next up, manual typewriters.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Yes, I'm not that organized digitally or on paper. I can't do  it.  I don't have the discipline.</p><p>BREWER:  Wow.</p><p>That's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I'm Contessa Brewer.</p><p>MATHISEN:  I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Thanks for watching.

Stocks power ahead to new records on the back of earnings, and the shoulders of Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT). So, how healthy really are consumers and retailers?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CONTESSA BREWER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Growth threat. Non-bank lenders have grabbed a huge share of mortgage business but that growth may be at risk.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MATHISEN: And back to the future. As online tools grow, we`ll show you why the hottest new organizational app might just be the pen and paper.</p><p>All that and more for Tuesday, February 21st.</p><p>Good evening, everyone, and welcome. I`m Tyler Mathisen.</p><p>BREWER: And I`m Contessa Brewer, in for Sue Herera.</p><p>Investors kicked off the holiday weekend style with all three major indices finishing in a record territory helps my earnings and energy. All three are up more than ten percent since the election. Today, the Dow 118 points up to 20,743. The NASDAQ added the 27, and the S&amp;P 500 tackled -- look at this -- ending up 14 points. Energy shares higher thanks to a one-percent game in oil.</p><p>MATHISEN: And Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) was one of the key drivers in the Dow today and in stocks in general. Earnings at the world`s largest retailer fell in the holiday quarter but so what? They beat those all-important Wall Street estimates. On the other hand, sales came in a little bit below forecasts even though they were -- get this -- a whopping $131 billion.</p><p>But here`s what caught investors eyes: same-store sales in the U.S. rose at the fastest clip since 2012, and that is what sent the stock up 3 percent.</p><p>Courtney Reagan has more on Wal-Mart`s big quarter.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The world`s largest retailer had a pretty good holiday quarter. Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) U.S. sales where the bulk of its sales come from grew at the strongest rate in more than four years and e-commerce is making up a bigger share of those sales. The discounter saw strong traffic in stores and even though food prices continue to fall, grocery sales were positive, which is important for Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) grocery represents more than half of total sales and it`s a big traffic driver.</p><p>The discounter did acknowledge sales have been slower than expected to start the year, which it chalks up to the delay in tax refund versus last year.</p><p>JAN ROGERS KNIFFEN, J. ROGERS KNIFFEN WORLDWIDE ENTEPRISES: I`m positive on Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) right now. I`ve had them in the question mark phase. I`ve said they`re doing all the right things but it`s hard to get it for the bottom line.</p><p>Unfortunately, they`re competing with a really, really tough business than Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).</p><p>REAGAN: Investing in e-commerce remains a top priority for Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) as it spends billions of dollars to catch up to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) online. Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) says it`s free two-day shipping on orders of $35 or more has led to a nice uptick in e-commerce in the three weeks since it launched.</p><p>Interestingly over the weekend, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) quietly dropped its free shipping threshold back down to $35.</p><p>I spoke to Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) chief financial officer Brett Biggs. And when I asked how Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) is thinking about a potential border adjustment tax, Biggs explained, \"We are pro-tax reform for anything that will help with jobs and help consumers.\" He went on to say, \"We do have concerns that the border adjustment tax has the probability of increasing prices. It is concerning to us.\"</p><p>Biggs added, \"The devil is in the details, so it`s too difficult to speculate on any potential impact.\"</p><p>So, for now, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) guidance assumes the tax and regulatory landscape stays as is.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Courtney Reagan.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREWER: Fellow Dow component Home Depot (NYSE:HD) had a strong quarter blowing past Wall Street expectations as the housing market remains strong. The home-improvement retailer also hiked its dividend 29 percent to 89 cents a share. That`s up from 69 cents.</p><p>Home Depot (NYSE:HD) wasn`t finish there. Nope. It said it`s buying back $15 billion worth of shares.</p><p>Put that all together, and you have shares up 2 percent to an all-time high.</p><p>MATHISEN: And now to Macy`s and a different kind of retail result. The company`s profits fell more than 10 percent and its same-store sales slumped, with the company telling investors to brace for another year of the same. Earlier this month, the reports surface that Hudson Bay had approached Macy`s (NYSE:M) about a possible takeover.</p><p>But despite the results today, Macy CEO is betting on the consumer and says his company has to be ready.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TERRY LUNDGREN, MACY`S CHAIRMAN AND CEO: Consumers have money. They`re spending their money. They`re spending it in different places than in stores like ours in mall-based stores. But -- and they`re spending it with us online.</p><p>But still, at the end of the day, the consumer has the money once they spent their money on these various categories, they`ve got to be ready to come back to ours. And when they do, we`ve got to be in position to take advantage, particularly in our stores.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATHISEN: Macy`s shares flat on the day.</p><p>BREWER: On Friday, we told you one of the biggest deals ever was closed and now call it a deal undone. Kraft (NYSE:KFT) Heinz dropped its $143 billion takeover bid for rival consumer goods giant Unilever (NYSE:UN). The deal broke up when the offer became public and it was clear Unilever (NYSE:UN) was not interested in a tie-up. Kraft (NYSE:KFT) shares lost about 2 percent on the day.</p><p>MATHISEN: And another deal we told you about last week that it might happen actually did. Burger King`s parents Restaurant Brands will buy the chicken chain Popeyes for nearly $2 billion. That`s a lot of wings.</p><p>Both companies taking off on the news. Restaurant Brands up about seven percent and Popeyes spreading higher by nearly twenty percent.</p><p>BREWER: Consumer staple companies particularly food companies are having a hard time growing. So, they`re working on new strategies to find a way to do that.</p><p>Sara Eisen is in Boca Raton, Florida, with a look at some innovative approaches.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SARA EISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Big food has a big growth problem. That`s why companies from General Mills (NYSE:GIS) to Conagra are rolling out new innovations for longtime household brands to meet changing consumer taste. Like Oreo and Ritz Crackers maker Mondelez launching a new brand called Vea, no artificial ingredients and GMO-free.</p><p>IRENE ROSENFELD, MONDELEZ CEO: Consumers still want indulgence I think I think there`s always a sense that all everybody`s moving over to what well- being. We certainly on are more indulgent brands, we`re continuing to evolve them with products like Oreo Thins, with products like Bubbly Chocolate and making sure that we have portion control packages. So, there`s all sorts of ways to meet the consumers needs.</p><p>But at the end of the day, there`s no question it is a trend everywhere in the world and as the world`s largest snacking company, we intend to capitalize on.</p><p>EISEN: Ingredion supplies ingredients to many of these companies and sees the health trend evolving.</p><p>What`s really working right now? What are some insights you can give us?</p><p>ILENE GORDON, INGREDION CEO: People want a protein in different ways and certainly meat protein has been evidence in the past. Soy protein has been around. So, I think vegetable protein is going to be the next trend where consumers want that in the crackers, in their pasta, in their rice, and we at Ingredion are really participating with our customers to formulate that.</p><p>EISEN: Besides falling behind on big food trends like healthier and fresher eating, companies have grappled with slower growth both abroad and here in the U.S. And they have yet to see any meaningful boost in spending despite the strong jump and consumer confidence after the election.</p><p>TOM HAYES, TYSON FOODS CEO: What we see is in the second quarter of the year is usually a difficult time for us, because consumers are coming out the holidays. The holiday period, based on our product portfolio, is a huge, huge period for us. So, right now, we`re not necessarily seeing that play through. But certainly, you know, confidence is building and helps the restaurant business, our food service business is starting to gain some momentum. And overall, you know, of course, people are going to focus more on brands to the extent that they`re more confident. That`s always good for us.</p><p>EISEN: Companies are also adapting to any potential policy changes from Washington on trade taxes and regulation.</p><p>For the meat industry, for example, China and Mexico are big buyers of U.S. poultry, beef and pork. So, executives are watching nervously, bracing for any heated rhetoric and a slowdown in trade.</p><p>But despite the growth problems, overall food stocks have been great investments lately. They`re considered safe. They pay big dividends and they`ve been a hot space for deal-making.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Sara Eisen in Boca.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: So, what do all of these results from retailers, deal news, and so forth tell us about the state of the consumer and retail today?</p><p>Jan Kniffen knows. He`s the CEO of the retail research firm J. Rogers (NYSE:ROG) Kniffen Worldwide Enterprises and he`s with us now to discuss.</p><p>Let`s start, Jan, with Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), which is not exactly been a big market participants, a driver of the market until today. How did they get their mojo back?</p><p>JAN KNIFFEN, J. ROGERS KNIFFEN WORLDWIDE ENTERPRISES: They worked really hard at it. They`ve done retailing pretty darn well. They`ve got better in stocks. They`ve fixed the supply chain. They`ve made the stores more shoppable.</p><p>They`ve actually done what they`ve been needing to do for a long time, which was just get back to the fundamentals making the consumer happier. But the other thing they`ve done is they`ve done a really good job of getting online, and they`ve done it without costing themselves bottom line.</p><p>The biggest problem but we thought they might have was that as they transferred more and more online, that it would cost them at the bottom line. It hasn`t done that. So, people were pretty excited about that. They had good, solid store for store sales numbers and they didn`t wreck their earnings to get there.</p><p>So, this looks like Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) has turned the corner and I think they were up 29 percent online, with a really big number, and that tells you what Jets doing for them and what their own business is doing for them. That`s what they`ve got to do to be competitive with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).</p><p>BREWER: And they are really giving Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) a run for their money. In fact, there was news today about Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) now dumping back from of its cost on those items what they have -- what you have to pay on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in order to get free shipping if you`re not a prime member.</p><p>So, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) looking at Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) with a skeptical eye, but Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) itself it`s not only seeing a big jump in online, it saw a big jump in same-store sales. How do they do that? What kind of it experience do you see that`s drawing customers in?</p><p>KNIFFEN: Well, they actually have up traffic. I think that up traffic was like one-point-four percent, and, boy, that`s hard to get in the current environment. So, not only did they get up store for store comps. They actually had more people coming to the store and most stores are not seeing that.</p><p>And they`ve done that because they`ve made the store a better place to buy. They`ve got a better assortment of products. They`ve got much better business in the grocery than they`ve had in the past. They`re doing pick up at the store, drive-in, loaded in your car and more than 500 stores now.</p><p>So, they really made themselves much more attractive to the customer and the customer finally have started responding, which is what they`ve been waiting to see.</p><p>MATHISEN: So, my sense is that the consumer is pretty healthy. Incomes are stable or rising. Unemployment is low and so forth.</p><p>But when we were talking, Jan, right after the holidays, we all sort of universally agreed that the mall base stores and their holiday results were kind of meh. Here, you got Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Home Depot (NYSE:HD) not going to cover off the ball, take it out a little, broaden it out a little bit, are others doing as well? Macy`s sure isn`t.</p><p>KNIFFEN: Well, you know, the two you just named are not mall-based stores and they`re also not dealing in exactly the same space.</p><p>MATHISEN: Good point.</p><p>KNIFFEN: If you look at people who are dealing in apparel as of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) became the biggest apparel seller in the country last year, apparel really got hurt, and apparel continuing to deflate where we`ve seen a slowdown in food inflation.</p><p>And Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is in another category all by itself, right? It`s clearly best-in-class of what it does but it`s also selling a product where everybody is doing things to their home.</p><p>MATHISEN: Right.</p><p>KNIFFEN: Plus, we`re seeing housing turns do really well.</p><p>But people are nesting too. They want to do more for the house they`re currently in and they`d rather do that and sit home and ordering Domino`s than go out and shop. And that`s hurting everybody else. So it`s great for Home Depot (NYSE:HD).</p><p>BREWER: Yes. By the way, Home Depot`s offering that experience to the shoppers too because they`re offering the kids workshop at the beginning of the month. They offer how-to programs for people who come in. And you top that off with the branding and the knowledge and you`re making loyal customers out of the people who might just venture into you went there.</p><p>KNIFFEN: And experiential is where we are.</p><p>BREWER: Yes.</p><p>KNIFFEN: If you can get the customer to want to come to your store to do something, they may buy something while they`re there. And that`s kind of what we`ve come down to.</p><p>MATHISEN: Well, have fun in Las Vegas, Jan.</p><p>KNIFFEN: It`s always fun. I love magic.</p><p>MATHISEN: See you, man. Jan Kniffen with J. Rogers (NYSE:ROG) Kniffen Worldwide.</p><p>BREWER: Earlier, we mentioned Home Depot`s massive stock buyback and while the repurchases generally help to lift earnings, Bob Pisani tells us they`re not necessarily a cure-all.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Home Depot (NYSE:HD) had great learning for what really moved the stock to an historic high today was the announcement that they were hiking the dividend 29 percent and buying back $15 billion in stock. That`s nearly nine percent of the shares outstanding.</p><p>Home Depot (NYSE:HD) was already what I call a buyback monster. Since 2003, they cut their shares outstanding in a half from $2.36 billion to $1.21 billion shares. And they`re not alone. A lot of companies have drastically cut shares outstanding in an effort to boost earnings.</p><p>For example, since 1997, IBM has cut its shares outstanding in half. Exxon has cut their shares by 42 percent since 2000. Big tech names like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) have also cut their shares outstanding by about 30 percent since 2001.</p><p>The buybacks are not a panacea for stock growth. IBM has woefully underperformed the S&amp;P 500 in the last five years because they`ve been beset by growth issues. Its revenues from its online businesses were shrinking and there wasn`t revenues from newer businesses like artificial intelligence replacing it.</p><p>The lesson here is no amount of financial engineering like buying back shares can replace management`s inability to grow the businesses.</p><p>Home Depot (NYSE:HD) grows their business. The stock goes up. IBM has troubles growing their business. The stock has trouble going up. Buybacks are not a panacea for stock growth.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Coming up, why the president`s agenda could be troublesome for the companies that issue most of the nation`s mortgages.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN: CEOs of more than a dozen companies including Boeing (NYSE:BA), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) have called on lawmakers to overall the corporate tax code. In a letter to the House and Senate leadership, the chief executives argued a so-called \"border adjustment tax\" will make the U.S. products more competitive overseas. This comes following last week`s meeting at the White House with the topic execs from the retail industry who say the opposite. They say this type of tax would raise their costs and likely prices for consumers.</p><p>BREWER: Canada`s foreign minister says any renegotiating of the North American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, would be between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, and not negotiated individually.</p><p>And as Kayla Tausche tells us, that it`s all been not to talk so far.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: President Trump`s 100-day action plan list renegotiating NAFTA as a top priority. But it could be months before official talks with Canada and Mexico begin. By law passed in 2015, the White House must notify in writing the House Ways and means and Senate finance committee of a negotiation period beginning that last 90 days. The two branches then have that time to set their agenda before the U.S. approaches Canada and Mexico.</p><p>Aides from both committees confirmed that no such letter has been sent as of this week`s recess. Meanwhile, Mexico has already begun its renegotiation clock.</p><p>The president and his team have met more casually with the relevant parties earlier this month, but a senior administration official says it will pursue the proper channels to renegotiate with Congress once a U.S. trade representative is installed. No hearing yet for that nominee, Robert Lighthizer.</p><p>In the meantime, NAFTA remains a key pillar of Trump`s economic talking points.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We`re going to have tremendous trade deals all over the world, but they`re going to be bilateral or as we would say, one-on-one. None of these deals will we get caught in a quicksand, where we get mired in and we can`t do anything about it, like by the way, NAFTA and so many others.</p><p>TAUSCHE: Canada`s foreign minister on Tuesday struck down the notion that a new NAFTA could actually be two deals, one with each country, saying any negotiations would involve all three.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Kayla Tausche, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Lumber Liquidators post on a narrower loss and shares take off, and that is where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>The results easily beat analyst expectations. The beleaguered hardwood flooring retailer said a rise in same-store sales helped overall revenue top street estimates. The company also said it remains committed to returning the profitability. Shares pop 17 percent to $17.98.</p><p>The railroad company CSX (NYSE:CSX) said it would cut a thousand management position through what it called an involuntary separation program. The layoffs are expected to be concentrated in the company`s Jacksonville, Florida, headquarter operations and the company also said its CEO and president are expected to retire at the end of May. CSX (NYSE:CSX) shares up 37 cents to $48.91.</p><p>Shares of Community Health Systems (NYSE:CYH) took off today following the hospital operator`s better-than-expected earnings and revenue report came out yesterday. Community Health said it has divested more than 20 hospitals in the latest quarter and will continue to focus its efforts on reducing its debt load. Shares soared more than 33 percent to $9.23.</p><p>BREWER: Self-driving technology company Mobileye has inked another deal with an automaker. Last week, we told you the company signed an agreement with Volkswagen. And today, Mobileye and luxury car company BMW said that Mobileye`s data generation technology will be available in BMW`s models. Mobileye shares rose 1 percent to $46.12.</p><p>Horizon confirmed it would buy Yahoo`s core assets at a discount. We told last week that the two companies were reportedly in talks to revise the takeover price following Yahoo`s two data breaches. Well, now, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) said it will pay about $4.5 billion for Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO). That is $350 million less than its initial offer. That`s my kind of bargain. Verizon (NYSE:VZ) shares were up a fraction to $49.43, while shares of Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO) rose 40 cents to $49.50.</p><p>And Boeing (NYSE:BA) has received an order from a private Chinese carrier for five of its Dreamliner jet. That deal is valued at more than $1 billion. Boeing (NYSE:BA) shares rose more than 1 1/2 percent to $175.56.</p><p>MATHISEN: Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) has fired four of its senior managers as part of the fraudulent accounts scandal that has rocked the bank since last year. None of those executives will get a bonus and they will forfeit all of their unvested equity awards and vested outstanding options.</p><p>The move is part of the company board of directors` independent investigation into the bank sales practices. Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) was fined in September nearly $200 million for creating some 2 million fraudulent accounts. And the bank`s former CEO, John Stumpf, resigned in October.</p><p>BREWER: Tighter regulation on the banks led to the rise of a whole new group of companies like Quicken and Loan Depot, who grabbed a huge chunk of the mortgage market.</p><p>But as Diana Olick tell us, if President Trump is able to roll back some of the regulation, those non-bank lenders will feel a pinch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: At a recent meeting with his employees, the CEO of Loan Depot had some sobering word.</p><p>ANTHONY HSIEH, LOAN DEPOT CEO: Everything that we`re doing today unfortunately will change.</p><p>OLICK: Anthony Hsieh was talking technology but he could have said the same for regulation in the mortgage market. The Trump administration has signaled it will roll back stringent safeguards put in place following the financial crisis. Those rules in addition to billions of dollars in lawsuits and fine cause the big banks to pull back on home loan lending, opening the door for non-bank lenders like Loan Depot, Quicken and Caliber Home Loan.</p><p>HSIEH: In one since, we really don`t want any changes because of what it really does it creates the barrier to entry. It just makes life more difficult.</p><p>OLICK: For the past six years, there had been a staggering takeover by non-bank lenders, especially in government insured FHA lending. They went from just ten percent of new originations in 2010 to half the market today. But if the Trump administration loosen regulations on big bank and stop suing for every single loan infraction, the big banks could move back in and the nonbanks could face stiffer competition.</p><p>The CEO of Caliber Home Loans who used to run Citi Mortgage sees another threat.</p><p>SANJIV DAS, CALIBER HOME LOANS CEO: I do expect that the regional banks would step up their exposure to lending a lot more, because the U.S. consumer is still very strong, home buying is very strong, and everybody has to show growth for their shareholders and investors.</p><p>OLICK: Whether banks large or local move back in or not, one thing is certain. Higher mortgage rates will shrink demand for all home loans, especially refinances. And that means all lenders will be competing for an ever-smaller pool of business.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: And coming up, why the good old-fashioned a planner day is back, sort of. We`ll explain.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>BREWER: Here`s what to watch on Wednesday. On the housing front, sales in January of existing homes are expected to tick higher. As for earnings, one of Wall Street`s darlings, Tesla, is expected to release its quarterly results. And the markets will pick apart the minutes of this month`s Federal Reserve meeting. That`s what to watch for tomorrow.</p><p>MATHISEN: Well, at a time when seemingly everything is done online, millennials are starting to schedule their lives in a very old school way, with the notebook. In fact, sales of traditional journals and notebooks have taken off over the past year.</p><p>And as Jane Wells tells us, what`s old is new again.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MOLLIE CRAVEN, BULLET JOURNAL OWNER: This is this week.</p><p>JANE WELLS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Mollie Craven is a 30- something marketing professional who discovered the hottest new app for organizing her life is a notebook.</p><p>CRAVEN: I wanted to kind of get more religious and ritualistic about my planning and my list making.</p><p>WELLS: Everything old is new again as millennials are taking pen to paper. They call it bullet journaling. Hundreds of thousands of images have been posted on Instagram from simple to elaborate. There`s even a how-to video.</p><p>RYDER CARROLL, BULLETJOURNAL.COM: We keep track of things.</p><p>WELLS: That`s Ryder Carroll, an app designer in Brooklyn who has led the bullet journal movement. He says apps like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Calendar are great, but limited.</p><p>CARROLL: And what I really like about bullet train was really important to me is that all kind of goes into one place. It`s like one tool.</p><p>WELLS: But it`s so easy now to schedule your life, go to the dentist and put down your goals. And an app and if you fail to do something, you can just cut and paste it over to the next week or delete all evidence of failure.</p><p>Physically writing something down makes it permanent. It takes more time and perhaps leads to better results, at least that`s the idea.</p><p>CRAVEN: It does give me time to sit down and think about what`s coming up and plan a little bit more effectively. However, I don`t think I`ve been doing it long enough to really see the improvement yet.</p><p>WELLS: Even so, sales by publicly traded notebook maker Moleskine rose 12 percent in the U.S. last year. Ryder Carroll is selling a bullet journal made by Leuchtturm, a 100-year-old German company started back when people used to write. He says there`s one other benefit.</p><p>CARROLL: The Bullet Journal by its very nature of the analog forces you to disconnect. It forces you not to be online, and that`s also really powerful thing.</p><p>WELLS: However, digital apps do have one advantage lose your device and your info is stored in the Cloud. Lose your notebook and it`s gone forever.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Jane Wells, Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BREWER: Next up, manual typewriters.</p><p>MATHISEN: Yes, I`m not that organized digitally or on paper. I can`t do it. I don`t have the discipline.</p><p>BREWER: Wow.</p><p>That`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I`m Contessa Brewer.</p><p>MATHISEN: I`m Tyler Mathisen. Thanks for watching.

Stocks power  ahead to new records on the back of earnings, and the shoulders of Wal-Mart  (NYSE:WMT).  So, how healthy really are consumers and retailers? </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> CONTESSA BREWER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Growth threat.  Non-bank  lenders have grabbed a huge share of mortgage business but that growth may  be at risk.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> MATHISEN:  And back to the future.  As online tools grow, we'll show you  why the hottest new organizational app might just be the pen and paper.</p><p> All that and more for Tuesday, February 21st.</p><p> Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  I'm Tyler Mathisen.</p><p> BREWER:  And I'm Contessa Brewer, in for Sue Herera.</p><p> Investors kicked off the holiday weekend style with all three major indices  finishing in a record territory helps my earnings and energy.  All three  are up more than ten percent since the election.  Today, the Dow 118 points  up to 20,743.  The NASDAQ added the 27, and the S&amp;P 500 tackled -- look at  this -- ending up 14 points.  Energy shares higher thanks to a one-percent  game in oil.</p><p> MATHISEN:  And Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) was one of the key drivers in the Dow  today and in stocks in general.  Earnings at the world's largest retailer  fell in the holiday quarter but so what?  They beat those all-important  Wall Street estimates.  On the other hand, sales came in a little bit below  forecasts even though they were -- get this -- a whopping $131 billion.</p><p> But here's what caught investors eyes: same-store sales in the U.S. rose at  the fastest clip since 2012, and that is what sent the stock up 3 percent.</p><p> Courtney Reagan has more on Wal-Mart's big quarter.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The world's  largest retailer had a pretty good holiday quarter.  Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT)  U.S. sales where the bulk of its sales come from grew at the strongest rate  in more than four years and e-commerce is making up a bigger share of those  sales.  The discounter saw strong traffic in stores and even though food  prices continue to fall, grocery sales were positive, which is important  for Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) grocery represents more than half of total sales  and it's a big traffic driver.</p><p> The discounter did acknowledge sales have been slower than expected to  start the year, which it chalks up to the delay in tax refund versus last  year.</p><p> JAN ROGERS KNIFFEN, J. ROGERS KNIFFEN WORLDWIDE ENTEPRISES:  I'm positive  on Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) right now.  I've had them in the question mark  phase.  I've said they're doing all the right things but it's hard to get  it for the bottom line.</p><p> Unfortunately, they're competing with a really, really tough business than  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).</p><p> REAGAN:  Investing in e-commerce remains a top priority for Wal-Mart  (NYSE:WMT) as it spends billions of dollars to catch up to Amazon  (NASDAQ:AMZN) online.  Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) says it's free two-day shipping  on orders of $35 or more has led to a nice uptick in e-commerce in the  three weeks since it launched.</p><p> Interestingly over the weekend, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) quietly dropped its  free shipping threshold back down to $35.</p><p> I spoke to Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) chief financial officer Brett Biggs.  And  when I asked how Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) is thinking about a potential border  adjustment tax, Biggs explained, \"We are pro-tax reform for anything that  will help with jobs and help consumers.\"  He went on to say, \"We do have  concerns that the border adjustment tax has the probability of increasing  prices.  It is concerning to us.\"</p><p> Biggs added, \"The devil is in the details, so it's too difficult to  speculate on any potential impact.\"  </p><p> So, for now, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) guidance assumes the tax and regulatory  landscape stays as is.</p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Courtney Reagan.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BREWER:  Fellow Dow component Home Depot (NYSE:HD) had a strong quarter  blowing past Wall Street expectations as the housing market remains strong.   The home-improvement retailer also hiked its dividend 29 percent to 89  cents a share.  That's up from 69 cents.</p><p> Home Depot (NYSE:HD) wasn't finish there.  Nope.  It said it's buying back  $15 billion worth of shares. </p><p> Put that all together, and you have shares up 2 percent to an all-time  high.</p><p> MATHISEN:  And now to Macy's and a different kind of retail result.  The  company's profits fell more than 10 percent and its same-store sales  slumped, with the company telling investors to brace for another year of  the same.  Earlier this month, the reports surface that Hudson Bay had  approached Macy's (NYSE:M) about a possible takeover.</p><p> But despite the results today, Macy CEO is betting on the consumer and says  his company has to be ready.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TERRY LUNDGREN, MACY'S CHAIRMAN AND CEO:  Consumers have money.  They're  spending their money.  They're spending it in different places than in  stores like ours in mall-based stores.  But -- and they're spending it with  us online.  </p><p> But still, at the end of the day, the consumer has the money once they  spent their money on these various categories, they've got to be ready to  come back to ours.  And when they do, we've got to be in position to take  advantage, particularly in our stores.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MATHISEN:  Macy's shares flat on the day.</p><p> BREWER:  On Friday, we told you one of the biggest deals ever was closed  and now call it a deal undone.  Kraft (NYSE:KFT) Heinz dropped its $143  billion takeover bid for rival consumer goods giant Unilever (NYSE:UN).   The deal broke up when the offer became public and it was clear Unilever  (NYSE:UN) was not interested in a tie-up.  Kraft (NYSE:KFT) shares lost  about 2 percent on the day.</p><p> MATHISEN:  And another deal we told you about last week that it might  happen actually did.  Burger King's parents Restaurant Brands will buy the  chicken chain Popeyes for nearly $2 billion.  That's a lot of wings.  </p><p>Both companies taking off on the news.  Restaurant Brands up about seven  percent and Popeyes spreading higher by nearly twenty percent.</p><p> BREWER:  Consumer staple companies particularly food companies are having a  hard time growing.  So, they're working on new strategies to find a way to  do that.</p><p> Sara Eisen is in Boca Raton, Florida, with a look at some innovative  approaches.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> SARA EISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Big food has a big  growth problem.  That's why companies from General Mills (NYSE:GIS) to  Conagra are rolling out new innovations for longtime household brands to  meet changing consumer taste.  Like Oreo and Ritz Crackers maker Mondelez  launching a new brand called Vea, no artificial ingredients and GMO-free.</p><p> IRENE ROSENFELD, MONDELEZ CEO:  Consumers still want indulgence I think I  think there's always a sense that all everybody's moving over to what well- being.  We certainly on are more indulgent brands, we're continuing to  evolve them with products like Oreo Thins, with products like Bubbly  Chocolate and making sure that we have portion control packages.  So,  there's all sorts of ways to meet the consumers needs.</p><p> But at the end of the day, there's no question it is a trend everywhere in  the world and as the world's largest snacking company, we intend to  capitalize on.</p><p> EISEN:  Ingredion supplies ingredients to many of these companies and sees  the health trend evolving.</p><p> What's really working right now?  What are some insights you can give us?</p><p> ILENE GORDON, INGREDION CEO:  People want a protein in different ways and  certainly meat protein has been evidence in the past.  Soy protein has been  around.  So, I think vegetable protein is going to be the next trend where  consumers want that in the crackers, in their pasta, in their rice, and we  at Ingredion are really participating with our customers to formulate that.</p><p> EISEN:  Besides falling behind on big food trends like healthier and  fresher eating, companies have grappled with slower growth both abroad and  here in the U.S.  And they have yet to see any meaningful boost in spending  despite the strong jump and consumer confidence after the election.</p><p> TOM HAYES, TYSON FOODS CEO:  What we see is in the second quarter of the  year is usually a difficult time for us, because consumers are coming out  the holidays.  The holiday period, based on our product portfolio, is a  huge, huge period for us.  So, right now, we're not necessarily seeing that  play through.  But certainly, you know, confidence is building and helps  the restaurant business, our food service business is starting to gain some  momentum.  And overall, you know, of course, people are going to focus more  on brands to the extent that they're more confident.  That's always good  for us.</p><p> EISEN:  Companies are also adapting to any potential policy changes from  Washington on trade taxes and regulation.  </p><p> For the meat industry, for example, China and Mexico are big buyers of U.S.  poultry, beef and pork.  So, executives are watching nervously, bracing for  any heated rhetoric and a slowdown in trade.</p><p> But despite the growth problems, overall food stocks have been great  investments lately.  They're considered safe.  They pay big dividends and  they've been a hot space for deal-making.</p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Sara Eisen in Boca.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MATHISEN:  So, what do all of these results from retailers, deal news, and  so forth tell us about the state of the consumer and retail today?</p><p> Jan Kniffen knows.  He's the CEO of the retail research firm J. Rogers  (NYSE:ROG) Kniffen Worldwide Enterprises and he's with us now to discuss.</p><p> Let's start, Jan, with Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), which is not exactly been a big  market participants, a driver of the market until today.  How did they get  their mojo back?</p><p> JAN KNIFFEN, J. ROGERS KNIFFEN WORLDWIDE ENTERPRISES:  They worked really  hard at it.  They've done retailing pretty darn well.  They've got better  in stocks.  They've fixed the supply chain.  They've made the stores more  shoppable.</p><p> They've actually done what they've been needing to do for a long time,  which was just get back to the fundamentals making the consumer happier.   But the other thing they've done is they've done a really good job of  getting online, and they've done it without costing themselves bottom line.  </p><p> The biggest problem but we thought they might have was that as they  transferred more and more online, that it would cost them at the bottom  line.  It hasn't done that.  So, people were pretty excited about that.   They had good, solid store for store sales numbers and they didn't wreck  their earnings to get there.  </p><p> So, this looks like Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) has turned the corner and I think  they were up 29 percent online, with a really big number, and that tells  you what Jets doing for them and what their own business is doing for them.   That's what they've got to do to be competitive with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).</p><p> BREWER:  And they are really giving Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) a run for their  money.  In fact, there was news today about Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) now  dumping back from of its cost on those items what they have -- what you  have to pay on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in order to get free shipping if you're  not a prime member.</p><p> So, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) looking at Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) with a skeptical  eye, but Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) itself it's not only seeing a big jump in  online, it saw a big jump in same-store sales.  How do they do that?  What  kind of it experience do you see that's drawing customers in?</p><p> KNIFFEN:  Well, they actually have up traffic.  I think that up traffic was  like one-point-four percent, and, boy, that's hard to get in the current  environment.  So, not only did they get up store for store comps.  They  actually had more people coming to the store and most stores are not seeing  that.  </p><p> And they've done that because they've made the store a better place to buy.   They've got a better assortment of products.  They've got much better  business in the grocery than they've had in the past.  They're doing pick  up at the store, drive-in, loaded in your car and more than 500 stores now.</p><p> So, they really made themselves much more attractive to the customer and  the customer finally have started responding, which is what they've been  waiting to see.</p><p> MATHISEN:  So, my sense is that the consumer is pretty healthy.  Incomes  are stable or rising.  Unemployment is low and so forth.  </p><p> But when we were talking, Jan, right after the holidays, we all sort of  universally agreed that the mall base stores and their holiday results were  kind of meh.  Here, you got Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Home Depot (NYSE:HD)  not going to cover off the ball, take it out a little, broaden it out a  little bit, are others doing as well?  Macy's sure isn't.</p><p> KNIFFEN:  Well, you know, the two you just named are not mall-based stores  and they're also not dealing in exactly the same space.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Good point.</p><p> KNIFFEN:  If you look at people who are dealing in apparel as of Amazon  (NASDAQ:AMZN) became the biggest apparel seller in the country last year,  apparel really got hurt, and apparel continuing to deflate where we've seen  a slowdown in food inflation.</p><p> And Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is in another category all by itself, right?  It's  clearly best-in-class of what it does but it's also selling a product where  everybody is doing things to their home.</p><p> MATHISEN:  Right.</p><p> KNIFFEN:  Plus, we're seeing housing turns do really well.</p><p> But people are nesting too.  They want to do more for the house they're  currently in and they'd rather do that and sit home and ordering Domino's  than go out and shop.  And that's hurting everybody else.  So it's great  for Home Depot (NYSE:HD).</p><p> BREWER:  Yes.  By the way, Home Depot's offering that experience to the  shoppers too because they're offering the kids workshop at the beginning of  the month.  They offer how-to programs for people who come in.  And you top  that off with the branding and the knowledge and you're making loyal  customers out of the people who might just venture into you went there.</p><p> KNIFFEN:  And experiential is where we are.</p><p> BREWER:  Yes.</p><p> KNIFFEN:  If you can get the customer to want to come to your store to do  something, they may buy something while they're there.  And that's kind of  what we've come down to.</p><p> MATHISEN:  Well, have fun in Las Vegas, Jan.</p><p> KNIFFEN:  It's always fun.  I love magic.</p><p> MATHISEN:  See you, man.  Jan Kniffen with J. Rogers (NYSE:ROG) Kniffen  Worldwide.</p><p> BREWER:  Earlier, we mentioned Home Depot's massive stock buyback and while  the repurchases generally help to lift earnings, Bob Pisani tells us  they're not necessarily a cure-all.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BOB PISANI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Home Depot (NYSE:HD)  had great learning for what really moved the stock to an historic high  today was the announcement that they were hiking the dividend 29 percent  and buying back $15 billion in stock.  That's nearly nine percent of the  shares outstanding.</p><p> Home Depot (NYSE:HD) was already what I call a buyback monster.  Since  2003, they cut their shares outstanding in a half from $2.36 billion to  $1.21 billion shares.  And they're not alone.  A lot of companies have  drastically cut shares outstanding in an effort to boost earnings.  </p><p> For example, since 1997, IBM has cut its shares outstanding in half.  Exxon  has cut their shares by 42 percent since 2000.  Big tech names like Intel  (NASDAQ:INTC) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) have also cut their shares  outstanding by about 30 percent since 2001.</p><p> The buybacks are not a panacea for stock growth.  IBM has woefully  underperformed the S&amp;P 500 in the last five years because they've been  beset by growth issues.  Its revenues from its online businesses were  shrinking and there wasn't revenues from newer businesses like artificial  intelligence replacing it. </p><p> The lesson here is no amount of financial engineering like buying back  shares can replace management's inability to grow the businesses.  </p><p> Home Depot (NYSE:HD) grows their business.  The stock goes up.  IBM has  troubles growing their business.  The stock has trouble going up.  Buybacks  are not a panacea for stock growth.</p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Bob Pisani at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MATHISEN:  Coming up, why the president's agenda could be troublesome for  the companies that issue most of the nation's mortgages.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> MATHISEN:  CEOs of more than a dozen companies including Boeing (NYSE:BA),  Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) have called on  lawmakers to overall the corporate tax code.  In a letter to the House and  Senate leadership, the chief executives argued a so-called \"border  adjustment tax\" will make the U.S. products more competitive overseas.   This comes following last week's meeting at the White House with the topic  execs from the retail industry who say the opposite.  They say this type of  tax would raise their costs and likely prices for consumers.</p><p> BREWER:  Canada's foreign minister says any renegotiating of the North  American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, would be between Canada, the U.S. and  Mexico, and not negotiated individually.</p><p> And as Kayla Tausche tells us, that it's all been not to talk so far.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> KAYLA TAUSCHE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  President Trump's  100-day action plan list renegotiating NAFTA as a top priority.  But it  could be months before official talks with Canada and Mexico begin.  By law  passed in 2015, the White House must notify in writing the House Ways and  means and Senate finance committee of a negotiation period beginning that  last 90 days.  The two branches then have that time to set their agenda  before the U.S. approaches Canada and Mexico.</p><p> Aides from both committees confirmed that no such letter has been sent as  of this week's recess.  Meanwhile, Mexico has already begun its  renegotiation clock.</p><p> The president and his team have met more casually with the relevant parties  earlier this month, but a senior administration official says it will  pursue the proper channels to renegotiate with Congress once a U.S. trade  representative is installed.  No hearing yet for that nominee, Robert  Lighthizer.</p><p> In the meantime, NAFTA remains a key pillar of Trump's economic talking  points.</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We're going to have  tremendous trade deals all over the world, but they're going to be  bilateral or as we would say, one-on-one.  None of these deals will we get  caught in a quicksand, where we get mired in and we can't do anything about  it, like by the way, NAFTA and so many others.</p><p> TAUSCHE:  Canada's foreign minister on Tuesday struck down the notion that  a new NAFTA could actually be two deals, one with each country, saying any  negotiations would involve all three.</p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Kayla Tausche, Washington.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MATHISEN:  Lumber Liquidators post on a narrower loss and shares take off,  and that is where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".</p><p> The results easily beat analyst expectations.  The beleaguered hardwood  flooring retailer said a rise in same-store sales helped overall revenue  top street estimates.  The company also said it remains committed to  returning the profitability.  Shares pop 17 percent to $17.98.</p><p> The railroad company CSX (NYSE:CSX) said it would cut a thousand management  position through what it called an involuntary separation program.  The  layoffs are expected to be concentrated in the company's Jacksonville,  Florida, headquarter operations and the company also said its CEO and  president are expected to retire at the end of May.  CSX (NYSE:CSX) shares  up 37 cents to $48.91.</p><p> Shares of Community Health Systems (NYSE:CYH) took off today following the  hospital operator's better-than-expected earnings and revenue report came  out yesterday.  Community Health said it has divested more than 20  hospitals in the latest quarter and will continue to focus its efforts on  reducing its debt load.  Shares soared more than 33 percent to $9.23.</p><p> BREWER:  Self-driving technology company Mobileye has inked another deal  with an automaker.  Last week, we told you the company signed an agreement  with Volkswagen.  And today, Mobileye and luxury car company BMW said that  Mobileye's data generation technology will be available in BMW's models.   Mobileye shares rose 1 percent to $46.12.</p><p> Horizon confirmed it would buy Yahoo's core assets at a discount.  We told  last week that the two companies were reportedly in talks to revise the  takeover price following Yahoo's two data breaches.  Well, now, Verizon  (NYSE:VZ) said it will pay about $4.5 billion for Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO).   That is $350 million less than its initial offer.  That's my kind of  bargain.  Verizon (NYSE:VZ) shares were up a fraction to $49.43, while  shares of Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO) rose 40 cents to $49.50.</p><p> And Boeing (NYSE:BA) has received an order from a private Chinese carrier  for five of its Dreamliner jet.  That deal is valued at more than $1  billion.  Boeing (NYSE:BA) shares rose more than 1 1/2 percent to $175.56.</p><p> MATHISEN:  Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) has fired four of its senior managers as  part of the fraudulent accounts scandal that has rocked the bank since last  year.  None of those executives will get a bonus and they will forfeit all  of their unvested equity awards and vested outstanding options.</p><p> The move is part of the company board of directors' independent  investigation into the bank sales practices.  Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) was  fined in September nearly $200 million for creating some 2 million  fraudulent accounts.  And the bank's former CEO, John Stumpf, resigned in  October.</p><p> BREWER:  Tighter regulation on the banks led to the rise of a whole new  group of companies like Quicken and Loan Depot, who grabbed a huge chunk of  the mortgage market.  </p><p> But as Diana Olick tell us, if President Trump is able to roll back some of  the regulation, those non-bank lenders will feel a pinch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  At a recent meeting  with his employees, the CEO of Loan Depot had some sobering word.</p><p> ANTHONY HSIEH, LOAN DEPOT CEO:  Everything that we're doing today  unfortunately will change.  </p><p> OLICK:  Anthony Hsieh was talking technology but he could have said the  same for regulation in the mortgage market.  The Trump administration has  signaled it will roll back stringent safeguards put in place following the  financial crisis.  Those rules in addition to billions of dollars in  lawsuits and fine cause the big banks to pull back on home loan lending,  opening the door for non-bank lenders like Loan Depot, Quicken and Caliber  Home Loan.</p><p> HSIEH:  In one since, we really don't want any changes because of what it  really does it creates the barrier to entry.  It just makes life more  difficult.</p><p> OLICK:  For the past six years, there had been a staggering takeover by  non-bank lenders, especially in government insured FHA lending.  They went  from just ten percent of new originations in 2010 to half the market today.   But if the Trump administration loosen regulations on big bank and stop  suing for every single loan infraction, the big banks could move back in  and the nonbanks could face stiffer competition.</p><p> The CEO of Caliber Home Loans who used to run Citi Mortgage sees another  threat.</p><p> SANJIV DAS, CALIBER HOME LOANS CEO:  I do expect that the regional banks  would step up their exposure to lending a lot more, because the U.S.  consumer is still very strong, home buying is very strong, and everybody  has to show growth for their shareholders and investors.</p><p> OLICK:  Whether banks large or local move back in or not, one thing is  certain.  Higher mortgage rates will shrink demand for all home loans,  especially refinances.  And that means all lenders will be competing for an  ever-smaller pool of business.</p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MATHISEN:  And coming up, why the good old-fashioned a planner day is back,  sort of.  We'll explain.</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> BREWER:  Here's what to watch on Wednesday.  On the housing front, sales in  January of existing homes are expected to tick higher.  As for earnings,  one of Wall Street's darlings, Tesla, is expected to release its quarterly  results.  And the markets will pick apart the minutes of this month's  Federal Reserve meeting.  That's what to watch for tomorrow.</p><p> MATHISEN:  Well, at a time when seemingly everything is done online,  millennials are starting to schedule their lives in a very old school way,  with the notebook.  In fact, sales of traditional journals and notebooks  have taken off over the past year.  </p><p> And as Jane Wells tells us, what's old is new again.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MOLLIE CRAVEN, BULLET JOURNAL OWNER:  This is this week.</p><p> JANE WELLS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Mollie Craven is a 30- something marketing professional who discovered the hottest new app for  organizing her life is a notebook.  </p><p> CRAVEN:  I wanted to kind of get more religious and ritualistic about my  planning and my list making.</p><p>WELLS:  Everything old is new again as millennials are taking pen to paper.   They call it bullet journaling.  Hundreds of thousands of images have been  posted on Instagram from simple to elaborate.  There's even a how-to video.</p><p> RYDER CARROLL, BULLETJOURNAL.COM:  We keep track of things.</p><p>WELLS:  That's Ryder Carroll, an app designer in Brooklyn who has led the  bullet journal movement.  He says apps like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Calendar  are great, but limited.</p><p> CARROLL:  And what I really like about bullet train was really important to  me is that all kind of goes into one place.  It's like one tool.</p><p>WELLS:  But it's so easy now to schedule your life, go to the dentist and  put down your goals.  And an app and if you fail to do something, you can  just cut and paste it over to the next week or delete all evidence of  failure.</p><p> Physically writing something down makes it permanent.  It takes more time  and perhaps leads to better results, at least that's the idea.</p><p> CRAVEN:  It does give me time to sit down and think about what's coming up  and plan a little bit more effectively.  However, I don't think I've been  doing it long enough to really see the improvement yet.</p><p>WELLS:  Even so, sales by publicly traded notebook maker Moleskine rose 12  percent in the U.S. last year.  Ryder Carroll is selling a bullet journal  made by Leuchtturm, a 100-year-old German company started back when people  used to write.  He says there's one other benefit.</p><p> CARROLL:  The Bullet Journal by its very nature of the analog forces you to  disconnect.  It forces you not to be online, and that's also really  powerful thing.</p><p>WELLS:  However, digital apps do have one advantage lose your device and  your info is stored in the Cloud.  Lose your notebook and it's gone  forever.</p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Jane Wells, Los Angeles.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BREWER:  Next up, manual typewriters.</p><p> MATHISEN:  Yes, I'm not that organized digitally or on paper. I can't do  it.  I don't have the discipline.</p><p> BREWER:  Wow.</p><p> That's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I'm Contessa Brewer.</p><p> MATHISEN:  I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Thanks for watching.  Have a great evening.   We'll see you tomorrow.</p><p> END</p><p> Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

Investors kicked  off the weekend in a buying mood.  The S&amp;P finishing just shy of a record  and the NASDAQ sits at a 14-year high.  Where is the enthusiasm coming  from, and how long will it last?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUSIE GHARIB, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Winners and losers.  It's a  big week for retail earnings, but just because Wal-Mart's numbers were  disappointing, it doesn't mean others will follow suit.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GRIFFETH:  New players.  As the health care system changes, the insurers  are facing new competition tonight.  In the first of our three-part series,  we're going to focus on a hospital that's not only offering care, but also  insurance plans that cover it. </p><p>All that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, February,  the 24th.  </p><p>Good evening, everybody.  I'm Bill Griffeth, in tonight for Tyler Mathisen. </p><p>GHARIB:  And I'm Susie Gharib. </p><p>Well, what a way to kick off a new week on Wall Street.  Stocks rallied  with the S&amp;P 500 even setting a new intraday record high.  Investors were  in a bullish mood thanks to optimism over the latest round of corporate  deal-making, and that includes Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) striking a deal with  Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) to use its high-speed broadband to get  movies to customers faster.  And we'll talk more about that subject in just  a few minutes. </p><p>Now, here is a look at the closing numbers on Wall Street today.  The Dow  rose 104 points.  It was up almost 200 points but then pulled back.  The  NASDAQ added 29 and the S&amp;P gained 11 points to 1,847.61, less than 1 point  from a new record.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  So, while the major averages are now on pace to end the month of  February higher, the National Association for Business Economics is  wondering whether stocks will continue to climb even if economic growth  starts to slow down. </p><p>Steve Liesman has more on why those experts are worried about a possible  slow down in the economy and what could happen next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  An  economy is like a car engine.  When everything works perfectly, there is a  certain speed that can careen the car down the road.  But the latest  thinking on the American economic engine is that something isn't working  right, that the potential of the economy to generate growth and prosperity  over the next decade will be a lot slower than it had been.  One reason,  people out of work for years because of a recession means the quality of  the labor force has declined.</p><p>DOUGLAS ELMENDORF, CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE DIR.:  This shows, I think,  a very long shadow of having so many people out of work for such a long  period of time.</p><p>LIESMAN (on camera):  Elmendorf says the potential growth rate of the  economy, that's the speed it can travel at, has fallen to 2.1 percent from  3.3 percent the previous 60 years.  That's $200 billion less in growth.</p><p>(voice-over):  Another problem, the ageing of the work force. </p><p>CHRIS VARVARES:  As people age, they tend to not participate as much on the  labor force, up until the time that they retire.  So, the age and  population will lead to slower growth of those folks who are looking and  willing to work.  </p><p>LIESMAN:  Larry Summers, the former treasury secretary, and economic  advisor to President Obama, says this is a clear case for the government to  step in and increase spending.</p><p>LAWRENCE SUMMERS, HARVARD UNIVERSITY:  Ask if anyone is proud of Kennedy  Airport and then to note that if a moment when the long-term interest rate  in a currency we print is below 3 percent, and the construction  unemployment rate approaches double digits is not the right moment to  increase public investment in general and perhaps to repair Kennedy Airport  in particular.</p><p>LIESMAN:  Whatever the solution, there is a pretty good agreement the  economy will grow slower, unless some new technology can be found that will  kick start the American growth engine.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Steve Liesman.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB:  Gold prices soared today.  Investors poured money into the safe  haven asset, partly on those worries about slow growth in the U.S. that  Steve Liesman just talked about and also, because of growing uncertainty in  emerging markets and political turmoil in Ukraine and Thailand.  The price  of the precious metal rose by $14.40 to 1,338.  That's a four-month high. </p><p>GRIFFETH:  More now on that crisis in Ukraine, which remains a divided  country tonight.  One that's teetering between establishing bonds with  Europe and the U.S. and another that's leading toward returning back into  Moscow's fold. </p><p>Michelle Caruso-Cabrera reports now from Kiev on the latest news out of  Ukraine and why it matters to all of us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MICHELLE CARUSO-CABRERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The  political situation in Ukraine is much calmer today compared to what we saw  late last week, when there was terrible bloodshed as protesters rose up  against the government.  Although the situation is calmer politically  though, financially, it is not.  This country needs to borrow money and  borrow it fast.</p><p>Right now, the government is running a deficit.  That means every single  day, it spends more money it takes in tax revenues, and in normal times,  they could borrow from the international markets.  The traditional lenders  won't give money now because the political situation is so uncertain, so  they have to turn to someone. </p><p>They could turn to the European Union and the IMF and the United States has  said they would help, as well, or Ukraine could turn to Russia, its biggest  trading partner.  And that is the core of the issue and why the United  States is so interested in this.  Where will Ukraine end up, in whose  political satellite, the West or East? </p><p>Russia is very concerned about having a country aligned with the E.U. so  close to them, so they're probably going to be willing to do a lot, extend  loans with very few requirements in order to keep Ukraine within their  spear of influence. </p><p>However, the protest is on the ground why they rose up three months ago is  that they don't want their government to do that.  They want their  government to turn to the West, where there is better transparency, better  governance, and a lot more clarity about how democracy works.  How this all  plays out is unclear.  With a temporary government and over the next  several days, they're kind of try to hammer out some kind of agreement,  political and financial. </p><p>The outcome is deeply uncertain. </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Michelle Caruso-Cabrera, Kiev, Ukraine.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB:  Here now to talk more about today's market rally, Patricia  Edwards.  She's managing director of investments at U.S. Bank Wealth  Management. </p><p>And, Patty, nice to have you back with us.</p><p>PATRICIA EDWARDS, U.S. BANK WEALTH MANAGEMENT:  Nice to be here, thank you.  </p><p>GHARIB:  Let me begin by just asking you that we know that investors are  always worried about something, and, you know, all of a sudden today, we  get this big rally.  What changed?  Is driving this enthusiasm?  And will  the rally continue? </p><p>EDWARDS:  You know, I think there is a lot that went into today's numbers.   First of all, you had successful closing of the games with no issues over  in Sochi, and I think that was not to be taken lightly. </p><p>On top of that, you got a little resolve out of the Ukraine.  Nothing is  absolutely clear, but there is actually movement and things seem to be  calming down.  That helps, also. </p><p>Then you add in there some mergers and acquisitions that are really helping  to get the engines running here in the U.S.  And earnings have been pretty  good.  All those taken together made for a very nice day today. </p><p>GRIFFETH:  But what's wrong with the logic that says if the Fed -- if we  believe the Fed's easy money policy of the last few years has fueled a  great deal of the rally we've seen in the stock market, when they start to  remove that easy money policy, why don't we see a decline in the stock  market?  That's not happening yet. </p><p>EDWARDS:  No, it's not happening yet, and I think part of the reason for  that is there has been so much stimulus over the past few years.  And so,  we're starting to ease off on the throttle but our foot is still on the gas  peddle.  There's still money going into the economy, it's just not as much  as it was before.</p><p>GHARIB:  Well, speaking of the Fed, the new Fed chair, Janet Yellen, will  be speaking in front of Congress on Thursday.  What do you expect her to  say?  Is she going to be on message, or are we going to hear something new  from her? </p><p>EDWARDS:  We're really expecting that she's going to be charmingly boring,  which will probably be a good thing for this market.  Really what we're  expecting, at most, maybe a tweak maybe to put in some wording around some  sort of an inflation floor, meaning that they won't let things slow down  too much.</p><p>But beyond that, she should be on message and we expect things to continue  going forward the way they have. </p><p>GRIFFETH:  We've seen a pickup in merger activity lately.  A lot of deals  have been announced in the last couple of weeks.  There are a lot of deals  brewing now. </p><p>Do you consider that a positive?  And would you invest with that in mind  right now? </p><p>EDWARDS:  Well, it is a positive, bill.  It's one of the things we saw  actually starting last year.  If you look at the second half of 2013, there  were more deals in the second half than there were in the first and now,  we're starting to get a little more traction with that. </p><p>We think there is a couple things going on there.  One is that we need  revenue growth in some of our major corporations.  We've had huge earnings  growth in the past five years, about 118 percent, but we've only had 7  percent revenue growth. </p><p>And so, given that, they're going to be looking for different ways to get  that revenue growth.  We're looking more for organic growth and to buy the  growth.</p><p>So, that's going to actually be support under some of the smaller and  midcap companies, something that we are absolutely taking into  consideration.</p><p>GHARIB:  Patty, in 30 seconds, tell us about the Ukraine and what investors  should do, if anything, about their portfolios. </p><p>EDWARDS:  You know, the Ukraine situation is probably not going to affect  your portfolio in the short run.  The big issue here is going to be  something like a connotation.  We don't think that's coming.  In fact, we  think there's going to be help from both Russia and the E.U. offered.  We  know that the U.S. has already stepped in.  And so, we think that it will  probably get itself up and you have to invest over the long run using  fundamentals, and this is just a small thing.  </p><p>GHARIB:  All right.  Lots of good information. </p><p>Thank you so much, Patty.  Patricia Edwards, managing director out U.S.  Bank Wealth Management. </p><p>GRIFFETH:  Moving now to earning season.  It's winding down but not before  we hear from some of the nation's top retailers, and while some like Wal- Mart (NYSE:WMT) last week will partly blame weak sales on the brutal winter  weather, all retailers are not created equal.  Others may see the bad  weather as a plus for revenue. </p><p>Courtney Reagan has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  While  the world's largest retailer blamed nearly every possible external issue on  its disappointing earnings outlook, investors should be careful not to  think all retailers will follow suit in this week's earnings releases.</p><p>In fact, some retailers like those external factors, winter weather and  higher home investment, at the expense of discretionary buying. </p><p>Barclays retail analyst Alan Rifkin thinks Home Depot (NYSE:HD) was a  beneficiary of the winter weather, carefully positions those weather  appropriate products on a region basis, with snow removal products at a  particular high sales volume. </p><p>Plus, the upcoming spring quarter is the retailer's most important, perhaps  more so this year as homeowners are expected to continue investing in  improvement in and outside the home.</p><p>Stifel Nicolaus analyst Richard Jaffe thinks the cold weather did help  Macy's (NYSE:M) sell winter apparel early in the quarter, but says the  tight control on inventor didn't leave much left to sell in January.   Still, Jaffe has Macy's (NYSE:M) as a top pick going into earnings season.</p><p>RICHARD JAFFE, STIFEL NICOLAUS ANALYST:  Macy's (NYSE:M) is a giant  dominant force in the department store industry, and uses its strength  effectively to have exclusive brands, to offer unique product and, yes,  they do a great job on the channel or the Internet component, as well.</p><p>REAGAN (on camera):  Macy's (NYSE:M) remains a standout among an otherwise  dollar department store sector, with dealers posting disappointing  earnings, a shrinking Sears (NASDAQ:SHLD) and struggling JCPenney.  Sears  (NASDAQ:SHLD) and JCPenney report earnings this week.  Neither are expected  to inspire much confidence. </p><p>JAFFE:  Looking at the fourth quarter results, you want to look at the  inventory.  I look for the balance between Internet and stores to make sure  they're both healthy, robust and growing.  That you're not growing one at  the cost of the other.</p><p>REAGAN:  Whether merchandise is purchased in store or online, compelling  products remain the key success factor.  As retail options swell, the most  special product offering will win.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Courtney Reagan. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB:  And still ahead on the program, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) agrees to  pay Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) for faster access.  Is the deal a  game changer for the industry, and will more agreements like this one  follow? </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn is at it again, in a  note to eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) board members and shareholders this time, he's  accused members of the board of what he called lapses in corporate  governance.  And he's once again calling for the company to spin off its  successful PayPal electronic payment unit.  But eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) was  quick to respond to Icahn who owns about 2 percent of the outstanding  shares.  EBay says it's not interested in separating its fastest growing  from the parent company.</p><p>GHARIB:  With one of every five people in the world owning a smartphone,  tech companies are always looking to update their products with the latest  accessories and services to boost sales.  And this week all the big  smartphone makers, social media giants and software firms are doing just  that at a big tech conference in Spain. </p><p>It's call the world, the Mobile World Congress.</p><p>Jon Fortt is in Barcelona and he has all the buzz of what's new this year.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JON FORTT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  This week  in Barcelona, many top executives in wireless and tech from around the  world are gathering to try and figure out what's next. </p><p>(on camera):  The smartphone revolution gets well underway, which means the  new opportunities for profit probably won't be in hardware so much in  services.  That's going to be a key theme here at the Mobile World  Congress. </p><p>Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg is here, so is Jan Koum from  WhatsApp, his latest acquisition, and IBM CEO Ginny Rometty, Cisco  (NASDAQ:CSCO) CEO John Chambers and more.</p><p>For Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), the show is a chance to lay out its vision for  getting more people in emerging markets online. </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, FACEBOOK CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO:  All the data and studies that  we've shown show that it will not only increase their opportunities to find  jobs and health and education and all these things, it makes the economy  better and if we do this as an industry, it will also for self-interest  just increase the profits of all the different companies that involved  here.</p><p>FORTT:  Lots of new products are taking a bout here, including low-end  android phones from Nokia (NYSE:NOK), new tablets from HP and Huawei, and  an in app payment service from MasterCard (NYSE:MA).</p><p>But for the executives attending, lots of meetings. </p><p>JO LUNDER, VIMPELCOM CEO:  I meet government officials, I meet customers, I  meet partners, I meet my own employees, I meet competitors.  It's the  meeting place to learn and be inspired and it's also very effective because  everybody is here. </p><p>FORTT:  A big week for a very big mobile industry. </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Jon Fortt in Barcelona. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  We have more now on that deal we told you about at the top of  the program with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) paying Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA)  (NYSE:CCS) to use its high speed broadband to speed up digital downloads  for Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) customers.</p><p>Julia Boorstin has more on that agreement now, who benefits from it and  whether this opens the door to similar doors with other content and  Internet providers. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) deal aims to be  a win/win, giving better service to subscribers of both, addressing  concerns customers have suffered from slowing broadband speeds from Comcast  (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS), as well as Verizon (NYSE:VZ). </p><p>With this deal, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS)  will cut out the middleman.  Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) paying Comcast  (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) to establish a direct connection to the Internet  provider, improving infrastructure to make data transmission more  efficient.  It's a valuable partnership between the nation's largest  Internet provider about to become much larger and streaming video behemoth,  Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). </p><p>CRAIG MOFFETT, MOFFETT NATHANSON RESEARCH:  You just have a company that  represents one-third of the traffic on the internet strike a deal with a  company that represents as much as third of the Internet subscribers in  America. </p><p>BOORSTIN:  Other streaming video giants like YouTube have similar  arrangements to work directly with Internet providers, but this is the  first time a content company like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) has paid an  Internet provider like Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) directly. </p><p>(on camera):  That doesn't mean Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) will necessary face  higher cost.  It's just paying a different company.  Up until now, Netflix  (NASDAQ:NFLX) has paid other companies to help deliver its data.</p><p>(voice-over):  One of those intermediaries is Cogent (NASDAQ:COGT).  Its  stock is suffering on this news and concerns about other deals that could  follow.</p><p>Verizon (NYSE:VZ) CEO Lowell McAdam saying on CNBC Monday morning he's in  talks with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and expects to close a similar deal. </p><p>LOWELL MCADAM, VERIZON CEO:  The commercial model I think will work pretty  well.  So, to me, that shows that you don't necessarily need a lot of  regulation in a dynamic market here by doing these commercial deals, we'll  get good investments and good returns for both parties.</p><p>BOORSTIN:  Internet providers hope this will give the FCC and others a  reason to take a light hand when it comes to regulation, showing rivals can  work well together without intervention and analysts Craig Moffett says it  reflects well on Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) as it looks for approval  of its Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) Cable acquisition. </p><p>MOFFETT:  It tells you if you're the Department of Justice or FCC that  Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) is not going to engage in any competitive  practices. </p><p>BOORSTIN:  We'll see this if this speeds along regulatory approval for  Comcast's big Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) Cable purchase. </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  And we need to remind you that Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS)  is the parent company of CNBC, which produces this program. </p><p>GHARIB:  BlackBerry lands two major deals and that's where we begin  tonight's market focus.  Shares of BlackBerry surged on news that its BBM  messenger service will be available to Windows phone and Nokia (NYSE:NOK) X  users starting this summer.  Separately, Ford has picked BlackBerry over  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as its partner on its sync voice activated system  in future car models. </p><p>Shares of BlackBerry rose 7 percent to $9.83.</p><p>Chip maker RF Micro Devices (NASDAQ:RFMD) says it's paying $1.6 billion for  its TriQuint semiconductor.  The two companies get most of the revenue by  supplying parts to device makers like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung and  the deal makes them a bigger player.  Shares of both companies surged on  the news.  RF Micro up 21 percent, TriQuint by 26 percent to $11.64.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  The suit saga continues.  Mens Warehouse has now raised its  offer for its rival Jos. A. Bank by over 10 percent, spurring hopes that  this month's long battle of back and forth between the two companies might  finally be over.  Men's warehouse also said it might even raise its own bid  further if it's able to examine Jos. A. Bank's books.</p><p>Shares of both companies up, as you can imagine.  Mens Warehouse up to 7  1/2 percent to $48.51.  Jos. A. Bank rose by 9 percent to close at $60.04.</p><p>And Pfizer's pneumonia vaccine treatment for older adults showed that it  prevented several kinds of community acquired pneumonia in a clinical  study.  The treatment is already on the market to treat childhood  infections.  Analysts say that they predicted the success of the drug on  older patients would boost annual sales of the vaccine by $1 billion or  more.  Shares of Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) rose by more than 1 1/2 percent, closed  at $31.99.</p><p>GHARIB:  The Pentagon announced some deep spending cuts to the Armed Forces  today.  Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel outlined his vision for the military  in the year ahead, and the changing priorities for our men and women in  uniform. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHUCK HAGEL, DEFENSE SECRETARY:  We are repositioning to focus on a  strategic challenge and opportunity that will define our future -- new  technologies, new centers of power, and a world that is growing more  volatile, more unpredictable and in some instances, more threatening to the  United States. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GHARIB:  Now, among the proposed cuts, shrinking the army to the smallest  size before World War II, closing some military bases, eliminating the Air  Force A-10 and U2 aircraft, freezing pay for generals and admirals and a 1  percent across the board pay cut for all military personnel.  Now, despite  that, shares of some of the biggest defense contractors rose by more than 1  percent today including Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC), Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT), General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) and Raytheon (NYSE:RTN).</p><p>GRIFFETH:  As the health care industry changes, insurers are facing new  complications.  And tonight, in a first of a three-part series, we'll take  you to a hospital branching out beyond care and into insurance. </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Some of the shares of the biggest health insurers have been  moving higher because Medicare reimbursement cuts proposed by the  government for 2015 were not as bad as those companies feared.  And that  sent shares of Humana (NYSE:HUM) surging, closing more than 10 percent  higher.  Also making gains today, big names like WellPoint and Aetna  (NYSE:AET).</p><p>GHARIB:  Those insurers are not only bracing for reimbursement cuts and  other changes in the Affordable Care Act but also some tough new  competition. </p><p>Tonight, we begin with a three-part series on the changing health care  insurance business.  We begin with a look at how some hospitals are now  offering their own health care plans. </p><p>Bertha Coombs reports. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Mike  Perivolaris doesn't have to offer his workers health benefits, but he  always has. </p><p>MIKE PERIVOLARIS, BUSINESS OWNER:  We target people that are stable, family  people who expect at this point, you know, that the insurance is going to  be taken care of by their employer.</p><p>COOMBS:  This year, the Long Island small business owner is gambling on a  brand-new insurance company tied to a big area hospital, North Shore LIJ.   Its rates were lower and his staff is happy with the choice. </p><p>PERIVOLARIS:  The people that accept this insurance seem to be the doctors  that they already had.  So it seemed natural.  </p><p>COOMBS:  The CEO of North Shore LIJ's new care connect insurance unit says  the hospital's name recognition has helped them compete with large insurers  on New York's exchange and in the private market. </p><p>ALAN MURRAY, NORTH SHORE LIJ CARE CONNECT CEO:  We are not a United  Healthcare.  We're not Blue Cross and Blue Shield.  We have a very narrow  network, but it's highly intense interactive network. </p><p>So, what you trade in choice, we hope you make up with in simplicity. </p><p>COOMBS:  It means Care Connect will reimburse North Shore differently than  other insurers.</p><p>MURRAY:  I don't necessarily reimburse in fee-for-service environment.   What I do is I agree ahead of time that I will spend X number of dollars on  health care, and it's up to them to work with us to figure out the most  efficient and best place for that health care to take place so that they  are not trying to fight for every penny. </p><p>COOMBS:  If they get it right, they will join the ranks of Kaiser's health  system in California and Geisinger in Pennsylvania, highly regarded  hospital systems which hold down cost by integrating coverage and health  care.</p><p>(on camera):  Hospital systems first got into the business of insurance  back in the '90s, when HMOs were popular but many found they couldn't make  financials work. </p><p>Analysts say this time could be different.</p><p>LISA MARTIN, MOODY'S INVESTOR SERVICE SVP:  Since we moved through the  2000s and into the current day, the data capabilities are much greater, and  many hospitals are much more closely aligned with their physicians.</p><p>COOMBS (voice-over):  Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Lisa Martin says having an  insurance plan can help hospitals keep patients within their systems, as  long as they don't alienate other players. </p><p>MARTIN:  The other risk for hospital running a health plan is really  managing the relationship with the insurers that now the hospital is  directly competing with in its own market.</p><p>COOMBS:  So far, Care Connect has exceeded its enrolment expectations. </p><p>MURRAY:  We thought we would probably have 3,000 to 4,000 individual  members of which, let's say, 50 percent to 60 percent of them would pay the  bill.  We had almost double that both on and off exchange.</p><p>COOMBS:  Mike Perivolaris is hoping it pays to be one of their first  members. </p><p>PERIVOLARIS:  We try things every day.  We're business owners, so we have  to be daring sometimes and make decisions. </p><p>COOMBS:  Bertha Coombs, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Long Island, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB:  To read more about how hospitals are getting into the insurance  business, go to our Web site, NBR.com. </p><p>And tomorrow, our series continues with a look at how an insurance startup  is attempting to shakeup the industry.</p><p>GRIFFETH:  Finally tonight, good news if you invest in companies that pay a  dividend.  Last year, for the first time ever, the world's largest public  company paid out more than $1 trillion in shareholder dividends globally.   That's up more than $300 billion since 2009. </p><p>The research firm Henderson Global says research listed firms are by far  the largest source of dividend income right now, increasing their payouts  by an astounding 49 percent in just the past five years. </p><p>Financial firms paid out the most, no surprise.  That was followed by  technology companies.  That is a bit of a surprise.</p><p>GHARIB:  And that's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I'm Susie Gharib.   Thanks for joining us. </p><p>GRIFFETH:  I'm Bill Griffeth.  Have a great evening.

Investors kicked off the weekend in a buying mood. The S&amp;P finishing just shy of a record and the NASDAQ sits at a 14-year high. Where is the enthusiasm coming from, and how long will it last?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUSIE GHARIB, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Winners and losers. It`s a big week for retail earnings, but just because Wal-Mart`s numbers were disappointing, it doesn`t mean others will follow suit.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GRIFFETH: New players. As the health care system changes, the insurers are facing new competition tonight. In the first of our three-part series, we`re going to focus on a hospital that`s not only offering care, but also insurance plans that cover it.</p><p>All that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, February, the 24th.</p><p>Good evening, everybody. I`m Bill Griffeth, in tonight for Tyler Mathisen.</p><p>GHARIB: And I`m Susie Gharib.</p><p>Well, what a way to kick off a new week on Wall Street. Stocks rallied with the S&amp;P 500 even setting a new intraday record high. Investors were in a bullish mood thanks to optimism over the latest round of corporate deal-making, and that includes Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) striking a deal with Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) to use its high-speed broadband to get movies to customers faster. And we`ll talk more about that subject in just a few minutes.</p><p>Now, here is a look at the closing numbers on Wall Street today. The Dow rose 104 points. It was up almost 200 points but then pulled back. The NASDAQ added 29 and the S&amp;P gained 11 points to 1,847.61, less than 1 point from a new record.</p><p>GRIFFETH: So, while the major averages are now on pace to end the month of February higher, the National Association for Business Economics is wondering whether stocks will continue to climb even if economic growth starts to slow down.</p><p>Steve Liesman has more on why those experts are worried about a possible slow down in the economy and what could happen next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): An economy is like a car engine. When everything works perfectly, there is a certain speed that can careen the car down the road. But the latest thinking on the American economic engine is that something isn`t working right, that the potential of the economy to generate growth and prosperity over the next decade will be a lot slower than it had been. One reason, people out of work for years because of a recession means the quality of the labor force has declined.</p><p>DOUGLAS ELMENDORF, CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE DIR.: This shows, I think, a very long shadow of having so many people out of work for such a long period of time.</p><p>LIESMAN (on camera): Elmendorf says the potential growth rate of the economy, that`s the speed it can travel at, has fallen to 2.1 percent from 3.3 percent the previous 60 years. That`s $200 billion less in growth.</p><p>(voice-over): Another problem, the ageing of the work force.</p><p>CHRIS VARVARES: As people age, they tend to not participate as much on the labor force, up until the time that they retire. So, the age and population will lead to slower growth of those folks who are looking and willing to work.</p><p>LIESMAN: Larry Summers, the former treasury secretary, and economic advisor to President Obama, says this is a clear case for the government to step in and increase spending.</p><p>LAWRENCE SUMMERS, HARVARD UNIVERSITY: Ask if anyone is proud of Kennedy Airport and then to note that if a moment when the long-term interest rate in a currency we print is below 3 percent, and the construction unemployment rate approaches double digits is not the right moment to increase public investment in general and perhaps to repair Kennedy Airport in particular.</p><p>LIESMAN: Whatever the solution, there is a pretty good agreement the economy will grow slower, unless some new technology can be found that will kick start the American growth engine.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB: Gold prices soared today. Investors poured money into the safe haven asset, partly on those worries about slow growth in the U.S. that Steve Liesman just talked about and also, because of growing uncertainty in emerging markets and political turmoil in Ukraine and Thailand. The price of the precious metal rose by $14.40 to 1,338. That`s a four-month high.</p><p>GRIFFETH: More now on that crisis in Ukraine, which remains a divided country tonight. One that`s teetering between establishing bonds with Europe and the U.S. and another that`s leading toward returning back into Moscow`s fold.</p><p>Michelle Caruso-Cabrera reports now from Kiev on the latest news out of Ukraine and why it matters to all of us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MICHELLE CARUSO-CABRERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The political situation in Ukraine is much calmer today compared to what we saw late last week, when there was terrible bloodshed as protesters rose up against the government. Although the situation is calmer politically though, financially, it is not. This country needs to borrow money and borrow it fast.</p><p>Right now, the government is running a deficit. That means every single day, it spends more money it takes in tax revenues, and in normal times, they could borrow from the international markets. The traditional lenders won`t give money now because the political situation is so uncertain, so they have to turn to someone.</p><p>They could turn to the European Union and the IMF and the United States has said they would help, as well, or Ukraine could turn to Russia, its biggest trading partner. And that is the core of the issue and why the United States is so interested in this. Where will Ukraine end up, in whose political satellite, the West or East?</p><p>Russia is very concerned about having a country aligned with the E.U. so close to them, so they`re probably going to be willing to do a lot, extend loans with very few requirements in order to keep Ukraine within their spear of influence.</p><p>However, the protest is on the ground why they rose up three months ago is that they don`t want their government to do that. They want their government to turn to the West, where there is better transparency, better governance, and a lot more clarity about how democracy works. How this all plays out is unclear. With a temporary government and over the next several days, they`re kind of try to hammer out some kind of agreement, political and financial.</p><p>The outcome is deeply uncertain.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Michelle Caruso-Cabrera, Kiev, Ukraine.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB: Here now to talk more about today`s market rally, Patricia Edwards. She`s managing director of investments at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.</p><p>And, Patty, nice to have you back with us.</p><p>PATRICIA EDWARDS, U.S. BANK WEALTH MANAGEMENT: Nice to be here, thank you.</p><p>GHARIB: Let me begin by just asking you that we know that investors are always worried about something, and, you know, all of a sudden today, we get this big rally. What changed? Is driving this enthusiasm? And will the rally continue?</p><p>EDWARDS: You know, I think there is a lot that went into today`s numbers. First of all, you had successful closing of the games with no issues over in Sochi, and I think that was not to be taken lightly.</p><p>On top of that, you got a little resolve out of the Ukraine. Nothing is absolutely clear, but there is actually movement and things seem to be calming down. That helps, also.</p><p>Then you add in there some mergers and acquisitions that are really helping to get the engines running here in the U.S. And earnings have been pretty good. All those taken together made for a very nice day today.</p><p>GRIFFETH: But what`s wrong with the logic that says if the Fed -- if we believe the Fed`s easy money policy of the last few years has fueled a great deal of the rally we`ve seen in the stock market, when they start to remove that easy money policy, why don`t we see a decline in the stock market? That`s not happening yet.</p><p>EDWARDS: No, it`s not happening yet, and I think part of the reason for that is there has been so much stimulus over the past few years. And so, we`re starting to ease off on the throttle but our foot is still on the gas peddle. There`s still money going into the economy, it`s just not as much as it was before.</p><p>GHARIB: Well, speaking of the Fed, the new Fed chair, Janet Yellen, will be speaking in front of Congress on Thursday. What do you expect her to say? Is she going to be on message, or are we going to hear something new from her?</p><p>EDWARDS: We`re really expecting that she`s going to be charmingly boring, which will probably be a good thing for this market. Really what we`re expecting, at most, maybe a tweak maybe to put in some wording around some sort of an inflation floor, meaning that they won`t let things slow down too much.</p><p>But beyond that, she should be on message and we expect things to continue going forward the way they have.</p><p>GRIFFETH: We`ve seen a pickup in merger activity lately. A lot of deals have been announced in the last couple of weeks. There are a lot of deals brewing now.</p><p>Do you consider that a positive? And would you invest with that in mind right now?</p><p>EDWARDS: Well, it is a positive, bill. It`s one of the things we saw actually starting last year. If you look at the second half of 2013, there were more deals in the second half than there were in the first and now, we`re starting to get a little more traction with that.</p><p>We think there is a couple things going on there. One is that we need revenue growth in some of our major corporations. We`ve had huge earnings growth in the past five years, about 118 percent, but we`ve only had 7 percent revenue growth.</p><p>And so, given that, they`re going to be looking for different ways to get that revenue growth. We`re looking more for organic growth and to buy the growth.</p><p>So, that`s going to actually be support under some of the smaller and midcap companies, something that we are absolutely taking into consideration.</p><p>GHARIB: Patty, in 30 seconds, tell us about the Ukraine and what investors should do, if anything, about their portfolios.</p><p>EDWARDS: You know, the Ukraine situation is probably not going to affect your portfolio in the short run. The big issue here is going to be something like a connotation. We don`t think that`s coming. In fact, we think there`s going to be help from both Russia and the E.U. offered. We know that the U.S. has already stepped in. And so, we think that it will probably get itself up and you have to invest over the long run using fundamentals, and this is just a small thing.</p><p>GHARIB: All right. Lots of good information.</p><p>Thank you so much, Patty. Patricia Edwards, managing director out U.S. Bank Wealth Management.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Moving now to earning season. It`s winding down but not before we hear from some of the nation`s top retailers, and while some like Wal- Mart (NYSE:WMT) last week will partly blame weak sales on the brutal winter weather, all retailers are not created equal. Others may see the bad weather as a plus for revenue.</p><p>Courtney Reagan has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): While the world`s largest retailer blamed nearly every possible external issue on its disappointing earnings outlook, investors should be careful not to think all retailers will follow suit in this week`s earnings releases.</p><p>In fact, some retailers like those external factors, winter weather and higher home investment, at the expense of discretionary buying.</p><p>Barclays retail analyst Alan Rifkin thinks Home Depot (NYSE:HD) was a beneficiary of the winter weather, carefully positions those weather appropriate products on a region basis, with snow removal products at a particular high sales volume.</p><p>Plus, the upcoming spring quarter is the retailer`s most important, perhaps more so this year as homeowners are expected to continue investing in improvement in and outside the home.</p><p>Stifel Nicolaus analyst Richard Jaffe thinks the cold weather did help Macy`s (NYSE:M) sell winter apparel early in the quarter, but says the tight control on inventor didn`t leave much left to sell in January. Still, Jaffe has Macy`s (NYSE:M) as a top pick going into earnings season.</p><p>RICHARD JAFFE, STIFEL NICOLAUS ANALYST: Macy`s (NYSE:M) is a giant dominant force in the department store industry, and uses its strength effectively to have exclusive brands, to offer unique product and, yes, they do a great job on the channel or the Internet component, as well.</p><p>REAGAN (on camera): Macy`s (NYSE:M) remains a standout among an otherwise dollar department store sector, with dealers posting disappointing earnings, a shrinking Sears (NASDAQ:SHLD) and struggling JCPenney. Sears (NASDAQ:SHLD) and JCPenney report earnings this week. Neither are expected to inspire much confidence.</p><p>JAFFE: Looking at the fourth quarter results, you want to look at the inventory. I look for the balance between Internet and stores to make sure they`re both healthy, robust and growing. That you`re not growing one at the cost of the other.</p><p>REAGAN: Whether merchandise is purchased in store or online, compelling products remain the key success factor. As retail options swell, the most special product offering will win.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Courtney Reagan.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB: And still ahead on the program, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) agrees to pay Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) for faster access. Is the deal a game changer for the industry, and will more agreements like this one follow?</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn is at it again, in a note to eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) board members and shareholders this time, he`s accused members of the board of what he called lapses in corporate governance. And he`s once again calling for the company to spin off its successful PayPal electronic payment unit. But eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) was quick to respond to Icahn who owns about 2 percent of the outstanding shares. EBay says it`s not interested in separating its fastest growing from the parent company.</p><p>GHARIB: With one of every five people in the world owning a smartphone, tech companies are always looking to update their products with the latest accessories and services to boost sales. And this week all the big smartphone makers, social media giants and software firms are doing just that at a big tech conference in Spain.</p><p>It`s call the world, the Mobile World Congress.</p><p>Jon Fortt is in Barcelona and he has all the buzz of what`s new this year.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JON FORTT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This week in Barcelona, many top executives in wireless and tech from around the world are gathering to try and figure out what`s next.</p><p>(on camera): The smartphone revolution gets well underway, which means the new opportunities for profit probably won`t be in hardware so much in services. That`s going to be a key theme here at the Mobile World Congress.</p><p>Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg is here, so is Jan Koum from WhatsApp, his latest acquisition, and IBM CEO Ginny Rometty, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) CEO John Chambers and more.</p><p>For Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), the show is a chance to lay out its vision for getting more people in emerging markets online.</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, FACEBOOK CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO: All the data and studies that we`ve shown show that it will not only increase their opportunities to find jobs and health and education and all these things, it makes the economy better and if we do this as an industry, it will also for self-interest just increase the profits of all the different companies that involved here.</p><p>FORTT: Lots of new products are taking a bout here, including low-end android phones from Nokia (NYSE:NOK), new tablets from HP and Huawei, and an in app payment service from MasterCard (NYSE:MA).</p><p>But for the executives attending, lots of meetings.</p><p>JO LUNDER, VIMPELCOM CEO: I meet government officials, I meet customers, I meet partners, I meet my own employees, I meet competitors. It`s the meeting place to learn and be inspired and it`s also very effective because everybody is here.</p><p>FORTT: A big week for a very big mobile industry.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Jon Fortt in Barcelona.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: We have more now on that deal we told you about at the top of the program with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) paying Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) to use its high speed broadband to speed up digital downloads for Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) customers.</p><p>Julia Boorstin has more on that agreement now, who benefits from it and whether this opens the door to similar doors with other content and Internet providers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) deal aims to be a win/win, giving better service to subscribers of both, addressing concerns customers have suffered from slowing broadband speeds from Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS), as well as Verizon (NYSE:VZ).</p><p>With this deal, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) will cut out the middleman. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) paying Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) to establish a direct connection to the Internet provider, improving infrastructure to make data transmission more efficient. It`s a valuable partnership between the nation`s largest Internet provider about to become much larger and streaming video behemoth, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).</p><p>CRAIG MOFFETT, MOFFETT NATHANSON RESEARCH: You just have a company that represents one-third of the traffic on the internet strike a deal with a company that represents as much as third of the Internet subscribers in America.</p><p>BOORSTIN: Other streaming video giants like YouTube have similar arrangements to work directly with Internet providers, but this is the first time a content company like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) has paid an Internet provider like Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) directly.</p><p>(on camera): That doesn`t mean Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) will necessary face higher cost. It`s just paying a different company. Up until now, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) has paid other companies to help deliver its data.</p><p>(voice-over): One of those intermediaries is Cogent (NASDAQ:COGT). Its stock is suffering on this news and concerns about other deals that could follow.</p><p>Verizon (NYSE:VZ) CEO Lowell McAdam saying on CNBC Monday morning he`s in talks with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and expects to close a similar deal.</p><p>LOWELL MCADAM, VERIZON CEO: The commercial model I think will work pretty well. So, to me, that shows that you don`t necessarily need a lot of regulation in a dynamic market here by doing these commercial deals, we`ll get good investments and good returns for both parties.</p><p>BOORSTIN: Internet providers hope this will give the FCC and others a reason to take a light hand when it comes to regulation, showing rivals can work well together without intervention and analysts Craig Moffett says it reflects well on Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) as it looks for approval of its Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) Cable acquisition.</p><p>MOFFETT: It tells you if you`re the Department of Justice or FCC that Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) is not going to engage in any competitive practices.</p><p>BOORSTIN: We`ll see this if this speeds along regulatory approval for Comcast`s big Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) Cable purchase.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And we need to remind you that Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) is the parent company of CNBC, which produces this program.</p><p>GHARIB: BlackBerry lands two major deals and that`s where we begin tonight`s market focus. Shares of BlackBerry surged on news that its BBM messenger service will be available to Windows phone and Nokia (NYSE:NOK) X users starting this summer. Separately, Ford has picked BlackBerry over Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as its partner on its sync voice activated system in future car models.</p><p>Shares of BlackBerry rose 7 percent to $9.83.</p><p>Chip maker RF Micro Devices (NASDAQ:RFMD) says it`s paying $1.6 billion for its TriQuint semiconductor. The two companies get most of the revenue by supplying parts to device makers like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung and the deal makes them a bigger player. Shares of both companies surged on the news. RF Micro up 21 percent, TriQuint by 26 percent to $11.64.</p><p>GRIFFETH: The suit saga continues. Mens Warehouse has now raised its offer for its rival Jos. A. Bank by over 10 percent, spurring hopes that this month`s long battle of back and forth between the two companies might finally be over. Men`s warehouse also said it might even raise its own bid further if it`s able to examine Jos. A. Bank`s books.</p><p>Shares of both companies up, as you can imagine. Mens Warehouse up to 7 1/2 percent to $48.51. Jos. A. Bank rose by 9 percent to close at $60.04.</p><p>And Pfizer`s pneumonia vaccine treatment for older adults showed that it prevented several kinds of community acquired pneumonia in a clinical study. The treatment is already on the market to treat childhood infections. Analysts say that they predicted the success of the drug on older patients would boost annual sales of the vaccine by $1 billion or more. Shares of Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) rose by more than 1 1/2 percent, closed at $31.99.</p><p>GHARIB: The Pentagon announced some deep spending cuts to the Armed Forces today. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel outlined his vision for the military in the year ahead, and the changing priorities for our men and women in uniform.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHUCK HAGEL, DEFENSE SECRETARY: We are repositioning to focus on a strategic challenge and opportunity that will define our future -- new technologies, new centers of power, and a world that is growing more volatile, more unpredictable and in some instances, more threatening to the United States.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GHARIB: Now, among the proposed cuts, shrinking the army to the smallest size before World War II, closing some military bases, eliminating the Air Force A-10 and U2 aircraft, freezing pay for generals and admirals and a 1 percent across the board pay cut for all military personnel. Now, despite that, shares of some of the biggest defense contractors rose by more than 1 percent today including Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) and Raytheon (NYSE:RTN).</p><p>GRIFFETH: As the health care industry changes, insurers are facing new complications. And tonight, in a first of a three-part series, we`ll take you to a hospital branching out beyond care and into insurance.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Some of the shares of the biggest health insurers have been moving higher because Medicare reimbursement cuts proposed by the government for 2015 were not as bad as those companies feared. And that sent shares of Humana (NYSE:HUM) surging, closing more than 10 percent higher. Also making gains today, big names like WellPoint and Aetna (NYSE:AET).</p><p>GHARIB: Those insurers are not only bracing for reimbursement cuts and other changes in the Affordable Care Act but also some tough new competition.</p><p>Tonight, we begin with a three-part series on the changing health care insurance business. We begin with a look at how some hospitals are now offering their own health care plans.</p><p>Bertha Coombs reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Mike Perivolaris doesn`t have to offer his workers health benefits, but he always has.</p><p>MIKE PERIVOLARIS, BUSINESS OWNER: We target people that are stable, family people who expect at this point, you know, that the insurance is going to be taken care of by their employer.</p><p>COOMBS: This year, the Long Island small business owner is gambling on a brand-new insurance company tied to a big area hospital, North Shore LIJ. Its rates were lower and his staff is happy with the choice.</p><p>PERIVOLARIS: The people that accept this insurance seem to be the doctors that they already had. So it seemed natural.</p><p>COOMBS: The CEO of North Shore LIJ`s new care connect insurance unit says the hospital`s name recognition has helped them compete with large insurers on New York`s exchange and in the private market.</p><p>ALAN MURRAY, NORTH SHORE LIJ CARE CONNECT CEO: We are not a United Healthcare. We`re not Blue Cross and Blue Shield. We have a very narrow network, but it`s highly intense interactive network.</p><p>So, what you trade in choice, we hope you make up with in simplicity.</p><p>COOMBS: It means Care Connect will reimburse North Shore differently than other insurers.</p><p>MURRAY: I don`t necessarily reimburse in fee-for-service environment. What I do is I agree ahead of time that I will spend X number of dollars on health care, and it`s up to them to work with us to figure out the most efficient and best place for that health care to take place so that they are not trying to fight for every penny.</p><p>COOMBS: If they get it right, they will join the ranks of Kaiser`s health system in California and Geisinger in Pennsylvania, highly regarded hospital systems which hold down cost by integrating coverage and health care.</p><p>(on camera): Hospital systems first got into the business of insurance back in the `90s, when HMOs were popular but many found they couldn`t make financials work.</p><p>Analysts say this time could be different.</p><p>LISA MARTIN, MOODY`S INVESTOR SERVICE SVP: Since we moved through the 2000s and into the current day, the data capabilities are much greater, and many hospitals are much more closely aligned with their physicians.</p><p>COOMBS (voice-over): Moody`s (NYSE:MCO) Lisa Martin says having an insurance plan can help hospitals keep patients within their systems, as long as they don`t alienate other players.</p><p>MARTIN: The other risk for hospital running a health plan is really managing the relationship with the insurers that now the hospital is directly competing with in its own market.</p><p>COOMBS: So far, Care Connect has exceeded its enrolment expectations.</p><p>MURRAY: We thought we would probably have 3,000 to 4,000 individual members of which, let`s say, 50 percent to 60 percent of them would pay the bill. We had almost double that both on and off exchange.</p><p>COOMBS: Mike Perivolaris is hoping it pays to be one of their first members.</p><p>PERIVOLARIS: We try things every day. We`re business owners, so we have to be daring sometimes and make decisions.</p><p>COOMBS: Bertha Coombs, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Long Island, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB: To read more about how hospitals are getting into the insurance business, go to our Web site, NBR.com.</p><p>And tomorrow, our series continues with a look at how an insurance startup is attempting to shakeup the industry.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Finally tonight, good news if you invest in companies that pay a dividend. Last year, for the first time ever, the world`s largest public company paid out more than $1 trillion in shareholder dividends globally. That`s up more than $300 billion since 2009.</p><p>The research firm Henderson Global says research listed firms are by far the largest source of dividend income right now, increasing their payouts by an astounding 49 percent in just the past five years.</p><p>Financial firms paid out the most, no surprise. That was followed by technology companies. That is a bit of a surprise.</p><p>GHARIB: And that`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I`m Susie Gharib. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>GRIFFETH: I`m Bill Griffeth. Have a great evening. We`ll see you tomorrow.</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

Investors kicked off the weekend in a buying mood. The S&amp;P finishing just shy of a record and the NASDAQ sits at a 14-year high. Where is the enthusiasm coming from, and how long will it last?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUSIE GHARIB, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Winners and losers. It's a big week for retail earnings, but just because Wal-Mart's numbers were disappointing, it doesn't mean others will follow suit.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GRIFFETH: New players. As the health care system changes, the insurers are facing new competition tonight. In the first of our three-part series, we're going to focus on a hospital that's not only offering care, but also insurance plans that cover it.</p><p>All that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, February, the 24th.</p><p>Good evening, everybody. I'm Bill Griffeth, in tonight for Tyler Mathisen.</p><p>GHARIB: And I'm Susie Gharib.</p><p>Well, what a way to kick off a new week on Wall Street. Stocks rallied with the S&amp;P 500 even setting a new intraday record high. Investors were in a bullish mood thanks to optimism over the latest round of corporate deal-making, and that includes Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) striking a deal with Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) to use its high-speed broadband to get movies to customers faster. And we'll talk more about that subject in just a few minutes.</p><p>Now, here is a look at the closing numbers on Wall Street today. The Dow rose 104 points. It was up almost 200 points but then pulled back. The NASDAQ added 29 and the S&amp;P gained 11 points to 1,847.61, less than 1 point from a new record.</p><p>GRIFFETH: So, while the major averages are now on pace to end the month of February higher, the National Association for Business Economics is wondering whether stocks will continue to climb even if economic growth starts to slow down.</p><p>Steve Liesman has more on why those experts are worried about a possible slow down in the economy and what could happen next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): An economy is like a car engine. When everything works perfectly, there is a certain speed that can careen the car down the road. But the latest thinking on the American economic engine is that something isn't working right, that the potential of the economy to generate growth and prosperity over the next decade will be a lot slower than it had been. One reason, people out of work for years because of a recession means the quality of the labor force has declined.</p><p>DOUGLAS ELMENDORF, CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE DIR.: This shows, I think, a very long shadow of having so many people out of work for such a long period of time.</p><p>LIESMAN (on camera): Elmendorf says the potential growth rate of the economy, that's the speed it can travel at, has fallen to 2.1 percent from 3.3 percent the previous 60 years. That's $200 billion less in growth.</p><p>(voice-over): Another problem, the ageing of the work force.</p><p>CHRIS VARVARES: As people age, they tend to not participate as much on the labor force, up until the time that they retire. So, the age and population will lead to slower growth of those folks who are looking and willing to work.</p><p>LIESMAN: Larry Summers, the former treasury secretary, and economic advisor to President Obama, says this is a clear case for the government to step in and increase spending.</p><p>LAWRENCE SUMMERS, HARVARD UNIVERSITY: Ask if anyone is proud of Kennedy Airport and then to note that if a moment when the long-term interest rate in a currency we print is below 3 percent, and the construction unemployment rate approaches double digits is not the right moment to increase public investment in general and perhaps to repair Kennedy Airport in particular.</p><p>LIESMAN: Whatever the solution, there is a pretty good agreement the economy will grow slower, unless some new technology can be found that will kick start the American growth engine.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Steve Liesman.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB: Gold prices soared today. Investors poured money into the safe haven asset, partly on those worries about slow growth in the U.S. that Steve Liesman just talked about and also, because of growing uncertainty in emerging markets and political turmoil in Ukraine and Thailand. The price of the precious metal rose by $14.40 to 1,338. That's a four-month high.</p><p>GRIFFETH: More now on that crisis in Ukraine, which remains a divided country tonight. One that's teetering between establishing bonds with Europe and the U.S. and another that's leading toward returning back into Moscow's fold.</p><p>Michelle Caruso-Cabrera reports now from Kiev on the latest news out of Ukraine and why it matters to all of us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MICHELLE CARUSO-CABRERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The political situation in Ukraine is much calmer today compared to what we saw late last week, when there was terrible bloodshed as protesters rose up against the government. Although the situation is calmer politically though, financially, it is not. This country needs to borrow money and borrow it fast.</p><p>Right now, the government is running a deficit. That means every single day, it spends more money it takes in tax revenues, and in normal times, they could borrow from the international markets. The traditional lenders won't give money now because the political situation is so uncertain, so they have to turn to someone.</p><p>They could turn to the European Union and the IMF and the United States has said they would help, as well, or Ukraine could turn to Russia, its biggest trading partner. And that is the core of the issue and why the United States is so interested in this. Where will Ukraine end up, in whose political satellite, the West or East?</p><p>Russia is very concerned about having a country aligned with the E.U. so close to them, so they're probably going to be willing to do a lot, extend loans with very few requirements in order to keep Ukraine within their spear of influence.</p><p>However, the protest is on the ground why they rose up three months ago is that they don't want their government to do that. They want their government to turn to the West, where there is better transparency, better governance, and a lot more clarity about how democracy works. How this all plays out is unclear. With a temporary government and over the next several days, they're kind of try to hammer out some kind of agreement, political and financial.</p><p>The outcome is deeply uncertain.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Michelle Caruso-Cabrera, Kiev, Ukraine.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB: Here now to talk more about today's market rally, Patricia Edwards. She's managing director of investments at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.</p><p>And, Patty, nice to have you back with us.</p><p>PATRICIA EDWARDS, U.S. BANK WEALTH MANAGEMENT: Nice to be here, thank you.</p><p>GHARIB: Let me begin by just asking you that we know that investors are always worried about something, and, you know, all of a sudden today, we get this big rally. What changed? Is driving this enthusiasm? And will the rally continue?</p><p>EDWARDS: You know, I think there is a lot that went into today's numbers. First of all, you had successful closing of the games with no issues over in Sochi, and I think that was not to be taken lightly.</p><p>On top of that, you got a little resolve out of the Ukraine. Nothing is absolutely clear, but there is actually movement and things seem to be calming down. That helps, also.</p><p>Then you add in there some mergers and acquisitions that are really helping to get the engines running here in the U.S. And earnings have been pretty good. All those taken together made for a very nice day today.</p><p>GRIFFETH: But what's wrong with the logic that says if the Fed -- if we believe the Fed's easy money policy of the last few years has fueled a great deal of the rally we've seen in the stock market, when they start to remove that easy money policy, why don't we see a decline in the stock market? That's not happening yet.</p><p>EDWARDS: No, it's not happening yet, and I think part of the reason for that is there has been so much stimulus over the past few years. And so, we're starting to ease off on the throttle but our foot is still on the gas peddle. There's still money going into the economy, it's just not as much as it was before.</p><p>GHARIB: Well, speaking of the Fed, the new Fed chair, Janet Yellen, will be speaking in front of Congress on Thursday. What do you expect her to say? Is she going to be on message, or are we going to hear something new from her?</p><p>EDWARDS: We're really expecting that she's going to be charmingly boring, which will probably be a good thing for this market. Really what we're expecting, at most, maybe a tweak maybe to put in some wording around some sort of an inflation floor, meaning that they won't let things slow down too much.</p><p>But beyond that, she should be on message and we expect things to continue going forward the way they have.</p><p>GRIFFETH: We've seen a pickup in merger activity lately. A lot of deals have been announced in the last couple of weeks. There are a lot of deals brewing now.</p><p>Do you consider that a positive? And would you invest with that in mind right now?</p><p>EDWARDS: Well, it is a positive, bill. It's one of the things we saw actually starting last year. If you look at the second half of 2013, there were more deals in the second half than there were in the first and now, we're starting to get a little more traction with that.</p><p>We think there is a couple things going on there. One is that we need revenue growth in some of our major corporations. We've had huge earnings growth in the past five years, about 118 percent, but we've only had 7 percent revenue growth.</p><p>And so, given that, they're going to be looking for different ways to get that revenue growth. We're looking more for organic growth and to buy the growth.</p><p>So, that's going to actually be support under some of the smaller and midcap companies, something that we are absolutely taking into consideration.</p><p>GHARIB: Patty, in 30 seconds, tell us about the Ukraine and what investors should do, if anything, about their portfolios.</p><p>EDWARDS: You know, the Ukraine situation is probably not going to affect your portfolio in the short run. The big issue here is going to be something like a connotation. We don't think that's coming. In fact, we think there's going to be help from both Russia and the E.U. offered. We know that the U.S. has already stepped in. And so, we think that it will probably get itself up and you have to invest over the long run using fundamentals, and this is just a small thing.</p><p>GHARIB: All right. Lots of good information.</p><p>Thank you so much, Patty. Patricia Edwards, managing director out U.S. Bank Wealth Management.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Moving now to earning season. It's winding down but not before we hear from some of the nation's top retailers, and while some like Wal- Mart (NYSE:WMT) last week will partly blame weak sales on the brutal winter weather, all retailers are not created equal. Others may see the bad weather as a plus for revenue.</p><p>Courtney Reagan has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COURTNEY REAGAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): While the world's largest retailer blamed nearly every possible external issue on its disappointing earnings outlook, investors should be careful not to think all retailers will follow suit in this week's earnings releases.</p><p>In fact, some retailers like those external factors, winter weather and higher home investment, at the expense of discretionary buying.</p><p>Barclays retail analyst Alan Rifkin thinks Home Depot (NYSE:HD) was a beneficiary of the winter weather, carefully positions those weather appropriate products on a region basis, with snow removal products at a particular high sales volume.</p><p>Plus, the upcoming spring quarter is the retailer's most important, perhaps more so this year as homeowners are expected to continue investing in improvement in and outside the home.</p><p>Stifel Nicolaus analyst Richard Jaffe thinks the cold weather did help Macy's (NYSE:M) sell winter apparel early in the quarter, but says the tight control on inventor didn't leave much left to sell in January. Still, Jaffe has Macy's (NYSE:M) as a top pick going into earnings season.</p><p>RICHARD JAFFE, STIFEL NICOLAUS ANALYST: Macy's (NYSE:M) is a giant dominant force in the department store industry, and uses its strength effectively to have exclusive brands, to offer unique product and, yes, they do a great job on the channel or the Internet component, as well.</p><p>REAGAN (on camera): Macy's (NYSE:M) remains a standout among an otherwise dollar department store sector, with dealers posting disappointing earnings, a shrinking Sears (NASDAQ:SHLD) and struggling JCPenney. Sears (NASDAQ:SHLD) and JCPenney report earnings this week. Neither are expected to inspire much confidence.</p><p>JAFFE: Looking at the fourth quarter results, you want to look at the inventory. I look for the balance between Internet and stores to make sure they're both healthy, robust and growing. That you're not growing one at the cost of the other.</p><p>REAGAN: Whether merchandise is purchased in store or online, compelling products remain the key success factor. As retail options swell, the most special product offering will win.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Courtney Reagan.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB: And still ahead on the program, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) agrees to pay Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) for faster access. Is the deal a game changer for the industry, and will more agreements like this one follow?</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn is at it again, in a note to eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) board members and shareholders this time, he's accused members of the board of what he called lapses in corporate governance. And he's once again calling for the company to spin off its successful PayPal electronic payment unit. But eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) was quick to respond to Icahn who owns about 2 percent of the outstanding shares. EBay says it's not interested in separating its fastest growing from the parent company.</p><p>GHARIB: With one of every five people in the world owning a smartphone, tech companies are always looking to update their products with the latest accessories and services to boost sales. And this week all the big smartphone makers, social media giants and software firms are doing just that at a big tech conference in Spain.</p><p>It's call the world, the Mobile World Congress.</p><p>Jon Fortt is in Barcelona and he has all the buzz of what's new this year.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JON FORTT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This week in Barcelona, many top executives in wireless and tech from around the world are gathering to try and figure out what's next.</p><p>(on camera): The smartphone revolution gets well underway, which means the new opportunities for profit probably won't be in hardware so much in services. That's going to be a key theme here at the Mobile World Congress.</p><p>Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg is here, so is Jan Koum from WhatsApp, his latest acquisition, and IBM CEO Ginny Rometty, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) CEO John Chambers and more.</p><p>For Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), the show is a chance to lay out its vision for getting more people in emerging markets online.</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, FACEBOOK CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO: All the data and studies that we've shown show that it will not only increase their opportunities to find jobs and health and education and all these things, it makes the economy better and if we do this as an industry, it will also for self-interest just increase the profits of all the different companies that involved here.</p><p>FORTT: Lots of new products are taking a bout here, including low-end android phones from Nokia (NYSE:NOK), new tablets from HP and Huawei, and an in app payment service from MasterCard (NYSE:MA).</p><p>But for the executives attending, lots of meetings.</p><p>JO LUNDER, VIMPELCOM CEO: I meet government officials, I meet customers, I meet partners, I meet my own employees, I meet competitors. It's the meeting place to learn and be inspired and it's also very effective because everybody is here.</p><p>FORTT: A big week for a very big mobile industry.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Jon Fortt in Barcelona.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: We have more now on that deal we told you about at the top of the program with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) paying Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) to use its high speed broadband to speed up digital downloads for Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) customers.</p><p>Julia Boorstin has more on that agreement now, who benefits from it and whether this opens the door to similar doors with other content and Internet providers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) deal aims to be a win/win, giving better service to subscribers of both, addressing concerns customers have suffered from slowing broadband speeds from Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS), as well as Verizon (NYSE:VZ).</p><p>With this deal, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) will cut out the middleman. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) paying Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) to establish a direct connection to the Internet provider, improving infrastructure to make data transmission more efficient. It's a valuable partnership between the nation's largest Internet provider about to become much larger and streaming video behemoth, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).</p><p>CRAIG MOFFETT, MOFFETT NATHANSON RESEARCH: You just have a company that represents one-third of the traffic on the internet strike a deal with a company that represents as much as third of the Internet subscribers in America.</p><p>BOORSTIN: Other streaming video giants like YouTube have similar arrangements to work directly with Internet providers, but this is the first time a content company like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) has paid an Internet provider like Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) directly.</p><p>(on camera): That doesn't mean Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) will necessary face higher cost. It's just paying a different company. Up until now, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) has paid other companies to help deliver its data.</p><p>(voice-over): One of those intermediaries is Cogent (NASDAQ:COGT). Its stock is suffering on this news and concerns about other deals that could follow.</p><p>Verizon (NYSE:VZ) CEO Lowell McAdam saying on CNBC Monday morning he's in talks with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and expects to close a similar deal.</p><p>LOWELL MCADAM, VERIZON CEO: The commercial model I think will work pretty well. So, to me, that shows that you don't necessarily need a lot of regulation in a dynamic market here by doing these commercial deals, we'll get good investments and good returns for both parties.</p><p>BOORSTIN: Internet providers hope this will give the FCC and others a reason to take a light hand when it comes to regulation, showing rivals can work well together without intervention and analysts Craig Moffett says it reflects well on Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) as it looks for approval of its Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) Cable acquisition.</p><p>MOFFETT: It tells you if you're the Department of Justice or FCC that Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) is not going to engage in any competitive practices.</p><p>BOORSTIN: We'll see this if this speeds along regulatory approval for Comcast's big Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) Cable purchase.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFETH: And we need to remind you that Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NYSE:CCS) is the parent company of CNBC, which produces this program.</p><p>GHARIB: BlackBerry lands two major deals and that's where we begin tonight's market focus. Shares of BlackBerry surged on news that its BBM messenger service will be available to Windows phone and Nokia (NYSE:NOK) X users starting this summer. Separately, Ford has picked BlackBerry over Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as its partner on its sync voice activated system in future car models.</p><p>Shares of BlackBerry rose 7 percent to $9.83.</p><p>Chip maker RF Micro Devices (NASDAQ:RFMD) says it's paying $1.6 billion for its TriQuint semiconductor. The two companies get most of the revenue by supplying parts to device makers like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung and the deal makes them a bigger player. Shares of both companies surged on the news. RF Micro up 21 percent, TriQuint by 26 percent to $11.64.</p><p>GRIFFETH: The suit saga continues. Mens Warehouse has now raised its offer for its rival Jos. A. Bank by over 10 percent, spurring hopes that this month's long battle of back and forth between the two companies might finally be over. Men's warehouse also said it might even raise its own bid further if it's able to examine Jos. A. Bank's books.</p><p>Shares of both companies up, as you can imagine. Mens Warehouse up to 7 1/2 percent to $48.51. Jos. A. Bank rose by 9 percent to close at $60.04.</p><p>And Pfizer's pneumonia vaccine treatment for older adults showed that it prevented several kinds of community acquired pneumonia in a clinical study. The treatment is already on the market to treat childhood infections. Analysts say that they predicted the success of the drug on older patients would boost annual sales of the vaccine by $1 billion or more. Shares of Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) rose by more than 1 1/2 percent, closed at $31.99.</p><p>GHARIB: The Pentagon announced some deep spending cuts to the Armed Forces today. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel outlined his vision for the military in the year ahead, and the changing priorities for our men and women in uniform.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHUCK HAGEL, DEFENSE SECRETARY: We are repositioning to focus on a strategic challenge and opportunity that will define our future -- new technologies, new centers of power, and a world that is growing more volatile, more unpredictable and in some instances, more threatening to the United States.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GHARIB: Now, among the proposed cuts, shrinking the army to the smallest size before World War II, closing some military bases, eliminating the Air Force A-10 and U2 aircraft, freezing pay for generals and admirals and a 1 percent across the board pay cut for all military personnel. Now, despite that, shares of some of the biggest defense contractors rose by more than 1 percent today including Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) and Raytheon (NYSE:RTN).</p><p>GRIFFETH: As the health care industry changes, insurers are facing new complications. And tonight, in a first of a three-part series, we'll take you to a hospital branching out beyond care and into insurance.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>GRIFFETH: Some of the shares of the biggest health insurers have been moving higher because Medicare reimbursement cuts proposed by the government for 2015 were not as bad as those companies feared. And that sent shares of Humana (NYSE:HUM) surging, closing more than 10 percent higher. Also making gains today, big names like WellPoint and Aetna (NYSE:AET).</p><p>GHARIB: Those insurers are not only bracing for reimbursement cuts and other changes in the Affordable Care Act but also some tough new competition.</p><p>Tonight, we begin with a three-part series on the changing health care insurance business. We begin with a look at how some hospitals are now offering their own health care plans.</p><p>Bertha Coombs reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BERTHA COOMBS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Mike Perivolaris doesn't have to offer his workers health benefits, but he always has.</p><p>MIKE PERIVOLARIS, BUSINESS OWNER: We target people that are stable, family people who expect at this point, you know, that the insurance is going to be taken care of by their employer.</p><p>COOMBS: This year, the Long Island small business owner is gambling on a brand-new insurance company tied to a big area hospital, North Shore LIJ. Its rates were lower and his staff is happy with the choice.</p><p>PERIVOLARIS: The people that accept this insurance seem to be the doctors that they already had. So it seemed natural.</p><p>COOMBS: The CEO of North Shore LIJ's new care connect insurance unit says the hospital's name recognition has helped them compete with large insurers on New York's exchange and in the private market.</p><p>ALAN MURRAY, NORTH SHORE LIJ CARE CONNECT CEO: We are not a United Healthcare. We're not Blue Cross and Blue Shield. We have a very narrow network, but it's highly intense interactive network.</p><p>So, what you trade in choice, we hope you make up with in simplicity.</p><p>COOMBS: It means Care Connect will reimburse North Shore differently than other insurers.</p><p>MURRAY: I don't necessarily reimburse in fee-for-service environment. What I do is I agree ahead of time that I will spend X number of dollars on health care, and it's up to them to work with us to figure out the most efficient and best place for that health care to take place so that they are not trying to fight for every penny.</p><p>COOMBS: If they get it right, they will join the ranks of Kaiser's health system in California and Geisinger in Pennsylvania, highly regarded hospital systems which hold down cost by integrating coverage and health care.</p><p>(on camera): Hospital systems first got into the business of insurance back in the '90s, when HMOs were popular but many found they couldn't make financials work.</p><p>Analysts say this time could be different.</p><p>LISA MARTIN, MOODY'S INVESTOR SERVICE SVP: Since we moved through the 2000s and into the current day, the data capabilities are much greater, and many hospitals are much more closely aligned with their physicians.</p><p>COOMBS (voice-over): Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Lisa Martin says having an insurance plan can help hospitals keep patients within their systems, as long as they don't alienate other players.</p><p>MARTIN: The other risk for hospital running a health plan is really managing the relationship with the insurers that now the hospital is directly competing with in its own market.</p><p>COOMBS: So far, Care Connect has exceeded its enrolment expectations.</p><p>MURRAY: We thought we would probably have 3,000 to 4,000 individual members of which, let's say, 50 percent to 60 percent of them would pay the bill. We had almost double that both on and off exchange.</p><p>COOMBS: Mike Perivolaris is hoping it pays to be one of their first members.</p><p>PERIVOLARIS: We try things every day. We're business owners, so we have to be daring sometimes and make decisions.</p><p>COOMBS: Bertha Coombs, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Long Island, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GHARIB: To read more about how hospitals are getting into the insurance business, go to our Web site, NBR.com.</p><p>And tomorrow, our series continues with a look at how an insurance startup is attempting to shakeup the industry.</p><p>GRIFFETH: Finally tonight, good news if you invest in companies that pay a dividend. Last year, for the first time ever, the world's largest public company paid out more than $1 trillion in shareholder dividends globally. That's up more than $300 billion since 2009.</p><p>The research firm Henderson Global says research listed firms are by far the largest source of dividend income right now, increasing their payouts by an astounding 49 percent in just the past five years.</p><p>Financial firms paid out the most, no surprise. That was followed by technology companies. That is a bit of a surprise.</p><p>GHARIB: And that's NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I'm Susie Gharib. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>GRIFFETH: I'm Bill Griffeth. Have a great evening. We'll see you tomorrow.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

The S&amp;P 500  and Nasdaq closed at all-time high again.  No wonder more investors ask is  this the greatest bull market of all time?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Smartphone addiction.  Two big  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) investors want the company to do more to prevent  overuse by kids.  But is it Apple's responsibility?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MATHISEN:  And the long haul.  As the economy keeps on trucking so does the  trucking industry.  </p><p>Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday,  January 8th.  </p><p>HERERA:  Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  </p><p>Stocks extend their 2018 gains.  It wasn't a rip-roaring rally to start the  week, but it was enough to push the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq to new records.   Investors remain upbeat about the economy and confident that it will  continue to pick up steam.  </p><p>So, here are the final numbers.  The Dow pulled back a bit, dropping 12  points to 25,283, the Nasdaq gained 20 and the S&amp;P 500 gained four.  </p><p>With a string of record runs in 2018 getting off to a robust start, some  may start to think that this bull market is shaping up to be one of the  strongest ever.  </p><p>Mike Santoli picks it up from here.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The bull market set  to reach its ninth anniversary in two months is now the second best ever,  which means that investors who expect generous gains from here over the  next couple of years are effectively betting that this bull run can become  the greatest of all time.  </p><p>In terms of market gains, valuation, and the public exposure to stocks,  only the final years of the 1990s surge sit at higher elevations than the  climb that began in March of 2009.  This might sound scary for anyone who  recalls the speculative frenzy of the late '90s market and the wealth  destruction that followed as the tech bubble bursts, but the comforting  news for now is that while today's bull market ranks number two, it's still  quite a distance from the excesses of the one that closed the 20th century.  </p><p>The S&amp;P 500 has gained just over 300 percent from its lows set during the  great financial crisis in early 2009.  That compares to a 580 percent  advance that ran from the 1987 crash to early 2000.  And while stocks are  rather richly valued today, they are not as expensive as at the 2000 peak.  </p><p>Finally, retail investors had nearly 80 percent of their financial assets  in stocks and were feasting on half baked initial public offerings 18 years  ago.  Today, they hold closer to 70 percent in stocks and most popular  investments are sober index funds.  </p><p>All this explains why some optimistic strategists are predicting a more  energetic phase of the bull market as public excitement grows and the new  corporate tax cut offers a fresh story line for further gains atop strong  global growth and a healthy consumer.  It might all sound too good to be  true and it always makes sense to ask what could go wrong when the crowd is  fixated on the good news.  </p><p>For as long as stocks keep clicking to new record highs though, the  comparisons with the greatest ever bull market will only get louder.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Mike Santoli.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  When investors who focused last year on growth stocks were  richly rewarded.  Large cap growth funds were up nearly 30 percent in 2017  while large cap value funds rose just under 16 percent.  So, will growth  continue to dominate this year or should investors now start to nibble more  in value stocks and mutual funds?  </p><p>Joining us now to discuss that, Kevin Caron.  He's portfolio manager with  Washington Crossing Advisers.  </p><p>Kevin, always good to see you.  </p><p>KEVIN CARON, WASHINGTON CROSSINGS ADVISORS PORTFOLIO MANAGER:  It's good to  be here.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Let's do a little level setting here.  I just love for those who  don't know those terms of art to hear from you the difference is between a  growth stock or fund and a value stock or fund.  What are the distinctions?  </p><p>CARON:  All right.  Well, the growth stocks are companies that trade with  higher multiples, multiples of earnings or multiples of book value and  value is going to be lower.  </p><p>Now, you might say, well, why not always buy the thing that's cheaper and  the difference is, as you might guess it, guess, growth.  So, in the last  year or so, as we've seen growth pick up in the global economy and earnings  grow really pick up for the tech sector in particular, we've seen the  growth investors be more willing to pay higher multiples to own the growth  sectors.  And so, that's why the growth style has, by far, outperformed the  value sector.  </p><p>HERERA:  What do you say to those who say that valuations overall, whether  you're talking about value or growth are still pretty richly valued, no pun  intended?  </p><p>CARON:  Yes.  Well, they are.  And it's not -- it's really across not just  growth and value, but if you look at the overall stock market, it's trading  with a value that is relatively high compared to the underlying economy.   Roughly $28 trillion is the value of the U.S. stock market.  The economy is  $18 trillion.  </p><p>So, by that measure, it's fairly rough and it's fairly rich.  And also,  price to earnings is fairly high overall.  So, they're both fairly high.   And growth in particular is higher.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  So what are you doing in the portfolios that you manage that our  viewers could then maybe extrapolate and apply in their lives?  Are you  paring back your growth allocations and looking at more value companies and  funds?  </p><p>CARON:  Yes.  So, coming into 2018, we have done exactly that.  We have  been overweight growth on prospects of a better growth in the economy.  We  have seen that.  </p><p>But we are getting a little bit concerned about the relative valuation  between growth and value.  So, we have trimmed back the growth allocation  from overweight to neutral and we've lifted our value weighting from  underweight to neutral, citing better relative valuations for the value  sectors.  </p><p>HERERA:  How do you feel about the economy overall because that's basically  what's going to continue to drive stocks?</p><p>CARON:  Really solid.  There is little in the data that concerns us here.   The earnings are growing nicely.  The employment data seems to be fairly  good.  And the overall outlook for inflation and interest rates is  relatively benign.  </p><p>So, there is nothing in the immediate data that concerns us.  And we would  assume the near-term outlook for recession, for example, would relatively  low and encourage us to remain overweight equities overall compared to  bonds.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  All right.  Kevin, thanks very much.  She's the last guy there  tonight.  Go home.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Kevin Caron with Washington Crossings Advisers.</p><p>CARON:  Thank you.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Good to see you.  </p><p>HERERA:  In Washington, the treasury secretary has reportedly asked  Congress to lift the federal government's debt ceiling by February 28th.   That's according to \"Bloomberg\".  The treasury will exhaust all of its  borrowing options and run out of cash to pay its bills by late March or  early April if Congress doesn't raise its borrowing authority.  The  treasury secretary, Mr. Mnuchin, has said repeatedly that he would prefer  the debt limit raised well before the government faces a potential default.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Dow component Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) will fault research into  Alzheimer's and Parkinson's treatments.  The drug maker says the decision  reallocates money into other areas.  Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) had made big  investments into neuro degenerative diseases.  They faced some setbacks  recently.  There is no known cure for either Alzheimer or Parkinson's.  </p><p>Separately, the bio tech company Axovant will no longer develop a dementia  drug because that drug failed to meet certain goals in recent studies.</p><p>Shares of both Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and Axovant fell, with Axovant, a small  cap stock, seeing its value more than halved.  </p><p>HERERA:  That was just one of the very hot topics discussed at the biggest  health care event of the year.  </p><p>Meg Tirrell spoke to a number of industry CEOs at the JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)  health care conference, and that's in San Francisco.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MEG TIRRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  A rainy day of weather  kicked off the annual J.P. Morgan health care conference in San Francisco.   It's the year's biggest event for health care investing, where more than  450 companies present over four days to more than 9,000 attendees.  </p><p>It's always a big conference for deal news and this year, we did get a deal  from Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG).  It's spending $1.1 billion to acquire cancer  drug maker Impact Biomedicine, gaining a drug for a rare form of bone  marrow cancer.  </p><p>We talked to CEO Mark Alles about that at the conference.  </p><p>MARK ALLES, CELGENE CEO:  Well, first of all, it's a hematology play.  And  our DNA at Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) is hematology.  Second, it's a highly  unmet medical need.  Myelofibrosis is a rare cancer but at the same time,  until now, there's been only one FDA approved drug ever for the disease.  </p><p>TIRRELL:  Following the deal, though, biotech stocks were under pressure as  some may have hoped for Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) or others to do bigger deals  in the space.  Many wondering if the U.S. tax overhaul would spur M&amp;A.  </p><p>We talked to Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) CEO Dave Ricks about the impacts of tax  reform.  </p><p>DAVE RICKS, ELI LILLY CEO:  We're worried about the lopsided nature of  foreign competitors with better tax competitors than we did.  That's now  addressed.  I think strategically that's the most important thing that came  out of this tax reform.  </p><p>It will allow us also to invest without thinking about the tax rate so  much.  But rather put plants and labs where it makes sense, where the  talent is and where the markets serving are.  So, overall, it was a  successful package from a pharmaceutical sector.  </p><p>TIRRELL:  Other topics on discussion this week have been drug pricing.  It  was, of course, during this week last year that President-elect Donald  Trump made his comment that the industry is, quote, getting away with  murder when it comes to its pricing policy.  And as companies were updating  on their drug pipelines and other aspects of their businesses, there was  another issue on display, that of gender diversity.  According to a recent  effort from STAT News, of the more than 450 companies presenting here at  the conference, only 20 have women CEOs presenting.  That compares with 22  presenters at the conference named Michael.  </p><p>We talked with one of those women CEOs earlier.  </p><p>KATRINE BOSLEY, EDITAS MEDICINE CEO:  If you look at the senior team,  within the company, vice president and above, over half of our team members  are women.  But it's not just about gender.  I think it's a broader  question of diversity because making experimental medicines and advancing  them is tough and having diversity is a strength and part of what's going  to make us successful.  </p><p>TIRRELL:  Something for the industry to work on in 2018.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Meg Tirrell in San Francisco.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, there's also been a big push by Silicon Valley to move  into the very large and very lucrative health care industry.  </p><p>Deirdre Bosa has that angle tonight.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DEIRDRE BOSA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  This year, more than  20 million Americans are predicted to be using smart watches.  Many of them  will be using them for more than just telling the time.  They will be  tracking how many steps taken, how many calories burned and resting heart  rate.  </p><p>But could a smart watch one day save your life?  </p><p>Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is trying to find out.  The tech giant is teaming up  with Stanford medicine for a first of its kind research study that will use  the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) watch to detect irregular heart rhythms that could  lead to a stroke.  </p><p>And it's not just Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  Other big tech companies like  Alphabet, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) are getting  involved in efforts to remake the health care industry.  </p><p>A few reasons tech is moving into the space.  One, it is $3 trillion  industry in the United States.  Two, it's ripe for innovation and  disruption.  And three, these companies know consumers and they  increasingly have the scale, data and reach to deliver.  </p><p>In recent years, their involvement in the health care industry has surged.   According to CB Insights participation in health care equity deals by the  10 largest U.S. tech companies has increased ten-fold in the last five  years to nearly $3 billion last year.  </p><p>Some of those deals include Amazon's participation in a financing round for  Grail, a cancer detection startup.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) acquired sleep  tracking company Beddit and Alphabet bought Senosis, a health monitoring  start-up.  </p><p>Their efforts are much bigger than just those deals.  Alphabet has been  expanding verily, its unit dedicated to life sciences.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)  has health kit, while Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is quietly moving in for the  moment and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is making it easier for pharma companies to  advertise.  Increasingly, health care executives themselves are thinking  about disruption and innovation in terms of technology.  Biogen CEO says  the biotech industry needs to take the lead in changes and be what he calls  the Tesla of the industry and set new models.  </p><p>MICHAEL VOUNATSOS, BIOGEN CEO:  We need to bring this industry closer to  the consumer, closer to the patients.  We are meant to provide support to  the patient who is sick, not to take advantage of those.  </p><p>BOSA:  Meanwhile, some analysts say the road ahead for tech and health care  won't be without bumps as they learn to understand regulatory procedures  and patient/clinician relationships.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Deirdre Bosa, San Francisco.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Still ahead, screen time.  Should Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) do more to  curb growing smart phone addiction among kids?</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Two prominent Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shareholders made an unusual  request.  They're pressuring the company on a social responsibility issue  not a corporate one.  The focus is on children and whether the company  should do more to fight smartphone addiction in kids.  </p><p>Josh Lipton has the story.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Believe it or not, the  average American teenager got his first phone before he was a teen at  roughly 10 years old.  And that teenager today currently spends nearly five  hours a day on it.  And that doesn't even include taking and texting.  </p><p>Jana Partners and CalSTRS, two Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shareholders who own a  combined $2 billion of the company shares are concerned, citing that data  in a letter they sent the iPhone maker over the weekend.  The shareholders  are worried that the iPhone could hurt children, saying: As one of the most  innovative companies in the history of technology, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) can  play a defining role in signaling to the industry that paying special  attention to the health and development of the next generation is both good  business and the right thing to do.  </p><p>They point to alarming data that children are increasingly distracted by  digital devices in the classroom and that teenagers who spend too much time  on such devices are at higher risk of depression and even suicide.  </p><p>One of the researchers cited in the letter says children and their parents  would benefit if they weren't overusing the devices.  </p><p>JEAN TWENGE, SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY:  For Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in  particular, they make their profit when someone buys the device and owns  it.  It doesn't matter how often they use it.  And what the research shows  is for teens, the happiest teens are those who have the phones but use them  about an hour, maybe two hours a day.  It's beyond that when issues start  to show up.  </p><p>LIPTON:  The shareholders want Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to convene a panel of  experts to study the issue, partner with experts to conduct further  research and offer parents new tools and options.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) does  already offers parents help.  They can take an active role in restricting  the apps and features that their children use on these devices.  </p><p>Some might counter that the responsibility isn't ultimately with phone  manufacturers but with their parents.  And that's often the social media  apps like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Snapchat where young people spend their  time, but Jana and CalSTRS say that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) can do more and  argue that addressing the issue today will boost the long-term value for  all shareholders by creating more choices and options for customers.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Josh Lipton, San Francisco.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  As Josh mentioned in his report, today's typical teenager may  spend nearly five hours a day glued to that smartphone and that lack of  face to face time could be detrimental to a young person's well-being.  </p><p>So, is it the responsibility of companies to educate parents on the risk  associated with their products and services?  </p><p>Here to talk about that is Dan Eaton (NYSE:ETN).  He's a business ethics  instructor at the Fowler College of Business at San Diego State University.  </p><p>Welcome.  Nice to have you here.  </p><p>DAN EATON, SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY'S BUSINESS ETHICS INSTRUCTOR:  Good  to be with you.  </p><p>HERERA:  So, what do you think about the basic premise that we put forward?   What is the responsibility of a company like an Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or  another smartphone maker to the customer and the customer's parents?  </p><p>EATON:  Well, the responsibility of any company is to make sure that  consumers are sufficiently well-informed of the risks that come from using  their products.  So, when you talk about whether it's a responsibility of  the company on the one hand, or the end user or the parents on the other,  the answer is, well, yes, it's the responsibility of both.  </p><p>And it's really good business.  It's good for the bottom line.  This is not  entirely about corporate social responsibility.  It's also about protecting  shareholder value, which is why two big shareholders with $2 billion  invested in this company want pro-action now.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  You know, it's interesting that these shareholders who happen to  be Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shareholders have gone to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  It  could be Samsung.  It could be another manufacturer, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)  or whomever.  </p><p>What they seem to be calling for is, as you say, a more proactive position  on the part of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  Potentially to come up with wrinkles  or products that they put on the phone that make it easier for parents to  limit or monitor both the time or the ways -- and there are products out  there, but they are not -- Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) already does some of it, but  they are not as easy to use as these people are calling for.  </p><p>EATON:  And it doesn't seem to take anything away from Apple's bottom line  to make them easier to use.  The bottom line is that there is no defeat  device that is going to override the insistence of a teenager, period.  The  bottom line is --  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, you can say that again.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HERERA:  We both got kids that use them.  We know what you are talking  about.  </p><p>EATON:  But that said, it is sometimes the responsibility of these  companies to make it easier for parents to exercise that control.  </p><p>Barbara Booth (ph), our strategic editor, has an excellent piece on  CNBC.com about the things parents ought to do.  It's with them that the  ultimate responsibility rests.  But companies can do more and they should  do more, because it is good business.  </p><p>This is not just about saving the world.  It's about protecting a  vulnerable population which is children and it's about giving parents a  tool to do their ultimate job better.  </p><p>HERERA:  Do you think most parents are even aware of how much time their  kids spend on a phone and would they be more proactive if they realized it  or how integral the device is to their daily life?  </p><p>EATON:  They are probably not aware, but they're going to be more aware now  having watched this segment.  And the bottom line is that allowing this  kind of device which controls the amount of time will enable them to place  those controls regardless of how much they know about their own children's  usage.  </p><p>There was a report in the package that you just ran that children are  happiest when they only use it about an hour or two on the devices.  And  this technology will enable parents to ensure their children are as happy  as they can be without getting addicted.  </p><p>I mean, the piece that Barbara Booth ran talked about what's referred to as  digital heroin.  That's scary.  And it's better to take steps now to avoid  that kind of thing that to let it get out of control with the reputational  risks that are going to ultimately to jeopardize these two investors'  financial stake in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  </p><p>HERERA:  Dan, thank you so much.  Appreciate it.  We are all jealous that  you're out in San Diego and we're not.  Thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>EATON:  And yet it's raining here.  So --  </p><p>HERERA:  OK.  There you go.  </p><p>Dan Eaton (NYSE:ETN) with San Diego State University.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, GoPro may be open to selling itself, and that is where we  begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".</p><p>Just hours after the wearable camera maker said it was cutting jobs  lowering its fourth quarter sales forecast, \"Reuters\" said the company has  hired JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) to help explore a potential sale.  The company  which has been experiencing weaker demand said it was exiting the drone  business, cutting CEO Nick Woodman's salary to a dollar.  </p><p>Earlier today, Woodman said a potential merger wouldn't be out of the  question.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NICK WOODMAN, GOPRO CEO:  If there are opportunities for us to scale  awareness of GoPro globally by being part of a bigger company, that's  something that we would entertain.  But, of course, we need to run the  business as though we are going to be independent.  And we are planning  accordingly and we're looking forward to benefitting from the improved  sell-through we are seeing on all of our products at their new pricing.   And we're looking forward to profitability in the second half of 2018.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATHISEN:  GoPro shares plunged nearly 13 percent to $6.56.  </p><p>The restaurant and gaming chain Dave and Buster's slashed its full year  profit and sales outlook, after reporting a drop in same store receipts  during the holiday period.  The company said weak foot traffic at the  beginning of the quarter never picked up steam, like it initially  anticipated.  </p><p>Despite the disappointing guidance, Dave and Buster said its new stores are  performing well.  Shares cratered, though, 22 percent.  They finished today  at $43.79.  </p><p>On the flip side, same store sales at Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) rose during the  holiday season as more shoppers visited Kohl's location.  The retailer  expects its offerings will continue to attract shoppers.  It is hiking its  profit outlook for the year.  Shares rose more than 4 percent to $56.90.  </p><p>HERERA:  Tenet healthcare said that it will cut more jobs than planned as  the hospital operator tries to keep a tight lid on costs.  The company now  expects to eliminate 2,000 positions which it says will save Tenet about  $250 million.  Shares were off 3 percent to $14.95.</p><p>Despite reporting solid holiday sales, the discount retailer Five Below saw  its shares pressured after it gave earnings and revenue guidance for the  current quarter that trailed analyst estimates.  Shares were down 7 percent  to $66.95.  </p><p>And the footwear maker Crocs (NASDAQ:CROX) is increasing its fourth quarter  sales and gross margin outlook.  The company also said it expects operating  costs to be relatively flat compared to last year.  Shares of Crocs  (NASDAQ:CROX) finished the day up 8 percent to $13.23.  </p><p>And after the bell, Urban Outfitters (NASDAQ:URBN) reported a smaller than  expected rise in same store sales during the holiday shopping season.  The  shares were initially lower in after-hours trading but finished the regular  session down 1.5 percent to $33.74.  </p><p>HERERA:  And coming up, why one industry just keeps on trucking.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  A failed Atlantic City casino may get a new lease on life.  The  former Revel Casino was purchased by a Colorado developer for about $200  million.  The developer called the acquisition a dream come true.  He plans  to re-open it this summer around the same time the former Trump Taj Mahal  Casino will re-open under the Hard Rock brand.  The former Revel will be  called the Ocean Resort Casino.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, last year was the most expensive on record for natural  disasters.  Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, along with the wild fires that  ravaged the western part of the country, caused more than $300 billion in  total damage.  </p><p>According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the  largest cost came from the hurricanes.  Apart of last year, 2005 was the  most expensive disaster year.  That year, of course, hurricane Katrina  caused more than $200 billion in damage.</p><p>HERERA:  Takata is expanding the largest automotive recall in U.S. history.   The Japanese air bag maker is recalling 3 million more faulty air bag  inflaters.  In total, more than 19 automakers have been affected.  And more  than 42 million vehicles.  Thos recalls and the criminal convictions  against Takata forced that company to file for bankruptcy protection.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Have you noticed more and more trucks on the road?  Well, the  answer is probably yes.  When the economy grows as it has been doing, more  goods need to be transported and that is resulting in a spike in demand for  18-wheelers.  </p><p>Morgan Brennan hits the gas.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  As the economy  keeps on trucking, so too does trucking.  Demand for trucks is  skyrocketing.  And that means higher rates.  Freight exchange service DAT  Solutions says the price for the common kind of truck jumped to $2.11 per  mile in December, up more than 25 percent from the start of 2017, and  marking the highest monthly average rate since at least 2010.  </p><p>Analysts say that could go even higher.  </p><p>DONALD BROUGHTON, BROUGHTON CAPITAL:  It's going to be higher rates for  shippers.  The biggest question of shippers is whether or not they can get  the capacity, because if they're not willing to pay up, they're not going  to get the capacity.  That's just the clear pattern that's being  established right now.  </p><p>For consumers, it means higher prices at the shelf.  It means higher prices  delivered, because they'd been getting a discount on shipping.  And those  days are over, at least for the foreseeable future.  </p><p>BRENNAN:  More manufacturing activity, a robust holiday season, ongoing  rebuild efforts from hurricanes and new regulations are all playing a part.   Last month, a new rule took effect that makes drivers track driver hours  electronically.  That's helping to take trucks off the road and just as  volumes are soaring.  </p><p>The biggest winners are going to be the people that are on the assets, the  XPOs, the FedExes, the Knights, the Werners, the Celadons, the Covenants.   If you own the truck and trailer, then you are in a great position right  now.  </p><p>BRENNAN:  The demand is helping fuel resurgence of vehicle orders,  according to ACT Research.  In December, fleets reserved the most class 8  trucks, the kind used on long haul routes, in a single month in three  years.  That's something that could benefit manufacturers like Navistar,  Daimler and Volvo AB.</p><p>But it's not just trucking either.  Volumes of goods moved by railroad,  barge and plane are all growing.  It's good news for the companies moving  them, but bad news for retailers and other shippers, since stronger demand  also means higher costs.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Morgan Brennan.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I'm Sue Herera.   Thanks for joining us.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  And thanks from me as well.  I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Have a great  evening, everybody and we will see you back here tomorrow.  </p><p>END</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

The S&amp;P 500  and Nasdaq closed at all-time high again.  No wonder more investors ask is  this the greatest bull market of all time?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Smartphone addiction.  Two big  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) investors want the company to do more to prevent  overuse by kids.  But is it Apple's responsibility?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> MATHISEN:  And the long haul.  As the economy keeps on trucking so does the  trucking industry.  </p><p> Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday,  January 8th.  </p><p> HERERA:  Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  </p><p> Stocks extend their 2018 gains.  It wasn't a rip-roaring rally to start the  week, but it was enough to push the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq to new records.   Investors remain upbeat about the economy and confident that it will  continue to pick up steam.  </p><p> So, here are the final numbers.  The Dow pulled back a bit, dropping 12  points to 25,283, the Nasdaq gained 20 and the S&amp;P 500 gained four.  </p><p> With a string of record runs in 2018 getting off to a robust start, some  may start to think that this bull market is shaping up to be one of the  strongest ever.  </p><p> Mike Santoli picks it up from here.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The bull market set  to reach its ninth anniversary in two months is now the second best ever,  which means that investors who expect generous gains from here over the  next couple of years are effectively betting that this bull run can become  the greatest of all time.  </p><p> In terms of market gains, valuation, and the public exposure to stocks,  only the final years of the 1990s surge sit at higher elevations than the  climb that began in March of 2009.  This might sound scary for anyone who  recalls the speculative frenzy of the late '90s market and the wealth  destruction that followed as the tech bubble bursts, but the comforting  news for now is that while today's bull market ranks number two, it's still  quite a distance from the excesses of the one that closed the 20th century.  </p><p> The S&amp;P 500 has gained just over 300 percent from its lows set during the  great financial crisis in early 2009.  That compares to a 580 percent  advance that ran from the 1987 crash to early 2000.  And while stocks are  rather richly valued today, they are not as expensive as at the 2000 peak.  </p><p> Finally, retail investors had nearly 80 percent of their financial assets  in stocks and were feasting on half baked initial public offerings 18 years  ago.  Today, they hold closer to 70 percent in stocks and most popular  investments are sober index funds.  </p><p> All this explains why some optimistic strategists are predicting a more  energetic phase of the bull market as public excitement grows and the new  corporate tax cut offers a fresh story line for further gains atop strong  global growth and a healthy consumer.  It might all sound too good to be  true and it always makes sense to ask what could go wrong when the crowd is  fixated on the good news.  </p><p> For as long as stocks keep clicking to new record highs though, the  comparisons with the greatest ever bull market will only get louder.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Mike Santoli.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MATHISEN:  When investors who focused last year on growth stocks were  richly rewarded.  Large cap growth funds were up nearly 30 percent in 2017  while large cap value funds rose just under 16 percent.  So, will growth  continue to dominate this year or should investors now start to nibble more  in value stocks and mutual funds?  </p><p> Joining us now to discuss that, Kevin Caron.  He's portfolio manager with  Washington Crossing Advisers.  </p><p> Kevin, always good to see you.  </p><p> KEVIN CARON, WASHINGTON CROSSINGS ADVISORS PORTFOLIO MANAGER:  It's good to  be here.</p><p> MATHISEN:  Let's do a little level setting here.  I just love for those who  don't know those terms of art to hear from you the difference is between a  growth stock or fund and a value stock or fund.  What are the distinctions?  </p><p> CARON:  All right.  Well, the growth stocks are companies that trade with  higher multiples, multiples of earnings or multiples of book value and  value is going to be lower.  </p><p> Now, you might say, well, why not always buy the thing that's cheaper and  the difference is, as you might guess it, guess, growth.  So, in the last  year or so, as we've seen growth pick up in the global economy and earnings  grow really pick up for the tech sector in particular, we've seen the  growth investors be more willing to pay higher multiples to own the growth  sectors.  And so, that's why the growth style has, by far, outperformed the  value sector.  </p><p> HERERA:  What do you say to those who say that valuations overall, whether  you're talking about value or growth are still pretty richly valued, no pun  intended?  </p><p> CARON:  Yes.  Well, they are.  And it's not -- it's really across not just  growth and value, but if you look at the overall stock market, it's trading  with a value that is relatively high compared to the underlying economy.   Roughly $28 trillion is the value of the U.S. stock market.  The economy is  $18 trillion.  </p><p> So, by that measure, it's fairly rough and it's fairly rich.  And also,  price to earnings is fairly high overall.  So, they're both fairly high.   And growth in particular is higher.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  So what are you doing in the portfolios that you manage that our  viewers could then maybe extrapolate and apply in their lives?  Are you  paring back your growth allocations and looking at more value companies and  funds?  </p><p> CARON:  Yes.  So, coming into 2018, we have done exactly that.  We have  been overweight growth on prospects of a better growth in the economy.  We  have seen that.  </p><p> But we are getting a little bit concerned about the relative valuation  between growth and value.  So, we have trimmed back the growth allocation  from overweight to neutral and we've lifted our value weighting from  underweight to neutral, citing better relative valuations for the value  sectors.  </p><p> HERERA:  How do you feel about the economy overall because that's basically  what's going to continue to drive stocks?</p><p> CARON:  Really solid.  There is little in the data that concerns us here.   The earnings are growing nicely.  The employment data seems to be fairly  good.  And the overall outlook for inflation and interest rates is  relatively benign.  </p><p> So, there is nothing in the immediate data that concerns us.  And we would  assume the near-term outlook for recession, for example, would relatively  low and encourage us to remain overweight equities overall compared to  bonds.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  All right.  Kevin, thanks very much.  She's the last guy there  tonight.  Go home.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MATHISEN:  Kevin Caron with Washington Crossings Advisers.</p><p> CARON:  Thank you.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Good to see you.  </p><p> HERERA:  In Washington, the treasury secretary has reportedly asked  Congress to lift the federal government's debt ceiling by February 28th.   That's according to \"Bloomberg\".  The treasury will exhaust all of its  borrowing options and run out of cash to pay its bills by late March or  early April if Congress doesn't raise its borrowing authority.  The  treasury secretary, Mr. Mnuchin, has said repeatedly that he would prefer  the debt limit raised well before the government faces a potential default.</p><p> MATHISEN:  Dow component Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) will fault research into  Alzheimer's and Parkinson's treatments.  The drug maker says the decision  reallocates money into other areas.  Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) had made big  investments into neuro degenerative diseases.  They faced some setbacks  recently.  There is no known cure for either Alzheimer or Parkinson's.  </p><p> Separately, the bio tech company Axovant will no longer develop a dementia  drug because that drug failed to meet certain goals in recent studies.</p><p> Shares of both Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and Axovant fell, with Axovant, a small  cap stock, seeing its value more than halved.  </p><p> HERERA:  That was just one of the very hot topics discussed at the biggest  health care event of the year.  </p><p> Meg Tirrell spoke to a number of industry CEOs at the JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)  health care conference, and that's in San Francisco.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MEG TIRRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  A rainy day of weather  kicked off the annual J.P. Morgan health care conference in San Francisco.   It's the year's biggest event for health care investing, where more than  450 companies present over four days to more than 9,000 attendees.  </p><p> It's always a big conference for deal news and this year, we did get a deal  from Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG).  It's spending $1.1 billion to acquire cancer  drug maker Impact Biomedicine, gaining a drug for a rare form of bone  marrow cancer.  </p><p> We talked to CEO Mark Alles about that at the conference.  </p><p> MARK ALLES, CELGENE CEO:  Well, first of all, it's a hematology play.  And  our DNA at Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) is hematology.  Second, it's a highly  unmet medical need.  Myelofibrosis is a rare cancer but at the same time,  until now, there's been only one FDA approved drug ever for the disease.  </p><p> TIRRELL:  Following the deal, though, biotech stocks were under pressure as  some may have hoped for Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) or others to do bigger deals  in the space.  Many wondering if the U.S. tax overhaul would spur M&amp;A.  </p><p> We talked to Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) CEO Dave Ricks about the impacts of tax  reform.  </p><p> DAVE RICKS, ELI LILLY CEO:  We're worried about the lopsided nature of  foreign competitors with better tax competitors than we did.  That's now  addressed.  I think strategically that's the most important thing that came  out of this tax reform.  </p><p> It will allow us also to invest without thinking about the tax rate so  much.  But rather put plants and labs where it makes sense, where the  talent is and where the markets serving are.  So, overall, it was a  successful package from a pharmaceutical sector.  </p><p> TIRRELL:  Other topics on discussion this week have been drug pricing.  It  was, of course, during this week last year that President-elect Donald  Trump made his comment that the industry is, quote, getting away with  murder when it comes to its pricing policy.  And as companies were updating  on their drug pipelines and other aspects of their businesses, there was  another issue on display, that of gender diversity.  According to a recent  effort from STAT News, of the more than 450 companies presenting here at  the conference, only 20 have women CEOs presenting.  That compares with 22  presenters at the conference named Michael.  </p><p> We talked with one of those women CEOs earlier.  </p><p> KATRINE BOSLEY, EDITAS MEDICINE CEO:  If you look at the senior team,  within the company, vice president and above, over half of our team members  are women.  But it's not just about gender.  I think it's a broader  question of diversity because making experimental medicines and advancing  them is tough and having diversity is a strength and part of what's going  to make us successful.  </p><p> TIRRELL:  Something for the industry to work on in 2018.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Meg Tirrell in San Francisco.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MATHISEN:  Well, there's also been a big push by Silicon Valley to move  into the very large and very lucrative health care industry.  </p><p> Deirdre Bosa has that angle tonight.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> DEIRDRE BOSA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  This year, more than  20 million Americans are predicted to be using smart watches.  Many of them  will be using them for more than just telling the time.  They will be  tracking how many steps taken, how many calories burned and resting heart  rate.  </p><p> But could a smart watch one day save your life?  </p><p> Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is trying to find out.  The tech giant is teaming up  with Stanford medicine for a first of its kind research study that will use  the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) watch to detect irregular heart rhythms that could  lead to a stroke.  </p><p> And it's not just Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  Other big tech companies like  Alphabet, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) are getting  involved in efforts to remake the health care industry.  </p><p> A few reasons tech is moving into the space.  One, it is $3 trillion  industry in the United States.  Two, it's ripe for innovation and  disruption.  And three, these companies know consumers and they  increasingly have the scale, data and reach to deliver.  </p><p> In recent years, their involvement in the health care industry has surged.   According to CB Insights participation in health care equity deals by the  10 largest U.S. tech companies has increased ten-fold in the last five  years to nearly $3 billion last year.  </p><p> Some of those deals include Amazon's participation in a financing round for  Grail, a cancer detection startup.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) acquired sleep  tracking company Beddit and Alphabet bought Senosis, a health monitoring  start-up.  </p><p> Their efforts are much bigger than just those deals.  Alphabet has been  expanding verily, its unit dedicated to life sciences.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)  has health kit, while Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is quietly moving in for the  moment and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is making it easier for pharma companies to  advertise.  Increasingly, health care executives themselves are thinking  about disruption and innovation in terms of technology.  Biogen CEO says  the biotech industry needs to take the lead in changes and be what he calls  the Tesla of the industry and set new models.  </p><p> MICHAEL VOUNATSOS, BIOGEN CEO:  We need to bring this industry closer to  the consumer, closer to the patients.  We are meant to provide support to  the patient who is sick, not to take advantage of those.  </p><p> BOSA:  Meanwhile, some analysts say the road ahead for tech and health care  won't be without bumps as they learn to understand regulatory procedures  and patient/clinician relationships.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Deirdre Bosa, San Francisco.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  Still ahead, screen time.  Should Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) do more to  curb growing smart phone addiction among kids?</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> MATHISEN:  Two prominent Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shareholders made an unusual  request.  They're pressuring the company on a social responsibility issue  not a corporate one.  The focus is on children and whether the company  should do more to fight smartphone addiction in kids.  </p><p> Josh Lipton has the story.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Believe it or not, the  average American teenager got his first phone before he was a teen at  roughly 10 years old.  And that teenager today currently spends nearly five  hours a day on it.  And that doesn't even include taking and texting.  </p><p> Jana Partners and CalSTRS, two Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shareholders who own a  combined $2 billion of the company shares are concerned, citing that data  in a letter they sent the iPhone maker over the weekend.  The shareholders  are worried that the iPhone could hurt children, saying: As one of the most  innovative companies in the history of technology, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) can  play a defining role in signaling to the industry that paying special  attention to the health and development of the next generation is both good  business and the right thing to do.  </p><p> They point to alarming data that children are increasingly distracted by  digital devices in the classroom and that teenagers who spend too much time  on such devices are at higher risk of depression and even suicide.  </p><p> One of the researchers cited in the letter says children and their parents  would benefit if they weren't overusing the devices.  </p><p> JEAN TWENGE, SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY:  For Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in  particular, they make their profit when someone buys the device and owns  it.  It doesn't matter how often they use it.  And what the research shows  is for teens, the happiest teens are those who have the phones but use them  about an hour, maybe two hours a day.  It's beyond that when issues start  to show up.  </p><p> LIPTON:  The shareholders want Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to convene a panel of  experts to study the issue, partner with experts to conduct further  research and offer parents new tools and options.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) does  already offers parents help.  They can take an active role in restricting  the apps and features that their children use on these devices.  </p><p> Some might counter that the responsibility isn't ultimately with phone  manufacturers but with their parents.  And that's often the social media  apps like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Snapchat where young people spend their  time, but Jana and CalSTRS say that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) can do more and  argue that addressing the issue today will boost the long-term value for  all shareholders by creating more choices and options for customers.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Josh Lipton, San Francisco.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  As Josh mentioned in his report, today's typical teenager may  spend nearly five hours a day glued to that smartphone and that lack of  face to face time could be detrimental to a young person's well-being.  </p><p> So, is it the responsibility of companies to educate parents on the risk  associated with their products and services?  </p><p> Here to talk about that is Dan Eaton (NYSE:ETN).  He's a business ethics  instructor at the Fowler College of Business at San Diego State University.  </p><p> Welcome.  Nice to have you here.  </p><p> DAN EATON, SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY'S BUSINESS ETHICS INSTRUCTOR:  Good  to be with you.  </p><p> HERERA:  So, what do you think about the basic premise that we put forward?   What is the responsibility of a company like an Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or  another smartphone maker to the customer and the customer's parents?  </p><p> EATON:  Well, the responsibility of any company is to make sure that  consumers are sufficiently well-informed of the risks that come from using  their products.  So, when you talk about whether it's a responsibility of  the company on the one hand, or the end user or the parents on the other,  the answer is, well, yes, it's the responsibility of both.  </p><p> And it's really good business.  It's good for the bottom line.  This is not  entirely about corporate social responsibility.  It's also about protecting  shareholder value, which is why two big shareholders with $2 billion  invested in this company want pro-action now.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  You know, it's interesting that these shareholders who happen to  be Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shareholders have gone to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  It  could be Samsung.  It could be another manufacturer, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)  or whomever.  </p><p> What they seem to be calling for is, as you say, a more proactive position  on the part of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  Potentially to come up with wrinkles  or products that they put on the phone that make it easier for parents to  limit or monitor both the time or the ways -- and there are products out  there, but they are not -- Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) already does some of it, but  they are not as easy to use as these people are calling for.  </p><p> EATON:  And it doesn't seem to take anything away from Apple's bottom line  to make them easier to use.  The bottom line is that there is no defeat  device that is going to override the insistence of a teenager, period.  The  bottom line is --  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Well, you can say that again.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> HERERA:  We both got kids that use them.  We know what you are talking  about.  </p><p> EATON:  But that said, it is sometimes the responsibility of these  companies to make it easier for parents to exercise that control.  </p><p> Barbara Booth (ph), our strategic editor, has an excellent piece on  CNBC.com about the things parents ought to do.  It's with them that the  ultimate responsibility rests.  But companies can do more and they should  do more, because it is good business.  </p><p> This is not just about saving the world.  It's about protecting a  vulnerable population which is children and it's about giving parents a  tool to do their ultimate job better.  </p><p> HERERA:  Do you think most parents are even aware of how much time their  kids spend on a phone and would they be more proactive if they realized it  or how integral the device is to their daily life?  </p><p> EATON:  They are probably not aware, but they're going to be more aware now  having watched this segment.  And the bottom line is that allowing this  kind of device which controls the amount of time will enable them to place  those controls regardless of how much they know about their own children's  usage.  </p><p> There was a report in the package that you just ran that children are  happiest when they only use it about an hour or two on the devices.  And  this technology will enable parents to ensure their children are as happy  as they can be without getting addicted.  </p><p> I mean, the piece that Barbara Booth ran talked about what's referred to as  digital heroin.  That's scary.  And it's better to take steps now to avoid  that kind of thing that to let it get out of control with the reputational  risks that are going to ultimately to jeopardize these two investors'  financial stake in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  </p><p> HERERA:  Dan, thank you so much.  Appreciate it.  We are all jealous that  you're out in San Diego and we're not.  Thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p> EATON:  And yet it's raining here.  So --  </p><p> HERERA:  OK.  There you go.  </p><p> Dan Eaton (NYSE:ETN) with San Diego State University.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Well, GoPro may be open to selling itself, and that is where we  begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".</p><p> Just hours after the wearable camera maker said it was cutting jobs  lowering its fourth quarter sales forecast, \"Reuters\" said the company has  hired JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) to help explore a potential sale.  The company  which has been experiencing weaker demand said it was exiting the drone  business, cutting CEO Nick Woodman's salary to a dollar.  </p><p> Earlier today, Woodman said a potential merger wouldn't be out of the  question.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> NICK WOODMAN, GOPRO CEO:  If there are opportunities for us to scale  awareness of GoPro globally by being part of a bigger company, that's  something that we would entertain.  But, of course, we need to run the  business as though we are going to be independent.  And we are planning  accordingly and we're looking forward to benefitting from the improved  sell-through we are seeing on all of our products at their new pricing.   And we're looking forward to profitability in the second half of 2018.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MATHISEN:  GoPro shares plunged nearly 13 percent to $6.56.  </p><p> The restaurant and gaming chain Dave and Buster's slashed its full year  profit and sales outlook, after reporting a drop in same store receipts  during the holiday period.  The company said weak foot traffic at the  beginning of the quarter never picked up steam, like it initially  anticipated.  </p><p> Despite the disappointing guidance, Dave and Buster said its new stores are  performing well.  Shares cratered, though, 22 percent.  They finished today  at $43.79.  </p><p> On the flip side, same store sales at Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) rose during the  holiday season as more shoppers visited Kohl's location.  The retailer  expects its offerings will continue to attract shoppers.  It is hiking its  profit outlook for the year.  Shares rose more than 4 percent to $56.90.  </p><p> HERERA:  Tenet healthcare said that it will cut more jobs than planned as  the hospital operator tries to keep a tight lid on costs.  The company now  expects to eliminate 2,000 positions which it says will save Tenet about  $250 million.  Shares were off 3 percent to $14.95.</p><p> Despite reporting solid holiday sales, the discount retailer Five Below saw  its shares pressured after it gave earnings and revenue guidance for the  current quarter that trailed analyst estimates.  Shares were down 7 percent  to $66.95.  </p><p> And the footwear maker Crocs (NASDAQ:CROX) is increasing its fourth quarter  sales and gross margin outlook.  The company also said it expects operating  costs to be relatively flat compared to last year.  Shares of Crocs  (NASDAQ:CROX) finished the day up 8 percent to $13.23.  </p><p> And after the bell, Urban Outfitters (NASDAQ:URBN) reported a smaller than  expected rise in same store sales during the holiday shopping season.  The  shares were initially lower in after-hours trading but finished the regular  session down 1.5 percent to $33.74.  </p><p> HERERA:  And coming up, why one industry just keeps on trucking.  </p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> HERERA:  A failed Atlantic City casino may get a new lease on life.  The  former Revel Casino was purchased by a Colorado developer for about $200  million.  The developer called the acquisition a dream come true.  He plans  to re-open it this summer around the same time the former Trump Taj Mahal  Casino will re-open under the Hard Rock brand.  The former Revel will be  called the Ocean Resort Casino.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Well, last year was the most expensive on record for natural  disasters.  Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, along with the wild fires that  ravaged the western part of the country, caused more than $300 billion in  total damage.  </p><p> According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the  largest cost came from the hurricanes.  Apart of last year, 2005 was the  most expensive disaster year.  That year, of course, hurricane Katrina  caused more than $200 billion in damage.</p><p> HERERA:  Takata is expanding the largest automotive recall in U.S. history.   The Japanese air bag maker is recalling 3 million more faulty air bag  inflaters.  In total, more than 19 automakers have been affected.  And more  than 42 million vehicles.  Thos recalls and the criminal convictions  against Takata forced that company to file for bankruptcy protection.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Have you noticed more and more trucks on the road?  Well, the  answer is probably yes.  When the economy grows as it has been doing, more  goods need to be transported and that is resulting in a spike in demand for  18-wheelers.  </p><p> Morgan Brennan hits the gas.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  As the economy  keeps on trucking, so too does trucking.  Demand for trucks is  skyrocketing.  And that means higher rates.  Freight exchange service DAT  Solutions says the price for the common kind of truck jumped to $2.11 per  mile in December, up more than 25 percent from the start of 2017, and  marking the highest monthly average rate since at least 2010.  </p><p> Analysts say that could go even higher.  </p><p> DONALD BROUGHTON, BROUGHTON CAPITAL:  It's going to be higher rates for  shippers.  The biggest question of shippers is whether or not they can get  the capacity, because if they're not willing to pay up, they're not going  to get the capacity.  That's just the clear pattern that's being  established right now.  </p><p> For consumers, it means higher prices at the shelf.  It means higher prices  delivered, because they'd been getting a discount on shipping.  And those  days are over, at least for the foreseeable future.  </p><p> BRENNAN:  More manufacturing activity, a robust holiday season, ongoing  rebuild efforts from hurricanes and new regulations are all playing a part.   Last month, a new rule took effect that makes drivers track driver hours  electronically.  That's helping to take trucks off the road and just as  volumes are soaring.  </p><p> The biggest winners are going to be the people that are on the assets, the  XPOs, the FedExes, the Knights, the Werners, the Celadons, the Covenants.   If you own the truck and trailer, then you are in a great position right  now.  </p><p> BRENNAN:  The demand is helping fuel resurgence of vehicle orders,  according to ACT Research.  In December, fleets reserved the most class 8  trucks, the kind used on long haul routes, in a single month in three  years.  That's something that could benefit manufacturers like Navistar,  Daimler and Volvo AB.</p><p> But it's not just trucking either.  Volumes of goods moved by railroad,  barge and plane are all growing.  It's good news for the companies moving  them, but bad news for retailers and other shippers, since stronger demand  also means higher costs.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Morgan Brennan.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I'm Sue Herera.   Thanks for joining us.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  And thanks from me as well.  I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Have a great  evening, everybody and we will see you back here tomorrow.  </p><p> END</p><p> END</p><p> Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq closed at all-time high again. No wonder more investors ask is this the greatest bull market of all time?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Smartphone addiction. Two big Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) investors want the company to do more to prevent overuse by kids. But is it Apple`s responsibility?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MATHISEN: And the long haul. As the economy keeps on trucking so does the trucking industry.</p><p>Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday, January 8th.</p><p>HERERA: Good evening, everyone, and welcome.</p><p>Stocks extend their 2018 gains. It wasn`t a rip-roaring rally to start the week, but it was enough to push the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq to new records. Investors remain upbeat about the economy and confident that it will continue to pick up steam.</p><p>So, here are the final numbers. The Dow pulled back a bit, dropping 12 points to 25,283, the Nasdaq gained 20 and the S&amp;P 500 gained four.</p><p>With a string of record runs in 2018 getting off to a robust start, some may start to think that this bull market is shaping up to be one of the strongest ever.</p><p>Mike Santoli picks it up from here.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The bull market set to reach its ninth anniversary in two months is now the second best ever, which means that investors who expect generous gains from here over the next couple of years are effectively betting that this bull run can become the greatest of all time.</p><p>In terms of market gains, valuation, and the public exposure to stocks, only the final years of the 1990s surge sit at higher elevations than the climb that began in March of 2009. This might sound scary for anyone who recalls the speculative frenzy of the late `90s market and the wealth destruction that followed as the tech bubble bursts, but the comforting news for now is that while today`s bull market ranks number two, it`s still quite a distance from the excesses of the one that closed the 20th century.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 has gained just over 300 percent from its lows set during the great financial crisis in early 2009. That compares to a 580 percent advance that ran from the 1987 crash to early 2000. And while stocks are rather richly valued today, they are not as expensive as at the 2000 peak.</p><p>Finally, retail investors had nearly 80 percent of their financial assets in stocks and were feasting on half baked initial public offerings 18 years ago. Today, they hold closer to 70 percent in stocks and most popular investments are sober index funds.</p><p>All this explains why some optimistic strategists are predicting a more energetic phase of the bull market as public excitement grows and the new corporate tax cut offers a fresh story line for further gains atop strong global growth and a healthy consumer. It might all sound too good to be true and it always makes sense to ask what could go wrong when the crowd is fixated on the good news.</p><p>For as long as stocks keep clicking to new record highs though, the comparisons with the greatest ever bull market will only get louder.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Mike Santoli.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: When investors who focused last year on growth stocks were richly rewarded. Large cap growth funds were up nearly 30 percent in 2017 while large cap value funds rose just under 16 percent. So, will growth continue to dominate this year or should investors now start to nibble more in value stocks and mutual funds?</p><p>Joining us now to discuss that, Kevin Caron. He`s portfolio manager with Washington Crossing Advisers.</p><p>Kevin, always good to see you.</p><p>KEVIN CARON, WASHINGTON CROSSINGS ADVISORS PORTFOLIO MANAGER: It`s good to be here.</p><p>MATHISEN: Let`s do a little level setting here. I just love for those who don`t know those terms of art to hear from you the difference is between a growth stock or fund and a value stock or fund. What are the distinctions?</p><p>CARON: All right. Well, the growth stocks are companies that trade with higher multiples, multiples of earnings or multiples of book value and value is going to be lower.</p><p>Now, you might say, well, why not always buy the thing that`s cheaper and the difference is, as you might guess it, guess, growth. So, in the last year or so, as we`ve seen growth pick up in the global economy and earnings grow really pick up for the tech sector in particular, we`ve seen the growth investors be more willing to pay higher multiples to own the growth sectors. And so, that`s why the growth style has, by far, outperformed the value sector.</p><p>HERERA: What do you say to those who say that valuations overall, whether you`re talking about value or growth are still pretty richly valued, no pun intended?</p><p>CARON: Yes. Well, they are. And it`s not -- it`s really across not just growth and value, but if you look at the overall stock market, it`s trading with a value that is relatively high compared to the underlying economy. Roughly $28 trillion is the value of the U.S. stock market. The economy is $18 trillion.</p><p>So, by that measure, it`s fairly rough and it`s fairly rich. And also, price to earnings is fairly high overall. So, they`re both fairly high. And growth in particular is higher.</p><p>MATHISEN: So what are you doing in the portfolios that you manage that our viewers could then maybe extrapolate and apply in their lives? Are you paring back your growth allocations and looking at more value companies and funds?</p><p>CARON: Yes. So, coming into 2018, we have done exactly that. We have been overweight growth on prospects of a better growth in the economy. We have seen that.</p><p>But we are getting a little bit concerned about the relative valuation between growth and value. So, we have trimmed back the growth allocation from overweight to neutral and we`ve lifted our value weighting from underweight to neutral, citing better relative valuations for the value sectors.</p><p>HERERA: How do you feel about the economy overall because that`s basically what`s going to continue to drive stocks?</p><p>CARON: Really solid. There is little in the data that concerns us here. The earnings are growing nicely. The employment data seems to be fairly good. And the overall outlook for inflation and interest rates is relatively benign.</p><p>So, there is nothing in the immediate data that concerns us. And we would assume the near-term outlook for recession, for example, would relatively low and encourage us to remain overweight equities overall compared to bonds.</p><p>MATHISEN: All right. Kevin, thanks very much. She`s the last guy there tonight. Go home.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MATHISEN: Kevin Caron with Washington Crossings Advisers.</p><p>CARON: Thank you.</p><p>MATHISEN: Good to see you.</p><p>HERERA: In Washington, the treasury secretary has reportedly asked Congress to lift the federal government`s debt ceiling by February 28th. That`s according to \"Bloomberg\". The treasury will exhaust all of its borrowing options and run out of cash to pay its bills by late March or early April if Congress doesn`t raise its borrowing authority. The treasury secretary, Mr. Mnuchin, has said repeatedly that he would prefer the debt limit raised well before the government faces a potential default.</p><p>MATHISEN: Dow component Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) will fault research into Alzheimer`s and Parkinson`s treatments. The drug maker says the decision reallocates money into other areas. Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) had made big investments into neuro degenerative diseases. They faced some setbacks recently. There is no known cure for either Alzheimer or Parkinson`s.</p><p>Separately, the bio tech company Axovant will no longer develop a dementia drug because that drug failed to meet certain goals in recent studies.</p><p>Shares of both Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and Axovant fell, with Axovant, a small cap stock, seeing its value more than halved.</p><p>HERERA: That was just one of the very hot topics discussed at the biggest health care event of the year.</p><p>Meg Tirrell spoke to a number of industry CEOs at the JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) health care conference, and that`s in San Francisco.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MEG TIRRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: A rainy day of weather kicked off the annual J.P. Morgan health care conference in San Francisco. It`s the year`s biggest event for health care investing, where more than 450 companies present over four days to more than 9,000 attendees.</p><p>It`s always a big conference for deal news and this year, we did get a deal from Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG). It`s spending $1.1 billion to acquire cancer drug maker Impact Biomedicine, gaining a drug for a rare form of bone marrow cancer.</p><p>We talked to CEO Mark Alles about that at the conference.</p><p>MARK ALLES, CELGENE CEO: Well, first of all, it`s a hematology play. And our DNA at Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) is hematology. Second, it`s a highly unmet medical need. Myelofibrosis is a rare cancer but at the same time, until now, there`s been only one FDA approved drug ever for the disease.</p><p>TIRRELL: Following the deal, though, biotech stocks were under pressure as some may have hoped for Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) or others to do bigger deals in the space. Many wondering if the U.S. tax overhaul would spur M&amp;A.</p><p>We talked to Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) CEO Dave Ricks about the impacts of tax reform.</p><p>DAVE RICKS, ELI LILLY CEO: We`re worried about the lopsided nature of foreign competitors with better tax competitors than we did. That`s now addressed. I think strategically that`s the most important thing that came out of this tax reform.</p><p>It will allow us also to invest without thinking about the tax rate so much. But rather put plants and labs where it makes sense, where the talent is and where the markets serving are. So, overall, it was a successful package from a pharmaceutical sector.</p><p>TIRRELL: Other topics on discussion this week have been drug pricing. It was, of course, during this week last year that President-elect Donald Trump made his comment that the industry is, quote, getting away with murder when it comes to its pricing policy. And as companies were updating on their drug pipelines and other aspects of their businesses, there was another issue on display, that of gender diversity. According to a recent effort from STAT News, of the more than 450 companies presenting here at the conference, only 20 have women CEOs presenting. That compares with 22 presenters at the conference named Michael.</p><p>We talked with one of those women CEOs earlier.</p><p>KATRINE BOSLEY, EDITAS MEDICINE CEO: If you look at the senior team, within the company, vice president and above, over half of our team members are women. But it`s not just about gender. I think it`s a broader question of diversity because making experimental medicines and advancing them is tough and having diversity is a strength and part of what`s going to make us successful.</p><p>TIRRELL: Something for the industry to work on in 2018.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Meg Tirrell in San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Well, there`s also been a big push by Silicon Valley to move into the very large and very lucrative health care industry.</p><p>Deirdre Bosa has that angle tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DEIRDRE BOSA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: This year, more than 20 million Americans are predicted to be using smart watches. Many of them will be using them for more than just telling the time. They will be tracking how many steps taken, how many calories burned and resting heart rate.</p><p>But could a smart watch one day save your life?</p><p>Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is trying to find out. The tech giant is teaming up with Stanford medicine for a first of its kind research study that will use the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) watch to detect irregular heart rhythms that could lead to a stroke.</p><p>And it`s not just Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Other big tech companies like Alphabet, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) are getting involved in efforts to remake the health care industry.</p><p>A few reasons tech is moving into the space. One, it is $3 trillion industry in the United States. Two, it`s ripe for innovation and disruption. And three, these companies know consumers and they increasingly have the scale, data and reach to deliver.</p><p>In recent years, their involvement in the health care industry has surged. According to CB Insights participation in health care equity deals by the 10 largest U.S. tech companies has increased ten-fold in the last five years to nearly $3 billion last year.</p><p>Some of those deals include Amazon`s participation in a financing round for Grail, a cancer detection startup. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) acquired sleep tracking company Beddit and Alphabet bought Senosis, a health monitoring start-up.</p><p>Their efforts are much bigger than just those deals. Alphabet has been expanding verily, its unit dedicated to life sciences. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has health kit, while Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is quietly moving in for the moment and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is making it easier for pharma companies to advertise. Increasingly, health care executives themselves are thinking about disruption and innovation in terms of technology. Biogen CEO says the biotech industry needs to take the lead in changes and be what he calls the Tesla of the industry and set new models.</p><p>MICHAEL VOUNATSOS, BIOGEN CEO: We need to bring this industry closer to the consumer, closer to the patients. We are meant to provide support to the patient who is sick, not to take advantage of those.</p><p>BOSA: Meanwhile, some analysts say the road ahead for tech and health care won`t be without bumps as they learn to understand regulatory procedures and patient/clinician relationships.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Deirdre Bosa, San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Still ahead, screen time. Should Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) do more to curb growing smart phone addiction among kids?</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN: Two prominent Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shareholders made an unusual request. They`re pressuring the company on a social responsibility issue not a corporate one. The focus is on children and whether the company should do more to fight smartphone addiction in kids.</p><p>Josh Lipton has the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Believe it or not, the average American teenager got his first phone before he was a teen at roughly 10 years old. And that teenager today currently spends nearly five hours a day on it. And that doesn`t even include taking and texting.</p><p>Jana Partners and CalSTRS, two Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shareholders who own a combined $2 billion of the company shares are concerned, citing that data in a letter they sent the iPhone maker over the weekend. The shareholders are worried that the iPhone could hurt children, saying: As one of the most innovative companies in the history of technology, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) can play a defining role in signaling to the industry that paying special attention to the health and development of the next generation is both good business and the right thing to do.</p><p>They point to alarming data that children are increasingly distracted by digital devices in the classroom and that teenagers who spend too much time on such devices are at higher risk of depression and even suicide.</p><p>One of the researchers cited in the letter says children and their parents would benefit if they weren`t overusing the devices.</p><p>JEAN TWENGE, SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY: For Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in particular, they make their profit when someone buys the device and owns it. It doesn`t matter how often they use it. And what the research shows is for teens, the happiest teens are those who have the phones but use them about an hour, maybe two hours a day. It`s beyond that when issues start to show up.</p><p>LIPTON: The shareholders want Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to convene a panel of experts to study the issue, partner with experts to conduct further research and offer parents new tools and options. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) does already offers parents help. They can take an active role in restricting the apps and features that their children use on these devices.</p><p>Some might counter that the responsibility isn`t ultimately with phone manufacturers but with their parents. And that`s often the social media apps like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Snapchat where young people spend their time, but Jana and CalSTRS say that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) can do more and argue that addressing the issue today will boost the long-term value for all shareholders by creating more choices and options for customers.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Josh Lipton, San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: As Josh mentioned in his report, today`s typical teenager may spend nearly five hours a day glued to that smartphone and that lack of face to face time could be detrimental to a young person`s well-being.</p><p>So, is it the responsibility of companies to educate parents on the risk associated with their products and services?</p><p>Here to talk about that is Dan Eaton (NYSE:ETN). He`s a business ethics instructor at the Fowler College of Business at San Diego State University.</p><p>Welcome. Nice to have you here.</p><p>DAN EATON, SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY`S BUSINESS ETHICS INSTRUCTOR: Good to be with you.</p><p>HERERA: So, what do you think about the basic premise that we put forward? What is the responsibility of a company like an Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or another smartphone maker to the customer and the customer`s parents?</p><p>EATON: Well, the responsibility of any company is to make sure that consumers are sufficiently well-informed of the risks that come from using their products. So, when you talk about whether it`s a responsibility of the company on the one hand, or the end user or the parents on the other, the answer is, well, yes, it`s the responsibility of both.</p><p>And it`s really good business. It`s good for the bottom line. This is not entirely about corporate social responsibility. It`s also about protecting shareholder value, which is why two big shareholders with $2 billion invested in this company want pro-action now.</p><p>MATHISEN: You know, it`s interesting that these shareholders who happen to be Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shareholders have gone to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). It could be Samsung. It could be another manufacturer, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) or whomever.</p><p>What they seem to be calling for is, as you say, a more proactive position on the part of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Potentially to come up with wrinkles or products that they put on the phone that make it easier for parents to limit or monitor both the time or the ways -- and there are products out there, but they are not -- Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) already does some of it, but they are not as easy to use as these people are calling for.</p><p>EATON: And it doesn`t seem to take anything away from Apple`s bottom line to make them easier to use. The bottom line is that there is no defeat device that is going to override the insistence of a teenager, period. The bottom line is --</p><p>MATHISEN: Well, you can say that again.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HERERA: We both got kids that use them. We know what you are talking about.</p><p>EATON: But that said, it is sometimes the responsibility of these companies to make it easier for parents to exercise that control.</p><p>Barbara Booth (ph), our strategic editor, has an excellent piece on CNBC.com about the things parents ought to do. It`s with them that the ultimate responsibility rests. But companies can do more and they should do more, because it is good business.</p><p>This is not just about saving the world. It`s about protecting a vulnerable population which is children and it`s about giving parents a tool to do their ultimate job better.</p><p>HERERA: Do you think most parents are even aware of how much time their kids spend on a phone and would they be more proactive if they realized it or how integral the device is to their daily life?</p><p>EATON: They are probably not aware, but they`re going to be more aware now having watched this segment. And the bottom line is that allowing this kind of device which controls the amount of time will enable them to place those controls regardless of how much they know about their own children`s usage.</p><p>There was a report in the package that you just ran that children are happiest when they only use it about an hour or two on the devices. And this technology will enable parents to ensure their children are as happy as they can be without getting addicted.</p><p>I mean, the piece that Barbara Booth ran talked about what`s referred to as digital heroin. That`s scary. And it`s better to take steps now to avoid that kind of thing that to let it get out of control with the reputational risks that are going to ultimately to jeopardize these two investors` financial stake in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).</p><p>HERERA: Dan, thank you so much. Appreciate it. We are all jealous that you`re out in San Diego and we`re not. Thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>EATON: And yet it`s raining here. So --</p><p>HERERA: OK. There you go.</p><p>Dan Eaton (NYSE:ETN) with San Diego State University.</p><p>MATHISEN: Well, GoPro may be open to selling itself, and that is where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>Just hours after the wearable camera maker said it was cutting jobs lowering its fourth quarter sales forecast, \"Reuters\" said the company has hired JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) to help explore a potential sale. The company which has been experiencing weaker demand said it was exiting the drone business, cutting CEO Nick Woodman`s salary to a dollar.</p><p>Earlier today, Woodman said a potential merger wouldn`t be out of the question.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NICK WOODMAN, GOPRO CEO: If there are opportunities for us to scale awareness of GoPro globally by being part of a bigger company, that`s something that we would entertain. But, of course, we need to run the business as though we are going to be independent. And we are planning accordingly and we`re looking forward to benefitting from the improved sell-through we are seeing on all of our products at their new pricing. And we`re looking forward to profitability in the second half of 2018.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATHISEN: GoPro shares plunged nearly 13 percent to $6.56.</p><p>The restaurant and gaming chain Dave and Buster`s slashed its full year profit and sales outlook, after reporting a drop in same store receipts during the holiday period. The company said weak foot traffic at the beginning of the quarter never picked up steam, like it initially anticipated.</p><p>Despite the disappointing guidance, Dave and Buster said its new stores are performing well. Shares cratered, though, 22 percent. They finished today at $43.79.</p><p>On the flip side, same store sales at Kohl`s (NYSE:KSS) rose during the holiday season as more shoppers visited Kohl`s location. The retailer expects its offerings will continue to attract shoppers. It is hiking its profit outlook for the year. Shares rose more than 4 percent to $56.90.</p><p>HERERA: Tenet healthcare said that it will cut more jobs than planned as the hospital operator tries to keep a tight lid on costs. The company now expects to eliminate 2,000 positions which it says will save Tenet about $250 million. Shares were off 3 percent to $14.95.</p><p>Despite reporting solid holiday sales, the discount retailer Five Below saw its shares pressured after it gave earnings and revenue guidance for the current quarter that trailed analyst estimates. Shares were down 7 percent to $66.95.</p><p>And the footwear maker Crocs (NASDAQ:CROX) is increasing its fourth quarter sales and gross margin outlook. The company also said it expects operating costs to be relatively flat compared to last year. Shares of Crocs (NASDAQ:CROX) finished the day up 8 percent to $13.23.</p><p>And after the bell, Urban Outfitters (NASDAQ:URBN) reported a smaller than expected rise in same store sales during the holiday shopping season. The shares were initially lower in after-hours trading but finished the regular session down 1.5 percent to $33.74.</p><p>HERERA: And coming up, why one industry just keeps on trucking.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: A failed Atlantic City casino may get a new lease on life. The former Revel Casino was purchased by a Colorado developer for about $200 million. The developer called the acquisition a dream come true. He plans to re-open it this summer around the same time the former Trump Taj Mahal Casino will re-open under the Hard Rock brand. The former Revel will be called the Ocean Resort Casino.</p><p>MATHISEN: Well, last year was the most expensive on record for natural disasters. Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, along with the wild fires that ravaged the western part of the country, caused more than $300 billion in total damage.</p><p>According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the largest cost came from the hurricanes. Apart of last year, 2005 was the most expensive disaster year. That year, of course, hurricane Katrina caused more than $200 billion in damage.</p><p>HERERA: Takata is expanding the largest automotive recall in U.S. history. The Japanese air bag maker is recalling 3 million more faulty air bag inflaters. In total, more than 19 automakers have been affected. And more than 42 million vehicles. Thos recalls and the criminal convictions against Takata forced that company to file for bankruptcy protection.</p><p>MATHISEN: Have you noticed more and more trucks on the road? Well, the answer is probably yes. When the economy grows as it has been doing, more goods need to be transported and that is resulting in a spike in demand for 18-wheelers.</p><p>Morgan Brennan hits the gas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: As the economy keeps on trucking, so too does trucking. Demand for trucks is skyrocketing. And that means higher rates. Freight exchange service DAT Solutions says the price for the common kind of truck jumped to $2.11 per mile in December, up more than 25 percent from the start of 2017, and marking the highest monthly average rate since at least 2010.</p><p>Analysts say that could go even higher.</p><p>DONALD BROUGHTON, BROUGHTON CAPITAL: It`s going to be higher rates for shippers. The biggest question of shippers is whether or not they can get the capacity, because if they`re not willing to pay up, they`re not going to get the capacity. That`s just the clear pattern that`s being established right now.</p><p>For consumers, it means higher prices at the shelf. It means higher prices delivered, because they`d been getting a discount on shipping. And those days are over, at least for the foreseeable future.</p><p>BRENNAN: More manufacturing activity, a robust holiday season, ongoing rebuild efforts from hurricanes and new regulations are all playing a part. Last month, a new rule took effect that makes drivers track driver hours electronically. That`s helping to take trucks off the road and just as volumes are soaring.</p><p>The biggest winners are going to be the people that are on the assets, the XPOs, the FedExes, the Knights, the Werners, the Celadons, the Covenants. If you own the truck and trailer, then you are in a great position right now.</p><p>BRENNAN: The demand is helping fuel resurgence of vehicle orders, according to ACT Research. In December, fleets reserved the most class 8 trucks, the kind used on long haul routes, in a single month in three years. That`s something that could benefit manufacturers like Navistar, Daimler and Volvo AB.</p><p>But it`s not just trucking either. Volumes of goods moved by railroad, barge and plane are all growing. It`s good news for the companies moving them, but bad news for retailers and other shippers, since stronger demand also means higher costs.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Morgan Brennan.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I`m Sue Herera. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>MATHISEN: And thanks from me as well. I`m Tyler Mathisen.

The Dow pulled back a bit, dropping 12  points to 25,283, the Nasdaq gained 20 and the S&amp;P 500 gained four.  </p><p>With a string of record runs in 2018 getting off to a robust start, some  may start to think that this bull market is shaping up to be one of the  strongest ever.  </p><p>Mike Santoli picks it up from here.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The bull market set  to reach its ninth anniversary in two months is now the second best ever,  which means that investors who expect generous gains from here over the  next couple of years are effectively betting that this bull run can become  the greatest of all time.  </p><p>In terms of market gains, valuation, and the public exposure to stocks,  only the final years of the 1990s surge sit at higher elevations than the  climb that began in March of 2009.  This might sound scary for anyone who  recalls the speculative frenzy of the late '90s market and the wealth  destruction that followed as the tech bubble bursts, but the comforting  news for now is that while today's bull market ranks number two, it's still  quite a distance from the excesses of the one that closed the 20th century.  </p><p>The S&amp;P 500 has gained just over 300 percent from its lows set during the  great financial crisis in early 2009.  That compares to a 580 percent  advance that ran from the 1987 crash to early 2000.  And while stocks are  rather richly valued today, they are not as expensive as at the 2000 peak.  </p><p>Finally, retail investors had nearly 80 percent of their financial assets  in stocks and were feasting on half baked initial public offerings 18 years  ago.  Today, they hold closer to 70 percent in stocks and most popular  investments are sober index funds.  </p><p>All this explains why some optimistic strategists are predicting a more  energetic phase of the bull market as public excitement grows and the new  corporate tax cut offers a fresh story line for further gains atop strong  global growth and a healthy consumer.  It might all sound too good to be  true and it always makes sense to ask what could go wrong when the crowd is  fixated on the good news.  </p><p>For as long as stocks keep clicking to new record highs though, the  comparisons with the greatest ever bull market will only get louder.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Mike Santoli.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  When investors who focused last year on growth stocks were  richly rewarded.  Large cap growth funds were up nearly 30 percent in 2017  while large cap value funds rose just under 16 percent.  So, will growth  continue to dominate this year or should investors now start to nibble more  in value stocks and mutual funds?  </p><p>Joining us now to discuss that, Kevin Caron.  He's portfolio manager with  Washington Crossing Advisers.  </p><p>Kevin, always good to see you.  </p><p>KEVIN CARON, WASHINGTON CROSSINGS ADVISORS PORTFOLIO MANAGER:  It's good to  be here.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Let's do a little level setting here.  I just love for those who  don't know those terms of art to hear from you the difference is between a  growth stock or fund and a value stock or fund.  What are the distinctions?  </p><p>CARON:  All right.  Well, the growth stocks are companies that trade with  higher multiples, multiples of earnings or multiples of book value and  value is going to be lower.  </p><p>Now, you might say, well, why not always buy the thing that's cheaper and  the difference is, as you might guess it, guess, growth.  So, in the last  year or so, as we've seen growth pick up in the global economy and earnings  grow really pick up for the tech sector in particular, we've seen the  growth investors be more willing to pay higher multiples to own the growth  sectors.  And so, that's why the growth style has, by far, outperformed the  value sector.  </p><p>HERERA:  What do you say to those who say that valuations overall, whether  you're talking about value or growth are still pretty richly valued, no pun  intended?  </p><p>CARON:  Yes.  Well, they are.  And it's not -- it's really across not just  growth and value, but if you look at the overall stock market, it's trading  with a value that is relatively high compared to the underlying economy.   Roughly $28 trillion is the value of the U.S. stock market.  The economy is  $18 trillion.  </p><p>So, by that measure, it's fairly rough and it's fairly rich.  And also,  price to earnings is fairly high overall.  So, they're both fairly high.   And growth in particular is higher.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  So what are you doing in the portfolios that you manage that our  viewers could then maybe extrapolate and apply in their lives?  Are you  paring back your growth allocations and looking at more value companies and  funds?  </p><p>CARON:  Yes.  So, coming into 2018, we have done exactly that.  We have  been overweight growth on prospects of a better growth in the economy.  We  have seen that.  </p><p>But we are getting a little bit concerned about the relative valuation  between growth and value.  So, we have trimmed back the growth allocation  from overweight to neutral and we've lifted our value weighting from  underweight to neutral, citing better relative valuations for the value  sectors.  </p><p>HERERA:  How do you feel about the economy overall because that's basically  what's going to continue to drive stocks?</p><p>CARON:  Really solid.  There is little in the data that concerns us here.   The earnings are growing nicely.  The employment data seems to be fairly  good.  And the overall outlook for inflation and interest rates is  relatively benign.  </p><p>So, there is nothing in the immediate data that concerns us.  And we would  assume the near-term outlook for recession, for example, would relatively  low and encourage us to remain overweight equities overall compared to  bonds.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  All right.  Kevin, thanks very much.  She's the last guy there  tonight.  Go home.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Kevin Caron with Washington Crossings Advisers.</p><p>CARON:  Thank you.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Good to see you.  </p><p>HERERA:  In Washington, the treasury secretary has reportedly asked  Congress to lift the federal government's debt ceiling by February 28th.   That's according to \"Bloomberg\".  The treasury will exhaust all of its  borrowing options and run out of cash to pay its bills by late March or  early April if Congress doesn't raise its borrowing authority.  The  treasury secretary, Mr. Mnuchin, has said repeatedly that he would prefer  the debt limit raised well before the government faces a potential default.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Dow component Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) will fault research into  Alzheimer's and Parkinson's treatments.  The drug maker says the decision  reallocates money into other areas.  Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) had made big  investments into neuro degenerative diseases.  They faced some setbacks  recently.  There is no known cure for either Alzheimer or Parkinson's.  </p><p>Separately, the bio tech company Axovant will no longer develop a dementia  drug because that drug failed to meet certain goals in recent studies.</p><p>Shares of both Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and Axovant fell, with Axovant, a small  cap stock, seeing its value more than halved.  </p><p>HERERA:  That was just one of the very hot topics discussed at the biggest  health care event of the year.  </p><p>Meg Tirrell spoke to a number of industry CEOs at the JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)  health care conference, and that's in San Francisco.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MEG TIRRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  A rainy day of weather  kicked off the annual J.P. Morgan health care conference in San Francisco.   It's the year's biggest event for health care investing, where more than  450 companies present over four days to more than 9,000 attendees.  </p><p>It's always a big conference for deal news and this year, we did get a deal  from Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG).  It's spending $1.1 billion to acquire cancer  drug maker Impact Biomedicine, gaining a drug for a rare form of bone  marrow cancer.  </p><p>We talked to CEO Mark Alles about that at the conference.  </p><p>MARK ALLES, CELGENE CEO:  Well, first of all, it's a hematology play.  And  our DNA at Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) is hematology.  Second, it's a highly  unmet medical need.  Myelofibrosis is a rare cancer but at the same time,  until now, there's been only one FDA approved drug ever for the disease.  </p><p>TIRRELL:  Following the deal, though, biotech stocks were under pressure as  some may have hoped for Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) or others to do bigger deals  in the space.  Many wondering if the U.S. tax overhaul would spur M&amp;A.  </p><p>We talked to Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) CEO Dave Ricks about the impacts of tax  reform.  </p><p>DAVE RICKS, ELI LILLY CEO:  We're worried about the lopsided nature of  foreign competitors with better tax competitors than we did.  That's now  addressed.  I think strategically that's the most important thing that came  out of this tax reform.  </p><p>It will allow us also to invest without thinking about the tax rate so  much.  But rather put plants and labs where it makes sense, where the  talent is and where the markets serving are.  So, overall, it was a  successful package from a pharmaceutical sector.  </p><p>TIRRELL:  Other topics on discussion this week have been drug pricing.  It  was, of course, during this week last year that President-elect Donald  Trump made his comment that the industry is, quote, getting away with  murder when it comes to its pricing policy.  And as companies were updating  on their drug pipelines and other aspects of their businesses, there was  another issue on display, that of gender diversity.  According to a recent  effort from STAT News, of the more than 450 companies presenting here at  the conference, only 20 have women CEOs presenting.  That compares with 22  presenters at the conference named Michael.  </p><p>We talked with one of those women CEOs earlier.  </p><p>KATRINE BOSLEY, EDITAS MEDICINE CEO:  If you look at the senior team,  within the company, vice president and above, over half of our team members  are women.  But it's not just about gender.  I think it's a broader  question of diversity because making experimental medicines and advancing  them is tough and having diversity is a strength and part of what's going  to make us successful.  </p><p>TIRRELL:  Something for the industry to work on in 2018.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Meg Tirrell in San Francisco.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, there's also been a big push by Silicon Valley to move  into the very large and very lucrative health care industry.  </p><p>Deirdre Bosa has that angle tonight.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DEIRDRE BOSA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  This year, more than  20 million Americans are predicted to be using smart watches.  Many of them  will be using them for more than just telling the time.  They will be  tracking how many steps taken, how many calories burned and resting heart  rate.  </p><p>But could a smart watch one day save your life?  </p><p>Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is trying to find out.  The tech giant is teaming up  with Stanford medicine for a first of its kind research study that will use  the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) watch to detect irregular heart rhythms that could  lead to a stroke.  </p><p>And it's not just Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  Other big tech companies like  Alphabet, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) are getting  involved in efforts to remake the health care industry.  </p><p>A few reasons tech is moving into the space.  One, it is $3 trillion  industry in the United States.  Two, it's ripe for innovation and  disruption.  And three, these companies know consumers and they  increasingly have the scale, data and reach to deliver.  </p><p>In recent years, their involvement in the health care industry has surged.   According to CB Insights participation in health care equity deals by the  10 largest U.S. tech companies has increased ten-fold in the last five  years to nearly $3 billion last year.  </p><p>Some of those deals include Amazon's participation in a financing round for  Grail, a cancer detection startup.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) acquired sleep  tracking company Beddit and Alphabet bought Senosis, a health monitoring  start-up.  </p><p>Their efforts are much bigger than just those deals.  Alphabet has been  expanding verily, its unit dedicated to life sciences.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)  has health kit, while Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is quietly moving in for the  moment and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is making it easier for pharma companies to  advertise.  Increasingly, health care executives themselves are thinking  about disruption and innovation in terms of technology.  Biogen CEO says  the biotech industry needs to take the lead in changes and be what he calls  the Tesla of the industry and set new models.  </p><p>MICHAEL VOUNATSOS, BIOGEN CEO:  We need to bring this industry closer to  the consumer, closer to the patients.  We are meant to provide support to  the patient who is sick, not to take advantage of those.  </p><p>BOSA:  Meanwhile, some analysts say the road ahead for tech and health care  won't be without bumps as they learn to understand regulatory procedures  and patient/clinician relationships.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Deirdre Bosa, San Francisco.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Still ahead, screen time.  Should Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) do more to  curb growing smart phone addiction among kids?</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Two prominent Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shareholders made an unusual  request.  They're pressuring the company on a social responsibility issue  not a corporate one.  The focus is on children and whether the company  should do more to fight smartphone addiction in kids.  </p><p>Josh Lipton has the story.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Believe it or not, the  average American teenager got his first phone before he was a teen at  roughly 10 years old.  And that teenager today currently spends nearly five  hours a day on it.  And that doesn't even include taking and texting.  </p><p>Jana Partners and CalSTRS, two Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shareholders who own a  combined $2 billion of the company shares are concerned, citing that data  in a letter they sent the iPhone maker over the weekend.  The shareholders  are worried that the iPhone could hurt children, saying: As one of the most  innovative companies in the history of technology, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) can  play a defining role in signaling to the industry that paying special  attention to the health and development of the next generation is both good  business and the right thing to do.  </p><p>They point to alarming data that children are increasingly distracted by  digital devices in the classroom and that teenagers who spend too much time  on such devices are at higher risk of depression and even suicide.  </p><p>One of the researchers cited in the letter says children and their parents  would benefit if they weren't overusing the devices.  </p><p>JEAN TWENGE, SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY:  For Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in  particular, they make their profit when someone buys the device and owns  it.  It doesn't matter how often they use it.  And what the research shows  is for teens, the happiest teens are those who have the phones but use them  about an hour, maybe two hours a day.  It's beyond that when issues start  to show up.  </p><p>LIPTON:  The shareholders want Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to convene a panel of  experts to study the issue, partner with experts to conduct further  research and offer parents new tools and options.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) does  already offers parents help.  They can take an active role in restricting  the apps and features that their children use on these devices.  </p><p>Some might counter that the responsibility isn't ultimately with phone  manufacturers but with their parents.  And that's often the social media  apps like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Snapchat where young people spend their  time, but Jana and CalSTRS say that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) can do more and  argue that addressing the issue today will boost the long-term value for  all shareholders by creating more choices and options for customers.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Josh Lipton, San Francisco.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  As Josh mentioned in his report, today's typical teenager may  spend nearly five hours a day glued to that smartphone and that lack of  face to face time could be detrimental to a young person's well-being.  </p><p>So, is it the responsibility of companies to educate parents on the risk  associated with their products and services?  </p><p>Here to talk about that is Dan Eaton (NYSE:ETN).  He's a business ethics  instructor at the Fowler College of Business at San Diego State University.  </p><p>Welcome.  Nice to have you here.  </p><p>DAN EATON, SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY'S BUSINESS ETHICS INSTRUCTOR:  Good  to be with you.  </p><p>HERERA:  So, what do you think about the basic premise that we put forward?   What is the responsibility of a company like an Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or  another smartphone maker to the customer and the customer's parents?  </p><p>EATON:  Well, the responsibility of any company is to make sure that  consumers are sufficiently well-informed of the risks that come from using  their products.  So, when you talk about whether it's a responsibility of  the company on the one hand, or the end user or the parents on the other,  the answer is, well, yes, it's the responsibility of both.  </p><p>And it's really good business.  It's good for the bottom line.  This is not  entirely about corporate social responsibility.  It's also about protecting  shareholder value, which is why two big shareholders with $2 billion  invested in this company want pro-action now.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  You know, it's interesting that these shareholders who happen to  be Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shareholders have gone to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  It  could be Samsung.  It could be another manufacturer, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)  or whomever.  </p><p>What they seem to be calling for is, as you say, a more proactive position  on the part of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  Potentially to come up with wrinkles  or products that they put on the phone that make it easier for parents to  limit or monitor both the time or the ways -- and there are products out  there, but they are not -- Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) already does some of it, but  they are not as easy to use as these people are calling for.  </p><p>EATON:  And it doesn't seem to take anything away from Apple's bottom line  to make them easier to use.  The bottom line is that there is no defeat  device that is going to override the insistence of a teenager, period.  The  bottom line is --  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, you can say that again.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HERERA:  We both got kids that use them.  We know what you are talking  about.  </p><p>EATON:  But that said, it is sometimes the responsibility of these  companies to make it easier for parents to exercise that control.  </p><p>Barbara Booth (ph), our strategic editor, has an excellent piece on  CNBC.com about the things parents ought to do.  It's with them that the  ultimate responsibility rests.  But companies can do more and they should  do more, because it is good business.  </p><p>This is not just about saving the world.  It's about protecting a  vulnerable population which is children and it's about giving parents a  tool to do their ultimate job better.  </p><p>HERERA:  Do you think most parents are even aware of how much time their  kids spend on a phone and would they be more proactive if they realized it  or how integral the device is to their daily life?  </p><p>EATON:  They are probably not aware, but they're going to be more aware now  having watched this segment.  And the bottom line is that allowing this  kind of device which controls the amount of time will enable them to place  those controls regardless of how much they know about their own children's  usage.  </p><p>There was a report in the package that you just ran that children are  happiest when they only use it about an hour or two on the devices.  And  this technology will enable parents to ensure their children are as happy  as they can be without getting addicted.  </p><p>I mean, the piece that Barbara Booth ran talked about what's referred to as  digital heroin.  That's scary.  And it's better to take steps now to avoid  that kind of thing that to let it get out of control with the reputational  risks that are going to ultimately to jeopardize these two investors'  financial stake in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  </p><p>HERERA:  Dan, thank you so much.  Appreciate it.  We are all jealous that  you're out in San Diego and we're not.  Thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p>EATON:  And yet it's raining here.  So --  </p><p>HERERA:  OK.  There you go.  </p><p>Dan Eaton (NYSE:ETN) with San Diego State University.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, GoPro may be open to selling itself, and that is where we  begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".</p><p>Just hours after the wearable camera maker said it was cutting jobs  lowering its fourth quarter sales forecast, \"Reuters\" said the company has  hired JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) to help explore a potential sale.  The company  which has been experiencing weaker demand said it was exiting the drone  business, cutting CEO Nick Woodman's salary to a dollar.  </p><p>Earlier today, Woodman said a potential merger wouldn't be out of the  question.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NICK WOODMAN, GOPRO CEO:  If there are opportunities for us to scale  awareness of GoPro globally by being part of a bigger company, that's  something that we would entertain.  But, of course, we need to run the  business as though we are going to be independent.  And we are planning  accordingly and we're looking forward to benefitting from the improved  sell-through we are seeing on all of our products at their new pricing.   And we're looking forward to profitability in the second half of 2018.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATHISEN:  GoPro shares plunged nearly 13 percent to $6.56.  </p><p>The restaurant and gaming chain Dave and Buster's slashed its full year  profit and sales outlook, after reporting a drop in same store receipts  during the holiday period.  The company said weak foot traffic at the  beginning of the quarter never picked up steam, like it initially  anticipated.  </p><p>Despite the disappointing guidance, Dave and Buster said its new stores are  performing well.  Shares cratered, though, 22 percent.  They finished today  at $43.79.  </p><p>On the flip side, same store sales at Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) rose during the  holiday season as more shoppers visited Kohl's location.  The retailer  expects its offerings will continue to attract shoppers.  It is hiking its  profit outlook for the year.  Shares rose more than 4 percent to $56.90.  </p><p>HERERA:  Tenet healthcare said that it will cut more jobs than planned as  the hospital operator tries to keep a tight lid on costs.  The company now  expects to eliminate 2,000 positions which it says will save Tenet about  $250 million.  Shares were off 3 percent to $14.95.</p><p>Despite reporting solid holiday sales, the discount retailer Five Below saw  its shares pressured after it gave earnings and revenue guidance for the  current quarter that trailed analyst estimates.  Shares were down 7 percent  to $66.95.  </p><p>And the footwear maker Crocs (NASDAQ:CROX) is increasing its fourth quarter  sales and gross margin outlook.  The company also said it expects operating  costs to be relatively flat compared to last year.  Shares of Crocs  (NASDAQ:CROX) finished the day up 8 percent to $13.23.  </p><p>And after the bell, Urban Outfitters (NASDAQ:URBN) reported a smaller than  expected rise in same store sales during the holiday shopping season.  The  shares were initially lower in after-hours trading but finished the regular  session down 1.5 percent to $33.74.  </p><p>HERERA:  And coming up, why one industry just keeps on trucking.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  A failed Atlantic City casino may get a new lease on life.  The  former Revel Casino was purchased by a Colorado developer for about $200  million.  The developer called the acquisition a dream come true.  He plans  to re-open it this summer around the same time the former Trump Taj Mahal  Casino will re-open under the Hard Rock brand.  The former Revel will be  called the Ocean Resort Casino.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, last year was the most expensive on record for natural  disasters.  Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, along with the wild fires that  ravaged the western part of the country, caused more than $300 billion in  total damage.  </p><p>According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the  largest cost came from the hurricanes.  Apart of last year, 2005 was the  most expensive disaster year.  That year, of course, hurricane Katrina  caused more than $200 billion in damage.</p><p>HERERA:  Takata is expanding the largest automotive recall in U.S. history.   The Japanese air bag maker is recalling 3 million more faulty air bag  inflaters.  In total, more than 19 automakers have been affected.  And more  than 42 million vehicles.  Thos recalls and the criminal convictions  against Takata forced that company to file for bankruptcy protection.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Have you noticed more and more trucks on the road?  Well, the  answer is probably yes.  When the economy grows as it has been doing, more  goods need to be transported and that is resulting in a spike in demand for  18-wheelers.  </p><p>Morgan Brennan hits the gas.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  As the economy  keeps on trucking, so too does trucking.  Demand for trucks is  skyrocketing.  And that means higher rates.  Freight exchange service DAT  Solutions says the price for the common kind of truck jumped to $2.11 per  mile in December, up more than 25 percent from the start of 2017, and  marking the highest monthly average rate since at least 2010.  </p><p>Analysts say that could go even higher.  </p><p>DONALD BROUGHTON, BROUGHTON CAPITAL:  It's going to be higher rates for  shippers.  The biggest question of shippers is whether or not they can get  the capacity, because if they're not willing to pay up, they're not going  to get the capacity.  That's just the clear pattern that's being  established right now.  </p><p>For consumers, it means higher prices at the shelf.  It means higher prices  delivered, because they'd been getting a discount on shipping.  And those  days are over, at least for the foreseeable future.  </p><p>BRENNAN:  More manufacturing activity, a robust holiday season, ongoing  rebuild efforts from hurricanes and new regulations are all playing a part.   Last month, a new rule took effect that makes drivers track driver hours  electronically.  That's helping to take trucks off the road and just as  volumes are soaring.  </p><p>The biggest winners are going to be the people that are on the assets, the  XPOs, the FedExes, the Knights, the Werners, the Celadons, the Covenants.   If you own the truck and trailer, then you are in a great position right  now.  </p><p>BRENNAN:  The demand is helping fuel resurgence of vehicle orders,  according to ACT Research.  In December, fleets reserved the most class 8  trucks, the kind used on long haul routes, in a single month in three  years.  That's something that could benefit manufacturers like Navistar,  Daimler and Volvo AB.</p><p>But it's not just trucking either.  Volumes of goods moved by railroad,  barge and plane are all growing.  It's good news for the companies moving  them, but bad news for retailers and other shippers, since stronger demand  also means higher costs.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Morgan Brennan.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I'm Sue Herera.   Thanks for joining us.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  And thanks from me as well.  I'm Tyler Mathisen.

The S&amp;P 500  and Nasdaq closed at all-time high again.  No wonder more investors ask is  this the greatest bull market of all time?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Smartphone addiction.  Two big  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) investors want the company to do more to prevent  overuse by kids.  But is it Apple's responsibility?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> MATHISEN:  And the long haul.  As the economy keeps on trucking so does the  trucking industry.  </p><p> Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Monday,  January 8th.  </p><p> HERERA:  Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  </p><p> Stocks extend their 2018 gains.  It wasn't a rip-roaring rally to start the  week, but it was enough to push the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq to new records.   Investors remain upbeat about the economy and confident that it will  continue to pick up steam.  </p><p> So, here are the final numbers.  The Dow pulled back a bit, dropping 12  points to 25,283, the Nasdaq gained 20 and the S&amp;P 500 gained four.  </p><p> With a string of record runs in 2018 getting off to a robust start, some  may start to think that this bull market is shaping up to be one of the  strongest ever.  </p><p> Mike Santoli picks it up from here.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  The bull market set  to reach its ninth anniversary in two months is now the second best ever,  which means that investors who expect generous gains from here over the  next couple of years are effectively betting that this bull run can become  the greatest of all time.  </p><p> In terms of market gains, valuation, and the public exposure to stocks,  only the final years of the 1990s surge sit at higher elevations than the  climb that began in March of 2009.  This might sound scary for anyone who  recalls the speculative frenzy of the late '90s market and the wealth  destruction that followed as the tech bubble bursts, but the comforting  news for now is that while today's bull market ranks number two, it's still  quite a distance from the excesses of the one that closed the 20th century.  </p><p> The S&amp;P 500 has gained just over 300 percent from its lows set during the  great financial crisis in early 2009.  That compares to a 580 percent  advance that ran from the 1987 crash to early 2000.  And while stocks are  rather richly valued today, they are not as expensive as at the 2000 peak.  </p><p> Finally, retail investors had nearly 80 percent of their financial assets  in stocks and were feasting on half baked initial public offerings 18 years  ago.  Today, they hold closer to 70 percent in stocks and most popular  investments are sober index funds.  </p><p> All this explains why some optimistic strategists are predicting a more  energetic phase of the bull market as public excitement grows and the new  corporate tax cut offers a fresh story line for further gains atop strong  global growth and a healthy consumer.  It might all sound too good to be  true and it always makes sense to ask what could go wrong when the crowd is  fixated on the good news.  </p><p> For as long as stocks keep clicking to new record highs though, the  comparisons with the greatest ever bull market will only get louder.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Mike Santoli.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MATHISEN:  When investors who focused last year on growth stocks were  richly rewarded.  Large cap growth funds were up nearly 30 percent in 2017  while large cap value funds rose just under 16 percent.  So, will growth  continue to dominate this year or should investors now start to nibble more  in value stocks and mutual funds?  </p><p> Joining us now to discuss that, Kevin Caron.  He's portfolio manager with  Washington Crossing Advisers.  </p><p> Kevin, always good to see you.  </p><p> KEVIN CARON, WASHINGTON CROSSINGS ADVISORS PORTFOLIO MANAGER:  It's good to  be here.</p><p> MATHISEN:  Let's do a little level setting here.  I just love for those who  don't know those terms of art to hear from you the difference is between a  growth stock or fund and a value stock or fund.  What are the distinctions?  </p><p> CARON:  All right.  Well, the growth stocks are companies that trade with  higher multiples, multiples of earnings or multiples of book value and  value is going to be lower.  </p><p> Now, you might say, well, why not always buy the thing that's cheaper and  the difference is, as you might guess it, guess, growth.  So, in the last  year or so, as we've seen growth pick up in the global economy and earnings  grow really pick up for the tech sector in particular, we've seen the  growth investors be more willing to pay higher multiples to own the growth  sectors.  And so, that's why the growth style has, by far, outperformed the  value sector.  </p><p> HERERA:  What do you say to those who say that valuations overall, whether  you're talking about value or growth are still pretty richly valued, no pun  intended?  </p><p> CARON:  Yes.  Well, they are.  And it's not -- it's really across not just  growth and value, but if you look at the overall stock market, it's trading  with a value that is relatively high compared to the underlying economy.   Roughly $28 trillion is the value of the U.S. stock market.  The economy is  $18 trillion.  </p><p> So, by that measure, it's fairly rough and it's fairly rich.  And also,  price to earnings is fairly high overall.  So, they're both fairly high.   And growth in particular is higher.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  So what are you doing in the portfolios that you manage that our  viewers could then maybe extrapolate and apply in their lives?  Are you  paring back your growth allocations and looking at more value companies and  funds?  </p><p> CARON:  Yes.  So, coming into 2018, we have done exactly that.  We have  been overweight growth on prospects of a better growth in the economy.  We  have seen that.  </p><p> But we are getting a little bit concerned about the relative valuation  between growth and value.  So, we have trimmed back the growth allocation  from overweight to neutral and we've lifted our value weighting from  underweight to neutral, citing better relative valuations for the value  sectors.  </p><p> HERERA:  How do you feel about the economy overall because that's basically  what's going to continue to drive stocks?</p><p> CARON:  Really solid.  There is little in the data that concerns us here.   The earnings are growing nicely.  The employment data seems to be fairly  good.  And the overall outlook for inflation and interest rates is  relatively benign.  </p><p> So, there is nothing in the immediate data that concerns us.  And we would  assume the near-term outlook for recession, for example, would relatively  low and encourage us to remain overweight equities overall compared to  bonds.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  All right.  Kevin, thanks very much.  She's the last guy there  tonight.  Go home.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MATHISEN:  Kevin Caron with Washington Crossings Advisers.</p><p> CARON:  Thank you.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Good to see you.  </p><p> HERERA:  In Washington, the treasury secretary has reportedly asked  Congress to lift the federal government's debt ceiling by February 28th.   That's according to \"Bloomberg\".  The treasury will exhaust all of its  borrowing options and run out of cash to pay its bills by late March or  early April if Congress doesn't raise its borrowing authority.  The  treasury secretary, Mr. Mnuchin, has said repeatedly that he would prefer  the debt limit raised well before the government faces a potential default.</p><p> MATHISEN:  Dow component Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) will fault research into  Alzheimer's and Parkinson's treatments.  The drug maker says the decision  reallocates money into other areas.  Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) had made big  investments into neuro degenerative diseases.  They faced some setbacks  recently.  There is no known cure for either Alzheimer or Parkinson's.  </p><p> Separately, the bio tech company Axovant will no longer develop a dementia  drug because that drug failed to meet certain goals in recent studies.</p><p> Shares of both Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and Axovant fell, with Axovant, a small  cap stock, seeing its value more than halved.  </p><p> HERERA:  That was just one of the very hot topics discussed at the biggest  health care event of the year.  </p><p> Meg Tirrell spoke to a number of industry CEOs at the JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM)  health care conference, and that's in San Francisco.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MEG TIRRELL, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  A rainy day of weather  kicked off the annual J.P. Morgan health care conference in San Francisco.   It's the year's biggest event for health care investing, where more than  450 companies present over four days to more than 9,000 attendees.  </p><p> It's always a big conference for deal news and this year, we did get a deal  from Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG).  It's spending $1.1 billion to acquire cancer  drug maker Impact Biomedicine, gaining a drug for a rare form of bone  marrow cancer.  </p><p> We talked to CEO Mark Alles about that at the conference.  </p><p> MARK ALLES, CELGENE CEO:  Well, first of all, it's a hematology play.  And  our DNA at Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) is hematology.  Second, it's a highly  unmet medical need.  Myelofibrosis is a rare cancer but at the same time,  until now, there's been only one FDA approved drug ever for the disease.  </p><p> TIRRELL:  Following the deal, though, biotech stocks were under pressure as  some may have hoped for Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) or others to do bigger deals  in the space.  Many wondering if the U.S. tax overhaul would spur M&amp;A.  </p><p> We talked to Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) CEO Dave Ricks about the impacts of tax  reform.  </p><p> DAVE RICKS, ELI LILLY CEO:  We're worried about the lopsided nature of  foreign competitors with better tax competitors than we did.  That's now  addressed.  I think strategically that's the most important thing that came  out of this tax reform.  </p><p> It will allow us also to invest without thinking about the tax rate so  much.  But rather put plants and labs where it makes sense, where the  talent is and where the markets serving are.  So, overall, it was a  successful package from a pharmaceutical sector.  </p><p> TIRRELL:  Other topics on discussion this week have been drug pricing.  It  was, of course, during this week last year that President-elect Donald  Trump made his comment that the industry is, quote, getting away with  murder when it comes to its pricing policy.  And as companies were updating  on their drug pipelines and other aspects of their businesses, there was  another issue on display, that of gender diversity.  According to a recent  effort from STAT News, of the more than 450 companies presenting here at  the conference, only 20 have women CEOs presenting.  That compares with 22  presenters at the conference named Michael.  </p><p> We talked with one of those women CEOs earlier.  </p><p> KATRINE BOSLEY, EDITAS MEDICINE CEO:  If you look at the senior team,  within the company, vice president and above, over half of our team members  are women.  But it's not just about gender.  I think it's a broader  question of diversity because making experimental medicines and advancing  them is tough and having diversity is a strength and part of what's going  to make us successful.  </p><p> TIRRELL:  Something for the industry to work on in 2018.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Meg Tirrell in San Francisco.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MATHISEN:  Well, there's also been a big push by Silicon Valley to move  into the very large and very lucrative health care industry.  </p><p> Deirdre Bosa has that angle tonight.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> DEIRDRE BOSA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  This year, more than  20 million Americans are predicted to be using smart watches.  Many of them  will be using them for more than just telling the time.  They will be  tracking how many steps taken, how many calories burned and resting heart  rate.  </p><p> But could a smart watch one day save your life?  </p><p> Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is trying to find out.  The tech giant is teaming up  with Stanford medicine for a first of its kind research study that will use  the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) watch to detect irregular heart rhythms that could  lead to a stroke.  </p><p> And it's not just Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  Other big tech companies like  Alphabet, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) are getting  involved in efforts to remake the health care industry.  </p><p> A few reasons tech is moving into the space.  One, it is $3 trillion  industry in the United States.  Two, it's ripe for innovation and  disruption.  And three, these companies know consumers and they  increasingly have the scale, data and reach to deliver.  </p><p> In recent years, their involvement in the health care industry has surged.   According to CB Insights participation in health care equity deals by the  10 largest U.S. tech companies has increased ten-fold in the last five  years to nearly $3 billion last year.  </p><p> Some of those deals include Amazon's participation in a financing round for  Grail, a cancer detection startup.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) acquired sleep  tracking company Beddit and Alphabet bought Senosis, a health monitoring  start-up.  </p><p> Their efforts are much bigger than just those deals.  Alphabet has been  expanding verily, its unit dedicated to life sciences.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)  has health kit, while Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is quietly moving in for the  moment and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is making it easier for pharma companies to  advertise.  Increasingly, health care executives themselves are thinking  about disruption and innovation in terms of technology.  Biogen CEO says  the biotech industry needs to take the lead in changes and be what he calls  the Tesla of the industry and set new models.  </p><p> MICHAEL VOUNATSOS, BIOGEN CEO:  We need to bring this industry closer to  the consumer, closer to the patients.  We are meant to provide support to  the patient who is sick, not to take advantage of those.  </p><p> BOSA:  Meanwhile, some analysts say the road ahead for tech and health care  won't be without bumps as they learn to understand regulatory procedures  and patient/clinician relationships.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Deirdre Bosa, San Francisco.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  Still ahead, screen time.  Should Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) do more to  curb growing smart phone addiction among kids?</p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> MATHISEN:  Two prominent Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shareholders made an unusual  request.  They're pressuring the company on a social responsibility issue  not a corporate one.  The focus is on children and whether the company  should do more to fight smartphone addiction in kids.  </p><p> Josh Lipton has the story.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Believe it or not, the  average American teenager got his first phone before he was a teen at  roughly 10 years old.  And that teenager today currently spends nearly five  hours a day on it.  And that doesn't even include taking and texting.  </p><p> Jana Partners and CalSTRS, two Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shareholders who own a  combined $2 billion of the company shares are concerned, citing that data  in a letter they sent the iPhone maker over the weekend.  The shareholders  are worried that the iPhone could hurt children, saying: As one of the most  innovative companies in the history of technology, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) can  play a defining role in signaling to the industry that paying special  attention to the health and development of the next generation is both good  business and the right thing to do.  </p><p> They point to alarming data that children are increasingly distracted by  digital devices in the classroom and that teenagers who spend too much time  on such devices are at higher risk of depression and even suicide.  </p><p> One of the researchers cited in the letter says children and their parents  would benefit if they weren't overusing the devices.  </p><p> JEAN TWENGE, SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY:  For Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in  particular, they make their profit when someone buys the device and owns  it.  It doesn't matter how often they use it.  And what the research shows  is for teens, the happiest teens are those who have the phones but use them  about an hour, maybe two hours a day.  It's beyond that when issues start  to show up.  </p><p> LIPTON:  The shareholders want Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to convene a panel of  experts to study the issue, partner with experts to conduct further  research and offer parents new tools and options.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) does  already offers parents help.  They can take an active role in restricting  the apps and features that their children use on these devices.  </p><p> Some might counter that the responsibility isn't ultimately with phone  manufacturers but with their parents.  And that's often the social media  apps like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Snapchat where young people spend their  time, but Jana and CalSTRS say that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) can do more and  argue that addressing the issue today will boost the long-term value for  all shareholders by creating more choices and options for customers.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Josh Lipton, San Francisco.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  As Josh mentioned in his report, today's typical teenager may  spend nearly five hours a day glued to that smartphone and that lack of  face to face time could be detrimental to a young person's well-being.  </p><p> So, is it the responsibility of companies to educate parents on the risk  associated with their products and services?  </p><p> Here to talk about that is Dan Eaton (NYSE:ETN).  He's a business ethics  instructor at the Fowler College of Business at San Diego State University.  </p><p> Welcome.  Nice to have you here.  </p><p> DAN EATON, SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY'S BUSINESS ETHICS INSTRUCTOR:  Good  to be with you.  </p><p> HERERA:  So, what do you think about the basic premise that we put forward?   What is the responsibility of a company like an Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or  another smartphone maker to the customer and the customer's parents?  </p><p> EATON:  Well, the responsibility of any company is to make sure that  consumers are sufficiently well-informed of the risks that come from using  their products.  So, when you talk about whether it's a responsibility of  the company on the one hand, or the end user or the parents on the other,  the answer is, well, yes, it's the responsibility of both.  </p><p> And it's really good business.  It's good for the bottom line.  This is not  entirely about corporate social responsibility.  It's also about protecting  shareholder value, which is why two big shareholders with $2 billion  invested in this company want pro-action now.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  You know, it's interesting that these shareholders who happen to  be Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shareholders have gone to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  It  could be Samsung.  It could be another manufacturer, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)  or whomever.  </p><p> What they seem to be calling for is, as you say, a more proactive position  on the part of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  Potentially to come up with wrinkles  or products that they put on the phone that make it easier for parents to  limit or monitor both the time or the ways -- and there are products out  there, but they are not -- Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) already does some of it, but  they are not as easy to use as these people are calling for.  </p><p> EATON:  And it doesn't seem to take anything away from Apple's bottom line  to make them easier to use.  The bottom line is that there is no defeat  device that is going to override the insistence of a teenager, period.  The  bottom line is --  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Well, you can say that again.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> HERERA:  We both got kids that use them.  We know what you are talking  about.  </p><p> EATON:  But that said, it is sometimes the responsibility of these  companies to make it easier for parents to exercise that control.  </p><p> Barbara Booth (ph), our strategic editor, has an excellent piece on  CNBC.com about the things parents ought to do.  It's with them that the  ultimate responsibility rests.  But companies can do more and they should  do more, because it is good business.  </p><p> This is not just about saving the world.  It's about protecting a  vulnerable population which is children and it's about giving parents a  tool to do their ultimate job better.  </p><p> HERERA:  Do you think most parents are even aware of how much time their  kids spend on a phone and would they be more proactive if they realized it  or how integral the device is to their daily life?  </p><p> EATON:  They are probably not aware, but they're going to be more aware now  having watched this segment.  And the bottom line is that allowing this  kind of device which controls the amount of time will enable them to place  those controls regardless of how much they know about their own children's  usage.  </p><p> There was a report in the package that you just ran that children are  happiest when they only use it about an hour or two on the devices.  And  this technology will enable parents to ensure their children are as happy  as they can be without getting addicted.  </p><p> I mean, the piece that Barbara Booth ran talked about what's referred to as  digital heroin.  That's scary.  And it's better to take steps now to avoid  that kind of thing that to let it get out of control with the reputational  risks that are going to ultimately to jeopardize these two investors'  financial stake in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  </p><p> HERERA:  Dan, thank you so much.  Appreciate it.  We are all jealous that  you're out in San Diego and we're not.  Thanks for joining us tonight.</p><p> EATON:  And yet it's raining here.  So --  </p><p> HERERA:  OK.  There you go.  </p><p> Dan Eaton (NYSE:ETN) with San Diego State University.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Well, GoPro may be open to selling itself, and that is where we  begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".</p><p> Just hours after the wearable camera maker said it was cutting jobs  lowering its fourth quarter sales forecast, \"Reuters\" said the company has  hired JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) to help explore a potential sale.  The company  which has been experiencing weaker demand said it was exiting the drone  business, cutting CEO Nick Woodman's salary to a dollar.  </p><p> Earlier today, Woodman said a potential merger wouldn't be out of the  question.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> NICK WOODMAN, GOPRO CEO:  If there are opportunities for us to scale  awareness of GoPro globally by being part of a bigger company, that's  something that we would entertain.  But, of course, we need to run the  business as though we are going to be independent.  And we are planning  accordingly and we're looking forward to benefitting from the improved  sell-through we are seeing on all of our products at their new pricing.   And we're looking forward to profitability in the second half of 2018.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MATHISEN:  GoPro shares plunged nearly 13 percent to $6.56.  </p><p> The restaurant and gaming chain Dave and Buster's slashed its full year  profit and sales outlook, after reporting a drop in same store receipts  during the holiday period.  The company said weak foot traffic at the  beginning of the quarter never picked up steam, like it initially  anticipated.  </p><p> Despite the disappointing guidance, Dave and Buster said its new stores are  performing well.  Shares cratered, though, 22 percent.  They finished today  at $43.79.  </p><p> On the flip side, same store sales at Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) rose during the  holiday season as more shoppers visited Kohl's location.  The retailer  expects its offerings will continue to attract shoppers.  It is hiking its  profit outlook for the year.  Shares rose more than 4 percent to $56.90.  </p><p> HERERA:  Tenet healthcare said that it will cut more jobs than planned as  the hospital operator tries to keep a tight lid on costs.  The company now  expects to eliminate 2,000 positions which it says will save Tenet about  $250 million.  Shares were off 3 percent to $14.95.</p><p> Despite reporting solid holiday sales, the discount retailer Five Below saw  its shares pressured after it gave earnings and revenue guidance for the  current quarter that trailed analyst estimates.  Shares were down 7 percent  to $66.95.  </p><p> And the footwear maker Crocs (NASDAQ:CROX) is increasing its fourth quarter  sales and gross margin outlook.  The company also said it expects operating  costs to be relatively flat compared to last year.  Shares of Crocs  (NASDAQ:CROX) finished the day up 8 percent to $13.23.  </p><p> And after the bell, Urban Outfitters (NASDAQ:URBN) reported a smaller than  expected rise in same store sales during the holiday shopping season.  The  shares were initially lower in after-hours trading but finished the regular  session down 1.5 percent to $33.74.  </p><p> HERERA:  And coming up, why one industry just keeps on trucking.  </p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> HERERA:  A failed Atlantic City casino may get a new lease on life.  The  former Revel Casino was purchased by a Colorado developer for about $200  million.  The developer called the acquisition a dream come true.  He plans  to re-open it this summer around the same time the former Trump Taj Mahal  Casino will re-open under the Hard Rock brand.  The former Revel will be  called the Ocean Resort Casino.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Well, last year was the most expensive on record for natural  disasters.  Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, along with the wild fires that  ravaged the western part of the country, caused more than $300 billion in  total damage.  </p><p> According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the  largest cost came from the hurricanes.  Apart of last year, 2005 was the  most expensive disaster year.  That year, of course, hurricane Katrina  caused more than $200 billion in damage.</p><p> HERERA:  Takata is expanding the largest automotive recall in U.S. history.   The Japanese air bag maker is recalling 3 million more faulty air bag  inflaters.  In total, more than 19 automakers have been affected.  And more  than 42 million vehicles.  Thos recalls and the criminal convictions  against Takata forced that company to file for bankruptcy protection.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  Have you noticed more and more trucks on the road?  Well, the  answer is probably yes.  When the economy grows as it has been doing, more  goods need to be transported and that is resulting in a spike in demand for  18-wheelers.  </p><p> Morgan Brennan hits the gas.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MORGAN BRENNAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  As the economy  keeps on trucking, so too does trucking.  Demand for trucks is  skyrocketing.  And that means higher rates.  Freight exchange service DAT  Solutions says the price for the common kind of truck jumped to $2.11 per  mile in December, up more than 25 percent from the start of 2017, and  marking the highest monthly average rate since at least 2010.  </p><p> Analysts say that could go even higher.  </p><p> DONALD BROUGHTON, BROUGHTON CAPITAL:  It's going to be higher rates for  shippers.  The biggest question of shippers is whether or not they can get  the capacity, because if they're not willing to pay up, they're not going  to get the capacity.  That's just the clear pattern that's being  established right now.  </p><p> For consumers, it means higher prices at the shelf.  It means higher prices  delivered, because they'd been getting a discount on shipping.  And those  days are over, at least for the foreseeable future.  </p><p> BRENNAN:  More manufacturing activity, a robust holiday season, ongoing  rebuild efforts from hurricanes and new regulations are all playing a part.   Last month, a new rule took effect that makes drivers track driver hours  electronically.  That's helping to take trucks off the road and just as  volumes are soaring.  </p><p> The biggest winners are going to be the people that are on the assets, the  XPOs, the FedExes, the Knights, the Werners, the Celadons, the Covenants.   If you own the truck and trailer, then you are in a great position right  now.  </p><p> BRENNAN:  The demand is helping fuel resurgence of vehicle orders,  according to ACT Research.  In December, fleets reserved the most class 8  trucks, the kind used on long haul routes, in a single month in three  years.  That's something that could benefit manufacturers like Navistar,  Daimler and Volvo AB.</p><p> But it's not just trucking either.  Volumes of goods moved by railroad,  barge and plane are all growing.  It's good news for the companies moving  them, but bad news for retailers and other shippers, since stronger demand  also means higher costs.  </p><p> For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Morgan Brennan.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HERERA:  And that is NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.  I'm Sue Herera.   Thanks for joining us.  </p><p> MATHISEN:  And thanks from me as well.  I'm Tyler Mathisen.

Money flees stocks and floods the bond market on concerns over the health  of the global economy.  Is the U.S. strong enough to withstand weakness  overseas?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">       SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Retail route.  Many  thought consumers would spend all that money that they've been saving from  cheap gas.  But, today, we found out they didn't.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">       MATHISEN:  And the Houston of Canada.  How the dropping crude is  sending a chill across the heart of Canada's energy industry.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">       All that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Wednesday,  January 14th.  </p><p>       HERERA:  Good evening, everyone.  </p><p>       Another rough and unpredictable day on Wall Street with the major  averages falling for the fourth straight session amid concerns about the  strength of the U.S. consumer and the U.S. economy.  </p><p>       The big driver for today's selloff: retail sales falling nearly one  percent in December, despite deep discounts, lower gas prices and a robust  labor market.  That, combined with more volatility and oil prices and a  lower forecast for global economic growth, it sent stocks on another wild  ride.  The Dow cut an early 350 point loss in half, ending the session down  186 points, the NASDAQ lower by 22, and the S&amp;P was down 11 points.  </p><p>       In the bond market, the yield on 30-year treasuries hit record lows  while the yield on the benchmark ten-year note hit the lowest level in  nearly two years.  </p><p>       Crude bounced between losses and gains spiking higher into the close,  up 5.5 percent to $48.48 a barrel, its biggest one day percent gain since  June of 2012.</p><p>       So, with gas prices down and retail sales falling, what is the state  of the U.S. consumer right now?  </p><p>       Steve Liesman takes a look.  </p><p>       (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>       STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   Plunging oil prices have raised a few economic puzzles.  First, since the  U.S. is now such a huge oil producers, wouldn't it be a drag on the economy  or a benefit?  Second, and this is key to the first, what will consumers do  with the windfall?  Save it, spend it, or pay down debt?  </p><p>       Disappointing retail sales in December suggest consumers parting only  reluctantly with those extra petro dollars in their pocket.  </p><p>       LIZ DUNN, TALMAGE ADVISORS FOUNDER &amp; CEO:  The consumer is cautious  and waiting to see if this gas price thing is real, and I think they take a  while before they adjust their spending pattern.  </p><p>       LIESMAN:  To be sure, the case is not closed.  Consumer spending was  strong in October and November, leaving some economists to forecast the  fourth quarter growth will sport the best consumer spending number since  the Great Recession ended.  The December data may yet be revised and just  because consumers took a break doesn't mean the windfall won't find its way  into more cash registers in January and beyond.  </p><p>       MICHELLE MEYER, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH GLOBAL RESEARCH:  I think it's a  blip in an otherwise strong trend for the consumer because look at the  consumer backdrop.  Healthy job growth, increase in disposable income,  savings from the dropping gasoline prices, lower interest rates, wealth  appreciation and consumer sentiment is improving.  </p><p>       LIESMAN (on camera):  Now, let's go back to the first question.  Is  the plunge in oil good or bad for the U.S. economy?  Right now, stock  markets see only the negative -- plunging oil profits and oil stock prices.   Soon enough, capital spending could take a hit as producers scale back on  drilling new wells.  And then, there's the uncertainty.  Are oil prices  down because demand and growth are weak worldwide? </p><p>       (voice-over):  Now, it's clear why the consumer is so key.  Spending  should be the opposite of the petro pessimism.  But so far, it's not.  The  rule of thumb is that every $10 a barrel decline in oil means an extra  quarter point to growth.  </p><p>       But right now, the rule is being challenged, as are the optimists who  see lower oil prices as a positive for the U.S. economy but are still  waiting for proof. </p><p>       For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Steve Liesman.  </p><p>       (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>       MATHISEN:  We are two weeks away now from the Federal Reserve's first  policy setting meeting of the New Year.  And today, the Fed is out with its  latest Beige Book survey of economic conditions around the nation, a page  turner.  Businesses report modest to moderate growth across all 12 central  bank regions helped by strong auto sales, a pickup in tourism and increased  manufacturing.  But that big drop in oil prices starting to impact Texas,  says the Fed, and the other energy-producing regions.  </p><p>       HERERA:  Another factor weighing on the markets today, global growth  concerns.  Here to talk about this and what means for investors is John  Canally.  He's the chief economist strategist at LPL Financial.  </p><p>       Welcome, John.  Nice to have you here.  </p><p>       JOHN CANALLY, LPL FINANCIAL, CHIEF ECONOMIC STRATEGIST:  Good to be  here.  </p><p>       HERERA:  Tell me what this market is telling you about global growth,  or perhaps the lack of it.  There's a lot of fear of deflation out there  lately.  </p><p>       CANALLY:  Yes, there is.  And the ECB is working on that.  They got  that ruling today from the European court of justice that will allow them  to do this sovereign quantitative easing next Thursday.  So, that's a plus  for global growth, but there's other concerns as well.  Will the  quantitative easing that Japan has been doing for the last year, will that  start the work?  Will China finally come out and say that they aren't going  to grow at 7 percent next year, they're going to go at 6 1/2 percent, but  will they do some other kind of fiscal and monetary stimulus on top of  that?  </p><p>       And then taking it back to the U.S. here, the weak retail sales data  this morning, kind of was the clincher and said, man, if the U.S. consumer  isn't growing, then the U.S. isn't growing, then maybe we do have a global  growth scare.  </p><p>       So, I think all that weighed on the market early.  But as you  mentioned, later in the day, the Beige Book came around, which is a much  larger view of the U.S. economy, and that pretty much said things were OK,  not great, but we're still sort of in a muddle through phase here as we  wait for big events to unfold -- the ECB, China, things like that.  </p><p>       MATHISEN:  John, we spend a tremendous time asking our guests, how  low oil go?  Tonight, the question tonight, how low will bond yields go?   The 30-year bond yield now, at the lowest on record.  Ten years at 1.8  percent or thereabouts.  </p><p>       What are they saying?  What is the danger signal here, if any?  And  what should investors do if they own bonds?  </p><p>       CANALLY:  Yes, that's the thing.  I mean, is the bond market sending  a signal because yields are at all time lows?  I think if you were getting  other signals from the economy, and consumer confidence was falling sharply  instead of rising.  If auto sales were at a 10-year low instead of a 10- year high, that would be a concern.  </p><p>       If you've seen things like retail sales, the weekly retail sales we  get, if we get that and that was weak, that would be a signal that the bond  market is telling us something.  What we're seeing though is the opposite.  </p><p>       It's sort of the opposite of what happened in 2008.  In 2008, we saw  a big drop in bond yields and it was a global growth signal.  Today, it's  probably a signal of global deflation, disinflation rather than global  growth.  And I think there's things that are going to help that, but it may  be a couple of weeks, a couple of months before markets are convinced that  it's going to work.  </p><p>       HERERA:  So, John, what I think I hear you saying is that the U.S. is  the strongest around the globe right now, but is it strong enough to  survive a global either disinflation or deflationary cycle?  </p><p>       CANALLY:  Yes, I think it's important to remember that U.S. GDP is  not S&amp;P.  So, S&amp;P 500 profit is about 30 to 40 percent of those profits are  derived from overseas.  So, the stock market, financial markets are going  to get a lot more volatile around the global growth scare.  </p><p>       The U.S. economy, maybe 10 percent to 15 percent relying on exports,  but the other 85 percent to 95 percent is really just U.S. growth.  And  that looks fine.  And, you know, as we've been saying that the U.S. is sort  of the cleanest shirt in the hamper, or the best house on a bad street.  </p><p>       And as people look around the globe, they ask themselves where they  want to be this year in terms of investing.  Most likely it is in the U.S.  until China can show its cards until the ECB can do what it does and until  the Japan can do more. </p><p>       So, I think from that perspective, I think the U.S. will be fine,  simply because U.S. S&amp;P 500 is a lot different than the make-up of our  economy.  </p><p>       HERERA:  The make-up.</p><p>       All right, John.  Thank you so much for that.  We appreciate it.   Chief economist at LPL Financial.  </p><p>       And more now on the impact of plunging energy costs.  U.S. import  prices saw their biggest drop in six years in December, tumbling 2.5  percent.  That is the sixth month in a row of declines in import prices,  keeping inflation in check.  </p><p>       MATHISEN:  More detail now from that Beige Book survey out today,  regarding the slide in oil prices.  The Fed says the recent plunge in crude  may be hurting economic growth as some U.S. energy companies are already  reporting layoffs and spending freezes.  </p><p>       HERERA:  And tumbling oil prices is having a big impact north of the  border, where crude production is a driving force behind the Canadian  economy.  </p><p>       Brian Sullivan has more from Calgary.  </p><p>       (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>       BRIAN SULLIVAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   Here in Canada, oil's price collapse is front page news.  And while  consumers love the drop in the price of gas lane, the oil producers and the  government do not.  Rapidly falling oil prices are going to hit everything  from government budgets, to infrastructure building, to the Canadian dollar  and jobs.  </p><p>       Massive Canadian oil company Sun Corp just announced it will be  laying off 1,000 workers, and cutting a billion dollars from its capital  spending plan.  The potential downside is great enough that high ranking  government officials are speaking out about it.  </p><p>       JIM PRENTICE, ALBERTA PREMIER:  Oil prices continue to slip.  We  don't evidently -- haven't evidently seen the bottom yet, and this is  opened up an enormous revenue shortfall in terms of the Alberta  government's budget.  Quantified for next year, $6 billion to $7 billion,  $5 billion the year after that and $5 billion the year after if we don't  take action.  </p><p>       SULLIVAN:  Though finding an answer to the growing crisis is complex,  the cause of the problem is not.  The world is simply producing more oil  than it is using.  So, as supply and demand so out of whack, we asked an  oil economist, why don't the big oil producers simply cut back on  production?</p><p>       PETER TERTZAKIAN, ARC FINANCIAL CORP:  When you got a price for, all  try to offset by producing more.  So, it's a free for all for the moment.   But, you know, until we see the participants in the global thing start to  die off, we're going to see low prices.  </p><p>       SULLIVAN:  Canada's oil pain is not just a Canada story.  The stocks  in more than 70 major Canadian companies trade in the United States.  A  number of those are oil companies and they have been walloped.  Shares of  Baytex Energy, Penn West Petroleum, Enerplus and Precision Drilling  (NYSE:PDS) have seen their shares fall by more than 50 percent or even 60  percent in just a matter of months.  </p><p>       (on camera):  Some call Calgary the \"Houston of Canada\" because of  its strong job market and fast growth.  But much of that is tied to the  price of oil.  And if oil's price were to fall lower, or even stay at this  level for a long period of time, the building boom that you can clearly see  behind us may simply run out of gas.  </p><p>       For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Brian Sullivan in Calgary, Alberta,  Canada.  </p><p>       (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>       HERERA:  And still ahead, scaling back.  What the Republican- controlled House did today to two measures important to business.  </p><p>       (MUSIC)</p><p>       HERERA:  It was not a good day at J.P. Morgan Chase.  The nation's  biggest bank reported a 7 percent drop in earnings last quarter, getting  slammed by a billion dollars in legal costs and a decline in trading  revenue.  Shares fell 3 1/2 percent today, weighing heavily on the entire  financial sector.  </p><p>       MATHISEN:  Things were a little bit better at Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC),  the nation's biggest mortgage lender.  Net income rose more than $5  billion, thanks to higher revenue from loan interest payments.</p><p>       But chief financial officer John Shrewsberry says that growth is not  just from home loans.  </p><p>       (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>       JOHN SHREWSBERRY, WELLS FARGO CFO:  Loan growth for Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in the fourth quarter annualized, third to fourth quarter, grew  at 13 percent, which is as strong as it's been in some time.  So, some of  that is mortgage, some is autos, it's in credit cards, it's all categories  of commercial and industrial lending.  </p><p>       (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>       MATHISEN:  Despite that like a lot of other financials today, shares  of Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) closed lower.  They were down more than 1  percent.</p><p>       HERERA:  Mortgage applications took a big leap last week, the biggest  weekly jump, in fact, in six years -- thanks to near-record low interest  rates.  </p><p>       Diana Olick has the story from Washington.  </p><p>       (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>       DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Mortgage  applications spiked 49 percent last week and that was with the adjustment  for the New Year's holiday.  A sharp drop in interest rates, combined with  new reduced cost for FHC and Fannie Mae loans were behind the move.  Break  it out, refis were a big driver, a 66 percent week-to-week to the highest  level since July of 2013.  Jumbo refis quadrupled, of course, they're more  sensitive to interest rates.  </p><p>       Applications for a loan to purchase a home, up 24 percent from the  previous week.  They're also up 2 percent from a year ago, and that's the  first time in over a year that they've been higher annually.  </p><p>       All this as the average contract rate on the 30-year fix conforming  loan dropped to 3.89 percent.  That is the lowest level since May of 2013.  </p><p>       Adding to the momentum, Fannie Mae's new 3 percent down payment loan  and an announcement last week by FHA that it would cut annual insurance  premiums by half a percent.  That doesn't go into effect for a few weeks,  but borrowers are applying, and FHA is actually allowing borrowers who are  in process with the loan to cancel it and reapply under the new insurance  rates.  </p><p>       Lenders tell me that is huge.  One lender in northern Virginia calls  the response unbelievable.  He says people who have been debating buying a  home are now going ahead with pre-qualifications in the hopes they'll find  the house while rates are still low.  It all bodes well for the spring  housing market with one caveat.  More people may want to buy homes at the  new rate but there are still two few homes for sale.  It's a vicious circle  because people don't want to list their homes if they can't find something  else to buy.</p><p>       For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Diana Olick in Washington.  </p><p>       (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>       MATHISEN:  Moving to Washington now where the new Republican-led  Congress is trying to reverse President Obama's immigration policies and  roll back legislation regulating Wall Street banks.  </p><p>       John Harwood joins us now from Washington with more.</p><p>       John, let's start with the efforts to roll back or postpone, I guess,  some of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank law.  What does today's House vote  try to do here?  </p><p>       JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Well, what  they're trying to do is delay by two years the imposition of the Volcker  Rule.  Now, remember, this is something that wasn't originally in the Dodd- Frank bill.  So, this was added during the legislative process.  You could  have members of the financial community arguing that this was marginal to  the importance of Dodd-Frank and Republicans agree with that argument.   They're trying to roll it back.  </p><p>The administration has drawn a line and said, no, they accepted some  weakening of Dodd-Frank in legislation at the end of 2014, but they put a  veto threat on this bill.  Elizabeth Warren and Democratic liberals are  mobilizing against it.  </p><p>       So, it's future in the Republican-led Senate where Democrats have a  little more power because the power of the minority is very much in doubt.  </p><p>       HERERA:  Yes, it sounds like it's almost DOA.  I mean, is that a  correct read?  Or is there some hope?  </p><p>       HARWOOD:  Well, there's a whole lot, as you know, of lobbying going  on by Wall Street to try to target various portions of Dodd-Frank.  We  don't know where all of those efforts are going to lead.  I would say that,  as a stand-alone at this moment, it looks bleak but you could have back and  forth as other various pieces of legislation, including tax reform get  debated. </p><p>       MATHISEN:  All right.  So, now, let's move on to the other key vote  here.  The House vote that ties the funding of the Homeland Security  Department to undoing elements of the president's late last year executive  order on immigration.  </p><p>       Does this have any chance of passing in the Senate most especially?  </p><p>       HARWOOD:  More definitively, I would say it does not.  Harry Reid, in  fact, the Senate Democrat leader, put out a statement after the House  passed this bill saying, you might as well forget it.  This has no chance  of clearing the Senate of the United States.  </p><p>       In both of these cases, by the way, you had defection of significance  size within each party.  You had on the Dodd-Frank legislation, 29  Democrats joined Republicans to say, yes, we should put off the Volcker  Rule; 26 Republicans joined with Democrats to say, no, don't stop the  president on immigration.  </p><p>       MATHISEN:  All right, thanks very much, John.  John Harwood reporting  tonight from Washington.  </p><p>       HERERA:  Takeover talks sent BlackBerry spiking right before the  closing bell and that's where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\". </p><p>       Reuters is reporting that Samsung recently approached Blackberry  about a potential takeover.  It proposed an initial price range of between  $13 and $15.50 a share for the smartphone maker.  After the bell,  Blackberry responded saying it has not engaged in those reported  discussions. As you can see, Blackberry surged, closing about 30 percent to  $12.60, but then shares fell slightly after hours.  Samsung trades in  Korea.</p><p>       General Motors' 2015 financial outlook sent shares lower.  The  automaker expects to hike its capital expenditures by 20 percent this year  as it looks to grow its luxury brand.  But investors were disappointed when  the company's CFO said that there are no plans for a dividend hike.  Shares  fell almost 3 percent to $34.40.</p><p>       And one stock that participated in today's sell-off was Freeport  McMoRan.  The mining company was impacted by copper prices falling to a 5- year low.  Copper is a major part of the company's business.  Shares  plunged about 11 percent to $18.74.</p><p>       MATHISEN:  Tough day for shares of Foot Locker, too.  Goldman Sachs  (NYSE:GS) downgraded the stock to \"sell\" from \"neutral\" and lowered its  price target by $8.  It cited concerns that peak margins on basketball  sneakers may be a little risky.  Shares slumped 4 percent today to $53.21.   Its rival Finish Line fell, as we like to say, in sympathy about that.</p><p>       A unit of Caesars Entertainment will file for bankruptcy tomorrow in  Chicago, this according to a court filing.  A group of the casino  operator's bondholders have filed the papers to force the division into  involuntary Chapter 11.  Caesars has been trying to gain creditor's support  for a restructuring program.  Shares were up a fraction today to $12.71.</p><p>       And Chipotle has pulled pork of its menu at a third of its locations.   This after the company found out that one of its suppliers was not  complying with its animal treatment standards.  One supplier says it will  pick up the slack to help address the shortfall, but investors were  concerned after one analyst said the issue could impact the restaurants'  first-quarter results.  And shares were down today to $709.74, down $4.</p><p>Adobe saw its shares spike right after the close.  This as the  software company announced a new $2 billion stock buyback program.  The new  purchase plan will extend through 2017.  And shares rose initially after  hours.  Before the close, though, the stock was down slightly to $69.99.</p><p>       And coming up, the industry that's getting the attention of venture  capitalists out in Silicon Valley and raking in record money.  </p><p>       (MUSIC)</p><p>       HERERA:  If you're expecting to get a tax refund this year, be  prepared to wait a little longer to get it.  Because of budget cuts, the  IRS says that people who file paper tax returns may have to wait an extra  week or longer to get that refund.  The commissioner also said the IRS has  met any returns with errors will also face delays and fewer calls to the  help line will go unanswered.  </p><p>       On the other hand, those budget cuts may mean fewer audits as well.  </p><p>       MATHISEN:  Etsy is going public and planning to raise $300 million.   The Brooklyn-based seller of handmade crafts and hipster clothing -- this  is so not me -- a reportedly plans to have an initial public offering as  soon as this quarter.  </p><p>       HERERA:  Well, Ty, if vintage clothing and crafts are not your thing,  another place you may consider putting your money right now is health care  start-ups, which were attracting a lot of interest from some big tech  investors.  </p><p>       Josh Lipton has more. </p><p>       (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>       JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   Talked to venture capitalists in Silicon Valley and asked them which  industry they're most excited to revolutionize.  </p><p>       Odds are high that they'll say health care.  So, it's no surprise  that money is surging into start-ups that focus on that intersection of  health care and technology.  In 2014, venture funding for these start-ups  hit a record $4.1 billion.  That was a 125 percent year over year jump  according to Rock Health, which provides seed funding for startups.  Those  working in this sector say health care is undergoing a technology  transformation, with a range of startup aiming to make the industry more  efficient, convenient, and cost-effective.  </p><p>       One such start-up is Omada Health, which connects those at risk for  chronic diseases like diabetes to a comprehensive lifestyle program that  includes a personal health coach and digital support group.  The company's  CEO says start-ups like his are attracting attention and money in part  because there's now a new generation of entrepreneurs who are passionate  about both health care and tech.  </p><p>       SEAN DUFFY, OMADA HEALTH CEO:  I worked at Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)  before going to medical school.  Like I love -- I'm a huge techie.  I love  technology.  I love health care.  </p><p>       And, you know, you have entrepreneurs that are now able to combine  both and, you know, I think the venture capital investing community sees  the chance for the next wave of folks that really, you know, take health  care to a digital era.  </p><p>       LIPTON:  So, which start-ups in the space are most likely to go  public this year?  They're tracking the space, including Fitbit, the maker  of fitness trackers, ZocDoc, which allows users to all 50 states to find  and book appointments for doctors online, Practice Fusion, a Cloud-based  electronic health records provider, Proteus, which makes injectable  sensors, and 23andMe, which provides genetic reports on your ancestry and  family history.  </p><p>       One note of caution for investors, though, five digital health  companies went public in 2014 according to Rock Health, raising a total of  $1.7 billion.  But three of those five stocks are now selling at below  their offering price.  And enthusiasm for this sector could cool if that  trend continues this year.  </p><p>       For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Josh Lipton in Silicon Valley.  </p><p>       (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>       MATHISEN:  A recap now of another volatile and losing session on Wall  Street, and worries about the strength of the U.S. consumer and economic  growth globally.  The Dow off 186 points, half the losses from early in the  trading day.  NASDAQ was lower by 22.  The S&amp;P down 11.  Oil, a sharp jump  near the close, up 5.5 percent.  </p><p>       Dominic Chu is with us now.  </p><p>       Should we expect more of this, for example, tomorrow?  </p><p>       DOMINIC CHU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  You know, it's  interesting because we've become so accustom to not seeing these kinds of  swings.  </p><p>       MATHISEN:  Yes.</p><p>       CHU:  You forget that this kind of thing can happen from time to  time.  Over the course of the past, the Q.E. era, we'll call it, the Fed's  involvement in our markets -- we haven't seen a huge amount of volatility  for the move.  </p><p>       Tomorrow, it's going to be very interesting because you've got a  number of macro and micro, bigger picture economic things to consider, as  well as company specific details. </p><p>       On the macro front, you've got to worry about what's happening with  the manufacturing picture overall.  So, you've got the Philly Fed,  Philadelphia area manufacturing and the economy, also the Empire State,  that's New York.  </p><p>       Also, inflation data -- the producer price index comes up.  That's  going to be the macro picture.  </p><p>       On the micro front, tech and financial, the two most heavily weighted  sectors in the entire S&amp;P are going to be well-represented in earnings  tomorrow.  You've got the likes of Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Citi on  the financial side.  And then after the bell, you have Intel (NASDAQ:INTC),  one of the biggest chip producers in the world.  </p><p>       All of those are going to give you a picture of what's going to  happen with corporate America amidst this backdrop of volatility. </p><p>       HERERA:  I will be interested to see whether intel talks about  currency and the impact of the stronger dollar on its earnings.  </p><p>       CHU:  I would be surprised if any large cap company with  international exposure does not talk about the strength of the dollar in  terms of their earnings report.  That's going to be a real key.  </p><p>       MATHISEN:  And as you say, volatility is back.  2014, very low.   2015, so far, everyday has been a 100 point-day --  </p><p>       CHU:  Sure.</p><p>       MATHISEN:  -- with some moves end up and down.  But all of them had  100 points in them somewhere for the Dow.  </p><p>       CHU:  You know, it's interesting.  There's a lot of experts say that  this is one of those times you're going to have to deal with that kind of  volatility.  Maybe not run for the exits, but still, buckle your safety  belts.  </p><p>       HERERA:  All right.</p><p>       MATHISEN:  Dom, thank you very much.</p><p>       CHU:  Sure.</p><p>       MATHISEN:  Dominic Chu.  </p><p>       HERERA:  And that will do it for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.   I'm Sue Herera.  Thanks for joining us.  </p><p>       MATHISEN:  And I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Have a great evening, everybody.   And we will hope to see you right back here tomorrow night.  </p><p> END</p><p> Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

Money flees stocks and floods the bond market on concerns over the health of the global economy. Is the U.S. strong enough to withstand weakness overseas?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Retail route. Many thought consumers would spend all that money that they`ve been saving from cheap gas. But, today, we found out they didn`t.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MATHISEN: And the Houston of Canada. How the dropping crude is sending a chill across the heart of Canada`s energy industry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Wednesday, January 14th.</p><p>HERERA: Good evening, everyone.</p><p>Another rough and unpredictable day on Wall Street with the major averages falling for the fourth straight session amid concerns about the strength of the U.S. consumer and the U.S. economy.</p><p>The big driver for today`s selloff: retail sales falling nearly one percent in December, despite deep discounts, lower gas prices and a robust labor market. That, combined with more volatility and oil prices and a lower forecast for global economic growth, it sent stocks on another wild ride. The Dow cut an early 350 point loss in half, ending the session down 186 points, the NASDAQ lower by 22, and the S&amp;P was down 11 points.</p><p>In the bond market, the yield on 30-year treasuries hit record lows while the yield on the benchmark ten-year note hit the lowest level in nearly two years.</p><p>Crude bounced between losses and gains spiking higher into the close, up 5.5 percent to $48.48 a barrel, its biggest one day percent gain since June of 2012.</p><p>So, with gas prices down and retail sales falling, what is the state of the U.S. consumer right now?</p><p>Steve Liesman takes a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Plunging oil prices have raised a few economic puzzles. First, since the U.S. is now such a huge oil producers, wouldn`t it be a drag on the economy or a benefit? Second, and this is key to the first, what will consumers do with the windfall? Save it, spend it, or pay down debt?</p><p>Disappointing retail sales in December suggest consumers parting only reluctantly with those extra petro dollars in their pocket.</p><p>LIZ DUNN, TALMAGE ADVISORS FOUNDER &amp; CEO: The consumer is cautious and waiting to see if this gas price thing is real, and I think they take a while before they adjust their spending pattern.</p><p>LIESMAN: To be sure, the case is not closed. Consumer spending was strong in October and November, leaving some economists to forecast the fourth quarter growth will sport the best consumer spending number since the Great Recession ended. The December data may yet be revised and just because consumers took a break doesn`t mean the windfall won`t find its way into more cash registers in January and beyond.</p><p>MICHELLE MEYER, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH GLOBAL RESEARCH: I think it`s a blip in an otherwise strong trend for the consumer because look at the consumer backdrop. Healthy job growth, increase in disposable income, savings from the dropping gasoline prices, lower interest rates, wealth appreciation and consumer sentiment is improving.</p><p>LIESMAN (on camera): Now, let`s go back to the first question. Is the plunge in oil good or bad for the U.S. economy? Right now, stock markets see only the negative -- plunging oil profits and oil stock prices. Soon enough, capital spending could take a hit as producers scale back on drilling new wells. And then, there`s the uncertainty. Are oil prices down because demand and growth are weak worldwide?</p><p>(voice-over): Now, it`s clear why the consumer is so key. Spending should be the opposite of the petro pessimism. But so far, it`s not. The rule of thumb is that every $10 a barrel decline in oil means an extra quarter point to growth.</p><p>But right now, the rule is being challenged, as are the optimists who see lower oil prices as a positive for the U.S. economy but are still waiting for proof.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Steve Liesman.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: We are two weeks away now from the Federal Reserve`s first policy setting meeting of the New Year. And today, the Fed is out with its latest Beige Book survey of economic conditions around the nation, a page turner. Businesses report modest to moderate growth across all 12 central bank regions helped by strong auto sales, a pickup in tourism and increased manufacturing. But that big drop in oil prices starting to impact Texas, says the Fed, and the other energy-producing regions.</p><p>HERERA: Another factor weighing on the markets today, global growth concerns. Here to talk about this and what means for investors is John Canally. He`s the chief economist strategist at LPL Financial.</p><p>Welcome, John. Nice to have you here.</p><p>JOHN CANALLY, LPL FINANCIAL, CHIEF ECONOMIC STRATEGIST: Good to be here.</p><p>HERERA: Tell me what this market is telling you about global growth, or perhaps the lack of it. There`s a lot of fear of deflation out there lately.</p><p>CANALLY: Yes, there is. And the ECB is working on that. They got that ruling today from the European court of justice that will allow them to do this sovereign quantitative easing next Thursday. So, that`s a plus for global growth, but there`s other concerns as well. Will the quantitative easing that Japan has been doing for the last year, will that start the work? Will China finally come out and say that they aren`t going to grow at 7 percent next year, they`re going to go at 6 1/2 percent, but will they do some other kind of fiscal and monetary stimulus on top of that?</p><p>And then taking it back to the U.S. here, the weak retail sales data this morning, kind of was the clincher and said, man, if the U.S. consumer isn`t growing, then the U.S. isn`t growing, then maybe we do have a global growth scare.</p><p>So, I think all that weighed on the market early. But as you mentioned, later in the day, the Beige Book came around, which is a much larger view of the U.S. economy, and that pretty much said things were OK, not great, but we`re still sort of in a muddle through phase here as we wait for big events to unfold -- the ECB, China, things like that.</p><p>MATHISEN: John, we spend a tremendous time asking our guests, how low oil go? Tonight, the question tonight, how low will bond yields go? The 30-year bond yield now, at the lowest on record. Ten years at 1.8 percent or thereabouts.</p><p>What are they saying? What is the danger signal here, if any? And what should investors do if they own bonds?</p><p>CANALLY: Yes, that`s the thing. I mean, is the bond market sending a signal because yields are at all time lows? I think if you were getting other signals from the economy, and consumer confidence was falling sharply instead of rising. If auto sales were at a 10-year low instead of a 10- year high, that would be a concern.</p><p>If you`ve seen things like retail sales, the weekly retail sales we get, if we get that and that was weak, that would be a signal that the bond market is telling us something. What we`re seeing though is the opposite.</p><p>It`s sort of the opposite of what happened in 2008. In 2008, we saw a big drop in bond yields and it was a global growth signal. Today, it`s probably a signal of global deflation, disinflation rather than global growth. And I think there`s things that are going to help that, but it may be a couple of weeks, a couple of months before markets are convinced that it`s going to work.</p><p>HERERA: So, John, what I think I hear you saying is that the U.S. is the strongest around the globe right now, but is it strong enough to survive a global either disinflation or deflationary cycle?</p><p>CANALLY: Yes, I think it`s important to remember that U.S. GDP is not S&amp;P. So, S&amp;P 500 profit is about 30 to 40 percent of those profits are derived from overseas. So, the stock market, financial markets are going to get a lot more volatile around the global growth scare.</p><p>The U.S. economy, maybe 10 percent to 15 percent relying on exports, but the other 85 percent to 95 percent is really just U.S. growth. And that looks fine. And, you know, as we`ve been saying that the U.S. is sort of the cleanest shirt in the hamper, or the best house on a bad street.</p><p>And as people look around the globe, they ask themselves where they want to be this year in terms of investing. Most likely it is in the U.S. until China can show its cards until the ECB can do what it does and until the Japan can do more.</p><p>So, I think from that perspective, I think the U.S. will be fine, simply because U.S. S&amp;P 500 is a lot different than the make-up of our economy.</p><p>HERERA: The make-up.</p><p>All right, John. Thank you so much for that. We appreciate it. Chief economist at LPL Financial.</p><p>And more now on the impact of plunging energy costs. U.S. import prices saw their biggest drop in six years in December, tumbling 2.5 percent. That is the sixth month in a row of declines in import prices, keeping inflation in check.</p><p>MATHISEN: More detail now from that Beige Book survey out today, regarding the slide in oil prices. The Fed says the recent plunge in crude may be hurting economic growth as some U.S. energy companies are already reporting layoffs and spending freezes.</p><p>HERERA: And tumbling oil prices is having a big impact north of the border, where crude production is a driving force behind the Canadian economy.</p><p>Brian Sullivan has more from Calgary.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRIAN SULLIVAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Here in Canada, oil`s price collapse is front page news. And while consumers love the drop in the price of gas lane, the oil producers and the government do not. Rapidly falling oil prices are going to hit everything from government budgets, to infrastructure building, to the Canadian dollar and jobs.</p><p>Massive Canadian oil company Sun Corp just announced it will be laying off 1,000 workers, and cutting a billion dollars from its capital spending plan. The potential downside is great enough that high ranking government officials are speaking out about it.</p><p>JIM PRENTICE, ALBERTA PREMIER: Oil prices continue to slip. We don`t evidently -- haven`t evidently seen the bottom yet, and this is opened up an enormous revenue shortfall in terms of the Alberta government`s budget. Quantified for next year, $6 billion to $7 billion, $5 billion the year after that and $5 billion the year after if we don`t take action.</p><p>SULLIVAN: Though finding an answer to the growing crisis is complex, the cause of the problem is not. The world is simply producing more oil than it is using. So, as supply and demand so out of whack, we asked an oil economist, why don`t the big oil producers simply cut back on production?</p><p>PETER TERTZAKIAN, ARC FINANCIAL CORP: When you got a price for, all try to offset by producing more. So, it`s a free for all for the moment. But, you know, until we see the participants in the global thing start to die off, we`re going to see low prices.</p><p>SULLIVAN: Canada`s oil pain is not just a Canada story. The stocks in more than 70 major Canadian companies trade in the United States. A number of those are oil companies and they have been walloped. Shares of Baytex Energy, Penn West Petroleum, Enerplus and Precision Drilling (NYSE:PDS) have seen their shares fall by more than 50 percent or even 60 percent in just a matter of months.</p><p>(on camera): Some call Calgary the \"Houston of Canada\" because of its strong job market and fast growth. But much of that is tied to the price of oil. And if oil`s price were to fall lower, or even stay at this level for a long period of time, the building boom that you can clearly see behind us may simply run out of gas.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Brian Sullivan in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: And still ahead, scaling back. What the Republican- controlled House did today to two measures important to business.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: It was not a good day at J.P. Morgan Chase. The nation`s biggest bank reported a 7 percent drop in earnings last quarter, getting slammed by a billion dollars in legal costs and a decline in trading revenue. Shares fell 3 1/2 percent today, weighing heavily on the entire financial sector.</p><p>MATHISEN: Things were a little bit better at Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), the nation`s biggest mortgage lender. Net income rose more than $5 billion, thanks to higher revenue from loan interest payments.</p><p>But chief financial officer John Shrewsberry says that growth is not just from home loans.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN SHREWSBERRY, WELLS FARGO CFO: Loan growth for Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) in the fourth quarter annualized, third to fourth quarter, grew at 13 percent, which is as strong as it`s been in some time. So, some of that is mortgage, some is autos, it`s in credit cards, it`s all categories of commercial and industrial lending.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATHISEN: Despite that like a lot of other financials today, shares of Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) closed lower. They were down more than 1 percent.</p><p>HERERA: Mortgage applications took a big leap last week, the biggest weekly jump, in fact, in six years -- thanks to near-record low interest rates.</p><p>Diana Olick has the story from Washington.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Mortgage applications spiked 49 percent last week and that was with the adjustment for the New Year`s holiday. A sharp drop in interest rates, combined with new reduced cost for FHC and Fannie Mae loans were behind the move. Break it out, refis were a big driver, a 66 percent week-to-week to the highest level since July of 2013. Jumbo refis quadrupled, of course, they`re more sensitive to interest rates.</p><p>Applications for a loan to purchase a home, up 24 percent from the previous week. They`re also up 2 percent from a year ago, and that`s the first time in over a year that they`ve been higher annually.</p><p>All this as the average contract rate on the 30-year fix conforming loan dropped to 3.89 percent. That is the lowest level since May of 2013.</p><p>Adding to the momentum, Fannie Mae`s new 3 percent down payment loan and an announcement last week by FHA that it would cut annual insurance premiums by half a percent. That doesn`t go into effect for a few weeks, but borrowers are applying, and FHA is actually allowing borrowers who are in process with the loan to cancel it and reapply under the new insurance rates.</p><p>Lenders tell me that is huge. One lender in northern Virginia calls the response unbelievable. He says people who have been debating buying a home are now going ahead with pre-qualifications in the hopes they`ll find the house while rates are still low. It all bodes well for the spring housing market with one caveat. More people may want to buy homes at the new rate but there are still two few homes for sale. It`s a vicious circle because people don`t want to list their homes if they can`t find something else to buy.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Moving to Washington now where the new Republican-led Congress is trying to reverse President Obama`s immigration policies and roll back legislation regulating Wall Street banks.</p><p>John Harwood joins us now from Washington with more.</p><p>John, let`s start with the efforts to roll back or postpone, I guess, some of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank law. What does today`s House vote try to do here?</p><p>JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Well, what they`re trying to do is delay by two years the imposition of the Volcker Rule. Now, remember, this is something that wasn`t originally in the Dodd- Frank bill. So, this was added during the legislative process. You could have members of the financial community arguing that this was marginal to the importance of Dodd-Frank and Republicans agree with that argument. They`re trying to roll it back.</p><p>The administration has drawn a line and said, no, they accepted some weakening of Dodd-Frank in legislation at the end of 2014, but they put a veto threat on this bill. Elizabeth Warren and Democratic liberals are mobilizing against it.</p><p>So, it`s future in the Republican-led Senate where Democrats have a little more power because the power of the minority is very much in doubt.</p><p>HERERA: Yes, it sounds like it`s almost DOA. I mean, is that a correct read? Or is there some hope?</p><p>HARWOOD: Well, there`s a whole lot, as you know, of lobbying going on by Wall Street to try to target various portions of Dodd-Frank. We don`t know where all of those efforts are going to lead. I would say that, as a stand-alone at this moment, it looks bleak but you could have back and forth as other various pieces of legislation, including tax reform get debated.</p><p>MATHISEN: All right. So, now, let`s move on to the other key vote here. The House vote that ties the funding of the Homeland Security Department to undoing elements of the president`s late last year executive order on immigration.</p><p>Does this have any chance of passing in the Senate most especially?</p><p>HARWOOD: More definitively, I would say it does not. Harry Reid, in fact, the Senate Democrat leader, put out a statement after the House passed this bill saying, you might as well forget it. This has no chance of clearing the Senate of the United States.</p><p>In both of these cases, by the way, you had defection of significance size within each party. You had on the Dodd-Frank legislation, 29 Democrats joined Republicans to say, yes, we should put off the Volcker Rule; 26 Republicans joined with Democrats to say, no, don`t stop the president on immigration.</p><p>MATHISEN: All right, thanks very much, John. John Harwood reporting tonight from Washington.</p><p>HERERA: Takeover talks sent BlackBerry spiking right before the closing bell and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>Reuters is reporting that Samsung recently approached Blackberry about a potential takeover. It proposed an initial price range of between $13 and $15.50 a share for the smartphone maker. After the bell, Blackberry responded saying it has not engaged in those reported discussions. As you can see, Blackberry surged, closing about 30 percent to $12.60, but then shares fell slightly after hours. Samsung trades in Korea.</p><p>General Motors` 2015 financial outlook sent shares lower. The automaker expects to hike its capital expenditures by 20 percent this year as it looks to grow its luxury brand. But investors were disappointed when the company`s CFO said that there are no plans for a dividend hike. Shares fell almost 3 percent to $34.40.</p><p>And one stock that participated in today`s sell-off was Freeport McMoRan. The mining company was impacted by copper prices falling to a 5- year low. Copper is a major part of the company`s business. Shares plunged about 11 percent to $18.74.</p><p>MATHISEN: Tough day for shares of Foot Locker, too. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) downgraded the stock to \"sell\" from \"neutral\" and lowered its price target by $8. It cited concerns that peak margins on basketball sneakers may be a little risky. Shares slumped 4 percent today to $53.21. Its rival Finish Line fell, as we like to say, in sympathy about that.</p><p>A unit of Caesars Entertainment will file for bankruptcy tomorrow in Chicago, this according to a court filing. A group of the casino operator`s bondholders have filed the papers to force the division into involuntary Chapter 11. Caesars has been trying to gain creditor`s support for a restructuring program. Shares were up a fraction today to $12.71.</p><p>And Chipotle has pulled pork of its menu at a third of its locations. This after the company found out that one of its suppliers was not complying with its animal treatment standards. One supplier says it will pick up the slack to help address the shortfall, but investors were concerned after one analyst said the issue could impact the restaurants` first-quarter results. And shares were down today to $709.74, down $4.</p><p>Adobe saw its shares spike right after the close. This as the software company announced a new $2 billion stock buyback program. The new purchase plan will extend through 2017. And shares rose initially after hours. Before the close, though, the stock was down slightly to $69.99.</p><p>And coming up, the industry that`s getting the attention of venture capitalists out in Silicon Valley and raking in record money.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: If you`re expecting to get a tax refund this year, be prepared to wait a little longer to get it. Because of budget cuts, the IRS says that people who file paper tax returns may have to wait an extra week or longer to get that refund. The commissioner also said the IRS has met any returns with errors will also face delays and fewer calls to the help line will go unanswered.</p><p>On the other hand, those budget cuts may mean fewer audits as well.</p><p>MATHISEN: Etsy is going public and planning to raise $300 million. The Brooklyn-based seller of handmade crafts and hipster clothing -- this is so not me -- a reportedly plans to have an initial public offering as soon as this quarter.</p><p>HERERA: Well, Ty, if vintage clothing and crafts are not your thing, another place you may consider putting your money right now is health care start-ups, which were attracting a lot of interest from some big tech investors.</p><p>Josh Lipton has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Talked to venture capitalists in Silicon Valley and asked them which industry they`re most excited to revolutionize.</p><p>Odds are high that they`ll say health care. So, it`s no surprise that money is surging into start-ups that focus on that intersection of health care and technology. In 2014, venture funding for these start-ups hit a record $4.1 billion. That was a 125 percent year over year jump according to Rock Health, which provides seed funding for startups. Those working in this sector say health care is undergoing a technology transformation, with a range of startup aiming to make the industry more efficient, convenient, and cost-effective.</p><p>One such start-up is Omada Health, which connects those at risk for chronic diseases like diabetes to a comprehensive lifestyle program that includes a personal health coach and digital support group. The company`s CEO says start-ups like his are attracting attention and money in part because there`s now a new generation of entrepreneurs who are passionate about both health care and tech.</p><p>SEAN DUFFY, OMADA HEALTH CEO: I worked at Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) before going to medical school. Like I love -- I`m a huge techie. I love technology. I love health care.</p><p>And, you know, you have entrepreneurs that are now able to combine both and, you know, I think the venture capital investing community sees the chance for the next wave of folks that really, you know, take health care to a digital era.</p><p>LIPTON: So, which start-ups in the space are most likely to go public this year? They`re tracking the space, including Fitbit, the maker of fitness trackers, ZocDoc, which allows users to all 50 states to find and book appointments for doctors online, Practice Fusion, a Cloud-based electronic health records provider, Proteus, which makes injectable sensors, and 23andMe, which provides genetic reports on your ancestry and family history.</p><p>One note of caution for investors, though, five digital health companies went public in 2014 according to Rock Health, raising a total of $1.7 billion. But three of those five stocks are now selling at below their offering price. And enthusiasm for this sector could cool if that trend continues this year.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Josh Lipton in Silicon Valley.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: A recap now of another volatile and losing session on Wall Street, and worries about the strength of the U.S. consumer and economic growth globally. The Dow off 186 points, half the losses from early in the trading day. NASDAQ was lower by 22. The S&amp;P down 11. Oil, a sharp jump near the close, up 5.5 percent.</p><p>Dominic Chu is with us now.</p><p>Should we expect more of this, for example, tomorrow?</p><p>DOMINIC CHU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: You know, it`s interesting because we`ve become so accustom to not seeing these kinds of swings.</p><p>MATHISEN: Yes.</p><p>CHU: You forget that this kind of thing can happen from time to time. Over the course of the past, the Q.E. era, we`ll call it, the Fed`s involvement in our markets -- we haven`t seen a huge amount of volatility for the move.</p><p>Tomorrow, it`s going to be very interesting because you`ve got a number of macro and micro, bigger picture economic things to consider, as well as company specific details.</p><p>On the macro front, you`ve got to worry about what`s happening with the manufacturing picture overall. So, you`ve got the Philly Fed, Philadelphia area manufacturing and the economy, also the Empire State, that`s New York.</p><p>Also, inflation data -- the producer price index comes up. That`s going to be the macro picture.</p><p>On the micro front, tech and financial, the two most heavily weighted sectors in the entire S&amp;P are going to be well-represented in earnings tomorrow. You`ve got the likes of Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Citi on the financial side. And then after the bell, you have Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), one of the biggest chip producers in the world.</p><p>All of those are going to give you a picture of what`s going to happen with corporate America amidst this backdrop of volatility.</p><p>HERERA: I will be interested to see whether intel talks about currency and the impact of the stronger dollar on its earnings.</p><p>CHU: I would be surprised if any large cap company with international exposure does not talk about the strength of the dollar in terms of their earnings report. That`s going to be a real key.</p><p>MATHISEN: And as you say, volatility is back. 2014, very low. 2015, so far, everyday has been a 100 point-day --</p><p>CHU: Sure.</p><p>MATHISEN: -- with some moves end up and down. But all of them had 100 points in them somewhere for the Dow.</p><p>CHU: You know, it`s interesting. There`s a lot of experts say that this is one of those times you`re going to have to deal with that kind of volatility. Maybe not run for the exits, but still, buckle your safety belts.</p><p>HERERA: All right.</p><p>MATHISEN: Dom, thank you very much.</p><p>CHU: Sure.</p><p>MATHISEN: Dominic Chu.</p><p>HERERA: And that will do it for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I`m Sue Herera. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>MATHISEN: And I`m Tyler Mathisen. Have a great evening, everybody. And we will hope to see you right back here tomorrow night.</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

Money flees stocks and floods the bond market on concerns over the health of the global economy. Is the U.S. strong enough to withstand weakness overseas?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: Retail route. Many thought consumers would spend all that money that they've been saving from cheap gas. But, today, we found out they didn't.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MATHISEN: And the Houston of Canada. How the dropping crude is sending a chill across the heart of Canada's energy industry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Wednesday, January 14th.</p><p>HERERA: Good evening, everyone.</p><p>Another rough and unpredictable day on Wall Street with the major averages falling for the fourth straight session amid concerns about the strength of the U.S. consumer and the U.S. economy.</p><p>The big driver for today's selloff: retail sales falling nearly one percent in December, despite deep discounts, lower gas prices and a robust labor market. That, combined with more volatility and oil prices and a lower forecast for global economic growth, it sent stocks on another wild ride. The Dow cut an early 350 point loss in half, ending the session down 186 points, the NASDAQ lower by 22, and the S&amp;P was down 11 points.</p><p>In the bond market, the yield on 30-year treasuries hit record lows while the yield on the benchmark ten-year note hit the lowest level in nearly two years.</p><p>Crude bounced between losses and gains spiking higher into the close, up 5.5 percent to $48.48 a barrel, its biggest one day percent gain since June of 2012.</p><p>So, with gas prices down and retail sales falling, what is the state of the U.S. consumer right now?</p><p>Steve Liesman takes a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Plunging oil prices have raised a few economic puzzles. First, since the U.S. is now such a huge oil producers, wouldn't it be a drag on the economy or a benefit? Second, and this is key to the first, what will consumers do with the windfall? Save it, spend it, or pay down debt?</p><p>Disappointing retail sales in December suggest consumers parting only reluctantly with those extra petro dollars in their pocket.</p><p>LIZ DUNN, TALMAGE ADVISORS FOUNDER &amp; CEO: The consumer is cautious and waiting to see if this gas price thing is real, and I think they take a while before they adjust their spending pattern.</p><p>LIESMAN: To be sure, the case is not closed. Consumer spending was strong in October and November, leaving some economists to forecast the fourth quarter growth will sport the best consumer spending number since the Great Recession ended. The December data may yet be revised and just because consumers took a break doesn't mean the windfall won't find its way into more cash registers in January and beyond.</p><p>MICHELLE MEYER, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH GLOBAL RESEARCH: I think it's a blip in an otherwise strong trend for the consumer because look at the consumer backdrop. Healthy job growth, increase in disposable income, savings from the dropping gasoline prices, lower interest rates, wealth appreciation and consumer sentiment is improving.</p><p>LIESMAN (on camera): Now, let's go back to the first question. Is the plunge in oil good or bad for the U.S. economy? Right now, stock markets see only the negative -- plunging oil profits and oil stock prices. Soon enough, capital spending could take a hit as producers scale back on drilling new wells. And then, there's the uncertainty. Are oil prices down because demand and growth are weak worldwide?</p><p>(voice-over): Now, it's clear why the consumer is so key. Spending should be the opposite of the petro pessimism. But so far, it's not. The rule of thumb is that every $10 a barrel decline in oil means an extra quarter point to growth.</p><p>But right now, the rule is being challenged, as are the optimists who see lower oil prices as a positive for the U.S. economy but are still waiting for proof.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Steve Liesman.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: We are two weeks away now from the Federal Reserve's first policy setting meeting of the New Year. And today, the Fed is out with its latest Beige Book survey of economic conditions around the nation, a page turner. Businesses report modest to moderate growth across all 12 central bank regions helped by strong auto sales, a pickup in tourism and increased manufacturing. But that big drop in oil prices starting to impact Texas, says the Fed, and the other energy-producing regions.</p><p>HERERA: Another factor weighing on the markets today, global growth concerns. Here to talk about this and what means for investors is John Canally. He's the chief economist strategist at LPL Financial.</p><p>Welcome, John. Nice to have you here.</p><p>JOHN CANALLY, LPL FINANCIAL, CHIEF ECONOMIC STRATEGIST: Good to be here.</p><p>HERERA: Tell me what this market is telling you about global growth, or perhaps the lack of it. There's a lot of fear of deflation out there lately.</p><p>CANALLY: Yes, there is. And the ECB is working on that. They got that ruling today from the European court of justice that will allow them to do this sovereign quantitative easing next Thursday. So, that's a plus for global growth, but there's other concerns as well. Will the quantitative easing that Japan has been doing for the last year, will that start the work? Will China finally come out and say that they aren't going to grow at 7 percent next year, they're going to go at 6 1/2 percent, but will they do some other kind of fiscal and monetary stimulus on top of that?</p><p>And then taking it back to the U.S. here, the weak retail sales data this morning, kind of was the clincher and said, man, if the U.S. consumer isn't growing, then the U.S. isn't growing, then maybe we do have a global growth scare.</p><p>So, I think all that weighed on the market early. But as you mentioned, later in the day, the Beige Book came around, which is a much larger view of the U.S. economy, and that pretty much said things were OK, not great, but we're still sort of in a muddle through phase here as we wait for big events to unfold -- the ECB, China, things like that.</p><p>MATHISEN: John, we spend a tremendous time asking our guests, how low oil go? Tonight, the question tonight, how low will bond yields go? The 30-year bond yield now, at the lowest on record. Ten years at 1.8 percent or thereabouts.</p><p>What are they saying? What is the danger signal here, if any? And what should investors do if they own bonds?</p><p>CANALLY: Yes, that's the thing. I mean, is the bond market sending a signal because yields are at all time lows? I think if you were getting other signals from the economy, and consumer confidence was falling sharply instead of rising. If auto sales were at a 10-year low instead of a 10- year high, that would be a concern.</p><p>If you've seen things like retail sales, the weekly retail sales we get, if we get that and that was weak, that would be a signal that the bond market is telling us something. What we're seeing though is the opposite.</p><p>It's sort of the opposite of what happened in 2008. In 2008, we saw a big drop in bond yields and it was a global growth signal. Today, it's probably a signal of global deflation, disinflation rather than global growth. And I think there's things that are going to help that, but it may be a couple of weeks, a couple of months before markets are convinced that it's going to work.</p><p>HERERA: So, John, what I think I hear you saying is that the U.S. is the strongest around the globe right now, but is it strong enough to survive a global either disinflation or deflationary cycle?</p><p>CANALLY: Yes, I think it's important to remember that U.S. GDP is not S&amp;P. So, S&amp;P 500 profit is about 30 to 40 percent of those profits are derived from overseas. So, the stock market, financial markets are going to get a lot more volatile around the global growth scare.</p><p>The U.S. economy, maybe 10 percent to 15 percent relying on exports, but the other 85 percent to 95 percent is really just U.S. growth. And that looks fine. And, you know, as we've been saying that the U.S. is sort of the cleanest shirt in the hamper, or the best house on a bad street.</p><p>And as people look around the globe, they ask themselves where they want to be this year in terms of investing. Most likely it is in the U.S. until China can show its cards until the ECB can do what it does and until the Japan can do more.</p><p>So, I think from that perspective, I think the U.S. will be fine, simply because U.S. S&amp;P 500 is a lot different than the make-up of our economy.</p><p>HERERA: The make-up.</p><p>All right, John. Thank you so much for that. We appreciate it. Chief economist at LPL Financial.</p><p>And more now on the impact of plunging energy costs. U.S. import prices saw their biggest drop in six years in December, tumbling 2.5 percent. That is the sixth month in a row of declines in import prices, keeping inflation in check.</p><p>MATHISEN: More detail now from that Beige Book survey out today, regarding the slide in oil prices. The Fed says the recent plunge in crude may be hurting economic growth as some U.S. energy companies are already reporting layoffs and spending freezes.</p><p>HERERA: And tumbling oil prices is having a big impact north of the border, where crude production is a driving force behind the Canadian economy.</p><p>Brian Sullivan has more from Calgary.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRIAN SULLIVAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Here in Canada, oil's price collapse is front page news. And while consumers love the drop in the price of gas lane, the oil producers and the government do not. Rapidly falling oil prices are going to hit everything from government budgets, to infrastructure building, to the Canadian dollar and jobs.</p><p>Massive Canadian oil company Sun Corp just announced it will be laying off 1,000 workers, and cutting a billion dollars from its capital spending plan. The potential downside is great enough that high ranking government officials are speaking out about it.</p><p>JIM PRENTICE, ALBERTA PREMIER: Oil prices continue to slip. We don't evidently -- haven't evidently seen the bottom yet, and this is opened up an enormous revenue shortfall in terms of the Alberta government's budget. Quantified for next year, $6 billion to $7 billion, $5 billion the year after that and $5 billion the year after if we don't take action.</p><p>SULLIVAN: Though finding an answer to the growing crisis is complex, the cause of the problem is not. The world is simply producing more oil than it is using. So, as supply and demand so out of whack, we asked an oil economist, why don't the big oil producers simply cut back on production?</p><p>PETER TERTZAKIAN, ARC FINANCIAL CORP: When you got a price for, all try to offset by producing more. So, it's a free for all for the moment. But, you know, until we see the participants in the global thing start to die off, we're going to see low prices.</p><p>SULLIVAN: Canada's oil pain is not just a Canada story. The stocks in more than 70 major Canadian companies trade in the United States. A number of those are oil companies and they have been walloped. Shares of Baytex Energy, Penn West Petroleum, Enerplus and Precision Drilling (NYSE:PDS) have seen their shares fall by more than 50 percent or even 60 percent in just a matter of months.</p><p>(on camera): Some call Calgary the \"Houston of Canada\" because of its strong job market and fast growth. But much of that is tied to the price of oil. And if oil's price were to fall lower, or even stay at this level for a long period of time, the building boom that you can clearly see behind us may simply run out of gas.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Brian Sullivan in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: And still ahead, scaling back. What the Republican- controlled House did today to two measures important to business.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: It was not a good day at J.P. Morgan Chase. The nation's biggest bank reported a 7 percent drop in earnings last quarter, getting slammed by a billion dollars in legal costs and a decline in trading revenue. Shares fell 3 1/2 percent today, weighing heavily on the entire financial sector.</p><p>MATHISEN: Things were a little bit better at Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), the nation's biggest mortgage lender. Net income rose more than $5 billion, thanks to higher revenue from loan interest payments.</p><p>But chief financial officer John Shrewsberry says that growth is not just from home loans.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN SHREWSBERRY, WELLS FARGO CFO: Loan growth for Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) in the fourth quarter annualized, third to fourth quarter, grew at 13 percent, which is as strong as it's been in some time. So, some of that is mortgage, some is autos, it's in credit cards, it's all categories of commercial and industrial lending.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATHISEN: Despite that like a lot of other financials today, shares of Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) closed lower. They were down more than 1 percent.</p><p>HERERA: Mortgage applications took a big leap last week, the biggest weekly jump, in fact, in six years -- thanks to near-record low interest rates.</p><p>Diana Olick has the story from Washington.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Mortgage applications spiked 49 percent last week and that was with the adjustment for the New Year's holiday. A sharp drop in interest rates, combined with new reduced cost for FHC and Fannie Mae loans were behind the move. Break it out, refis were a big driver, a 66 percent week-to-week to the highest level since July of 2013. Jumbo refis quadrupled, of course, they're more sensitive to interest rates.</p><p>Applications for a loan to purchase a home, up 24 percent from the previous week. They're also up 2 percent from a year ago, and that's the first time in over a year that they've been higher annually.</p><p>All this as the average contract rate on the 30-year fix conforming loan dropped to 3.89 percent. That is the lowest level since May of 2013.</p><p>Adding to the momentum, Fannie Mae's new 3 percent down payment loan and an announcement last week by FHA that it would cut annual insurance premiums by half a percent. That doesn't go into effect for a few weeks, but borrowers are applying, and FHA is actually allowing borrowers who are in process with the loan to cancel it and reapply under the new insurance rates.</p><p>Lenders tell me that is huge. One lender in northern Virginia calls the response unbelievable. He says people who have been debating buying a home are now going ahead with pre-qualifications in the hopes they'll find the house while rates are still low. It all bodes well for the spring housing market with one caveat. More people may want to buy homes at the new rate but there are still two few homes for sale. It's a vicious circle because people don't want to list their homes if they can't find something else to buy.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Moving to Washington now where the new Republican-led Congress is trying to reverse President Obama's immigration policies and roll back legislation regulating Wall Street banks.</p><p>John Harwood joins us now from Washington with more.</p><p>John, let's start with the efforts to roll back or postpone, I guess, some of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank law. What does today's House vote try to do here?</p><p>JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Well, what they're trying to do is delay by two years the imposition of the Volcker Rule. Now, remember, this is something that wasn't originally in the Dodd- Frank bill. So, this was added during the legislative process. You could have members of the financial community arguing that this was marginal to the importance of Dodd-Frank and Republicans agree with that argument. They're trying to roll it back.</p><p>The administration has drawn a line and said, no, they accepted some weakening of Dodd-Frank in legislation at the end of 2014, but they put a veto threat on this bill. Elizabeth Warren and Democratic liberals are mobilizing against it.</p><p>So, it's future in the Republican-led Senate where Democrats have a little more power because the power of the minority is very much in doubt.</p><p>HERERA: Yes, it sounds like it's almost DOA. I mean, is that a correct read? Or is there some hope?</p><p>HARWOOD: Well, there's a whole lot, as you know, of lobbying going on by Wall Street to try to target various portions of Dodd-Frank. We don't know where all of those efforts are going to lead. I would say that, as a stand-alone at this moment, it looks bleak but you could have back and forth as other various pieces of legislation, including tax reform get debated.</p><p>MATHISEN: All right. So, now, let's move on to the other key vote here. The House vote that ties the funding of the Homeland Security Department to undoing elements of the president's late last year executive order on immigration.</p><p>Does this have any chance of passing in the Senate most especially?</p><p>HARWOOD: More definitively, I would say it does not. Harry Reid, in fact, the Senate Democrat leader, put out a statement after the House passed this bill saying, you might as well forget it. This has no chance of clearing the Senate of the United States.</p><p>In both of these cases, by the way, you had defection of significance size within each party. You had on the Dodd-Frank legislation, 29 Democrats joined Republicans to say, yes, we should put off the Volcker Rule; 26 Republicans joined with Democrats to say, no, don't stop the president on immigration.</p><p>MATHISEN: All right, thanks very much, John. John Harwood reporting tonight from Washington.</p><p>HERERA: Takeover talks sent BlackBerry spiking right before the closing bell and that's where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".</p><p>Reuters is reporting that Samsung recently approached Blackberry about a potential takeover. It proposed an initial price range of between $13 and $15.50 a share for the smartphone maker. After the bell, Blackberry responded saying it has not engaged in those reported discussions. As you can see, Blackberry surged, closing about 30 percent to $12.60, but then shares fell slightly after hours. Samsung trades in Korea.</p><p>General Motors' 2015 financial outlook sent shares lower. The automaker expects to hike its capital expenditures by 20 percent this year as it looks to grow its luxury brand. But investors were disappointed when the company's CFO said that there are no plans for a dividend hike. Shares fell almost 3 percent to $34.40.</p><p>And one stock that participated in today's sell-off was Freeport McMoRan. The mining company was impacted by copper prices falling to a 5- year low. Copper is a major part of the company's business. Shares plunged about 11 percent to $18.74.</p><p>MATHISEN: Tough day for shares of Foot Locker, too. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) downgraded the stock to \"sell\" from \"neutral\" and lowered its price target by $8. It cited concerns that peak margins on basketball sneakers may be a little risky. Shares slumped 4 percent today to $53.21. Its rival Finish Line fell, as we like to say, in sympathy about that.</p><p>A unit of Caesars Entertainment will file for bankruptcy tomorrow in Chicago, this according to a court filing. A group of the casino operator's bondholders have filed the papers to force the division into involuntary Chapter 11. Caesars has been trying to gain creditor's support for a restructuring program. Shares were up a fraction today to $12.71.</p><p>And Chipotle has pulled pork of its menu at a third of its locations. This after the company found out that one of its suppliers was not complying with its animal treatment standards. One supplier says it will pick up the slack to help address the shortfall, but investors were concerned after one analyst said the issue could impact the restaurants' first-quarter results. And shares were down today to $709.74, down $4.</p><p>Adobe saw its shares spike right after the close. This as the software company announced a new $2 billion stock buyback program. The new purchase plan will extend through 2017. And shares rose initially after hours. Before the close, though, the stock was down slightly to $69.99.</p><p>And coming up, the industry that's getting the attention of venture capitalists out in Silicon Valley and raking in record money.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: If you're expecting to get a tax refund this year, be prepared to wait a little longer to get it. Because of budget cuts, the IRS says that people who file paper tax returns may have to wait an extra week or longer to get that refund. The commissioner also said the IRS has met any returns with errors will also face delays and fewer calls to the help line will go unanswered.</p><p>On the other hand, those budget cuts may mean fewer audits as well.</p><p>MATHISEN: Etsy is going public and planning to raise $300 million. The Brooklyn-based seller of handmade crafts and hipster clothing -- this is so not me -- a reportedly plans to have an initial public offering as soon as this quarter.</p><p>HERERA: Well, Ty, if vintage clothing and crafts are not your thing, another place you may consider putting your money right now is health care start-ups, which were attracting a lot of interest from some big tech investors.</p><p>Josh Lipton has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Talked to venture capitalists in Silicon Valley and asked them which industry they're most excited to revolutionize.</p><p>Odds are high that they'll say health care. So, it's no surprise that money is surging into start-ups that focus on that intersection of health care and technology. In 2014, venture funding for these start-ups hit a record $4.1 billion. That was a 125 percent year over year jump according to Rock Health, which provides seed funding for startups. Those working in this sector say health care is undergoing a technology transformation, with a range of startup aiming to make the industry more efficient, convenient, and cost-effective.</p><p>One such start-up is Omada Health, which connects those at risk for chronic diseases like diabetes to a comprehensive lifestyle program that includes a personal health coach and digital support group. The company's CEO says start-ups like his are attracting attention and money in part because there's now a new generation of entrepreneurs who are passionate about both health care and tech.</p><p>SEAN DUFFY, OMADA HEALTH CEO: I worked at Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) before going to medical school. Like I love -- I'm a huge techie. I love technology. I love health care.</p><p>And, you know, you have entrepreneurs that are now able to combine both and, you know, I think the venture capital investing community sees the chance for the next wave of folks that really, you know, take health care to a digital era.</p><p>LIPTON: So, which start-ups in the space are most likely to go public this year? They're tracking the space, including Fitbit, the maker of fitness trackers, ZocDoc, which allows users to all 50 states to find and book appointments for doctors online, Practice Fusion, a Cloud-based electronic health records provider, Proteus, which makes injectable sensors, and 23andMe, which provides genetic reports on your ancestry and family history.</p><p>One note of caution for investors, though, five digital health companies went public in 2014 according to Rock Health, raising a total of $1.7 billion. But three of those five stocks are now selling at below their offering price. And enthusiasm for this sector could cool if that trend continues this year.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Josh Lipton in Silicon Valley.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: A recap now of another volatile and losing session on Wall Street, and worries about the strength of the U.S. consumer and economic growth globally. The Dow off 186 points, half the losses from early in the trading day. NASDAQ was lower by 22. The S&amp;P down 11. Oil, a sharp jump near the close, up 5.5 percent.</p><p>Dominic Chu is with us now.</p><p>Should we expect more of this, for example, tomorrow?</p><p>DOMINIC CHU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: You know, it's interesting because we've become so accustom to not seeing these kinds of swings.</p><p>MATHISEN: Yes.</p><p>CHU: You forget that this kind of thing can happen from time to time. Over the course of the past, the Q.E. era, we'll call it, the Fed's involvement in our markets -- we haven't seen a huge amount of volatility for the move.</p><p>Tomorrow, it's going to be very interesting because you've got a number of macro and micro, bigger picture economic things to consider, as well as company specific details.</p><p>On the macro front, you've got to worry about what's happening with the manufacturing picture overall. So, you've got the Philly Fed, Philadelphia area manufacturing and the economy, also the Empire State, that's New York.</p><p>Also, inflation data -- the producer price index comes up. That's going to be the macro picture.</p><p>On the micro front, tech and financial, the two most heavily weighted sectors in the entire S&amp;P are going to be well-represented in earnings tomorrow. You've got the likes of Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Citi on the financial side. And then after the bell, you have Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), one of the biggest chip producers in the world.</p><p>All of those are going to give you a picture of what's going to happen with corporate America amidst this backdrop of volatility.</p><p>HERERA: I will be interested to see whether intel talks about currency and the impact of the stronger dollar on its earnings.</p><p>CHU: I would be surprised if any large cap company with international exposure does not talk about the strength of the dollar in terms of their earnings report. That's going to be a real key.</p><p>MATHISEN: And as you say, volatility is back. 2014, very low. 2015, so far, everyday has been a 100 point-day --</p><p>CHU: Sure.</p><p>MATHISEN: -- with some moves end up and down. But all of them had 100 points in them somewhere for the Dow.</p><p>CHU: You know, it's interesting. There's a lot of experts say that this is one of those times you're going to have to deal with that kind of volatility. Maybe not run for the exits, but still, buckle your safety belts.</p><p>HERERA: All right.</p><p>MATHISEN: Dom, thank you very much.</p><p>CHU: Sure.</p><p>MATHISEN: Dominic Chu.</p><p>HERERA: And that will do it for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight. I'm Sue Herera. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>MATHISEN: And I'm Tyler Mathisen. Have a great evening, everybody.

Money flees stocks and floods the bond market on concerns over the health  of the global economy.  Is the U.S. strong enough to withstand weakness  overseas?  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUE HERERA, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Retail route.  Many  thought consumers would spend all that money that they've been saving from  cheap gas.  But, today, we found out they didn't.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MATHISEN:  And the Houston of Canada.  How the dropping crude is  sending a chill across the heart of Canada's energy industry.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All that and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Wednesday,  January 14th.  </p><p>HERERA:  Good evening, everyone.  </p><p>Another rough and unpredictable day on Wall Street with the major  averages falling for the fourth straight session amid concerns about the  strength of the U.S. consumer and the U.S. economy.  </p><p>The big driver for today's selloff: retail sales falling nearly one  percent in December, despite deep discounts, lower gas prices and a robust  labor market.  That, combined with more volatility and oil prices and a  lower forecast for global economic growth, it sent stocks on another wild  ride.  The Dow cut an early 350 point loss in half, ending the session down  186 points, the NASDAQ lower by 22, and the S&amp;P was down 11 points.  </p><p>In the bond market, the yield on 30-year treasuries hit record lows  while the yield on the benchmark ten-year note hit the lowest level in  nearly two years.  </p><p>Crude bounced between losses and gains spiking higher into the close,  up 5.5 percent to $48.48 a barrel, its biggest one day percent gain since  June of 2012.</p><p>So, with gas prices down and retail sales falling, what is the state  of the U.S. consumer right now?  </p><p>Steve Liesman takes a look.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEVE LIESMAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   Plunging oil prices have raised a few economic puzzles.  First, since the  U.S. is now such a huge oil producers, wouldn't it be a drag on the economy  or a benefit?  Second, and this is key to the first, what will consumers do  with the windfall?  Save it, spend it, or pay down debt?  </p><p>Disappointing retail sales in December suggest consumers parting only  reluctantly with those extra petro dollars in their pocket.  </p><p>LIZ DUNN, TALMAGE ADVISORS FOUNDER &amp; CEO:  The consumer is cautious  and waiting to see if this gas price thing is real, and I think they take a  while before they adjust their spending pattern.  </p><p>LIESMAN:  To be sure, the case is not closed.  Consumer spending was  strong in October and November, leaving some economists to forecast the  fourth quarter growth will sport the best consumer spending number since  the Great Recession ended.  The December data may yet be revised and just  because consumers took a break doesn't mean the windfall won't find its way  into more cash registers in January and beyond.  </p><p>MICHELLE MEYER, BOFAMERRILL LYNCH GLOBAL RESEARCH:  I think it's a  blip in an otherwise strong trend for the consumer because look at the  consumer backdrop.  Healthy job growth, increase in disposable income,  savings from the dropping gasoline prices, lower interest rates, wealth  appreciation and consumer sentiment is improving.  </p><p>LIESMAN (on camera):  Now, let's go back to the first question.  Is  the plunge in oil good or bad for the U.S. economy?  Right now, stock  markets see only the negative -- plunging oil profits and oil stock prices.   Soon enough, capital spending could take a hit as producers scale back on  drilling new wells.  And then, there's the uncertainty.  Are oil prices  down because demand and growth are weak worldwide? </p><p>(voice-over):  Now, it's clear why the consumer is so key.  Spending  should be the opposite of the petro pessimism.  But so far, it's not.  The  rule of thumb is that every $10 a barrel decline in oil means an extra  quarter point to growth.  </p><p>But right now, the rule is being challenged, as are the optimists who  see lower oil prices as a positive for the U.S. economy but are still  waiting for proof. </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Steve Liesman.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  We are two weeks away now from the Federal Reserve's first  policy setting meeting of the New Year.  And today, the Fed is out with its  latest Beige Book survey of economic conditions around the nation, a page  turner.  Businesses report modest to moderate growth across all 12 central  bank regions helped by strong auto sales, a pickup in tourism and increased  manufacturing.  But that big drop in oil prices starting to impact Texas,  says the Fed, and the other energy-producing regions.  </p><p>HERERA:  Another factor weighing on the markets today, global growth  concerns.  Here to talk about this and what means for investors is John  Canally.  He's the chief economist strategist at LPL Financial.  </p><p>Welcome, John.  Nice to have you here.  </p><p>JOHN CANALLY, LPL FINANCIAL, CHIEF ECONOMIC STRATEGIST:  Good to be  here.  </p><p>HERERA:  Tell me what this market is telling you about global growth,  or perhaps the lack of it.  There's a lot of fear of deflation out there  lately.  </p><p>CANALLY:  Yes, there is.  And the ECB is working on that.  They got  that ruling today from the European court of justice that will allow them  to do this sovereign quantitative easing next Thursday.  So, that's a plus  for global growth, but there's other concerns as well.  Will the  quantitative easing that Japan has been doing for the last year, will that  start the work?  Will China finally come out and say that they aren't going  to grow at 7 percent next year, they're going to go at 6 1/2 percent, but  will they do some other kind of fiscal and monetary stimulus on top of  that?  </p><p>And then taking it back to the U.S. here, the weak retail sales data  this morning, kind of was the clincher and said, man, if the U.S. consumer  isn't growing, then the U.S. isn't growing, then maybe we do have a global  growth scare.  </p><p>So, I think all that weighed on the market early.  But as you  mentioned, later in the day, the Beige Book came around, which is a much  larger view of the U.S. economy, and that pretty much said things were OK,  not great, but we're still sort of in a muddle through phase here as we  wait for big events to unfold -- the ECB, China, things like that.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  John, we spend a tremendous time asking our guests, how  low oil go?  Tonight, the question tonight, how low will bond yields go?   The 30-year bond yield now, at the lowest on record.  Ten years at 1.8  percent or thereabouts.  </p><p>What are they saying?  What is the danger signal here, if any?  And  what should investors do if they own bonds?  </p><p>CANALLY:  Yes, that's the thing.  I mean, is the bond market sending  a signal because yields are at all time lows?  I think if you were getting  other signals from the economy, and consumer confidence was falling sharply  instead of rising.  If auto sales were at a 10-year low instead of a 10- year high, that would be a concern.  </p><p>If you've seen things like retail sales, the weekly retail sales we  get, if we get that and that was weak, that would be a signal that the bond  market is telling us something.  What we're seeing though is the opposite.  </p><p>It's sort of the opposite of what happened in 2008.  In 2008, we saw  a big drop in bond yields and it was a global growth signal.  Today, it's  probably a signal of global deflation, disinflation rather than global  growth.  And I think there's things that are going to help that, but it may  be a couple of weeks, a couple of months before markets are convinced that  it's going to work.  </p><p>HERERA:  So, John, what I think I hear you saying is that the U.S. is  the strongest around the globe right now, but is it strong enough to  survive a global either disinflation or deflationary cycle?  </p><p>CANALLY:  Yes, I think it's important to remember that U.S. GDP is  not S&amp;P.  So, S&amp;P 500 profit is about 30 to 40 percent of those profits are  derived from overseas.  So, the stock market, financial markets are going  to get a lot more volatile around the global growth scare.  </p><p>The U.S. economy, maybe 10 percent to 15 percent relying on exports,  but the other 85 percent to 95 percent is really just U.S. growth.  And  that looks fine.  And, you know, as we've been saying that the U.S. is sort  of the cleanest shirt in the hamper, or the best house on a bad street.  </p><p>And as people look around the globe, they ask themselves where they  want to be this year in terms of investing.  Most likely it is in the U.S.  until China can show its cards until the ECB can do what it does and until  the Japan can do more. </p><p>So, I think from that perspective, I think the U.S. will be fine,  simply because U.S. S&amp;P 500 is a lot different than the make-up of our  economy.  </p><p>HERERA:  The make-up.</p><p>All right, John.  Thank you so much for that.  We appreciate it.   Chief economist at LPL Financial.  </p><p>And more now on the impact of plunging energy costs.  U.S. import  prices saw their biggest drop in six years in December, tumbling 2.5  percent.  That is the sixth month in a row of declines in import prices,  keeping inflation in check.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  More detail now from that Beige Book survey out today,  regarding the slide in oil prices.  The Fed says the recent plunge in crude  may be hurting economic growth as some U.S. energy companies are already  reporting layoffs and spending freezes.  </p><p>HERERA:  And tumbling oil prices is having a big impact north of the  border, where crude production is a driving force behind the Canadian  economy.  </p><p>Brian Sullivan has more from Calgary.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRIAN SULLIVAN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   Here in Canada, oil's price collapse is front page news.  And while  consumers love the drop in the price of gas lane, the oil producers and the  government do not.  Rapidly falling oil prices are going to hit everything  from government budgets, to infrastructure building, to the Canadian dollar  and jobs.  </p><p>Massive Canadian oil company Sun Corp just announced it will be  laying off 1,000 workers, and cutting a billion dollars from its capital  spending plan.  The potential downside is great enough that high ranking  government officials are speaking out about it.  </p><p>JIM PRENTICE, ALBERTA PREMIER:  Oil prices continue to slip.  We  don't evidently -- haven't evidently seen the bottom yet, and this is  opened up an enormous revenue shortfall in terms of the Alberta  government's budget.  Quantified for next year, $6 billion to $7 billion,  $5 billion the year after that and $5 billion the year after if we don't  take action.  </p><p>SULLIVAN:  Though finding an answer to the growing crisis is complex,  the cause of the problem is not.  The world is simply producing more oil  than it is using.  So, as supply and demand so out of whack, we asked an  oil economist, why don't the big oil producers simply cut back on  production?</p><p>PETER TERTZAKIAN, ARC FINANCIAL CORP:  When you got a price for, all  try to offset by producing more.  So, it's a free for all for the moment.   But, you know, until we see the participants in the global thing start to  die off, we're going to see low prices.  </p><p>SULLIVAN:  Canada's oil pain is not just a Canada story.  The stocks  in more than 70 major Canadian companies trade in the United States.  A  number of those are oil companies and they have been walloped.  Shares of  Baytex Energy, Penn West Petroleum, Enerplus and Precision Drilling  (NYSE:PDS) have seen their shares fall by more than 50 percent or even 60  percent in just a matter of months.  </p><p>(on camera):  Some call Calgary the \"Houston of Canada\" because of  its strong job market and fast growth.  But much of that is tied to the  price of oil.  And if oil's price were to fall lower, or even stay at this  level for a long period of time, the building boom that you can clearly see  behind us may simply run out of gas.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Brian Sullivan in Calgary, Alberta,  Canada.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  And still ahead, scaling back.  What the Republican- controlled House did today to two measures important to business.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  It was not a good day at J.P. Morgan Chase.  The nation's  biggest bank reported a 7 percent drop in earnings last quarter, getting  slammed by a billion dollars in legal costs and a decline in trading  revenue.  Shares fell 3 1/2 percent today, weighing heavily on the entire  financial sector.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Things were a little bit better at Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC),  the nation's biggest mortgage lender.  Net income rose more than $5  billion, thanks to higher revenue from loan interest payments.</p><p>But chief financial officer John Shrewsberry says that growth is not  just from home loans.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN SHREWSBERRY, WELLS FARGO CFO:  Loan growth for Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in the fourth quarter annualized, third to fourth quarter, grew  at 13 percent, which is as strong as it's been in some time.  So, some of  that is mortgage, some is autos, it's in credit cards, it's all categories  of commercial and industrial lending.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Despite that like a lot of other financials today, shares  of Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) closed lower.  They were down more than 1  percent.</p><p>HERERA:  Mortgage applications took a big leap last week, the biggest  weekly jump, in fact, in six years -- thanks to near-record low interest  rates.  </p><p>Diana Olick has the story from Washington.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Mortgage  applications spiked 49 percent last week and that was with the adjustment  for the New Year's holiday.  A sharp drop in interest rates, combined with  new reduced cost for FHC and Fannie Mae loans were behind the move.  Break  it out, refis were a big driver, a 66 percent week-to-week to the highest  level since July of 2013.  Jumbo refis quadrupled, of course, they're more  sensitive to interest rates.  </p><p>Applications for a loan to purchase a home, up 24 percent from the  previous week.  They're also up 2 percent from a year ago, and that's the  first time in over a year that they've been higher annually.  </p><p>All this as the average contract rate on the 30-year fix conforming  loan dropped to 3.89 percent.  That is the lowest level since May of 2013.  </p><p>Adding to the momentum, Fannie Mae's new 3 percent down payment loan  and an announcement last week by FHA that it would cut annual insurance  premiums by half a percent.  That doesn't go into effect for a few weeks,  but borrowers are applying, and FHA is actually allowing borrowers who are  in process with the loan to cancel it and reapply under the new insurance  rates.  </p><p>Lenders tell me that is huge.  One lender in northern Virginia calls  the response unbelievable.  He says people who have been debating buying a  home are now going ahead with pre-qualifications in the hopes they'll find  the house while rates are still low.  It all bodes well for the spring  housing market with one caveat.  More people may want to buy homes at the  new rate but there are still two few homes for sale.  It's a vicious circle  because people don't want to list their homes if they can't find something  else to buy.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Diana Olick in Washington.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Moving to Washington now where the new Republican-led  Congress is trying to reverse President Obama's immigration policies and  roll back legislation regulating Wall Street banks.  </p><p>John Harwood joins us now from Washington with more.</p><p>John, let's start with the efforts to roll back or postpone, I guess,  some of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank law.  What does today's House vote  try to do here?  </p><p>JOHN HARWOOD, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Well, what  they're trying to do is delay by two years the imposition of the Volcker  Rule.  Now, remember, this is something that wasn't originally in the Dodd- Frank bill.  So, this was added during the legislative process.  You could  have members of the financial community arguing that this was marginal to  the importance of Dodd-Frank and Republicans agree with that argument.   They're trying to roll it back.  </p><p>The administration has drawn a line and said, no, they accepted some  weakening of Dodd-Frank in legislation at the end of 2014, but they put a  veto threat on this bill.  Elizabeth Warren and Democratic liberals are  mobilizing against it.  </p><p>So, it's future in the Republican-led Senate where Democrats have a  little more power because the power of the minority is very much in doubt.  </p><p>HERERA:  Yes, it sounds like it's almost DOA.  I mean, is that a  correct read?  Or is there some hope?  </p><p>HARWOOD:  Well, there's a whole lot, as you know, of lobbying going  on by Wall Street to try to target various portions of Dodd-Frank.  We  don't know where all of those efforts are going to lead.  I would say that,  as a stand-alone at this moment, it looks bleak but you could have back and  forth as other various pieces of legislation, including tax reform get  debated. </p><p>MATHISEN:  All right.  So, now, let's move on to the other key vote  here.  The House vote that ties the funding of the Homeland Security  Department to undoing elements of the president's late last year executive  order on immigration.  </p><p>Does this have any chance of passing in the Senate most especially?  </p><p>HARWOOD:  More definitively, I would say it does not.  Harry Reid, in  fact, the Senate Democrat leader, put out a statement after the House  passed this bill saying, you might as well forget it.  This has no chance  of clearing the Senate of the United States.  </p><p>In both of these cases, by the way, you had defection of significance  size within each party.  You had on the Dodd-Frank legislation, 29  Democrats joined Republicans to say, yes, we should put off the Volcker  Rule; 26 Republicans joined with Democrats to say, no, don't stop the  president on immigration.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  All right, thanks very much, John.  John Harwood reporting  tonight from Washington.  </p><p>HERERA:  Takeover talks sent BlackBerry spiking right before the  closing bell and that's where we begin tonight's \"Market Focus\". </p><p>Reuters is reporting that Samsung recently approached Blackberry  about a potential takeover.  It proposed an initial price range of between  $13 and $15.50 a share for the smartphone maker.  After the bell,  Blackberry responded saying it has not engaged in those reported  discussions. As you can see, Blackberry surged, closing about 30 percent to  $12.60, but then shares fell slightly after hours.  Samsung trades in  Korea.</p><p>General Motors' 2015 financial outlook sent shares lower.  The  automaker expects to hike its capital expenditures by 20 percent this year  as it looks to grow its luxury brand.  But investors were disappointed when  the company's CFO said that there are no plans for a dividend hike.  Shares  fell almost 3 percent to $34.40.</p><p>And one stock that participated in today's sell-off was Freeport  McMoRan.  The mining company was impacted by copper prices falling to a 5- year low.  Copper is a major part of the company's business.  Shares  plunged about 11 percent to $18.74.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Tough day for shares of Foot Locker, too.  Goldman Sachs  (NYSE:GS) downgraded the stock to \"sell\" from \"neutral\" and lowered its  price target by $8.  It cited concerns that peak margins on basketball  sneakers may be a little risky.  Shares slumped 4 percent today to $53.21.   Its rival Finish Line fell, as we like to say, in sympathy about that.</p><p>A unit of Caesars Entertainment will file for bankruptcy tomorrow in  Chicago, this according to a court filing.  A group of the casino  operator's bondholders have filed the papers to force the division into  involuntary Chapter 11.  Caesars has been trying to gain creditor's support  for a restructuring program.  Shares were up a fraction today to $12.71.</p><p>And Chipotle has pulled pork of its menu at a third of its locations.   This after the company found out that one of its suppliers was not  complying with its animal treatment standards.  One supplier says it will  pick up the slack to help address the shortfall, but investors were  concerned after one analyst said the issue could impact the restaurants'  first-quarter results.  And shares were down today to $709.74, down $4.</p><p>Adobe saw its shares spike right after the close.  This as the  software company announced a new $2 billion stock buyback program.  The new  purchase plan will extend through 2017.  And shares rose initially after  hours.  Before the close, though, the stock was down slightly to $69.99.</p><p>And coming up, the industry that's getting the attention of venture  capitalists out in Silicon Valley and raking in record money.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  If you're expecting to get a tax refund this year, be  prepared to wait a little longer to get it.  Because of budget cuts, the  IRS says that people who file paper tax returns may have to wait an extra  week or longer to get that refund.  The commissioner also said the IRS has  met any returns with errors will also face delays and fewer calls to the  help line will go unanswered.  </p><p>On the other hand, those budget cuts may mean fewer audits as well.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Etsy is going public and planning to raise $300 million.   The Brooklyn-based seller of handmade crafts and hipster clothing -- this  is so not me -- a reportedly plans to have an initial public offering as  soon as this quarter.  </p><p>HERERA:  Well, Ty, if vintage clothing and crafts are not your thing,  another place you may consider putting your money right now is health care  start-ups, which were attracting a lot of interest from some big tech  investors.  </p><p>Josh Lipton has more. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):   Talked to venture capitalists in Silicon Valley and asked them which  industry they're most excited to revolutionize.  </p><p>Odds are high that they'll say health care.  So, it's no surprise  that money is surging into start-ups that focus on that intersection of  health care and technology.  In 2014, venture funding for these start-ups  hit a record $4.1 billion.  That was a 125 percent year over year jump  according to Rock Health, which provides seed funding for startups.  Those  working in this sector say health care is undergoing a technology  transformation, with a range of startup aiming to make the industry more  efficient, convenient, and cost-effective.  </p><p>One such start-up is Omada Health, which connects those at risk for  chronic diseases like diabetes to a comprehensive lifestyle program that  includes a personal health coach and digital support group.  The company's  CEO says start-ups like his are attracting attention and money in part  because there's now a new generation of entrepreneurs who are passionate  about both health care and tech.  </p><p>SEAN DUFFY, OMADA HEALTH CEO:  I worked at Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)  before going to medical school.  Like I love -- I'm a huge techie.  I love  technology.  I love health care.  </p><p>And, you know, you have entrepreneurs that are now able to combine  both and, you know, I think the venture capital investing community sees  the chance for the next wave of folks that really, you know, take health  care to a digital era.  </p><p>LIPTON:  So, which start-ups in the space are most likely to go  public this year?  They're tracking the space, including Fitbit, the maker  of fitness trackers, ZocDoc, which allows users to all 50 states to find  and book appointments for doctors online, Practice Fusion, a Cloud-based  electronic health records provider, Proteus, which makes injectable  sensors, and 23andMe, which provides genetic reports on your ancestry and  family history.  </p><p>One note of caution for investors, though, five digital health  companies went public in 2014 according to Rock Health, raising a total of  $1.7 billion.  But three of those five stocks are now selling at below  their offering price.  And enthusiasm for this sector could cool if that  trend continues this year.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Josh Lipton in Silicon Valley.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  A recap now of another volatile and losing session on Wall  Street, and worries about the strength of the U.S. consumer and economic  growth globally.  The Dow off 186 points, half the losses from early in the  trading day.  NASDAQ was lower by 22.  The S&amp;P down 11.  Oil, a sharp jump  near the close, up 5.5 percent.  </p><p>Dominic Chu is with us now.  </p><p>Should we expect more of this, for example, tomorrow?  </p><p>DOMINIC CHU, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  You know, it's  interesting because we've become so accustom to not seeing these kinds of  swings.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Yes.</p><p>CHU:  You forget that this kind of thing can happen from time to  time.  Over the course of the past, the Q.E. era, we'll call it, the Fed's  involvement in our markets -- we haven't seen a huge amount of volatility  for the move.  </p><p>Tomorrow, it's going to be very interesting because you've got a  number of macro and micro, bigger picture economic things to consider, as  well as company specific details. </p><p>On the macro front, you've got to worry about what's happening with  the manufacturing picture overall.  So, you've got the Philly Fed,  Philadelphia area manufacturing and the economy, also the Empire State,  that's New York.  </p><p>Also, inflation data -- the producer price index comes up.  That's  going to be the macro picture.  </p><p>On the micro front, tech and financial, the two most heavily weighted  sectors in the entire S&amp;P are going to be well-represented in earnings  tomorrow.  You've got the likes of Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Citi on  the financial side.  And then after the bell, you have Intel (NASDAQ:INTC),  one of the biggest chip producers in the world.  </p><p>All of those are going to give you a picture of what's going to  happen with corporate America amidst this backdrop of volatility. </p><p>HERERA:  I will be interested to see whether intel talks about  currency and the impact of the stronger dollar on its earnings.  </p><p>CHU:  I would be surprised if any large cap company with  international exposure does not talk about the strength of the dollar in  terms of their earnings report.  That's going to be a real key.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  And as you say, volatility is back.  2014, very low.   2015, so far, everyday has been a 100 point-day --  </p><p>CHU:  Sure.</p><p>MATHISEN:  -- with some moves end up and down.  But all of them had  100 points in them somewhere for the Dow.  </p><p>CHU:  You know, it's interesting.  There's a lot of experts say that  this is one of those times you're going to have to deal with that kind of  volatility.  Maybe not run for the exits, but still, buckle your safety  belts.  </p><p>HERERA:  All right.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Dom, thank you very much.</p><p>CHU:  Sure.</p><p>MATHISEN:  Dominic Chu.  </p><p>HERERA:  And that will do it for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for tonight.   I'm Sue Herera.  Thanks for joining us.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  And I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Have a great evening, everybody.   And we will hope to see you right back here tomorrow night.  </p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.

The Dow  closes above 26,000 for the first time ever, clinching the fastest 1,000- point run in history.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TYLER MATHISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Big promise.  Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL) is making a massive investment in America with a plan to  create thousands of jobs, put billions of dollars to work and bring a lot  of money back home.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA:  Bitcoin breakdown.  What goes up can come down, hard.  And the  controversial cryptocurrency is no exception.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Wednesday,  January 17th.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  </p><p>Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) surprises investors and promises a big investment in  the U.S.  More on that in just a moment.  </p><p>But we begin with the incredible day on Wall Street.  Stocks rose, and  rose, and rose some more.  The blue chip Dow index closed above 26,000 for  the first time ever, marking the fastest 1,000-point move in history.   Recall, it was just on January 4th that the Dow first closed before 25,000.   The rally today was broad, with all 11 sectors posting games and all of the  major indexes finishing at records.  </p><p>As one strategist said, there is just no reason to sell, which come the  think of it, may be a reason to sell.  But not today.  </p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 322 points to 26,115.  NASDAQ  added 74.  The S&amp;P 500 was up a sporty 26.  </p><p>If you need even more evidence of the enthusiasm for equities, a new survey  puts stock market optimism among professional investors at a 32-year high.  </p><p>What happens or tends to happen when we see an acceleration like this?  </p><p>Mike Santoli takes a look.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Has the stock market  rally begun to overshoot?  There is no formal definition of a bull market  overshoot.  It's not the same as a market bubble.  Not a mere short-term  sugar rush.  It's a phase when stocks accelerate higher from already high  levels, the public gets excited from the market and investors extrapolate  good economic news far into the future.  </p><p>Evidence that we might be getting there?  The rally has picked up plenty  more energy in 2018.  The S&amp;P 500 is up nearly 5 percent since the tax law  was passed less than a month.  That's twice as much as 2018 earnings  estimates have be raised.  Riskier, more cyclical stocks are pulling away  from defensive sectors.  Some measures of investor sentiment and market  momentum are pushing record highs.  Flows into stock funds in the latest  week were the sixth heaviest in history.  </p><p>These are all signs that stocks could be overheating in the very short-term  as the public embraces a richly valued market newly energized by a big  corporate tax cut.  </p><p>The market's volatility index is actually up this year, even as the Dow has  gone higher, an unusual combination that suggests the market might be in  for wider two-way swings this year even as the uptrend looks intact.  </p><p>If this is an overshoot, it could last a while and be pretty lucrative in  the best case.  The '90s bull market probably started overshooting in 1997  and doubled in three years before the peak for example.  </p><p>The gains posted in this phase often don't fully survive an eventual bear  market, whenever one might hit.  The good news is the market seems out of  reach of the bears for now.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Mike Santoli.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Apple's stock contributed to today's rally.  Shares of the largest  publicly traded company turned higher midday and the stock kept climbing  after the company announced a very big investment in this country, which  also happens to be Apple' largest market.  </p><p>Josh Lipton has the details.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Apple's CEO Tim Cook  is making a $350 billion pledge to America.  Over five years, the iPhone  maker will create 20,000 new jobs.  It will also build a new campus here in  the U.S. which will be its third corporate campus, in addition to Cupertino  and Austin.  </p><p>The company plans capital expenditures of $30 billion.  It will increase  the size of its advanced manufacturing fund from $1 billion to $5 billion,  and there are reports that the company will give employees a $2,500  restricted stock bonus.  </p><p>Cook saying in a statement, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a success story that  could only have happened in America and we are proud to build on our long  history of support for the U.S. economy.</p><p>Apple's announcement aligns with some of President Trump's top priorities,  which include getting companies to hire more workers here in the U.S.  The  president's deputy press secretary responded to Cook's announcement,  saying: Just as the president promised, making our businesses more  competitive internationally is translating directly to benefit the American  worker, through increased wages, better benefits, and new jobs.  </p><p>For investors, a key headline was this: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) anticipates  making a tax payment of $38 billion to bring overseas cash back to the U.S.   It's doing that in response to recent changes in the U.S. tax law in which  companies pay a one-time tax of 15.5 percent on overseas cash.  The  previous rate was 35 percent.  There are some details in this report that  investors don't have, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is not saying how much of its  $252 billion held overseas it's going to be sending home, and we don't know  exactly how much more hiring and investing the company is doing in addition  to what their plans already were for the U.S. </p><p>But analysts are already speculating about how any freed up money could be  put to work.  They think it could go right back to shareholders through  buybacks or dividends.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Josh Lipton, San Francisco.   </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, a number of other tech companies were on Capitol Hill  today.  Executives from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), YouTube and Twitter were  questioned by lawmakers about terrorist content an their sites.  It is the  latest move by government officials to increase scrutiny of big tech, a  sector that's growing fast and having a greater influence on our lives.  </p><p>Julia Boorstin has more.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB), YouTube, and Twitter policy chiefs defending their company's  efforts to defeat terrorism, saying they are working together and combining  artificial intelligence and their growing employee ranks to prevent their  platforms from being used to recruit and train terrorists.  </p><p>Facebook's head of global policy management saying the company will double  its employees focused on safety and security to 20,000 by the end of the  year.  YouTube saying it has removed 160,000 terrorism-related videos since  June, identifying 98 percent with machine learning.  While Twitter says it  suspends 75 percent of terrorist-related accounts before they tweet.  </p><p>Republican John Thune pushed the executives about why terrorist videos are  still online, flagging a YouTube bomb-making video instructing the  Manhattan suicide bomber which resurfaced as recently as this month.  </p><p>SEN. JOHN THUNE (R), SOUTH DAKOTA:  How is it possible for that to happen?   Why aren't your efforts working to keep this video off your platform  permanently?  </p><p>JUNIPER DOWNS, YOUTUBE HEAD OF PUBLIC POLICY:  This particular video was  caught by our systems.  We have used it in our sharing database and we are  catching re-uploads of the video quickly and removing it as soon as those  uploads are detected.  </p><p>BOORSTIN:  The questioning expanded beyond just terrorism, as senators also  pressed the companies about their role enabling Russian's manipulation of  the election and whether they have a political agenda.  The companies  saying they have no agenda and they are doing everything they can to crack  down on all varieties of abuse on the platforms.</p><p>This as all these companies face growing scrutiny for their size and  influence, and as they take steps to assuage concerns.  Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) yesterday announcing that every video submitted for Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) prepared advertising must be reviewed by a person and Mark  Zuckerberg saying that fixing Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is his goal for the  year, changing the newsfeed last week to prioritize personal interactions.  </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO, THE NEW YORK TIMES:  When they put out this product, they  seem to be stuck in the bubble of imagining the best stuff that will happen  with their technologies and usually not pausing to think about the worst  stuff.  And so, that's why they are behind the curve.  </p><p>BOORSTIN:  Now, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Twitter are  trying to make sure they are ahead of the curve, especially when it comes  to potential manipulation of the elections coming up this fall.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  In a \"Wall Street Journal\" op-ed published today, chief economics  commentator Greg Ip called into question whether today's tech giants are  becoming too big and should be broken up.  He said a handful of  heavyweights dominate their respective categories.  Alphabet's Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) was one example, driving nearly 90 percent of all Internet  searches.  But what would more regulation or a scaling down among tech  giants mean for consumers?</p><p>Joining us now is the author of the article, Greg Ip.  </p><p>Greg, it's always great to see you.  Thanks for joining us.</p><p>GREG IP, CHIEF ECONOMICS COMMENTATOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Yes, great to  talk to you.  Thanks for having me.  </p><p>HERERA:  In reading the article, you liken the situation that we find  ourselves in today with these tech giants, very similar to historical  precedent, which was Standard Oil and AT&amp;T (NYSE:T), which both dominated  their respective fields.  </p><p>IP:  That's right.  There is important similarities and differences.  The  similarity of course is that they are both gigantic.  They're both sort of  technological leaders.  And they both in some sense are gateways to  critical parts of the economy, whether it's oil and telephones in the old  days or whether it's the Internet today.  </p><p>And that gateway position gives them extreme leverage and some would argue  monopoly profits.  But there's also important differences.  Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) give their stuff away for free.   It's really hard to argue that they're gouging customers.  And even the  stuff they do sell like Google's advertising rates have been falling year  in and year out.  </p><p>They are also creating new product.  So you couldn't argue their innovation  is falling apart.  It creates sort of a difficult situation.  If you are in  the antitrust field today, it's not so much large market share or is a  monopoly that bothers you.  It's whether they are using that position to  make consumers worse off by suppressing competition.  And that's where the  big question is.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  So, you also talk about Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has a large  part of online sales, but a very fall part really when you look at it  overall retail sales.  They have a lot of e-book sales but there are  obviously printed book as well.  So, how -- how would one make an antitrust  case against any of these companies if, as you point out, a lot of their  stuff is being given away for free, and a lot of cases the prices are  coming down, not going up.  And they're not acting like monopolists.  </p><p>IP:  I think that it would be very hard right now given what we know today  to make that case, Tyler, precisely for the reasons you cite, that it's  hard to prove that the fact they are growing bigger has actually come at  the expense of consumers.  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), as you say, offers an  amazing array of stuff.  That stuff they've had such a powerful effect on  low prices, they seem to be actually affecting the inflation rate.  </p><p>But I think if you peer into the future, this is the question.  Their  dominance of certain segments, we mentioned electronic books.  But look at  third party merchants.   If you are a small business and you want to  actually sell on the Internet, the fact that roughly half of shopping and  Internet searches start with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) it means there is almost  no point this starting your own Website.  You almost feel like you have to  go through Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and pay their 15 percent commission.  </p><p>That I think is where questions will be asked in the future.  Is this good  or is this bad for consumers?</p><p>HERERA:  Is there political appetite to take on this sort of fight, if you  will, or discussion time?  </p><p>IP:  There is no question at the political world has gotten more  treacherous for these companies.  I mean, every day, we are hearing about  problems of how they facilitated interference with our elections, how they  are fostering social media addiction and so on and so forth.  But in the  antitrust field, they really look at one narrow thing of it's basically,  are consumers better off or worse off because of this behavior?  </p><p>They are not going to make a judgment whether these companies are  facilitating, you know, fake news.  That's not their area.  And that is why  thus far they have not restrained them.  But it's not always going to be  the case.  </p><p>And we've seen in Europe for example that their bar is lower.  In Europe,  they're much more likely to say the mere fact that the behavior of this  company drove others out of business is ultimately going to be bad for  consumers.  </p><p>HERERA:  Well, keep track of it for us, Greg.  We'll have you back very  soon.  Appreciate it.  </p><p>IP:  All right.  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  Greg Ip with the \"Wall Street Journal\".</p><p>MATHISEN:  To the economy now.  Manufacturing output rose for fourth  straight month back in December.  And that capped the strongest quarter  since 2010.  The sector being helped by stronger consumer spending,  increased business investment, and that improving global economy.  </p><p>Manufacturing accounts for more than 75 percent of total industrial  production, and accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy.  </p><p>HERERA: Economic activity expanded into the New Year.  According to the  Federal Reserve's latest read on the economy, inflation rose at a modest to  moderate pace at the end of 2017, while wages continued to push higher.   The Fed's Beige Book, which is an anecdotal look at the economy across the  country, indicated that businesses in some districts now have the ability  to raise prices which could lead to higher inflation.  </p><p>Separately, the Senate Banking Committee voted a send time to approve  Jerome Powell to be the next chair of the Central Bank.  The revote was  necessary because the full Senate did not take up Powell's nomination last  year.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  With the deadline to reach a budget deal and keep the government  open past Friday, the White House today threw its support behind a short- term funding bill.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate  would take up such a measure as soon as it is approved by the House.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R), KENTUCKY:  By now, it is clear we are not ready  to move ahead with a major agreement on long-term funding for our armed  forces, nor on our immigration policy.  Compromise solutions are not out of  reach.  But for now, Congress needs to keep the government running.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATHISEN:  The Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said he would not vote for  another stopgap bill.  Graham helped craft a bipartisan immigration deal  that was rejected last week.  </p><p>HERERA:  Still ahead, a bitcoin blood bath.  Why the once hot  cryptocurrency is suddenly ice cold?</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN:  It wasn't a pretty day for some of the country's biggest bank.   Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) reported a 50 percent drop this bond trading  revenue.  That's what investors focused on even as the bank reported better  than expected earnings and profits for fourth quarter.  Shares of the Dow  component fell nearly 2 percent on this very positive day for stocks.  </p><p>Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), meantime, saw its revenue fall short of  expectations in part because of a drop in fixed income trading.  Loan  growth was up, profits topped analyst's expectations despite a one $3  billion one-time charge related to the newly signed tax law.  Shares of  bank of America were also lower fractionally in trading today.</p><p>HERERA:  Bitcoin prices are breaking down.  After touching a peak of nearly  $20,000 in December, most major exchanges \"Today\" show the crypto currency  trading below $10,000, cutting its value in half from late last year.  </p><p>So, what's behind this crypto crash?  </p><p>Seema Mody takes a look.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEEMA MODY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Bitcoin continues to  fall on growing concerns that China and South Korea, two of the largest  bitcoin markets, will ban residents from trading the cryptocurrency.   Latest warning came from South Korea's finance minister, who said banning  cryptocurrencies is an option on the table due to concerns over tax  evasion.  </p><p>Further regulation is not being welcomed by all.  Citizens (NYSE:CIA) in  South Korea, over 200,000 of them, have signed an online petition asking  the Korean government to not limit trading as they see value in crypto  currencies.  South Korea was one of the first countries to embrace digital  currencies and it currently accounts for a significant portion of trading  volume in bitcoin.  Citizens (NYSE:CIA) writing: You may think you are  protecting the public, but we citizens think that the government is  stealing our dream.  </p><p>It's not just Asia that is trying to crack down on cryptocurrencies.   France's finance minister says he is launching a special task force that  will look into weather individuals are using cryptocurrencies for tax  evasion, a topic that got attention here in the United States when the IRS  ordered Coinbase, a widely used cryptocurrency trading platform, to turn in  records for over 14,000 users who trade bitcoin.  </p><p>Concerns over tighter regulation have sent bitcoin sharply lower.  Just  today, it wiped out $30 billion in market value.  And other crypto  currencies, Ripple, Ether and Litecoin are also under pressure.  </p><p>DENNIS BERMAN, WALL STREET JOURNAL FINANCIAL EDITOR:  There is a  fundamental tension between bitcoin as an unregulated, governmentless,  seamless means of transaction and store value, however you want to  characterize it, and the idea that it should be regulated to be me  effective.  So, I don't know how in the end those two are bridged.  </p><p>MODY:  But given bitcoin's massive 1,200 percent rise in 2017, some bitcoin  investors see the recent drop as a healthy correction.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Seema Mody.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Let's take a closer look now at what might have contributed to  bitcoin's collapse today.  Joining us to talk about that is Matthew Green.   He rejoins us.  He is a cryptocurrency expert, and assistant professor at  Johns Hopkins Information Security Institute.  </p><p>Matthew, welcome.  Good to have you back again.  </p><p>In simple terms, what do you think happened today?  </p><p>MATTHEW GREEN, JOHNS HOPKINS INFORMATION SECURITY INSTITUTE:  It's hard to  say.  Cryptocurrencies go up and cryptocurrencies go down.  Sometimes,  people to ascribe reasons to that, but it's not always clear there are  reasons.  There was definitely some fear about regulatory actions overseas.   There are some indication that futures contracts may have played a role,  and maybe people just panicked.  Hard to know.  </p><p>HERERA:  You know, you liken it to gambling, correct?  </p><p>GREEN:  Yes.  </p><p>HERERA:  Because of the volatility that we are seeing in this particular  cryptocurrency.  It is a cautionary tale for investors, if you just look at  the chart action in today's trading session.  </p><p>GREEN:  So, some people like that aspect of bitcoin and cryptocurrency.   They like the fact that it moves up and down very quickly.  But, yes, I  think for people who have invested money that they can't afford to lose,  cryptocurrencies are very dangerous and it's a little worrying to me that  we see so many of that kind of investor now getting involved in this field.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Another person I was speaking to earlier today likened the  cryptocurrencies to some of the Internet stocks circa 1998, 1999.  You  didn't know how they were going to perform.  Even Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN),  this person pointed out, lost 95 percent of its value at one point in its  history.  </p><p>How do you react to that analogy, number one?  And will there come a time  when bitcoin or these other cryptocurrencies aren't as prone to these as  spasms of moves up or down?  </p><p>GREEN:  So, I think something has happened over the last year, aside from  this incredible price increase, is that we've seen a lot more money come  into this field.  That's kind of -- that's what is responsible for some of  the price increase.  </p><p>But I think over time as the markets become more liquid and more developed,  you are probably going to see prices start to come to a point where they  are actually stable and maybe not so crazy.  And also, you are going to see  technological advancements in the currencies themselves that hopefully will  make them more useful for real applications like payments, kind of the way  the dotcom bubble popped and then ultimately resulted in real tech  companies we know are relying on.  </p><p>HERERA:  As you mentioned, more people have begun to mine bitcoin and the  other cryptocurrencies.  But as you look further out, do you envision a  time when there is widespread adoption of bitcoin as either legitimate  currency?  I mean, it's not backed by any particular government, in a more  legitimate trading vehicle?  </p><p>GREEN:  So, it may not be bitcoin.  It may be one of the other currencies  like ethereum or another currency.  But, yes, I do.  I used to be very  skeptical about this, but I think that they're -- it's very unlikely that  cryptocurrencies will go away.  Maybe they'll go down by 90 percent for a  while, but I think they are here to stay.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Matthew, thank you very much.  We'll have you back.  I know  we're going to be talking about this more.  </p><p>Matthew Green is with Johns Hopkins Information Security Institute.  </p><p>HERERA:  Tiffany (NYSE:TIF) has a shiny new outlook, and that's where we  begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p>Following a solid holiday shopping season the luxury jeweler raised its  fiscal 2017 earnings forecast and said it would invest in technology,  marketing, and store presentation.  In the latest quarter, the company said  fine jewelry and items from its new home and accessories collection appeal  to customers.  The company's stores in Europe and the Asia Pacific Region  did particularly well.  So, did the shares.  They were up 1 percent to  $108.99.</p><p>Viacom's chairwoman Shari Redstone is reportedly pushing for a board  shakeup at CBS (NYSE:CBS).  The \"Wall Street Journal\" says Redstone wants  to bring on new director as she renews discussions about a potential merger  between the two companies.  The report added that CBS (NYSE:CBS) has  reservations about a tie up.  Viacom's shares were up nearly 2 percent to  $31.96, shares of CBS (NYSE:CBS) were off almost 1 percent to $55.90.</p><p>U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) reported earnings that rose and beat expectations.   The nation's largest regional bank said the majority of the savings from  the new tax law will be returned to shareholders in the form of dividends  and stock buy backs.  The rest will be put towards investments in  technology and higher entry level wages.  Shares closed down more than 1  percent to $57.34.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Charles Schwab posted profits that were in line with  expectations, despite saying earnings took an immediate hit from the new  tax changes.  Revenue topped forecasts.  Schwab shares, up 1 percent,  $56.09, the close there.  </p><p>The drugmaker Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) reportedly in talks to buy the biotech  Juno Therapeutics.  \"The Wall Street Journal\" says the deal between the two  companies could help strengthen Celgene's portfolio of blood cancer drugs.   Shares of Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) fell more than 2 percent to end the day at  $102.02.  Meanwhile, Juno Therapeutics up 51 percent -- it sounds like  bitcoin -- to $69.25.  Not today.  </p><p>And after the bell, Alcoa (NYSE:AA) posted a larger than expected quarterly  loss.  Revenue did improve but also came up short.  Shares were initially  pressured in the after-hour session but they closed the regular day up 1  percent at $56.99.  </p><p>Coming up, is the long run of record low mortgage rates about to come to an  end?</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  Walmart is wading into the opioid crisis.  The world's largest  retailer is distributing the first of its kind opioid disposal product.   The product is called Dispose RX and includes a packet that when mix with  water in the prescription bottle turns the pills into a biodegradable gel  that can be thrown in the garbage.  The product is meant to be used by  customers who no longer need their prescription painkillers or they're  concerned that someone else might take their pills.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, homebuilders' sentiment is cooling off a bit but still  remains near historic highs.  This as the industry deals with higher  construction costs and the shortage of workers.  That said, many builders  are optimistic that a solid job market, rising consumer confidence, and  relatively low mortgage rates will help propel housing demand in the coming  months.  </p><p>HERERA:  And even as mortgage rates stay near historically low levels, they  are moving a bit higher and prospective homebuyers are keenly aware.  </p><p>Diana Olick explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Mortgage applications  rose last week, which doesn't make a whole lot of sense, because interest  rates also rose.  Usually, applications fall on higher rates, especially  refinances.  It makes more sense though when you factor in fear.  Borrowers  may have jumped in, worried that the long run of record low rates is over.  </p><p>So, applications to refinance led the charge, rising 4 percent for the  week.  Refinances are highly sensitive to even small moves in interest  rates.  And interest rates rose to their highest level since March of last  year.  </p><p>The average contract rate for a 30-year fixed jumped from 4.23 percent to  4.33 percent.  That's pretty big.  We haven't seen a move like that in a  while and rates edge higher this week as well.  While borrowers may be  worried, expert economy watchers are not.  </p><p>JERRY CASTELLINI, CASTLEARK MANAGEMENT PRESIDENT:  It doesn't appear rates  are going to have a significant runaway on the upside, which I think should  be supported for housing purchases.</p><p>OLICK:  Mortgage applications to purchase a home which are less rate- sensitive rose 3 percent for the week and were 7 percent higher than the  same week one year ago.  Home buyers may be trying to get a jump on the  spring market, given how competitive the market has been.  The supply of  homes for sale is still very low, but there are generally fewer shoppers  out this time of year.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Diana Olick in Washington.   </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  And before we go, here's another look at the very happy on Wall  Street today.  And the Dow's first close above 26,000.  The blue chip index  climbed 322 points.  </p><p>There was no giveback today.  The NASDAQ added 74.  And the S&amp;P 500 was up  26.  All of the indexes closed at records.  </p><p>HERERA:  Once again.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Once again.</p><p>HERERA:  It seems like we are saying that all the time.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Saying that all the time.  </p><p>HERERA:  That does it for us tonight.  I'm Sue Herera.  Thank you joining  us.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  And I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Thanks from me as well.  Have a great  evening, everybody.

What goes up can come down, hard. And the controversial cryptocurrency is no exception.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Wednesday, January 17th.</p><p>MATHISEN: Good evening, everyone, and welcome.</p><p>Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) surprises investors and promises a big investment in the U.S. More on that in just a moment.</p><p>But we begin with the incredible day on Wall Street. Stocks rose, and rose, and rose some more. The blue chip Dow index closed above 26,000 for the first time ever, marking the fastest 1,000-point move in history. Recall, it was just on January 4th that the Dow first closed before 25,000. The rally today was broad, with all 11 sectors posting games and all of the major indexes finishing at records.</p><p>As one strategist said, there is just no reason to sell, which come the think of it, may be a reason to sell. But not today.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 322 points to 26,115. NASDAQ added 74. The S&amp;P 500 was up a sporty 26.</p><p>If you need even more evidence of the enthusiasm for equities, a new survey puts stock market optimism among professional investors at a 32-year high.</p><p>What happens or tends to happen when we see an acceleration like this?</p><p>Mike Santoli takes a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Has the stock market rally begun to overshoot? There is no formal definition of a bull market overshoot. It`s not the same as a market bubble. Not a mere short-term sugar rush. It`s a phase when stocks accelerate higher from already high levels, the public gets excited from the market and investors extrapolate good economic news far into the future.</p><p>Evidence that we might be getting there? The rally has picked up plenty more energy in 2018. The S&amp;P 500 is up nearly 5 percent since the tax law was passed less than a month. That`s twice as much as 2018 earnings estimates have be raised. Riskier, more cyclical stocks are pulling away from defensive sectors. Some measures of investor sentiment and market momentum are pushing record highs. Flows into stock funds in the latest week were the sixth heaviest in history.</p><p>These are all signs that stocks could be overheating in the very short-term as the public embraces a richly valued market newly energized by a big corporate tax cut.</p><p>The market`s volatility index is actually up this year, even as the Dow has gone higher, an unusual combination that suggests the market might be in for wider two-way swings this year even as the uptrend looks intact.</p><p>If this is an overshoot, it could last a while and be pretty lucrative in the best case. The `90s bull market probably started overshooting in 1997 and doubled in three years before the peak for example.</p><p>The gains posted in this phase often don`t fully survive an eventual bear market, whenever one might hit. The good news is the market seems out of reach of the bears for now.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Mike Santoli.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: Apple`s stock contributed to today`s rally. Shares of the largest publicly traded company turned higher midday and the stock kept climbing after the company announced a very big investment in this country, which also happens to be Apple` largest market.</p><p>Josh Lipton has the details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Apple`s CEO Tim Cook is making a $350 billion pledge to America. Over five years, the iPhone maker will create 20,000 new jobs. It will also build a new campus here in the U.S. which will be its third corporate campus, in addition to Cupertino and Austin.</p><p>The company plans capital expenditures of $30 billion. It will increase the size of its advanced manufacturing fund from $1 billion to $5 billion, and there are reports that the company will give employees a $2,500 restricted stock bonus.</p><p>Cook saying in a statement, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a success story that could only have happened in America and we are proud to build on our long history of support for the U.S. economy.</p><p>Apple`s announcement aligns with some of President Trump`s top priorities, which include getting companies to hire more workers here in the U.S. The president`s deputy press secretary responded to Cook`s announcement, saying: Just as the president promised, making our businesses more competitive internationally is translating directly to benefit the American worker, through increased wages, better benefits, and new jobs.</p><p>For investors, a key headline was this: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) anticipates making a tax payment of $38 billion to bring overseas cash back to the U.S. It`s doing that in response to recent changes in the U.S. tax law in which companies pay a one-time tax of 15.5 percent on overseas cash. The previous rate was 35 percent. There are some details in this report that investors don`t have, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is not saying how much of its $252 billion held overseas it`s going to be sending home, and we don`t know exactly how much more hiring and investing the company is doing in addition to what their plans already were for the U.S.</p><p>But analysts are already speculating about how any freed up money could be put to work. They think it could go right back to shareholders through buybacks or dividends.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Josh Lipton, San Francisco.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Well, a number of other tech companies were on Capitol Hill today. Executives from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), YouTube and Twitter were questioned by lawmakers about terrorist content an their sites. It is the latest move by government officials to increase scrutiny of big tech, a sector that`s growing fast and having a greater influence on our lives.</p><p>Julia Boorstin has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), YouTube, and Twitter policy chiefs defending their company`s efforts to defeat terrorism, saying they are working together and combining artificial intelligence and their growing employee ranks to prevent their platforms from being used to recruit and train terrorists.</p><p>Facebook`s head of global policy management saying the company will double its employees focused on safety and security to 20,000 by the end of the year. YouTube saying it has removed 160,000 terrorism-related videos since June, identifying 98 percent with machine learning. While Twitter says it suspends 75 percent of terrorist-related accounts before they tweet.</p><p>Republican John Thune pushed the executives about why terrorist videos are still online, flagging a YouTube bomb-making video instructing the Manhattan suicide bomber which resurfaced as recently as this month.</p><p>SEN. JOHN THUNE (R), SOUTH DAKOTA: How is it possible for that to happen? Why aren`t your efforts working to keep this video off your platform permanently?</p><p>JUNIPER DOWNS, YOUTUBE HEAD OF PUBLIC POLICY: This particular video was caught by our systems. We have used it in our sharing database and we are catching re-uploads of the video quickly and removing it as soon as those uploads are detected.</p><p>BOORSTIN: The questioning expanded beyond just terrorism, as senators also pressed the companies about their role enabling Russian`s manipulation of the election and whether they have a political agenda. The companies saying they have no agenda and they are doing everything they can to crack down on all varieties of abuse on the platforms.</p><p>This as all these companies face growing scrutiny for their size and influence, and as they take steps to assuage concerns. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) yesterday announcing that every video submitted for Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) prepared advertising must be reviewed by a person and Mark Zuckerberg saying that fixing Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is his goal for the year, changing the newsfeed last week to prioritize personal interactions.</p><p>FARHAD MANJOO, THE NEW YORK TIMES: When they put out this product, they seem to be stuck in the bubble of imagining the best stuff that will happen with their technologies and usually not pausing to think about the worst stuff. And so, that`s why they are behind the curve.</p><p>BOORSTIN: Now, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Twitter are trying to make sure they are ahead of the curve, especially when it comes to potential manipulation of the elections coming up this fall.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA: In a \"Wall Street Journal\" op-ed published today, chief economics commentator Greg Ip called into question whether today`s tech giants are becoming too big and should be broken up. He said a handful of heavyweights dominate their respective categories. Alphabet`s Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) was one example, driving nearly 90 percent of all Internet searches. But what would more regulation or a scaling down among tech giants mean for consumers?</p><p>Joining us now is the author of the article, Greg Ip.</p><p>Greg, it`s always great to see you. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>GREG IP, CHIEF ECONOMICS COMMENTATOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL: Yes, great to talk to you. Thanks for having me.</p><p>HERERA: In reading the article, you liken the situation that we find ourselves in today with these tech giants, very similar to historical precedent, which was Standard Oil and AT&amp;T (NYSE:T), which both dominated their respective fields.</p><p>IP: That`s right. There is important similarities and differences. The similarity of course is that they are both gigantic. They`re both sort of technological leaders. And they both in some sense are gateways to critical parts of the economy, whether it`s oil and telephones in the old days or whether it`s the Internet today.</p><p>And that gateway position gives them extreme leverage and some would argue monopoly profits. But there`s also important differences. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) give their stuff away for free. It`s really hard to argue that they`re gouging customers. And even the stuff they do sell like Google`s advertising rates have been falling year in and year out.</p><p>They are also creating new product. So you couldn`t argue their innovation is falling apart. It creates sort of a difficult situation. If you are in the antitrust field today, it`s not so much large market share or is a monopoly that bothers you. It`s whether they are using that position to make consumers worse off by suppressing competition. And that`s where the big question is.</p><p>MATHISEN: So, you also talk about Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has a large part of online sales, but a very fall part really when you look at it overall retail sales. They have a lot of e-book sales but there are obviously printed book as well. So, how -- how would one make an antitrust case against any of these companies if, as you point out, a lot of their stuff is being given away for free, and a lot of cases the prices are coming down, not going up. And they`re not acting like monopolists.</p><p>IP: I think that it would be very hard right now given what we know today to make that case, Tyler, precisely for the reasons you cite, that it`s hard to prove that the fact they are growing bigger has actually come at the expense of consumers. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), as you say, offers an amazing array of stuff. That stuff they`ve had such a powerful effect on low prices, they seem to be actually affecting the inflation rate.</p><p>But I think if you peer into the future, this is the question. Their dominance of certain segments, we mentioned electronic books. But look at third party merchants. If you are a small business and you want to actually sell on the Internet, the fact that roughly half of shopping and Internet searches start with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) it means there is almost no point this starting your own Website. You almost feel like you have to go through Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and pay their 15 percent commission.</p><p>That I think is where questions will be asked in the future. Is this good or is this bad for consumers?</p><p>HERERA: Is there political appetite to take on this sort of fight, if you will, or discussion time?</p><p>IP: There is no question at the political world has gotten more treacherous for these companies. I mean, every day, we are hearing about problems of how they facilitated interference with our elections, how they are fostering social media addiction and so on and so forth. But in the antitrust field, they really look at one narrow thing of it`s basically, are consumers better off or worse off because of this behavior?</p><p>They are not going to make a judgment whether these companies are facilitating, you know, fake news. That`s not their area. And that is why thus far they have not restrained them. But it`s not always going to be the case.</p><p>And we`ve seen in Europe for example that their bar is lower. In Europe, they`re much more likely to say the mere fact that the behavior of this company drove others out of business is ultimately going to be bad for consumers.</p><p>HERERA: Well, keep track of it for us, Greg. We`ll have you back very soon. Appreciate it.</p><p>IP: All right. Thank you.</p><p>HERERA: Greg Ip with the \"Wall Street Journal\".</p><p>MATHISEN: To the economy now. Manufacturing output rose for fourth straight month back in December. And that capped the strongest quarter since 2010. The sector being helped by stronger consumer spending, increased business investment, and that improving global economy.</p><p>Manufacturing accounts for more than 75 percent of total industrial production, and accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy.</p><p>HERERA: Economic activity expanded into the New Year. According to the Federal Reserve`s latest read on the economy, inflation rose at a modest to moderate pace at the end of 2017, while wages continued to push higher. The Fed`s Beige Book, which is an anecdotal look at the economy across the country, indicated that businesses in some districts now have the ability to raise prices which could lead to higher inflation.</p><p>Separately, the Senate Banking Committee voted a send time to approve Jerome Powell to be the next chair of the Central Bank. The revote was necessary because the full Senate did not take up Powell`s nomination last year.</p><p>MATHISEN: With the deadline to reach a budget deal and keep the government open past Friday, the White House today threw its support behind a short- term funding bill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate would take up such a measure as soon as it is approved by the House.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R), KENTUCKY: By now, it is clear we are not ready to move ahead with a major agreement on long-term funding for our armed forces, nor on our immigration policy. Compromise solutions are not out of reach. But for now, Congress needs to keep the government running.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATHISEN: The Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said he would not vote for another stopgap bill. Graham helped craft a bipartisan immigration deal that was rejected last week.</p><p>HERERA: Still ahead, a bitcoin blood bath. Why the once hot cryptocurrency is suddenly ice cold?</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN: It wasn`t a pretty day for some of the country`s biggest bank. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) reported a 50 percent drop this bond trading revenue. That`s what investors focused on even as the bank reported better than expected earnings and profits for fourth quarter. Shares of the Dow component fell nearly 2 percent on this very positive day for stocks.</p><p>Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), meantime, saw its revenue fall short of expectations in part because of a drop in fixed income trading. Loan growth was up, profits topped analyst`s expectations despite a one $3 billion one-time charge related to the newly signed tax law. Shares of bank of America were also lower fractionally in trading today.</p><p>HERERA: Bitcoin prices are breaking down. After touching a peak of nearly $20,000 in December, most major exchanges \"Today\" show the crypto currency trading below $10,000, cutting its value in half from late last year.</p><p>So, what`s behind this crypto crash?</p><p>Seema Mody takes a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEEMA MODY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Bitcoin continues to fall on growing concerns that China and South Korea, two of the largest bitcoin markets, will ban residents from trading the cryptocurrency. Latest warning came from South Korea`s finance minister, who said banning cryptocurrencies is an option on the table due to concerns over tax evasion.</p><p>Further regulation is not being welcomed by all. Citizens (NYSE:CIA) in South Korea, over 200,000 of them, have signed an online petition asking the Korean government to not limit trading as they see value in crypto currencies. South Korea was one of the first countries to embrace digital currencies and it currently accounts for a significant portion of trading volume in bitcoin. Citizens (NYSE:CIA) writing: You may think you are protecting the public, but we citizens think that the government is stealing our dream.</p><p>It`s not just Asia that is trying to crack down on cryptocurrencies. France`s finance minister says he is launching a special task force that will look into weather individuals are using cryptocurrencies for tax evasion, a topic that got attention here in the United States when the IRS ordered Coinbase, a widely used cryptocurrency trading platform, to turn in records for over 14,000 users who trade bitcoin.</p><p>Concerns over tighter regulation have sent bitcoin sharply lower. Just today, it wiped out $30 billion in market value. And other crypto currencies, Ripple, Ether and Litecoin are also under pressure.</p><p>DENNIS BERMAN, WALL STREET JOURNAL FINANCIAL EDITOR: There is a fundamental tension between bitcoin as an unregulated, governmentless, seamless means of transaction and store value, however you want to characterize it, and the idea that it should be regulated to be me effective. So, I don`t know how in the end those two are bridged.</p><p>MODY: But given bitcoin`s massive 1,200 percent rise in 2017, some bitcoin investors see the recent drop as a healthy correction.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Seema Mody.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: Let`s take a closer look now at what might have contributed to bitcoin`s collapse today. Joining us to talk about that is Matthew Green. He rejoins us. He is a cryptocurrency expert, and assistant professor at Johns Hopkins Information Security Institute.</p><p>Matthew, welcome. Good to have you back again.</p><p>In simple terms, what do you think happened today?</p><p>MATTHEW GREEN, JOHNS HOPKINS INFORMATION SECURITY INSTITUTE: It`s hard to say. Cryptocurrencies go up and cryptocurrencies go down. Sometimes, people to ascribe reasons to that, but it`s not always clear there are reasons. There was definitely some fear about regulatory actions overseas. There are some indication that futures contracts may have played a role, and maybe people just panicked. Hard to know.</p><p>HERERA: You know, you liken it to gambling, correct?</p><p>GREEN: Yes.</p><p>HERERA: Because of the volatility that we are seeing in this particular cryptocurrency. It is a cautionary tale for investors, if you just look at the chart action in today`s trading session.</p><p>GREEN: So, some people like that aspect of bitcoin and cryptocurrency. They like the fact that it moves up and down very quickly. But, yes, I think for people who have invested money that they can`t afford to lose, cryptocurrencies are very dangerous and it`s a little worrying to me that we see so many of that kind of investor now getting involved in this field.</p><p>MATHISEN: Another person I was speaking to earlier today likened the cryptocurrencies to some of the Internet stocks circa 1998, 1999. You didn`t know how they were going to perform. Even Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), this person pointed out, lost 95 percent of its value at one point in its history.</p><p>How do you react to that analogy, number one? And will there come a time when bitcoin or these other cryptocurrencies aren`t as prone to these as spasms of moves up or down?</p><p>GREEN: So, I think something has happened over the last year, aside from this incredible price increase, is that we`ve seen a lot more money come into this field. That`s kind of -- that`s what is responsible for some of the price increase.</p><p>But I think over time as the markets become more liquid and more developed, you are probably going to see prices start to come to a point where they are actually stable and maybe not so crazy. And also, you are going to see technological advancements in the currencies themselves that hopefully will make them more useful for real applications like payments, kind of the way the dotcom bubble popped and then ultimately resulted in real tech companies we know are relying on.</p><p>HERERA: As you mentioned, more people have begun to mine bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies. But as you look further out, do you envision a time when there is widespread adoption of bitcoin as either legitimate currency? I mean, it`s not backed by any particular government, in a more legitimate trading vehicle?</p><p>GREEN: So, it may not be bitcoin. It may be one of the other currencies like ethereum or another currency. But, yes, I do. I used to be very skeptical about this, but I think that they`re -- it`s very unlikely that cryptocurrencies will go away. Maybe they`ll go down by 90 percent for a while, but I think they are here to stay.</p><p>MATHISEN: Matthew, thank you very much. We`ll have you back. I know we`re going to be talking about this more.</p><p>Matthew Green is with Johns Hopkins Information Security Institute.</p><p>HERERA: Tiffany (NYSE:TIF) has a shiny new outlook, and that`s where we begin tonight`s \"Market Focus\".</p><p>Following a solid holiday shopping season the luxury jeweler raised its fiscal 2017 earnings forecast and said it would invest in technology, marketing, and store presentation. In the latest quarter, the company said fine jewelry and items from its new home and accessories collection appeal to customers. The company`s stores in Europe and the Asia Pacific Region did particularly well. So, did the shares. They were up 1 percent to $108.99.</p><p>Viacom`s chairwoman Shari Redstone is reportedly pushing for a board shakeup at CBS (NYSE:CBS). The \"Wall Street Journal\" says Redstone wants to bring on new director as she renews discussions about a potential merger between the two companies. The report added that CBS (NYSE:CBS) has reservations about a tie up. Viacom`s shares were up nearly 2 percent to $31.96, shares of CBS (NYSE:CBS) were off almost 1 percent to $55.90.</p><p>U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) reported earnings that rose and beat expectations. The nation`s largest regional bank said the majority of the savings from the new tax law will be returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock buy backs. The rest will be put towards investments in technology and higher entry level wages. Shares closed down more than 1 percent to $57.34.</p><p>MATHISEN: Charles Schwab posted profits that were in line with expectations, despite saying earnings took an immediate hit from the new tax changes. Revenue topped forecasts. Schwab shares, up 1 percent, $56.09, the close there.</p><p>The drugmaker Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) reportedly in talks to buy the biotech Juno Therapeutics. \"The Wall Street Journal\" says the deal between the two companies could help strengthen Celgene`s portfolio of blood cancer drugs. Shares of Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) fell more than 2 percent to end the day at $102.02. Meanwhile, Juno Therapeutics up 51 percent -- it sounds like bitcoin -- to $69.25. Not today.</p><p>And after the bell, Alcoa (NYSE:AA) posted a larger than expected quarterly loss. Revenue did improve but also came up short. Shares were initially pressured in the after-hour session but they closed the regular day up 1 percent at $56.99.</p><p>Coming up, is the long run of record low mortgage rates about to come to an end?</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA: Walmart is wading into the opioid crisis. The world`s largest retailer is distributing the first of its kind opioid disposal product. The product is called Dispose RX and includes a packet that when mix with water in the prescription bottle turns the pills into a biodegradable gel that can be thrown in the garbage. The product is meant to be used by customers who no longer need their prescription painkillers or they`re concerned that someone else might take their pills.</p><p>MATHISEN: Well, homebuilders` sentiment is cooling off a bit but still remains near historic highs. This as the industry deals with higher construction costs and the shortage of workers. That said, many builders are optimistic that a solid job market, rising consumer confidence, and relatively low mortgage rates will help propel housing demand in the coming months.</p><p>HERERA: And even as mortgage rates stay near historically low levels, they are moving a bit higher and prospective homebuyers are keenly aware.</p><p>Diana Olick explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Mortgage applications rose last week, which doesn`t make a whole lot of sense, because interest rates also rose. Usually, applications fall on higher rates, especially refinances. It makes more sense though when you factor in fear. Borrowers may have jumped in, worried that the long run of record low rates is over.</p><p>So, applications to refinance led the charge, rising 4 percent for the week. Refinances are highly sensitive to even small moves in interest rates. And interest rates rose to their highest level since March of last year.</p><p>The average contract rate for a 30-year fixed jumped from 4.23 percent to 4.33 percent. That`s pretty big. We haven`t seen a move like that in a while and rates edge higher this week as well. While borrowers may be worried, expert economy watchers are not.</p><p>JERRY CASTELLINI, CASTLEARK MANAGEMENT PRESIDENT: It doesn`t appear rates are going to have a significant runaway on the upside, which I think should be supported for housing purchases.</p><p>OLICK: Mortgage applications to purchase a home which are less rate- sensitive rose 3 percent for the week and were 7 percent higher than the same week one year ago. Home buyers may be trying to get a jump on the spring market, given how competitive the market has been. The supply of homes for sale is still very low, but there are generally fewer shoppers out this time of year.</p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I`m Diana Olick in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN: And before we go, here`s another look at the very happy on Wall Street today. And the Dow`s first close above 26,000. The blue chip index climbed 322 points.</p><p>There was no giveback today. The NASDAQ added 74. And the S&amp;P 500 was up 26. All of the indexes closed at records.</p><p>HERERA: Once again.</p><p>MATHISEN: Once again.</p><p>HERERA: It seems like we are saying that all the time.</p><p>MATHISEN: Saying that all the time.</p><p>HERERA: That does it for us tonight. I`m Sue Herera. Thank you joining us.</p><p>MATHISEN: And I`m Tyler Mathisen. Thanks from me as well. Have a great evening, everybody.

The Dow  closes above 26,000 for the first time ever, clinching the fastest 1,000- point run in history.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TYLER MATHISEN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR:  Big promise.  Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL) is making a massive investment in America with a plan to  create thousands of jobs, put billions of dollars to work and bring a lot  of money back home.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HERERA:  Bitcoin breakdown.  What goes up can come down, hard.  And the  controversial cryptocurrency is no exception.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those stories and more tonight on NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Wednesday,  January 17th.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Good evening, everyone, and welcome.  </p><p>Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) surprises investors and promises a big investment in  the U.S.  More on that in just a moment.  </p><p>But we begin with the incredible day on Wall Street.  Stocks rose, and  rose, and rose some more.  The blue chip Dow index closed above 26,000 for  the first time ever, marking the fastest 1,000-point move in history.   Recall, it was just on January 4th that the Dow first closed before 25,000.   The rally today was broad, with all 11 sectors posting games and all of the  major indexes finishing at records.  </p><p>As one strategist said, there is just no reason to sell, which come the  think of it, may be a reason to sell.  But not today.  </p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 322 points to 26,115.  NASDAQ  added 74.  The S&amp;P 500 was up a sporty 26.  </p><p>If you need even more evidence of the enthusiasm for equities, a new survey  puts stock market optimism among professional investors at a 32-year high.  </p><p>What happens or tends to happen when we see an acceleration like this?  </p><p>Mike Santoli takes a look.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE SANTOLI, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Has the stock market  rally begun to overshoot?  There is no formal definition of a bull market  overshoot.  It's not the same as a market bubble.  Not a mere short-term  sugar rush.  It's a phase when stocks accelerate higher from already high  levels, the public gets excited from the market and investors extrapolate  good economic news far into the future.  </p><p>Evidence that we might be getting there?  The rally has picked up plenty  more energy in 2018.  The S&amp;P 500 is up nearly 5 percent since the tax law  was passed less than a month.  That's twice as much as 2018 earnings  estimates have be raised.  Riskier, more cyclical stocks are pulling away  from defensive sectors.  Some measures of investor sentiment and market  momentum are pushing record highs.  Flows into stock funds in the latest  week were the sixth heaviest in history.  </p><p>These are all signs that stocks could be overheating in the very short-term  as the public embraces a richly valued market newly energized by a big  corporate tax cut.  </p><p>The market's volatility index is actually up this year, even as the Dow has  gone higher, an unusual combination that suggests the market might be in  for wider two-way swings this year even as the uptrend looks intact.  </p><p>If this is an overshoot, it could last a while and be pretty lucrative in  the best case.  The '90s bull market probably started overshooting in 1997  and doubled in three years before the peak for example.  </p><p>The gains posted in this phase often don't fully survive an eventual bear  market, whenever one might hit.  The good news is the market seems out of  reach of the bears for now.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Mike Santoli.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  Apple's stock contributed to today's rally.  Shares of the largest  publicly traded company turned higher midday and the stock kept climbing  after the company announced a very big investment in this country, which  also happens to be Apple' largest market.  </p><p>Josh Lipton has the details.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOSH LIPTON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Apple's CEO Tim Cook  is making a $350 billion pledge to America.  Over five years, the iPhone  maker will create 20,000 new jobs.  It will also build a new campus here in  the U.S. which will be its third corporate campus, in addition to Cupertino  and Austin.  </p><p>The company plans capital expenditures of $30 billion.  It will increase  the size of its advanced manufacturing fund from $1 billion to $5 billion,  and there are reports that the company will give employees a $2,500  restricted stock bonus.  </p><p>Cook saying in a statement, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a success story that  could only have happened in America and we are proud to build on our long  history of support for the U.S. economy.</p><p>Apple's announcement aligns with some of President Trump's top priorities,  which include getting companies to hire more workers here in the U.S.  The  president's deputy press secretary responded to Cook's announcement,  saying: Just as the president promised, making our businesses more  competitive internationally is translating directly to benefit the American  worker, through increased wages, better benefits, and new jobs.  </p><p>For investors, a key headline was this: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) anticipates  making a tax payment of $38 billion to bring overseas cash back to the U.S.   It's doing that in response to recent changes in the U.S. tax law in which  companies pay a one-time tax of 15.5 percent on overseas cash.  The  previous rate was 35 percent.  There are some details in this report that  investors don't have, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is not saying how much of its  $252 billion held overseas it's going to be sending home, and we don't know  exactly how much more hiring and investing the company is doing in addition  to what their plans already were for the U.S. </p><p>But analysts are already speculating about how any freed up money could be  put to work.  They think it could go right back to shareholders through  buybacks or dividends.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Josh Lipton, San Francisco.   </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, a number of other tech companies were on Capitol Hill  today.  Executives from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), YouTube and Twitter were  questioned by lawmakers about terrorist content an their sites.  It is the  latest move by government officials to increase scrutiny of big tech, a  sector that's growing fast and having a greater influence on our lives.  </p><p>Julia Boorstin has more.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JULIA BOORSTIN, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB), YouTube, and Twitter policy chiefs defending their company's  efforts to defeat terrorism, saying they are working together and combining  artificial intelligence and their growing employee ranks to prevent their  platforms from being used to recruit and train terrorists.  </p><p>Facebook's head of global policy management saying the company will double  its employees focused on safety and security to 20,000 by the end of the  year.  YouTube saying it has removed 160,000 terrorism-related videos since  June, identifying 98 percent with machine learning.  While Twitter says it  suspends 75 percent of terrorist-related accounts before they tweet.  </p><p>Republican John Thune pushed the executives about why terrorist videos are  still online, flagging a YouTube bomb-making video instructing the  Manhattan suicide bomber which resurfaced as recently as this month.  </p><p>SEN. JOHN THUNE (R), SOUTH DAKOTA:  How is it possible for that to happen?   Why aren't your efforts working to keep this video off your platform  permanently?  </p><p>JUNIPER DOWNS, YOUTUBE HEAD OF PUBLIC POLICY:  This particular video was  caught by our systems.  We have used it in our sharing database and we are  catching re-uploads of the video quickly and removing it as soon as those  uploads are detected.  </p><p>BOORSTIN:  The questioning expanded beyond just terrorism, as senators also  pressed the companies about their role enabling Russian's manipulation of  the election and whether they have a political agenda.  The companies  saying they have no agenda and they are doing everything they can to crack  down on all varieties of abuse on the platforms.</p><p>This as all these companies face growing scrutiny for their size and  influence, and as they take steps to assuage concerns.  Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) yesterday announcing that every video submitted for Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) prepared advertising must be reviewed by a person and Mark  Zuckerberg saying that fixing Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is his goal for the  year, changing the newsfeed last week to prioritize personal interactions.  </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO, THE NEW YORK TIMES:  When they put out this product, they  seem to be stuck in the bubble of imagining the best stuff that will happen  with their technologies and usually not pausing to think about the worst  stuff.  And so, that's why they are behind the curve.  </p><p>BOORSTIN:  Now, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Twitter are  trying to make sure they are ahead of the curve, especially when it comes  to potential manipulation of the elections coming up this fall.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Julia Boorstin in Los Angeles.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HERERA:  In a \"Wall Street Journal\" op-ed published today, chief economics  commentator Greg Ip called into question whether today's tech giants are  becoming too big and should be broken up.  He said a handful of  heavyweights dominate their respective categories.  Alphabet's Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) was one example, driving nearly 90 percent of all Internet  searches.  But what would more regulation or a scaling down among tech  giants mean for consumers?</p><p>Joining us now is the author of the article, Greg Ip.  </p><p>Greg, it's always great to see you.  Thanks for joining us.</p><p>GREG IP, CHIEF ECONOMICS COMMENTATOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Yes, great to  talk to you.  Thanks for having me.  </p><p>HERERA:  In reading the article, you liken the situation that we find  ourselves in today with these tech giants, very similar to historical  precedent, which was Standard Oil and AT&amp;T (NYSE:T), which both dominated  their respective fields.  </p><p>IP:  That's right.  There is important similarities and differences.  The  similarity of course is that they are both gigantic.  They're both sort of  technological leaders.  And they both in some sense are gateways to  critical parts of the economy, whether it's oil and telephones in the old  days or whether it's the Internet today.  </p><p>And that gateway position gives them extreme leverage and some would argue  monopoly profits.  But there's also important differences.  Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) give their stuff away for free.   It's really hard to argue that they're gouging customers.  And even the  stuff they do sell like Google's advertising rates have been falling year  in and year out.  </p><p>They are also creating new product.  So you couldn't argue their innovation  is falling apart.  It creates sort of a difficult situation.  If you are in  the antitrust field today, it's not so much large market share or is a  monopoly that bothers you.  It's whether they are using that position to  make consumers worse off by suppressing competition.  And that's where the  big question is.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  So, you also talk about Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has a large  part of online sales, but a very fall part really when you look at it  overall retail sales.  They have a lot of e-book sales but there are  obviously printed book as well.  So, how -- how would one make an antitrust  case against any of these companies if, as you point out, a lot of their  stuff is being given away for free, and a lot of cases the prices are  coming down, not going up.  And they're not acting like monopolists.  </p><p>IP:  I think that it would be very hard right now given what we know today  to make that case, Tyler, precisely for the reasons you cite, that it's  hard to prove that the fact they are growing bigger has actually come at  the expense of consumers.  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), as you say, offers an  amazing array of stuff.  That stuff they've had such a powerful effect on  low prices, they seem to be actually affecting the inflation rate.  </p><p>But I think if you peer into the future, this is the question.  Their  dominance of certain segments, we mentioned electronic books.  But look at  third party merchants.   If you are a small business and you want to  actually sell on the Internet, the fact that roughly half of shopping and  Internet searches start with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) it means there is almost  no point this starting your own Website.  You almost feel like you have to  go through Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and pay their 15 percent commission.  </p><p>That I think is where questions will be asked in the future.  Is this good  or is this bad for consumers?</p><p>HERERA:  Is there political appetite to take on this sort of fight, if you  will, or discussion time?  </p><p>IP:  There is no question at the political world has gotten more  treacherous for these companies.  I mean, every day, we are hearing about  problems of how they facilitated interference with our elections, how they  are fostering social media addiction and so on and so forth.  But in the  antitrust field, they really look at one narrow thing of it's basically,  are consumers better off or worse off because of this behavior?  </p><p>They are not going to make a judgment whether these companies are  facilitating, you know, fake news.  That's not their area.  And that is why  thus far they have not restrained them.  But it's not always going to be  the case.  </p><p>And we've seen in Europe for example that their bar is lower.  In Europe,  they're much more likely to say the mere fact that the behavior of this  company drove others out of business is ultimately going to be bad for  consumers.  </p><p>HERERA:  Well, keep track of it for us, Greg.  We'll have you back very  soon.  Appreciate it.  </p><p>IP:  All right.  Thank you.</p><p>HERERA:  Greg Ip with the \"Wall Street Journal\".</p><p>MATHISEN:  To the economy now.  Manufacturing output rose for fourth  straight month back in December.  And that capped the strongest quarter  since 2010.  The sector being helped by stronger consumer spending,  increased business investment, and that improving global economy.  </p><p>Manufacturing accounts for more than 75 percent of total industrial  production, and accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy.  </p><p>HERERA: Economic activity expanded into the New Year.  According to the  Federal Reserve's latest read on the economy, inflation rose at a modest to  moderate pace at the end of 2017, while wages continued to push higher.   The Fed's Beige Book, which is an anecdotal look at the economy across the  country, indicated that businesses in some districts now have the ability  to raise prices which could lead to higher inflation.  </p><p>Separately, the Senate Banking Committee voted a send time to approve  Jerome Powell to be the next chair of the Central Bank.  The revote was  necessary because the full Senate did not take up Powell's nomination last  year.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  With the deadline to reach a budget deal and keep the government  open past Friday, the White House today threw its support behind a short- term funding bill.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate  would take up such a measure as soon as it is approved by the House.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R), KENTUCKY:  By now, it is clear we are not ready  to move ahead with a major agreement on long-term funding for our armed  forces, nor on our immigration policy.  Compromise solutions are not out of  reach.  But for now, Congress needs to keep the government running.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATHISEN:  The Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said he would not vote for  another stopgap bill.  Graham helped craft a bipartisan immigration deal  that was rejected last week.  </p><p>HERERA:  Still ahead, a bitcoin blood bath.  Why the once hot  cryptocurrency is suddenly ice cold?</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>MATHISEN:  It wasn't a pretty day for some of the country's biggest bank.   Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) reported a 50 percent drop this bond trading  revenue.  That's what investors focused on even as the bank reported better  than expected earnings and profits for fourth quarter.  Shares of the Dow  component fell nearly 2 percent on this very positive day for stocks.  </p><p>Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), meantime, saw its revenue fall short of  expectations in part because of a drop in fixed income trading.  Loan  growth was up, profits topped analyst's expectations despite a one $3  billion one-time charge related to the newly signed tax law.  Shares of  bank of America were also lower fractionally in trading today.</p><p>HERERA:  Bitcoin prices are breaking down.  After touching a peak of nearly  $20,000 in December, most major exchanges \"Today\" show the crypto currency  trading below $10,000, cutting its value in half from late last year.  </p><p>So, what's behind this crypto crash?  </p><p>Seema Mody takes a look.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEEMA MODY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Bitcoin continues to  fall on growing concerns that China and South Korea, two of the largest  bitcoin markets, will ban residents from trading the cryptocurrency.   Latest warning came from South Korea's finance minister, who said banning  cryptocurrencies is an option on the table due to concerns over tax  evasion.  </p><p>Further regulation is not being welcomed by all.  Citizens (NYSE:CIA) in  South Korea, over 200,000 of them, have signed an online petition asking  the Korean government to not limit trading as they see value in crypto  currencies.  South Korea was one of the first countries to embrace digital  currencies and it currently accounts for a significant portion of trading  volume in bitcoin.  Citizens (NYSE:CIA) writing: You may think you are  protecting the public, but we citizens think that the government is  stealing our dream.  </p><p>It's not just Asia that is trying to crack down on cryptocurrencies.   France's finance minister says he is launching a special task force that  will look into weather individuals are using cryptocurrencies for tax  evasion, a topic that got attention here in the United States when the IRS  ordered Coinbase, a widely used cryptocurrency trading platform, to turn in  records for over 14,000 users who trade bitcoin.  </p><p>Concerns over tighter regulation have sent bitcoin sharply lower.  Just  today, it wiped out $30 billion in market value.  And other crypto  currencies, Ripple, Ether and Litecoin are also under pressure.  </p><p>DENNIS BERMAN, WALL STREET JOURNAL FINANCIAL EDITOR:  There is a  fundamental tension between bitcoin as an unregulated, governmentless,  seamless means of transaction and store value, however you want to  characterize it, and the idea that it should be regulated to be me  effective.  So, I don't know how in the end those two are bridged.  </p><p>MODY:  But given bitcoin's massive 1,200 percent rise in 2017, some bitcoin  investors see the recent drop as a healthy correction.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Seema Mody.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  Let's take a closer look now at what might have contributed to  bitcoin's collapse today.  Joining us to talk about that is Matthew Green.   He rejoins us.  He is a cryptocurrency expert, and assistant professor at  Johns Hopkins Information Security Institute.  </p><p>Matthew, welcome.  Good to have you back again.  </p><p>In simple terms, what do you think happened today?  </p><p>MATTHEW GREEN, JOHNS HOPKINS INFORMATION SECURITY INSTITUTE:  It's hard to  say.  Cryptocurrencies go up and cryptocurrencies go down.  Sometimes,  people to ascribe reasons to that, but it's not always clear there are  reasons.  There was definitely some fear about regulatory actions overseas.   There are some indication that futures contracts may have played a role,  and maybe people just panicked.  Hard to know.  </p><p>HERERA:  You know, you liken it to gambling, correct?  </p><p>GREEN:  Yes.  </p><p>HERERA:  Because of the volatility that we are seeing in this particular  cryptocurrency.  It is a cautionary tale for investors, if you just look at  the chart action in today's trading session.  </p><p>GREEN:  So, some people like that aspect of bitcoin and cryptocurrency.   They like the fact that it moves up and down very quickly.  But, yes, I  think for people who have invested money that they can't afford to lose,  cryptocurrencies are very dangerous and it's a little worrying to me that  we see so many of that kind of investor now getting involved in this field.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Another person I was speaking to earlier today likened the  cryptocurrencies to some of the Internet stocks circa 1998, 1999.  You  didn't know how they were going to perform.  Even Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN),  this person pointed out, lost 95 percent of its value at one point in its  history.  </p><p>How do you react to that analogy, number one?  And will there come a time  when bitcoin or these other cryptocurrencies aren't as prone to these as  spasms of moves up or down?  </p><p>GREEN:  So, I think something has happened over the last year, aside from  this incredible price increase, is that we've seen a lot more money come  into this field.  That's kind of -- that's what is responsible for some of  the price increase.  </p><p>But I think over time as the markets become more liquid and more developed,  you are probably going to see prices start to come to a point where they  are actually stable and maybe not so crazy.  And also, you are going to see  technological advancements in the currencies themselves that hopefully will  make them more useful for real applications like payments, kind of the way  the dotcom bubble popped and then ultimately resulted in real tech  companies we know are relying on.  </p><p>HERERA:  As you mentioned, more people have begun to mine bitcoin and the  other cryptocurrencies.  But as you look further out, do you envision a  time when there is widespread adoption of bitcoin as either legitimate  currency?  I mean, it's not backed by any particular government, in a more  legitimate trading vehicle?  </p><p>GREEN:  So, it may not be bitcoin.  It may be one of the other currencies  like ethereum or another currency.  But, yes, I do.  I used to be very  skeptical about this, but I think that they're -- it's very unlikely that  cryptocurrencies will go away.  Maybe they'll go down by 90 percent for a  while, but I think they are here to stay.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Matthew, thank you very much.  We'll have you back.  I know  we're going to be talking about this more.  </p><p>Matthew Green is with Johns Hopkins Information Security Institute.  </p><p>HERERA:  Tiffany (NYSE:TIF) has a shiny new outlook, and that's where we  begin tonight's \"Market Focus\".  </p><p>Following a solid holiday shopping season the luxury jeweler raised its  fiscal 2017 earnings forecast and said it would invest in technology,  marketing, and store presentation.  In the latest quarter, the company said  fine jewelry and items from its new home and accessories collection appeal  to customers.  The company's stores in Europe and the Asia Pacific Region  did particularly well.  So, did the shares.  They were up 1 percent to  $108.99.</p><p>Viacom's chairwoman Shari Redstone is reportedly pushing for a board  shakeup at CBS (NYSE:CBS).  The \"Wall Street Journal\" says Redstone wants  to bring on new director as she renews discussions about a potential merger  between the two companies.  The report added that CBS (NYSE:CBS) has  reservations about a tie up.  Viacom's shares were up nearly 2 percent to  $31.96, shares of CBS (NYSE:CBS) were off almost 1 percent to $55.90.</p><p>U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) reported earnings that rose and beat expectations.   The nation's largest regional bank said the majority of the savings from  the new tax law will be returned to shareholders in the form of dividends  and stock buy backs.  The rest will be put towards investments in  technology and higher entry level wages.  Shares closed down more than 1  percent to $57.34.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Charles Schwab posted profits that were in line with  expectations, despite saying earnings took an immediate hit from the new  tax changes.  Revenue topped forecasts.  Schwab shares, up 1 percent,  $56.09, the close there.  </p><p>The drugmaker Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) reportedly in talks to buy the biotech  Juno Therapeutics.  \"The Wall Street Journal\" says the deal between the two  companies could help strengthen Celgene's portfolio of blood cancer drugs.   Shares of Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) fell more than 2 percent to end the day at  $102.02.  Meanwhile, Juno Therapeutics up 51 percent -- it sounds like  bitcoin -- to $69.25.  Not today.  </p><p>And after the bell, Alcoa (NYSE:AA) posted a larger than expected quarterly  loss.  Revenue did improve but also came up short.  Shares were initially  pressured in the after-hour session but they closed the regular day up 1  percent at $56.99.  </p><p>Coming up, is the long run of record low mortgage rates about to come to an  end?</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>HERERA:  Walmart is wading into the opioid crisis.  The world's largest  retailer is distributing the first of its kind opioid disposal product.   The product is called Dispose RX and includes a packet that when mix with  water in the prescription bottle turns the pills into a biodegradable gel  that can be thrown in the garbage.  The product is meant to be used by  customers who no longer need their prescription painkillers or they're  concerned that someone else might take their pills.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Well, homebuilders' sentiment is cooling off a bit but still  remains near historic highs.  This as the industry deals with higher  construction costs and the shortage of workers.  That said, many builders  are optimistic that a solid job market, rising consumer confidence, and  relatively low mortgage rates will help propel housing demand in the coming  months.  </p><p>HERERA:  And even as mortgage rates stay near historically low levels, they  are moving a bit higher and prospective homebuyers are keenly aware.  </p><p>Diana Olick explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIANA OLICK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT:  Mortgage applications  rose last week, which doesn't make a whole lot of sense, because interest  rates also rose.  Usually, applications fall on higher rates, especially  refinances.  It makes more sense though when you factor in fear.  Borrowers  may have jumped in, worried that the long run of record low rates is over.  </p><p>So, applications to refinance led the charge, rising 4 percent for the  week.  Refinances are highly sensitive to even small moves in interest  rates.  And interest rates rose to their highest level since March of last  year.  </p><p>The average contract rate for a 30-year fixed jumped from 4.23 percent to  4.33 percent.  That's pretty big.  We haven't seen a move like that in a  while and rates edge higher this week as well.  While borrowers may be  worried, expert economy watchers are not.  </p><p>JERRY CASTELLINI, CASTLEARK MANAGEMENT PRESIDENT:  It doesn't appear rates  are going to have a significant runaway on the upside, which I think should  be supported for housing purchases.</p><p>OLICK:  Mortgage applications to purchase a home which are less rate- sensitive rose 3 percent for the week and were 7 percent higher than the  same week one year ago.  Home buyers may be trying to get a jump on the  spring market, given how competitive the market has been.  The supply of  homes for sale is still very low, but there are generally fewer shoppers  out this time of year.  </p><p>For NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, I'm Diana Olick in Washington.   </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATHISEN:  And before we go, here's another look at the very happy on Wall  Street today.  And the Dow's first close above 26,000.  The blue chip index  climbed 322 points.  </p><p>There was no giveback today.  The NASDAQ added 74.  And the S&amp;P 500 was up  26.  All of the indexes closed at records.  </p><p>HERERA:  Once again.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Once again.</p><p>HERERA:  It seems like we are saying that all the time.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  Saying that all the time.  </p><p>HERERA:  That does it for us tonight.  I'm Sue Herera.  Thank you joining  us.  </p><p>MATHISEN:  And I'm Tyler Mathisen.  Thanks from me as well.  Have a great  evening, everybody.  We'll see you back here tomorrow.</p><p>END</p><p>Nightly Business Report transcripts and video are available on-line post  broadcast at <url normalizedValue=\"http://nbr.com\">http://nbr.com</url>.
