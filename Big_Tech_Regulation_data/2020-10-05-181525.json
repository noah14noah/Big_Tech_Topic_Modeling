And thank you to the Bank Al-Maghrib which is celebrating its 60th anniversary this year for hosting this conference.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We're pleased to join you here in Rabat, as we continue a series of conferences that we're convening this year in every region, worldwide. The purpose of our conferences is to promote broad discussions on and develop a better understanding of how our member countries are incorporating the high-level considerations proposed in the Bali Fintech Agenda in their national frameworks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Promoting progress in Fintech will surely be a daunting challenge for policymakers as we aim to reap the potential benefits of new financial technologies, while also managing their risks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This conference will give us an opportunity to reflect on the relevance of the elements of the Bali Fintech Agenda (what we refer to as the \"BFA\") to each economy's conditions; to share experiences; to voice concerns and explore challenges; and to discuss various policy approaches.</p><p>Technological change, along with market developments, present us with a wide range of new options and an array of new risks. With the BFA outlining an integrated approach, our task now is to adjust the policy framework in a comprehensive manner around these trends aiming to grasp the full, positive potential of Fintech for the good of society.</p><p>The BFA started in response to the call by many member countries of the World Bank Group and the IMF to have a high-level conceptual framework that can tie together the many challenges inherent in the digitalization of financial services.</p><p>Maintaining the momentum of the BFA after its launch last October at our Annual Meetings the Bank and the Fund have already started to set this agenda into action.</p><p>We've already conducted a survey with more than 100 responses that will provide insights into how our membership sees the agenda's priorities. The survey results combined with a summary of recent Fintech developments and regulatory responses will soon be presented in a formal paper to our Executive Board. We are also furthering our understanding of Fintech issues through our dialogue with national authorities in the context of our Article IV consultation and FSAP reports. And we've been working closely with standard-setters in each of their respective areas.</p><p>In facing the challenges ahead, everyone has a role to play. Given the diversity within our global membership, the experiences of policymakers with Fintech vary widely. Some jurisdictions have been at the frontier, with pro-active and sometimes experimental proposals while others, until now, have observed from the sidelines.</p><p>There are important public-sector initiatives underway that provide a sound footing for private-sector fintech activities including payment-systems modernization in Egypt and Morocco. In other jurisdictions, including the UAE, legal frameworks are being constructed to ensure that fintech developments observe prudential principles. In the next two days, we hope to learn more about this.</p><p>We'll also discuss a very promising area, where Fintech seems ready to provide a major benefit to the region promoting Financial Inclusion. Making financial services available to populations that now have little, or no, access to finance is a profoundly important priority in global development. Those services include making payments, as well as ensuring easier access to credit through peer-to-peer networks, for example. Some countries in the region have made enormous strides in mobile payments, while others are still catching up.</p><p>Those benefits, however, are accompanied by new challenges. For instance: Since those broader types of access to financial services are provided by non-bank firms such as telecom operators and lending platforms new regulatory issues have arisen. Financial regulations, in the past, have been focused more on licensed institutions principally, banks. So how should these new areas be regulated? And should there be relatively high barriers to entry to mitigate unknown risks or does financial innovation require more flexible solutions, including regulatory sandboxes?</p><p>Amid today's discussions, we're looking forward to hearing your thoughts about the Financial Inclusion theme as well additional issues in financial development. They include new ways of raising funds, managing risks, and prioritizing national development strategies. We're also mindful of ensuring that the new landscape is competitive, so that we can realize the full value of the new efficiencies promised by new technologies.7</p><p>Another opportunity that we'll discuss today where the potential for cost savings and time efficiency is enormous is cross-border payments. That includes remittances, which play a very significant role in the region. Banks currently play a major role in international money transfers but banks' role is changing in light of new entrants, including telcos, Big Tech, and other firms. In the region, Saudi Arabia and the UAE are spearheading fintech initiatives to facilitate cross-border settlements.</p><p>This area includes a wide array of policy challenges that, by their nature, require a coordinated international framework. We must seek ways</p><p>to improve the payments infrastructure, to enable greater efficiency;</p><p>to broaden access to, and review the oversight of, this infrastructure to new entrants and ensure the interoperability of systems to maximize the benefits of innovation;</p><p>to oversee and appropriately address the transformation of the banking business due to new technologies; and</p><p>to mitigate the risk of money laundering in the new payment channels.</p><p>In addition, some fundamental services of central banks relate to the issuance of currencies specifically, the question of whether central banks should issue digital currencies (or \"CBDCs\"). According to a recent survey by the Bank for International Settlements: 70 percent of central banks are currently involved in or soon will be involved in this complex area, with one-third of them now seeing the issuance of CBDCs as likely.</p><p>In today's discussions, we'll explore the costs and benefits of CBDCs along with the implications for \"banking as we know it.\" Panelists will delve into the implications of Fintech for providing central-bank services as well as for developing robust data infrastructures, to address privacy and cyber risk concerns.</p><p>With all of these new developments occurring around us, we must also change what regulators and supervisors monitor and analyze. Classic prudential reporting frameworks, which rely on statutory powers, will need to be complemented by new data-collection frameworks. They must cover new entrants and new channels and the legal basis for doing so, may not yet be in place.</p><p>Similarly, issues regarding the regulatory perimeter must be addressed. For example: What is the appropriate regulatory approach to crypto assets and, more generally, to new products and activities? What are the stability implications and, as we identify new risks, how can we mitigate them? Such adjustments should be embedded in strong institutional and legal frameworks that guarantee financial integrity.</p><p>After considering all of these issues: Our final session of the day, will be devoted to a roundtable, in which participants will be invited to share their experiences and ask further questions.</p><p>As we start developing our work program, to follow-up on the Bali Fintech Agenda, we can begin our efforts by taking three specific steps.</p><p>First: Given the comprehensive nature of these challenges, and these opportunities, it would certainly be useful for all jurisdictions to begin consultations with all of the relevant parties in this area with central banks, regulators, and private-sector participants to come up with country-specific approaches. Taking into account the comparative advantages and specific situations of each jurisdiction, the priorities are likely to differ from country to country, and the focus will have to shift to meet their specific needs. For some countries, AML/CFT issues may be the top priority; for others, financial inclusion may be the central concern; for still others, the leading priority may be infrastructure.</p><p>Second: Another concrete step would be to have regional consultations and cooperation efforts.</p><p>And third: We can commit ourselves to sharing knowledge, and to engaging in more events like this one, to reach beyond our own specific countries' conditions and concerns. Agreeing to pursue a robust program of publications by our respective institutions can be very helpful, as well, in promoting broader knowledge-exchange.</p><p>I'm looking forward to our discussions over the next two days, and I'll be eager to keep in touch with all of your institutions as we move forward in the months to come, to advance this exciting agenda.</p><p>Before concluding, I should also mention that, as you may already know, the IMF and Morocco have started a broad partnership towards hosting the 2021 IMF Annual Meetings in Marrakesh. This conference is one of many events that will be organized in Morocco and the region to build momentum for this global event, and we are happy to have the Moroccan authorities as our partners.</p><p>Thank you once again for your participation, and for your warm welcome here in Rabat.</p><p>With that, I'll wish you well, hoping that we'll have productive discussions.</p><p>Thank you.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1122776455</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMM-M261-DYTH-G17S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1577\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 13, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Some jurisdictions have been at the frontier, with pro-active and sometimes experimental proposals \u2014 while others, until now, have observed from the sidelines.There are important public-sector initiatives underway that provide a sound footing for private-sector fintech activities \u2014 including payment-systems modernization in Egypt and Morocco. In other jurisdictions, including the UAE, legal frameworks are being constructed to ensure that fintech developments observe prudential principles. In the next two days, we hope to learn more about this.We'll also discuss a very promising area, where Fintech seems ready to provide a major benefit to the region \u2014 promoting Financial Inclusion. Making financial services available to populations that now have little, or no, access to finance is a profoundly important priority in global development. Those services include making payments, as well as ensuring easier access to credit \u2014 through peer-to-peer networks, for example. Some countries in the region have made enormous strides in mobile payments, while others are still catching up.Those benefits, however, are accompanied by new challenges. For instance: Since those broader types of access to financial services are provided by non-bank firms \u2014 such as telecom operators and lending platforms \u2014 new regulatory issues have arisen. Financial regulations, in the past, have been focused more on licensed institutions \u2014 principally, banks. So how should these new areas be regulated? And should there be relatively high barriers to entry to mitigate unknown risks \u2014or does financial innovation require more flexible solutions, including regulatory sandboxes?Amid today's discussions, we're looking forward to hearing your thoughts about the Financial Inclusion theme \u2014 as well additional issues in financial development. They include new ways of raising funds, managing risks, and prioritizing national development strategies. We're also mindful of ensuring that the new landscape is competitive, so that we can realize the full value of the new efficiencies promised by new technologies.7Another opportunity that we'll discuss today \u2014 where the potential for cost savings and time efficiency is enormous \u2014 is cross-border payments. That includes remittances, which play a very significant role in the region. Banks currently play a major role in international money transfers \u2014 but banks' role is changing in light of new entrants, including telcos, Big Tech, and other firms. In the region, Saudi Arabia and the UAE are spearheading fintech initiatives to facilitate cross-border settlements.This area includes a wide array of policy challenges that, by their nature, require a coordinated international framework. We must seek waysto improve the payments infrastructure, to enable greater efficiency;to broaden access to, and review the oversight of, this infrastructure to new entrants \u2014 and ensure the interoperability of systems to maximize the benefits of innovation;to oversee and appropriately address the transformation of the banking business due to new technologies; and to mitigate the risk of money laundering in the new payment channels.In addition, some fundamental services of central banks relate to the issuance of currencies \u2014 specifically, the question of whether central banks should issue digital currencies (or 'CBDCs'). According to a recent survey by the Bank for International Settlements: 70 percent of central banks are currently involved in \u2014 or soon will be involved in \u2014 this complex area, with one-third of them now seeing the issuance of CBDCs as likely.In today's discussions, we'll explore the costs and benefits of CBDCs \u2014 along with the implications for 'banking as we know it.' Panelists will delve into the implications of Fintech for providing central-bank services \u2014 as well as for developing robust data infrastructures, to address privacy and cyber risk concerns.With all of these new developments occurring around us, we must also change what regulators and supervisors monitor and analyze. Classic prudential reporting frameworks, which rely on statutory powers, will need to be complemented by new data-collection frameworks. They must cover new entrants and new channels \u2014 and the legal basis for doing so, may not yet be in place.Similarly, issues regarding the regulatory perimeter must be addressed. For example: What is the appropriate regulatory approach to crypto assets \u2014 and, more generally, to new products and activities? What are the stability implications \u2014 and, as we identify new risks, how can we mitigate them? Such adjustments should be embedded in strong institutional and legal frameworks that guarantee financial integrity.After considering all of these issues: Our final session of the day, will be devoted to a roundtable, in which participants will be invited to share their experiences and ask further questions.As we start developing our work program, to follow-up on the Bali Fintech Agenda, we can begin our efforts by taking three specific steps.First: Given the comprehensive nature of these challenges, and these opportunities, it would certainly be useful for all jurisdictions to begin consultations with all of the relevant parties in this area \u2014 with central banks, regulators, and private-sector participants \u2014 to come up with country-specific approaches. Taking into account the comparative advantages and specific situations of each jurisdiction, the priorities are likely to differ from country to country, and the focus will have to shift to meet their specific needs. For some countries, AML/CFT issues may be the top priority; for others, financial inclusion may be the central concern; for still others, the leading priority may be infrastructure.Second: Another concrete step would be to have regional consultations and cooperation efforts.And third: We can commit ourselves to sharing knowledge, and to engaging in more events like this one, to reach beyond our own specific countries' conditions and concerns. Agreeing to pursue a robust program of publications by our respective institutions can be very helpful, as well, in promoting broader knowledge-exchange.I'm looking forward to our discussions over the next two days, and I'll be eager to keep in touch with all of your institutions \u2014 as we move forward in the months to come, to advance this exciting agenda.Before concluding, I should also mention that, as you may already know, the IMF and Morocco have started a broad partnership towards hosting the 2021 IMF Annual Meetings in Marrakesh. This conference is one of many events that will be organized in Morocco and the region to build momentum for this global event, and we are happy to have the Moroccan authorities as our partners.Thank you once again for your participation, and for your warm welcome here in Rabat.With that, I'll wish you well, hoping that we'll have productive discussions.Thank you.Distributed by APO Group on behalf of International Monetary Fund (IMF).

And thank you to the Bank Al-Maghrib - which is celebrating its 60thanniversary this year - for hosting this conference.<br/><br/>We're pleased to join you here in Rabat, as we continue a series of conferences that we're convening this year in every region, worldwide. The purpose of our conferences is to promote broad discussions on - and develop a better understanding of - how our member countries are incorporating the high-level considerations proposed in the Bali Fintech Agenda in their national frameworks.</p><p><br/><br/>Promoting progress in Fintech will surely be a daunting challenge for policymakers - as we aim to reap the potential benefits of new financial technologies, while also managing their risks.<br/><br/>This conference will give us an opportunity to reflect on the relevance of the elements of the Bali Fintech Agenda (what we refer to as the \"BFA\") to each economy's conditions; to share experiences; to voice concerns and explore challenges; and to discuss various policy approaches.<br/><br/>Technological change, along with market developments, present us with a wide range of new options - and an array of new risks. With the BFA outlining an integrated approach, our task now is to adjust the policy framework in a comprehensive manner around these trends - aiming to grasp the full, positive potential of Fintech for the good of society.<br/><br/>The BFA started in response to the call - by many member countries of the World Bank Group and the IMF - to have a high-level conceptual framework that can tie together the many challenges inherent in the digitalization of financial services.<br/><br/>Maintaining the momentum of the BFA - after its launch last October at our Annual Meetings - the Bank and the Fund have already started to set this agenda into action.<br/><br/>We've already conducted a survey - with more than 100 responses - that will provide insights into how our membership sees the agenda's priorities. The survey results - combined with a summary of recent Fintech developments and regulatory responses - will soon be presented in a formal paper to our Executive Board. We are also furthering our understanding of Fintech issues through our dialogue with national authorities in the context of our Article IV consultation and FSAP reports. And we've been working closely with standard-setters in each of their respective areas.<br/><br/>In facing the challenges ahead, everyone has a role to play. Given the diversity within our global membership, the experiences of policymakers with Fintech vary widely. Some jurisdictions have been at the frontier, with pro-active and sometimes experimental proposals - while others, until now, have observed from the sidelines.<br/><br/>There are important public-sector initiatives underway that provide a sound footing for private-sector fintech activities - including payment-systems modernization in Egypt and Morocco. In other jurisdictions, including the UAE, legal frameworks are being constructed to ensure that fintech developments observe prudential principles. In the next two days, we hope to learn more about this.<br/><br/>We'll also discuss a very promising area, where Fintech seems ready to provide a major benefit to the region - promoting Financial Inclusion.

And thank you to the Bank Al-Maghrib \u2014 which is celebrating its 60th anniversary this year \u2014 for hosting this conference.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We're pleased to join you here in Rabat, as we continue a series of conferences that we're convening this year in every region, worldwide. The purpose of our conferences is to promote broad discussions on \u2014 and develop a better understanding of \u2014 how our member countries are incorporating the high-level considerations proposed in the Bali Fintech Agenda in their national frameworks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Promoting progress in Fintech will surely be a daunting challenge for policymakers \u2014 as we aim to reap the potential benefits of new financial technologies, while also managing their risks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This conference will give us an opportunity to reflect on the relevance of the elements of the Bali Fintech Agenda (what we refer to as the \"BFA\") to each economy's conditions; to share experiences; to voice concerns and explore challenges; and to discuss various policy approaches.</p><p>Technological change, along with market developments, present us with a wide range of new options \u2014 and an array of new risks. With the BFA outlining an integrated approach, our task now is to adjust the policy framework in a comprehensive manner around these trends \u2014 aiming to grasp the full, positive potential of Fintech for the good of society.</p><p>The BFA started in response to the call \u2014 by many member countries of the World Bank Group and the IMF \u2014 to have a high-level conceptual framework that can tie together the many challenges inherent in the digitalization of financial services.</p><p>Maintaining the momentum of the BFA \u2014 after its launch last October at our Annual Meetings \u2014 the Bank and the Fund have already started to set this agenda into action.</p><p>We've already conducted a survey \u2014 with more than 100 responses \u2014 that will provide insights into how our membership sees the agenda's priorities. The survey results \u2014 combined with a summary of recent Fintech developments and regulatory responses \u2014 will soon be presented in a formal paper to our Executive Board. We are also furthering our understanding of Fintech issues through our dialogue with national authorities in the context of our Article IV consultation and FSAP reports. And we've been working closely with standard-setters in each of their respective areas.</p><p>In facing the challenges ahead, everyone has a role to play. Given the diversity within our global membership, the experiences of policymakers with Fintech vary widely. Some jurisdictions have been at the frontier, with pro-active and sometimes experimental proposals \u2014 while others, until now, have observed from the sidelines.</p><p>There are important public-sector initiatives underway that provide a sound footing for private-sector fintech activities \u2014 including payment-systems modernization in Egypt and Morocco. In other jurisdictions, including the UAE, legal frameworks are being constructed to ensure that fintech developments observe prudential principles. In the next two days, we hope to learn more about this.</p><p>We'll also discuss a very promising area, where Fintech seems ready to provide a major benefit to the region \u2014 promoting Financial Inclusion. Making financial services available to populations that now have little, or no, access to finance is a profoundly important priority in global development. Those services include making payments, as well as ensuring easier access to credit \u2014 through peer-to-peer networks, for example. Some countries in the region have made enormous strides in mobile payments, while others are still catching up.</p><p>Those benefits, however, are accompanied by new challenges. For instance: Since those broader types of access to financial services are provided by non-bank firms \u2014 such as telecom operators and lending platforms \u2014 new regulatory issues have arisen. Financial regulations, in the past, have been focused more on licensed institutions \u2014 principally, banks. So how should these new areas be regulated? And should there be relatively high barriers to entry to mitigate unknown risks \u2014or does financial innovation require more flexible solutions, including regulatory sandboxes?</p><p>Amid today's discussions, we're looking forward to hearing your thoughts about the Financial Inclusion theme \u2014 as well additional issues in financial development. They include new ways of raising funds, managing risks, and prioritizing national development strategies. We're also mindful of ensuring that the new landscape is competitive, so that we can realize the full value of the new efficiencies promised by new technologies.7</p><p>Another opportunity that we'll discuss today \u2014 where the potential for cost savings and time efficiency is enormous \u2014 is cross-border payments. That includes remittances, which play a very significant role in the region. Banks currently play a major role in international money transfers \u2014 but banks' role is changing in light of new entrants, including telcos, Big Tech, and other firms. In the region, Saudi Arabia and the UAE are spearheading fintech initiatives to facilitate cross-border settlements.</p><p>This area includes a wide array of policy challenges that, by their nature, require a coordinated international framework. We must seek ways</p><p>to improve the payments infrastructure, to enable greater efficiency;</p><p>to broaden access to, and review the oversight of, this infrastructure to new entrants \u2014 and ensure the interoperability of systems to maximize the benefits of innovation;</p><p>to oversee and appropriately address the transformation of the banking business due to new technologies; and</p><p>to mitigate the risk of money laundering in the new payment channels.</p><p>In addition, some fundamental services of central banks relate to the issuance of currencies \u2014 specifically, the question of whether central banks should issue digital currencies (or \"CBDCs\"). According to a recent survey by the Bank for International Settlements: 70 percent of central banks are currently involved in \u2014 or soon will be involved in \u2014 this complex area, with one-third of them now seeing the issuance of CBDCs as likely.</p><p>In today's discussions, we'll explore the costs and benefits of CBDCs \u2014 along with the implications for \"banking as we know it.\" Panelists will delve into the implications of Fintech for providing central-bank services \u2014 as well as for developing robust data infrastructures, to address privacy and cyber risk concerns.</p><p>With all of these new developments occurring around us, we must also change what regulators and supervisors monitor and analyze. Classic prudential reporting frameworks, which rely on statutory powers, will need to be complemented by new data-collection frameworks. They must cover new entrants and new channels \u2014 and the legal basis for doing so, may not yet be in place.</p><p>Similarly, issues regarding the regulatory perimeter must be addressed. For example: What is the appropriate regulatory approach to crypto assets \u2014 and, more generally, to new products and activities? What are the stability implications \u2014 and, as we identify new risks, how can we mitigate them? Such adjustments should be embedded in strong institutional and legal frameworks that guarantee financial integrity.</p><p>After considering all of these issues: Our final session of the day, will be devoted to a roundtable, in which participants will be invited to share their experiences and ask further questions.</p><p>As we start developing our work program, to follow-up on the Bali Fintech Agenda, we can begin our efforts by taking three specific steps.</p><p>First: Given the comprehensive nature of these challenges, and these opportunities, it would certainly be useful for all jurisdictions to begin consultations with all of the relevant parties in this area \u2014 with central banks, regulators, and private-sector participants \u2014 to come up with country-specific approaches. Taking into account the comparative advantages and specific situations of each jurisdiction, the priorities are likely to differ from country to country, and the focus will have to shift to meet their specific needs. For some countries, AML/CFT issues may be the top priority; for others, financial inclusion may be the central concern; for still others, the leading priority may be infrastructure.</p><p>Second: Another concrete step would be to have regional consultations and cooperation efforts.</p><p>And third: We can commit ourselves to sharing knowledge, and to engaging in more events like this one, to reach beyond our own specific countries' conditions and concerns. Agreeing to pursue a robust program of publications by our respective institutions can be very helpful, as well, in promoting broader knowledge-exchange.</p><p>I'm looking forward to our discussions over the next two days, and I'll be eager to keep in touch with all of your institutions \u2014 as we move forward in the months to come, to advance this exciting agenda.</p><p>Before concluding, I should also mention that, as you may already know, the IMF and Morocco have started a broad partnership towards hosting the 2021 IMF Annual Meetings in Marrakesh. This conference is one of many events that will be organized in Morocco and the region to build momentum for this global event, and we are happy to have the Moroccan authorities as our partners.</p><p>Thank you once again for your participation, and for your warm welcome here in Rabat.</p><p>With that, I'll wish you well, hoping that we'll have productive discussions.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Distributed by APO Group on behalf of International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VNTRAF-140138697</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VNTRAF2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMN-7SC1-F11P-X1GR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411406</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1592\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Ventures Africa.

And thank you to the Bank Al-Maghrib - which is celebrating its 60thanniversary this year - for hosting this conference.<br/><br/>We're pleased to join you here in Rabat, as we continue a series of conferences that we're convening this year in every region, worldwide. The purpose of our conferences is to promote broad discussions on - and develop a better understanding of - how our member countries are incorporating the high-level considerations proposed in the Bali Fintech Agenda in their national frameworks.</p><p><br/><br/>Promoting progress in Fintech will surely be a daunting challenge for policymakers - as we aim to reap the potential benefits of new financial technologies, while also managing their risks.<br/><br/>This conference will give us an opportunity to reflect on the relevance of the elements of the Bali Fintech Agenda (what we refer to as the \"BFA\") to each economy's conditions; to share experiences; to voice concerns and explore challenges; and to discuss various policy approaches.<br/><br/>Technological change, along with market developments, present us with a wide range of new options - and an array of new risks. With the BFA outlining an integrated approach, our task now is to adjust the policy framework in a comprehensive manner around these trends - aiming to grasp the full, positive potential of Fintech for the good of society.<br/><br/>The BFA started in response to the call - by many member countries of the World Bank Group and the IMF - to have a high-level conceptual framework that can tie together the many challenges inherent in the digitalization of financial services.<br/><br/>Maintaining the momentum of the BFA - after its launch last October at our Annual Meetings - the Bank and the Fund have already started to set this agenda into action.<br/><br/>We've already conducted a survey - with more than 100 responses - that will provide insights into how our membership sees the agenda's priorities. The survey results - combined with a summary of recent Fintech developments and regulatory responses - will soon be presented in a formal paper to our Executive Board. We are also furthering our understanding of Fintech issues through our dialogue with national authorities in the context of our Article IV consultation and FSAP reports. And we've been working closely with standard-setters in each of their respective areas.<br/><br/>In facing the challenges ahead, everyone has a role to play. Given the diversity within our global membership, the experiences of policymakers with Fintech vary widely. Some jurisdictions have been at the frontier, with pro-active and sometimes experimental proposals - while others, until now, have observed from the sidelines.<br/><br/>There are important public-sector initiatives underway that provide a sound footing for private-sector fintech activities - including payment-systems modernization in Egypt and Morocco. In other jurisdictions, including the UAE, legal frameworks are being constructed to ensure that fintech developments observe prudential principles. In the next two days, we hope to learn more about this.<br/><br/>We'll also discuss a very promising area, where Fintech seems ready to provide a major benefit to the region - promoting Financial Inclusion. Making financial services available to populations that now have little, or no, access to finance is a profoundly important priority in global development. Those services include making payments, as well as ensuring easier access to credit - through peer-to-peer networks, for example. Some countries in the region have made enormous strides in mobile payments, while others are still catching up.<br/><br/>Those benefits, however, are accompanied by new challenges. For instance: Since those broader types of access to financial services are provided by non-bank firms - such as telecom operators and lending platforms - new regulatory issues have arisen. Financial regulations, in the past, have been focused more on licensed institutions - principally, banks. So how should these new areas be regulated? And should there be relatively high barriers to entry to mitigate unknown risks -or does financial innovation require more flexible solutions, including regulatory sandboxes?<br/><br/>Amid today's discussions, we're looking forward to hearing your thoughts about the Financial Inclusion theme - as well additional issues in financial development. They include new ways of raising funds, managing risks, and prioritizing national development strategies. We're also mindful of ensuring that the new landscape is competitive, so that we can realize the full value of the new efficiencies promised by new technologies.7<br/><br/>Another opportunity that we'll discuss today - where the potential for cost savings and time efficiency is enormous - is cross-border payments. That includes remittances, which play a very significant role in the region. Banks currently play a major role in international money transfers - but banks' role is changing in light of new entrants, including telcos, Big Tech, and other firms. In the region, Saudi Arabia and the UAE are spearheading fintech initiatives to facilitate cross-border settlements.<br/><br/>This area includes a wide array of policy challenges that, by their nature, require a coordinated international framework. We must seek ways<br/><br/>to improve the payments infrastructure, to enable greater efficiency;<br/><br/>to broaden access to, and review the oversight of, this infrastructure to new entrants - and ensure the interoperability of systems to maximize the benefits of innovation;<br/><br/>to oversee and appropriately address the transformation of the banking business due to new technologies; and<br/><br/>to mitigate the risk of money laundering in the new payment channels.<br/><br/>In addition, some fundamental services of central banks relate to the issuance of currencies - specifically, the question of whether central banks should issue digital currencies (or \"CBDCs\"). According to a recent survey by the Bank for International Settlements: 70 percent of central banks are currently involved in -or soon will be involved in - this complex area, with one-third of them now seeing the issuance of CBDCs as likely.<br/><br/>In today's discussions, we'll explore the costs and benefits of CBDCs - along with the implications for \"banking as we know it.\" Panelists will delve into the implications of Fintech for providing central-bank services - as well as for developing robust data infrastructures, to address privacy and cyber risk concerns.<br/><br/>With all of these new developments occurring around us, we must also change what regulators and supervisors monitor and analyze. Classic prudential reporting frameworks, which rely on statutory powers, will need to be complemented by new data-collection frameworks. They must cover new entrants and new channels - and the legal basis for doing so, may not yet be in place.<br/><br/>Similarly, issues regarding the regulatory perimeter must be addressed. For example: What is the appropriate regulatory approach to crypto assets - and, more generally, to new products and activities? What are the stability implications - and, as we identify new risks, how can we mitigate them? Such adjustments should be embedded in strong institutional and legal frameworks that guarantee financial integrity.<br/><br/>After considering all of these issues: Our final session of the day, will be devoted to a roundtable, in which participants will be invited to share their experiences and ask further questions.<br/><br/>As we start developing our work program, to follow-up on the Bali Fintech Agenda, we can begin our efforts by taking three specific steps.<br/><br/>First: Given the comprehensive nature of these challenges, and these opportunities, it would certainly be useful for all jurisdictions to begin consultations with all of the relevant parties in this area - with central banks, regulators, and private-sector participants - to come up with country-specific approaches. Taking into account the comparative advantages and specific situations of each jurisdiction, the priorities are likely to differ from country to country, and the focus will have to shift to meet their specific needs. For some countries, AML/CFT issues may be the top priority; for others, financial inclusion may be the central concern; for still others, the leading priority may be infrastructure.<br/><br/>Second: Another concrete step would be to have regional consultations and cooperation efforts.<br/><br/>And third: We can commit ourselves to sharing knowledge, and to engaging in more events like this one, to reach beyond our own specific countries' conditions and concerns. Agreeing to pursue a robust program of publications by our respective institutions can be very helpful, as well, in promoting broader knowledge-exchange.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to our discussions over the next two days, and I'll be eager to keep in touch with all of your institutions - as we move forward in the months to come, to advance this exciting agenda.<br/><br/>Before concluding, I should also mention that, as you may already know, the IMF and Morocco have started a broad partnership towards hosting the 2021 IMF Annual Meetings in Marrakesh. This conference is one of many events that will be organized in Morocco and the region to build momentum for this global event, and we are happy to have the Moroccan authorities as our partners.<br/><br/>Thank you once again for your participation, and for your warm welcome here in Rabat.<br/><br/>With that, I'll wish you well, hoping that we'll have productive discussions.<br/><br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>Distributed by APO Group on behalf of International Monetary Fund (IMF).         </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">M2PW-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">M2PW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMK-HGR1-JD3Y-Y490-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">162367</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1596\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Normans Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>M2 PressWIRE</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"21233\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 13, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

And thank you for hosting this conference, here in the Bank\u2019s remarkable Kassensaal.  We\u2019re pleased that the Bank is the site of the very first in our series of conferences, which we\u2019ll convene this year in every region, worldwide. The purpose of our conferences is to promote broad discussions on \u2014 and develop a better understanding of \u2014 how our member countries are incorporating the high-level considerations proposed in the Bali Fintech Agenda in their national frameworks. That will surely be a daunting challenge for policymakers, as we aim to reap the potential benefits of new financial technologies , while also managing their risks. </p><p> This conference will give us an opportunity to reflect on the relevance of the elements of the Bali Fintech Agenda (or \u201cBFA\u201d) to each economy\u2019s conditions; to share experiences; to voice concerns and explore challenges; and to discuss various policy approaches.  Technological change, along with market developments, present us with a wide range of new options \u2014 and an array of new risks. With the BFA outlining an integrated approach, our task now is to adjust the policy framework in a comprehensive manner around these trends \u2014 aiming to grasp the full, positive potential of Fintech for the good of society.  The BFA started in response to the call \u2014 by many member countries of the World Bank Group and the IMF \u2014 to have a high-level conceptual framework that can tie together the many challenges inherent in the digitalization of financial services.  Maintaining the momentum of the BFA \u2014 after its launch last October at our Annual Meetings \u2014 the Bank and the Fund have already started to set this agenda into action.  We\u2019ve already conducted a survey that will provide insights into how our membership sees the agenda\u2019s priorities. The survey results \u2014 combined with a summary of recent Fintech developments and regulatory responses \u2014 will soon be presented in a formal paper to our Executive Board. We are also furthering our understanding of Fintech issues through our dialogue with national authorities in the context of our Article IV consultation and Financial Sector Assessment Program reports. And we\u2019ve been working closely with standard-setters in each of their respective areas.  In facing the challenges ahead, everyone has a role to play. Given the diversity within our global membership, the experiences of policymakers with Fintech vary widely. Some jurisdictions have been at the frontier, with pro-active and sometimes experimental proposals \u2014 while others, until now, have observed from the sidelines.  The financial industry continues to move at breakneck speed \u2014 and not necessarily in a linear fashion. (Consider, for example, the recent gyrations of cryptocurrency prices, or the rise and fall of Initial Coin Offerings.) We\u2019ll begin today\u2019s discussions by considering the continuing Fintech developments driven by private-sector innovation, and we\u2019ll explore the private sector\u2019s view of the coming evolution of the dialogue with policymakers.  We\u2019ll also discuss a very promising area, where Fintech seems ready to provide a major benefit to society \u2014 promoting Financial Inclusion. Making financial services available to populations that now have little, or no, access to finance is a profoundly important priority in global development.  Those services include making payments, as well as ensuring easier access to credit \u2014 through peer-to-peer networks, for example. This is already happening at scale in such places as Kenya, where the M-Pesa mobile-phone wallet is being widely used.  Those benefits, however, are accompanied by new challenges. For instance: Since those broader types of access to financial services are provided by non-bank firms \u2014 such as telecom operators and lending platforms \u2014 new regulatory issues have arisen. Financial regulations, in the past, have been focused more on licensed institutions \u2014 principally, banks. So how should these new areas be regulated?  Amid today\u2019s discussions, we\u2019re looking forward to hearing your thoughts about the Financial Inclusion theme \u2014 as well additional issues in financial development. They include new ways of raising funds, managing risks, and prioritizing national development strategies. We\u2019re also mindful of ensuring that the new landscape is competitive, so that we can realize the full value of the new efficiencies promised by new technologies.  Another opportunity that we\u2019ll discuss today \u2014 where the potential for cost savings and time efficiency is enormous \u2014 is cross-border payments. Banks currently play a major role in international money transfers \u2014 but banks\u2019 role is changing in light of new entrants, including telcos, Big Tech, and other firms. In Kenya, for example, M-Pesa users can now make payments to China\u2019s WeChat users.  This area includes a wide array of policy challenges that, by their nature, require a coordinated international framework. We must seek ways      to improve the payments infrastructure, to enable greater efficiency;      to broaden access to, and review the oversight of, this infrastructure to new entrants \u2014 and ensure the interoperability of systems to maximize the benefits of innovation;      to oversee and appropriately address the transformation of the banking business due to new technologies; and      to mitigate the risk of money laundering in the new payment channels.  In addition, some fundamental services of central banks relate to the issuance of currencies \u2014 specifically, the question of whether central banks should issue digital currencies (or \u201cCBDCs\u201d). According to a recent survey by the Bank for International Settlements: 70 percent of central banks are currently involved in \u2014 or soon will be involved in \u2014 this complex area, with one-third of them now seeing the issuance of CBDCs as likely.  In today\u2019s discussions, we\u2019ll explore the costs and benefits of CBDCs \u2014 along with the implications for \u201cbanking as we know it.\u201d Panelists will delve into the implications of Fintech for providing central-bank services \u2014 as well as for developing robust data infrastructures, to address privacy and cyber risk concerns.  With all of these new developments occurring around us, we must also change what regulators and supervisors monitor and analyze. Classic prudential reporting frameworks, which rely on statutory powers, will need to be complemented by new data-collection frameworks. They must cover new entrants and new channels \u2014 and the legal basis for doing so, may not yet be in place.  Similarly, issues regarding the regulatory perimeter must be addressed. For example: What is the appropriate regulatory approach to crypto assets \u2014 and, more generally, to new products and activities? What are the stability implications \u2014 and, as we identify new risks, how can we mitigate them? Such adjustments should be embedded in strong institutional and legal frameworks that guarantee financial integrity.  After considering all of these issues: Our final session of the day, will be devoted to a roundtable, in which participants will be invited to share their experiences and ask further questions.  As we start developing our work program, to follow-up on the Bali Fintech Agenda, we can begin our efforts by taking three specific steps.  First: Given the comprehensive nature of these challenges, and these opportunities, it would certainly be useful for all jurisdictions to begin consultations with all of the relevant parties in this area \u2014 with central banks, regulators, and private-sector participants \u2014 to come up with country-specific approaches. Taking into account the comparative advantages and specific situations of each jurisdiction, the priorities are likely to differ from country to country, and the focus will have to shift to meet their specific needs. For some countries, Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism issues may be the top priority; for others, financial inclusion may be the central concern; for still others, the leading priority may be infrastructure.  Second: Another concrete step would be to have regional consultations and cooperation efforts. Tomorrow, Tom Richardson will explore this issue in greater depth, when he talks about the role that the Joint Vienna Institute can play.  And third: We can commit ourselves to sharing knowledge, and to engaging in more events like this one, to reach beyond our own specific countries\u2019 conditions and concerns. Agreeing to pursue a robust program of publications by our respective institutions can be very helpful, as well, in promoting broader knowledge-exchange.  I\u2019m looking forward to our discussions over the next two days, and I\u2019ll be eager to keep in touch with all of your institutions \u2014 as we move forward in the months to come, to advance this exciting agenda.  With that, I\u2019ll wish you well, hoping that you\u2019ll have productive discussions today and tomorrow \u2014 and now I\u2019ll turn the proceedings over to Tom. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN781713020190129</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V9F-RJ41-DXCW-D35M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1514\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 29, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

And thank you for hosting this conference, here in the Bank's remarkable Kassensaal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We're pleased that the Bank is the site of the very first in our series of conferences, which we'll convene this year in every region, worldwide. The purpose of our conferences is to promote broad discussions on and develop a better understanding of how our member countries are incorporating the high-level considerations proposed in the Bali Fintech Agenda in their national frameworks. That will surely be a daunting challenge for policymakers, as we aim to reap the potential benefits of new financial technologies , while also managing their risks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This conference will give us an opportunity to reflect on the relevance of the elements of the Bali Fintech Agenda (or \"BFA\") to each economy's conditions; to share experiences; to voice concerns and explore challenges; and to discuss various policy approaches.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Technological change, along with market developments, present us with a wide range of new options and an array of new risks. With the BFA outlining an integrated approach, our task now is to adjust the policy framework in a comprehensive manner around these trends aiming to grasp the full, positive potential of Fintech for the good of society.</p><p>The BFA started in response to the call by many member countries of the World Bank Group and the IMF to have a high-level conceptual framework that can tie together the many challenges inherent in the digitalization of financial services.</p><p>Maintaining the momentum of the BFA after its launch last October at our Annual Meetings the Bank and the Fund have already started to set this agenda into action.</p><p>We've already conducted a survey that will provide insights into how our membership sees the agenda's priorities. The survey results combined with a summary of recent Fintech developments and regulatory responses will soon be presented in a formal paper to our Executive Board. We are also furthering our understanding of Fintech issues through our dialogue with national authorities in the context of our Article IV consultation and Financial Sector Assessment Program reports. And we've been working closely with standard-setters in each of their respective areas.</p><p>In facing the challenges ahead, everyone has a role to play. Given the diversity within our global membership, the experiences of policymakers with Fintech vary widely. Some jurisdictions have been at the frontier, with pro-active and sometimes experimental proposals while others, until now, have observed from the sidelines.</p><p>The financial industry continues to move at breakneck speed and not necessarily in a linear fashion. (Consider, for example, the recent gyrations of cryptocurrency prices, or the rise and fall of Initial Coin Offerings.) We'll begin today's discussions by considering the continuing Fintech developments driven by private-sector innovation, and we'll explore the private sector's view of the coming evolution of the dialogue with policymakers.</p><p>We'll also discuss a very promising area, where Fintech seems ready to provide a major benefit to society promoting Financial Inclusion. Making financial services available to populations that now have little, or no, access to finance is a profoundly important priority in global development.</p><p>Those services include making payments, as well as ensuring easier access to credit through peer-to-peer networks, for example. This is already happening at scale in such places as Kenya, where the M-Pesa mobile-phone wallet is being widely used.</p><p>Those benefits, however, are accompanied by new challenges. For instance: Since those broader types of access to financial services are provided by non-bank firms such as telecom operators and lending platforms new regulatory issues have arisen. Financial regulations, in the past, have been focused more on licensed institutions principally, banks. So how should these new areas be regulated?</p><p>Amid today's discussions, we're looking forward to hearing your thoughts about the Financial Inclusion theme as well additional issues in financial development. They include new ways of raising funds, managing risks, and prioritizing national development strategies. We're also mindful of ensuring that the new landscape is competitive, so that we can realize the full value of the new efficiencies promised by new technologies.</p><p>Another opportunity that we'll discuss today where the potential for cost savings and time efficiency is enormous is cross-border payments. Banks currently play a major role in international money transfers but banks' role is changing in light of new entrants, including telcos, Big Tech, and other firms. In Kenya, for example, M-Pesa users can now make payments to China's WeChat users.</p><p>This area includes a wide array of policy challenges that, by their nature, require a coordinated international framework. We must seek ways</p><p>to improve the payments infrastructure, to enable greater efficiency;</p><p>to broaden access to, and review the oversight of, this infrastructure to new entrants and ensure the interoperability of systems to maximize the benefits of innovation;</p><p>to oversee and appropriately address the transformation of the banking business due to new technologies; and</p><p>to mitigate the risk of money laundering in the new payment channels.</p><p>In addition, some fundamental services of central banks relate to the issuance of currencies specifically, the question of whether central banks should issue digital currencies (or \"CBDCs\"). According to a recent survey by the Bank for International Settlements: 70 percent of central banks are currently involved in or soon will be involved in this complex area, with one-third of them now seeing the issuance of CBDCs as likely.</p><p>In today's discussions, we'll explore the costs and benefits of CBDCs along with the implications for \"banking as we know it.\" Panelists will delve into the implications of Fintech for providing central-bank services as well as for developing robust data infrastructures, to address privacy and cyber risk concerns.</p><p>With all of these new developments occurring around us, we must also change what regulators and supervisors monitor and analyze. Classic prudential reporting frameworks, which rely on statutory powers, will need to be complemented by new data-collection frameworks. They must cover new entrants and new channels and the legal basis for doing so, may not yet be in place.</p><p>Similarly, issues regarding the regulatory perimeter must be addressed. For example: What is the appropriate regulatory approach to crypto assets and, more generally, to new products and activities? What are the stability implications and, as we identify new risks, how can we mitigate them? Such adjustments should be embedded in strong institutional and legal frameworks that guarantee financial integrity.</p><p>After considering all of these issues: Our final session of the day, will be devoted to a roundtable, in which participants will be invited to share their experiences and ask further questions.</p><p>As we start developing our work program, to follow-up on the Bali Fintech Agenda, we can begin our efforts by taking three specific steps.</p><p>First: Given the comprehensive nature of these challenges, and these opportunities, it would certainly be useful for all jurisdictions to begin consultations with all of the relevant parties in this area with central banks, regulators, and private-sector participants to come up with country-specific approaches. Taking into account the comparative advantages and specific situations of each jurisdiction, the priorities are likely to differ from country to country, and the focus will have to shift to meet their specific needs. For some countries, Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism issues may be the top priority; for others, financial inclusion may be the central concern; for still others, the leading priority may be infrastructure.</p><p>Second: Another concrete step would be to have regional consultations and cooperation efforts. Tomorrow, Tom Richardson will explore this issue in greater depth, when he talks about the role that the Joint Vienna Institute can play.</p><p>And third: We can commit ourselves to sharing knowledge, and to engaging in more events like this one, to reach beyond our own specific countries' conditions and concerns. Agreeing to pursue a robust program of publications by our respective institutions can be very helpful, as well, in promoting broader knowledge-exchange.</p><p>I'm looking forward to our discussions over the next two days, and I'll be eager to keep in touch with all of your institutions as we move forward in the months to come, to advance this exciting agenda.</p><p>With that, I'll wish you well, hoping that you'll have productive discussions today and tomorrow and now I'll turn the proceedings over to Tom.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1122675542</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V9G-1HR1-JCBF-S0YT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1491\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 28, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

In the ensuing 14\u202fyears, health care research has become an acknowledged specialization within the IS field. In this review article, we examine how health care research publications have developed within the IS field's leading journals since 2004 and explore the analytical and technological areas of focus within these publications. In addition to providing a descriptive overview of such research, we also examine three topical clusters in-depth (health IT adoption and diffusion, physician resistance to health IT use, and health IT impact on health care or system outcomes) to consider how researchers have addressed the challenge of developing general IS knowledge within this distinctive research context while also contributing contextually-relevant insights to the health care field. Finally, we discuss the implications of these analyses and suggest potential areas for future research. Overall, we contribute a foundation for IS health care researchers to consider how to position their work to contribute to knowledge through informational and organizational theory as well as to address important concerns of practice at the intersection of health and IS.</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>Evaluates HIT research published in Information &amp; Organization and other leading IS journals from 2004 to 2017</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>Identifies analytical and technological areas of focus for considered HIT research</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>Analyzes selected thematic clusters of considered HIT research</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u00b7  </label><bodyText><p>Considers emerging areas of HIT focus in the information systems field with regards to health industry trends</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p></bodyText></abstract></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FULL TEXT</emphasis></h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1. Introduction and motivation</emphasis></h><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><anchor id=\"ref5b0115\"/>In a review of health care information systems research (often referred to as health information technology or HIT research) published in Information Systems (IS) journals, <link><marker>Chiasson and Davidson (2004)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0115\"/></link> challenged the IS field to expand its \"contextual envelope\" by embracing the health care sector as a socially important and theoretically interesting context to develop and refine information systems theory as well as to provide contextually-relevant insights on health care information systems development and use. Over the period of their review (1985-2003), they estimated that less than 1.5% of publications in the 17 journals examined addressed health care topics (p. 160) and over half did so by focusing exclusively on IS theory or on the health care context, rather than on the nuanced interplay of theory and context (p. 163). They noted that a critical mass of IS researchers interested in HIT topics was developing within IS conferences, but argued that for HIT research to become a viable specialization within the IS academic field, greater acceptance within high visibility, mainstream IS journals would be essential (p. 178).</p><p>Over the ensuing 14\u202fyears, HIT research has grown into a well-recognized specialty within the IS academic field. For instance, most major IS field conferences5 regularly sponsor health care-focused tracks. A special interest group within the Association of Information Systems (SIG-Health)10 promotes the specialty through conference events, publication awards, and member communications. A number of IS faculties have established HIT research centers in their institutions or collaborated with university medical schools or schools of public health to do so. As we report here, health care-related papers are now being published more regularly across mainstream IS journals, indicating widespread acceptance of research in this specialty area.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0110\"/>This rapid growth in HIT research can be attributed in large part to socio-economic and technical developments within the health care sector that have provided new opportunities and demand for HIT research. In most national economies, health care spending continues to grow rapidly as populations age and rates of chronic diseases increase. HITs, which include software and infrastructure used in the clinical practice of medicine15 as well as technologies to store, share, and analyze health information,20 have been touted as vital components to reduce health care costs and also to improve health care quality, access, and health outcomes (<link><marker>Chaudhry et al., 2006</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0110\"/></link>; <link><marker>Hillestad et al., 2005</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0200\"/></link>). Yet, many challenges have emerged including a slower than expected rate of HIT adoption, questionable usability of technologies such as Electronic Health Records (EHRs), health care professionals' resistance to adopting or using such technologies, difficulty in changing health care processes to reap the full benefits of HIT, and the lack of interoperability between disparate systems (<link><marker>Kellermann &amp; Jones, 2013</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0225\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0005\"/>Investigating such challenges, particularly in light of substantial HIT spending by governments, health service providers, and IT firms, has provided extensive opportunities for researchers to examine how to more effectively realize value from HIT investments. Further, many HIT research phenomena lie at the intersection of organizational, consumer, and societal needs and information technology developments, that is, in the mainstream of the scholarly IS field's broad research agenda. Thus, ample opportunity has been afforded to IS researchers to leverage HIT to revisit prior research contributions, to further refine existing theory, and to generate new research questions and insights (<link><marker>Agarwal, Gao, DesRoches, &amp; Jha, 2010</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0005\"/></link>; <link><marker>Baird, 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0035\"/></link>; <link><marker>Chiasson &amp; Davidson, 2004</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0115\"/></link>; <link><marker>Fichman, Kohli, &amp; Krishnan, 2011</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0175\"/></link>; <link><marker>Kohli &amp; Tan, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0235\"/></link>).</p><p>To understand how IS scholars have leveraged opportunities to study health IT developments in order to make contributions to knowledge, we need an understanding of what the health care context has offered to the IS field in terms of theory development opportunities, what the IS field has contributed to the understanding of information systems phenomena in health care settings, and how the scholarly IS field has embraced these contributions to knowledge as evidenced in published research. To examine these points, we consider where and how contributions to the IS field's knowledge domain from health care studies have occurred. Specifically, we analyze health care related articles published from 2004 to 2017 in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Information &amp; Organization</emphasis> and eight other highly-ranked IS journals to understand how the HIT specialty has progressed within the IS field in terms of scholarly publications, to identify specific areas of contributions, and to provide guidance for future research. In the following sections, we discuss our approach to the literature review, the review results, and implications of this analysis.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2. Literature review approach</emphasis></h><p>The HIT literature is broad and diverse. To accomplish our specific review objectives, we thus established boundaries to the scale and scope of the review process. To assess theoretical developments in the IS field's body of HIT literature, we examined publications in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Information &amp; Organization</emphasis> and in the IS senior scholars' basket of eight journals.25 We limited our review to this subset of highly-ranked IS journals for two primary reasons. First, there are many other outlets for HIT research, such as medical sociology, health economics, and medical informatics. However, each field has distinctive criteria for research contributions, such as an emphasis on policy or empirical findings rather than theoretical developments. Examining IS journals provides a more realistic perspective on whether and how IS researchers, within their own field, have developed or refined IS theory through HIT research. The selected journals publish research across the range of topics in the mainstream of IS research and thus evaluate HIT research within the IS field generally. Second, early reports of HIT research may appear in conference proceedings, and some studies are also published in specialized journals. However, as the field's top-ranked journals, the selected journals represent and also help shape norms and expectations for high quality IS research. HIT publications in these journals have been vetted for theoretically significant contributions in terms of these expectations through the peer review process. In summary, publications in these journals provided a useful and appropriate body of literature for examining how theory and context have been addressed in HIT research in the IS field.</p><p>We identified and downloaded individual articles from the selected via Web of Science and Google Scholar search engines, using terms such as <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">health information technology</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">health information system</emphasis>, and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">health care</emphasis>, limiting the search to these nine journals. We examined each article in the initial compilation to remove articles that were not relevant, such as when articles included the term \"health,\" but were not referring to health care or HIT. We also removed editorials that simply introduced a special issue or that incidentally mentioned an HIT study while describing an issue's contents. The authors then made final decisions about including or excluding articles that incidentally mentioned health care in the text. The final set of publications included 202 articles that either directly evaluated some aspect of HIT or incorporated the health care context into the research design and empirical study.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0085\"/>To assess these 202 articles, we conducted three separate analyses: 1) descriptive analysis of when and where HIT papers were published as well as which research category, drawn from <link><marker>Chiasson and Davidson (2004)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0115\"/></link>, each article is representative of, 2) content analysis of the analytical focus and the technology focus of each article, and 3) narrative review of three major thematic clusters represented within this body of literature. The content-analytic and thematic coding procedures followed recommended guidelines (e.g., <link><marker>Bowen, 2009</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0085\"/></link>; <link><marker>Bryman, 2006</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0100\"/></link>; <link><marker>Morse, Barrett, Mayan, Olson, &amp; Spiers, 2002</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0295\"/></link>) where iterations of coding were divided between the three authors of this paper, codes assigned by one author were evaluated by the other authors, differences were discussed (and some codes were revised after discussion), and final consensus was reached. Each of the authors assessed articles relevant to the thematic clusters for the analytical narratives to develop and refine these review narratives.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3. Review findings and analysis</emphasis></h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3.1. Has the IS scholarly field embraced HIT research in the field's journals?</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref90005\"/>We first report our results for when (what year) and where (what journal) HIT and health care context focused articles were published in the timeframe of our study (2004 to 2017). As evidenced in <link><marker>Table 1</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference90005\"/></link>, the temporal distribution suggests an upward trend in the quantity of health care focused publications within these highly ranked IS journals. From 2004 to 2010, 65 articles were published, and from 2011 to 2017, 137 articles (i.e., a little more than double the number) were published. Further, the number of journals participating in this trend is also increasing, with only four of the nine journals participating in 2004 (and only 6 articles published) to 100% of the journals participating in 2017 (with 33 articles published). Spikes in some of the yearly publication counts are indicative of special issues focused on health care, such as in 2007 (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">EJIS</emphasis>) and 2011 (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">ISR</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">JAIS</emphasis>).<table><title><link><locator anchorIdRef=\"ref90005\"/></link></title><tgroup cols=\"16\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec

in our dataset according to the theory-context framework that <link><marker>Chiasson and Davidson (2004)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0115\"/></link> used to understand the state of contributions from and to the IS field via HIT publications. These codes classify articles according to their emphasis on IS theoretical developments and attention to the health care context in their contributions to knowledge. (See \"Description\" column in <link><marker>Table 2</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference90010\"/></link>.) As shown in <link><marker>Table 2</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference90010\"/></link>, the distribution of contributions to knowledge is concentrated at the intersection of health care phenomena and IS theory (codes 2 and 3), suggesting HIT researchers have leveraged the health care context to develop a general theoretical contribution when evaluating HIT phenomena (IS-health care) or applied IS theory as a framework for empirical study of HIT phenomena (health care-IS).30 Articles in the IS-Health care category had, on average, slightly higher citations per paper than other categories. Highly cited HIT articles draw on the health care setting to develop new theory to explain long-studied IS phenomena, such as user (physician) resistance to technology (e.g., <link><marker>Bhattacherjee &amp; Hikmet, 2007</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0080\"/></link>; <link><marker>Lapointe &amp; Rivard, 2005</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0240\"/></link>) and user privacy concerns (e.g., <link><marker>Angst &amp; Agarwal, 2009</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0015\"/></link>), thus appealing to IS researchers as well as researchers in related health care fields. Other highly cited articles leverage the study of sociotechnical phenomena specific to the health care field, such as developing national-level health information infrastructure, to articulate general IS research knowledge from health care phenomena (<link><marker>Braa, Hanseth, Heywood, Mohammed, &amp; Shaw, 2007</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0090\"/></link>; <link><marker>Braa, Monteiro, &amp; Sahay, 2004</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0095\"/></link>; <link><marker>Paul &amp; McDaniel, 2004</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0320\"/></link>). The lower rate of citations for health care only studies (code 4) suggests that IS researchers, particularly those not engaged in HIT research, are less likely to build on such contributions to knowledge. These studies may also not be highly visible to researchers in the medical informatics field, where such studies might be of heightened interest.<table><title><link><locator anchorIdRef=\"ref90010\"/></link></title><tgroup cols=\"5\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"48\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\" colwidth=\"360\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\" colwidth=\"64\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col4\" colwidth=\"64\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col5\" colwidth=\"64\"/><thead><row><entry><anchor id=\"reference90010\"/>Theory-context code</entry><entry>Description</entry><entry>Article % (count) 2004-2017</entry><entry><anchor id=\"ref80005\"/>Total number of citations<link><marker>a</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference80005\"/></link></entry><entry>Avg. citations per article</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry>Research commentaries</entry><entry>A commentary on the nature of research relative to health care topics.</entry><entry>2.5% (5)</entry><entry>403</entry><entry>80.6</entry></row><row><entry>1_ IS-Only</entry><entry>Theoretical or topical focus of primary interest to the IS field; health care setting, data, implications are minimized.</entry><entry>22.3% (45)</entry><entry>3421</entry><entry>76.0</entry></row><row><entry>2_ IS-Health Care</entry><entry>Theoretical or topical focus is primarily oriented to IS field issues, but the health care setting plays a part in the theorizing, analysis.</entry><entry>28.2% (57)</entry><entry>4601</entry><entry>80.7</entry></row><row><entry>3_ Health Care-IS</entry><entry>Theoretical or topical focus is primarily aimed at health care issues, but there are general implications for IS theory or cumulative knowledge.</entry><entry>34.6% (70)</entry><entry>4216</entry><entry>60.2</entry></row><row><entry>4_ Health Care Only</entry><entry>Theorizing or topical focus is aimed at health care issues, without clear engagement with IS theory or cumulative knowledge per se.</entry><entry>12.4% (25)</entry><entry>1030</entry><entry>41.2</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>Table 2 - Theory-context coding of HIT articles from 2004 to 2017.<sup>a</sup>Aggregated from Google Scholar citation counts as of November 2017.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3.2.

This is unsurprising as the IS journals examined tend to emphasize organizational IS phenomena. A growing number of articles are addressing technologies that represent the intersection of organizations and consumers (analytical focus code 4) and even consumer-focused technologies that do not rely on traditional health care organizations as sponsors, such as freestanding online health communities (analytical focus codes 5 and 6). These categories (4-6) are seeing an upward trend of research with 71.4% (25/35) being published between 2012 and 2017. This publication trend is indicative of the growth in consumer social media and health IS/IT applications, evident in other industries as well. We expect this trend to continue as major IT firms such as Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Fitbit (for wearable devices) commit more resources to the consumer market for health care applications.</p><p>In regard to the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">technological focus</emphasis> codes, a majority of the articles fall within the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">clinical (2)</emphasis> or <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">clinical</emphasis>\u202f+\u202f<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">administrative (3)</emphasis> code categories, representing 69.3% ([64\u202f+\u202f76]/202) of the total articles published. While not nearly as many articles were published in the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">policy code (1)</emphasis> category (26 total articles), HIT policy seems to be a growing area of interest, with 17 of the 26 (65.4%) total articles in this category published from 2012 to 2017 and 7 of the 26 (26.9%) published in 2017. As attention shifts from the effectiveness of HIT implementation efforts to health system and patient outcomes, there may be an increasing emphasis on how policies impact such transitions and thus growing research attention to health IT policy in IS studies.</p><p>Finally, a significant portion of the articles are clustered at the intersection of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">clinical</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">clinical</emphasis>\u202f+\u202f<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">administrative</emphasis> (technological focus codes 2 and 3) and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">organizational</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">inter-organizational</emphasis> analytical focus codes (analytical focus codes 2 and 3). Studies at this intersection account for 50.9% of articles published ([26\u202f+\u202f45\u202f+\u202f15\u202f+\u202f17]/202). However, publications in these categories represent about 42.0% (47/112) of the articles published within the last 5\u202fyears (2012-2017), compared to 62.2% (56/90) of articles published in 2004-2011, again suggesting that the IS field's HIT research focus is diversifying to include a broader range of topics such as health IT policy and consumer health care phenomena.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3.3. Have IS researchers leveraged IS theory and the health care context to contribute to knowledge?</emphasis></h><p><link><marker>Chiasson and Davidson (2004)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0115\"/></link> argued that the institutional context of health care would challenge IS theories and assumptions developed in studies of other industries, and thus could enable IS researchers to expand and elaborate IS theory. To evaluate this argument in recent health care IS publications, we evaluated the literature review and discussion sections of each of the 202 articles in order to determine which theoretical foundations were identified as particularly relevant to the article (if any) and whether the researchers claimed a general contribution to IS theory from the paper. We identified three clusters of publications for closer examination of contributions to IS or health care knowledge domains: 1) adoption and diffusion of innovative HIT, 2) physician resistance to HIT use, and 3) impact of HIT on health care or system outcomes. In the following sections, we consider each of these clusters to highlight health information systems contributions within the broader IS discourse on these topics.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3.3.1. Adoption and diffusion of innovation: key insights from HIT studies</emphasis></h><p>The adoption and diffusion of innovative HIT has lagged behind other industries - such as finance, travel, and retail - thus providing opportunities for IS researchers to revisit and revise prior theorizing efforts on these topics. Further, advancements in technology, particularly in web and mobile applications, preceded the more recent, significant increases in HIT adoption in health care organizations, permitting HIT adopters to take advantage of this next generation of technology. The result has been compressed diffusion cycles where implementation of enterprise systems such as EHRs are quickly followed (or even simultaneously implemented along with) web and mobile applications that provide access and conveniences to patients. These cycles of innovation exhibit tensions between consumer, producer, and societal value derived from HITs and have afforded IS researchers opportunities to extend innovation theory and related switching cost and privacy calculus theory.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0055\"/>Consider, for instance, the adoption and diffusion of a type of health care digital intermediary, Personal Health Records (PHRs) platforms. PHRs are technologies that allow consumers (patients) to access and consolidate their individual health records (<link><marker>Baird, Raghu, &amp; Tulledge-Scheitel, 2012</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0055\"/></link>; <link><marker>Davidson, \u00d8sterlund, &amp; Flaherty, 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0130\"/></link>). The success of this innovation depends not only on its adoption by individuals (the subject of the PHR), but also of organizational stakeholders (clinical service providers) who provide much of the data and could be co-users of the PHR system and the intermediary organizations sponsoring the PHR platform (e.g., hospital, insurer, IT firm). Yet, innovation theory prior to 2004 typically focused primarily on either organizational characteristics associated with adoption and diffusion (<link><marker>Fichman, 2004</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0170\"/></link>), determinants of consumer-level adoption (<link><marker>Rogers, 2003</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0365\"/></link>), or how innovations emerged and evolved within and between communities of stakeholders (<link><marker>Poole &amp; Van de Ven, 2004</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0340\"/></link>), rather than intersections between organizations, consumers, and communities who adopt and use innovations. While research in the areas of co-creation of value (e.g., <link><marker>Prahalad &amp; Ramaswamy, 2004</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0355\"/></link>) and IT-enabled collaborations (e.g., <link><marker>Melville, Kraemer, &amp; Gurbaxani, 2004</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0275\"/></link>) were emerging and coalescing at the time, nuanced consideration of the impacts of IS innovations at the intersection of organizations, consumers, and society remained limited. The HIT context provides an opportunity to enhance innovation knowledge at this intersection.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0040\"/>For example, to evaluate innovation occurring at the intersection between organizations and consumers, <link><marker>Baird, Furukawa, and Raghu (2012)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0040\"/></link> evaluated the role of traditional diffusion of innovation predictors (firm size, slack resources, competition, management support, and capabilities) in describing the variation in the adoption of a PHR-related business-to-consumer (B2C) technology (i.e., patient portals) by ambulatory care practices. They found that three contingencies - service contingencies, learning contingencies, and demand contingencies - play a significant role, in addition to the traditional diffusion of innovation predictors, in determining organizational B2C adoption. This research extended organizational innovation adoption theory through empirical study of a health care setting and technology that organizations provide to facilitate patient interactions.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0050\"/>HIT studies of how consumers perceive HIT offered by health care provider organizations have also advanced IS adoption theory. Traditional models of consumer (demand-side) innovation adoption often consider the five characteristics put forth by <link><marker>Rogers (2003)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0365\"/></link> (relative advantage, trialability, compatibility, complexity, and observability) or close variations, but do not typically consider how the business model underlying the technology may affect consumer preference formation. <link><marker>Baird and Raghu (2015)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0050\"/></link> analyzed variations in consumer preferences for PHRs and associated business models. They found that underlying business model characteristics of how the PHR was offered by the health provider organization, including privacy commitment, initiation effort, switching costs, and degree of data control, to also be essential determinants of consumer preference formations for this innovative technology. Particularly significant is that long-held debates about patients' rights to their personal health data are just developing in other sectors in terms of consumer data rights, so that studies of PHR adoption between organizations and consumers have a significant role in updating theory in this area.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0315\"/>How technologies like PHRs impact switching costs for consumers (patients) and supplier (health provider) adoption has also been examined in depth in health care settings (<link><marker>Ozdemir, Barron, &amp; Bandyopadhyay, 2011</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0315\"/></link>). Switching cost theory primarily originated with the evaluation of customer retention by firms competing in one-sided markets (e.g., <link><marker>Klemperer, 1987</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0230\"/></link>). As technology reduced the costs of participating in networks, switching costs in two-sided networks became a popular focus of research (e.g., <link><marker>Rysman, 2009</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0370\"/></link>). What was not as well understood, however, was how consumer versus producer surplus may be impacted in two-sided networks where technology reduces switching costs for consumers. Reduced consumer switching costs potentially reduce the ability for the producer (health care provider) to retain consumers (patients), thereby reducing incentives for producers to participate in the digitally intermediated two-sided market. <link><marker>Ozdemir et al. (2011)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0315\"/></link> found that voluntary participation by ambulatory care practices in medical record sharing markets facilitated by PHRs, while highly beneficial from a societal standpoint, may reduce rents (potential revenues) for individual health care practices, thus making their participation unlikely unless it is complemented (a subsidy by the intermediary or payers). These findings, derived through the study of PHR adoption, contribute to theory by demonstrating that technology adoption in two-sided markets is endogenously associated with switching costs, thus changing how we model the relationship between technology adoption and switching costs under conditions of potential producer loss.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0150\"/>Theoretical understanding of adoption and diffusion of information sharing technologies (such as PHRs) extends to consumers' trepidation associated with potential exposure of sensitive personal information. In particular, while privacy calculus has long been a consideration in the IS literature, especially as the use of e-commerce increased (e.g., <link><marker>Dinev &amp; Hart, 2006</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0150\"/></link>), the theory has mostly focused on how consumers rationally (and logically) evaluate benefits versus risks associated with their concern over potential disclosure and the trust they have in the recipient (<link><marker>Petronio, 2002</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0330\"/></link>). However, <link><marker>Anderson and Agarwal (2011)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0010\"/></link> found the privacy calculus of individuals concerned about disclosure of their personal health information also incorporates emotion (risk-as-feelings), conditional on the purpose of information use and the perception of the requesting stakeholder. Thus, while the societal utility of a data sharing innovation may potentially be high, patient emotions and the potential for negative emotional impacts may alter traditional conceptualizations of rational evaluation of patient participation in the innovation.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0305\"/>Though many studies presume a single definition or perception of an innovation as the object for adoption studies, the understanding of an innovation evolves over time within a community of innovators or adopters. HIT research has extended our understanding of how perceptions of the innovation are diffused across a community of innovators, influencing both adoption and the innovation per se. For instance, in a study of home health care mobile technologies, <link><marker>Nielsen, Mathiassen, and Newell (2014)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0305\"/></link> theorized about how ideas for this innovation \"traveled\" through the adopter community and were adapted in implementation contexts through ongoing organizational visioning. Building on these findings in a study of organizing visions for PHRs, <link><marker>Davidson et al. (2015)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0130\"/></link> highlighted how visions for this innovation drifted over a 10-year period among different sub-communities and technical instantiations, contributing to low rates of consumer adoption until shifting eventually toward the patient portal concept and consumer health applications. Such studies help explain the adjustment or exit from the market by the first generation of PHR providers, and more generally, illustrate the importance of the innovation community context to understanding of the outcomes of adoption and diffusion processes.</p><p>Overall, we suggest that the HIT literature has made a significant contribution to technology innovation theorizing. Since 2004, HIT focused innovation research has provided more nuanced and pragmatic understandings of how stakeholders perceive and evaluate the impacts of innovation adoption and diffusion. Of particular note is that adoption and diffusion models account for needs and perceptions at the intersection of organizations, consumers, and societies and that perceptions of risk may be subject to emotional considerations, especially when evaluating the potential for immediate loss. Therefore, the uptake of innovations is likely to have many contingencies, even when there are considerable potential benefits to society, which often are not fully considered in prior research models.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3.3.2. User resistance: evidence from physician resistance to HIT use</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0135\"/>The IS field has long been concerned with predicting whether individual users of an IS will actually use the innovation. The technology acceptance model (TAM), developed by Davis and colleagues (<link><marker>Davis, 1989</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0135\"/></link>; <link><marker>Davis, Bagozzi, &amp; Warshaw, 1989</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0140\"/></link>; <link><marker>Venkatesh &amp; Davis, 2000</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0400\"/></link>; <link><marker>Venkatesh, Morris, Davis, &amp; Davis, 2003</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0405\"/></link>) is perhaps the most cited theory in the IS field and has been the basis of countless research projects and publications on IT adoption and use intentions. Such studies focus on individual users' characteristics and their perceptions of a technology's ease of use and usefulness as determinants of their use intentions. Many IS theorists have critiqued this narrow scope and argued for broader models which include aspects of human and social change processes (<link><marker>Legris, Ingham, &amp; Collerette, 2003</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0245\"/></link>), particularly the interdependencies between organizational context, technology use and adoption, and change models (<link><marker>Orlikowski &amp; Hoffman, 1997</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0310\"/></link>). Moreover, few IS researchers have investigated non-adoption of systems and technologies, in particular the role of users' resistance in rejecting the introduction of new technologies. While resistance has been recognized as a key issue in implementation, little IS research has focused on the nature and reasons for resistance (<link><marker>Lapointe &amp; Rivard, 2005</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0240\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0165\"/>The health care context provides a rich domain of practice to consider the phenomena of resistance to organizational IS such as EHRs. In health care settings, physicians are a highly trained and skilled workforce performing complex activities in the delivery of a highly regarded societal duty, i.e., caring for human beings. Given that physicians are an essential but limited organizational resource, they have traditionally wielded significant influence in their organizations as a counterbalance to top-down managerial control. This creates interesting dynamics of power and politics within health care organizations as administrators seek to maintain order (e.g., <link><marker>Ferlie, Fitzgerald, Wood, &amp; Hawkins, 2005</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0165\"/></link>). Health care managers and IS professionals have long recognized that physician resistance to organizational HIT such as EHRs presents a significant barrier to advancing diffusion and adoption of HIT.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0180\"/>However, understanding this barrier beyond the individual-level insights about \"ease of use\" and \"usefulness\" (e.g., from TAM studies) has required that IS researchers engage deeply with IS resistance as the phenomena of interest. For instance, the introduction of IS in health care contexts, as in other settings, may be seen as a means of shifting power and control (<link><marker>Gray, 2001</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0180\"/></link>; <link><marker>Zuboff, 1988</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0430\"/></link>) and as an instrument to support the various interests, claims, and negotiations within the social and political processes of organizational life. <link><marker>Doolin (2004)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0155\"/></link> investigated these issues by highlighting the ability of physicians to actively resist the implementation of an information system, rather than remain passive adopters of it. <link><marker>Doolin (2004)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0155\"/></link> adopted a Foucauldian conception of power to reveal how calculative practices are made visible by information systems as a means for management to exercise control but are also integral to resistance. His case study demonstrated that physician resistance can derail the implementation of an IS, shifting the system's initial focus to suit their own ways of working.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0210\"/>Addressing the limited research focusing on resistance, <link><marker>Lapointe and Rivard (2005)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0240\"/></link> build on previous work (e.g., <link><marker>Joshi, 1991</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0210\"/></link>; <link><marker>Marakas &amp; Hornik, 1996</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0260\"/></link>; <link><marker>Markus, 1983</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0265\"/></link>; <link><marker>Martinko, Zmud, &amp; Henry, 1996</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0270\"/></link>) to define resistance and to develop a multilevel, longitudinal model which identifies resistance behaviors, objects of resistance, perceived threats, initial conditions and the subjects of resistance, across group and individual levels. This highly and widely cited work represents one of the earliest attempts to present a holistic view of resistance in IS implementation. The authors argue for the black box of resistance to be opened in order for researchers and managers to appropriately address it, especially by understanding how resistance develops and acknowledging that there are at times legitimate reasons for resistance. The authors acknowledged the value of the health care setting for studying resistance among \"clearly identified groups of actors\" (<link><marker>Lapointe &amp; Rivard, 2005</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0240\"/></link>, p. 469). They also highlight implications for HIT adoption with suggestions for awareness of resistance becoming politicized or escalating due to administrators' inappropriate responses to resistance.</p><p><link><marker>Bhattacherjee and Hikmet (2007)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0080\"/></link> also address physician resistance to explore why users would resist seemingly useful technologies. They integrate the concept of user resistance with the technology acceptance literature and empirically demonstrate the significance of ensuring that user resistance is considered in the broader context of IS usage studies. It is worth noting that this study, which was one of the early attempts to unify acceptance and resistance models of IS usage, drew on the health care context where physician resistance is a well-known issue. Interestingly, <link><marker>Bhattacherjee and Hikmet (2007)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0080\"/></link> articulate only limited implications for HIT per se and also caution researchers to beware of the generalizability of their findings given the unique contextual factors of the research setting (a large, urban, regional medical center). This tension between generalizable theory and context highlights one of the dilemmas IS researchers face with HIT research (<link><marker>Chiasson &amp; Davidson, 2004</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0115\"/></link>): on the one hand there are opportunities to explore phenomena that can be readily examined in this setting, while on the other, unique aspects of the health care settings may limit hoped-for generalization to IS theory. For instance, user resistance to organizational information systems is not limited to health care settings, but the influence and power of physicians to successfully engage in resistance behaviors may not be present in many other settings, where workers have less professional autonomy.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0215\"/>Varying the focus from active user resistance to subtle avoidance of organizational IS, <link><marker>Kane and Borgatti (2011)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0215\"/></link> explore the concept of IS avoidance as a post-adoption behavior which reveals how resistance can persist even after implementation. They show that while doctors' IS avoidance can negatively affect health care team performance, it is also possible to compensate for this form of resistance so that the impact of such behavior is limited or eliminated. While it may not be possible to convince all doctors to engage with HIT, it is possible to ensure that their actions are not wholly detrimental to the performance potential of technology interventions. Nonetheless, <link><marker>Venkatesh, Zhang, and Sykes (2011)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0410\"/></link> found that doctors can negatively affect the use of HIT technologies among all user groups within the health care context, despite the positive effect on patient satisfaction that HIT might contribute.</p><p>These various studies, conducted within health care settings, have explored nuances in how the concept of resistance is theoretically defined as well as enacted in practice. Furthermore, even though these articles were crafted primarily to build IS knowledge and contribute to IS theory, the influence of the research reaches across domains. The articles are cited in journals in management and organization studies, computing studies, and health care as well as being cited in IS journals. The challenges to implementation and use of well-established technologies such as EHRs as well as new HIT developments (such as artificial intelligence and robotics) will continue to further disrupt clinical roles, so that user resistance studies will undoubtedly continue to be an important subject of HIT research in the IS field.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3.3.3. Addressing health care outcomes with HIT</emphasis></h><p><link><marker>Chiasson and Davidson (2004)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0115\"/></link> described \"health care only\" studies as those papers focused on specific health care system problems, rather than on developing or elaborating IS theory through the study of health care IS phenomena. They cautioned that such studies, while providing valuable insights on HIT issues, might be excluded from publication in the IS field's most elite journals, because these journals would require generalizable theoretical contributions of interest to the IS field (p. 176). However, among more recent HIT publications (2011-2017) we identified a growing number that examine health care system phenomena with great specificity and with little (if any) attempts to specify general IS theoretical or knowledge contributions. Interestingly, these papers are appearing in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">MIS Quarterly</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Information Systems Research</emphasis>, and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Journal of MIS</emphasis>, among other top-ranked journals.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0250\"/>For instance, health care organizations are increasingly looking to predictive modeling to more efficiently apply health care therapies or interventions. <link><marker>Lin, Chen, Brown, Li, and Yang (2017)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0250\"/></link> applied design science methods to develop a Bayesian multitask learning approach to predictive modeling of adverse health outcomes, stating \"our goal is to improve clinical decision making and facilitate preventive and personalized care with data analytics\" (p. 474). They developed and then assessed this predictive modeling approach using a large-scale, longitudinal data set extracted from a hospital EHR system to demonstrate the model significantly improved predictive performance compared to existing models. <link><marker>Bardhan, Oh, Zheng, and Kirksey (2014)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0060\"/></link> developed a predictive analytics model (a beta geometric Erlang-2 hurdle model) to predict the propensity, frequency and timing of readmissions of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). The model was then tested using a multi-hospital, multi-year data set of insurance claims data, which allowed the researchers to validate the model as well as to examine the differential influence of cardiology information systems on propensity and frequency of readmissions versus of administrative IS systems on frequency.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0030\"/>Other empirically-focused studies have assessed specific health care outcomes of organizational health information systems (such as EHRs). <link><marker>Ayabakan, Bardhan, Zheng, and Kirksey (2017)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0030\"/></link>, for instance, assessed whether shared HIT systems would reduce wasteful duplication of radiology and laboratory tests, finding a more pronounced reduction for duplicate radiology tests (vs. laboratory tests) across health system provider organizations. <link><marker>Pinsonneault, Addas, Qian, Dakshinamoorthy, and Tamblyn (2017)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0335\"/></link>, using a structure-process-outcome framework, demonstrated that integrated HIT systems have a direct effect on improving quality of care as well as indirect effects by providing more complete information to health providers, allowing them to better manage patients' health care needs. <link><marker>Aron, Dutta, Janakiraman, and Pathak (2011)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0025\"/></link> assessed how introducing automation into care delivery processes contributes to medical error reduction, particularly for processes involving sensing rather than interpreting appropriate health care pathways (procedures). In a study that bridged the creation of HIT artifacts and their evaluation in practice (through a longitudinal field experiment), Kelley et al. (2011) investigated how an eHealth system helped patients with Type II diabetes understand their condition, develop self-care practices, and improve biomedical outcomes through a two-stage process of first adopting the technology and then adopting the self-care practices.</p><p>The publication of these and other, similar studies suggests that health care phenomena are increasingly being viewed as important and legitimate research topics per se within the IS scholarly field. For example, while quality and waste issues are not unique to health care organizations or processes, the studies cited above do not attempt to generalize the specific study to a general IS topic but remain focused on the health care system implications. This trend also highlights the opportunities for conducting data-driven outcomes research at the intersection of the IS field's growing interest in big data analytics, the increased accessibility of large-scale, longitudinal health data sets, and the health care field's interest in tackling critical issues with health care quality and costs through computational methods. Notably the studies cited above relied on the availability and accessibility of large-scale, longitudinal data sets with individual patient level data and details on health care delivery processes. Compared with proprietary data sets in other industries, health care data are more readily available (once privacy and research protocols are satisfied), in part because the public agencies that fund health services may require sharing data for research purposes.</p><p>Also notable is that several of the cited papers included co-authors from clinical positions (such as medical doctors), and all drew heavily on publications in the medical informatics field (such as the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association</emphasis>) for operational definitions of constructs and empirical results for comparison. This suggests IS researchers are integrating scholarship from these related fields into their HIT research endeavors. Whether these types of health care focused studies (Type 4 in <link><marker>Table 2</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference90010\"/></link>) will translate from the IS field into medical research or practice is not yet clear, however. A scan of citations (using Google Scholar's citation tracking) of Type 4 articles from 2011 indicated few medical or medical informatics journals citing these IS publications in their own publications. Nonetheless, the recent uptick in analytically sophisticated studies of long-standing health care system concerns, along with research partnerships with medical researchers, may in future facilitate knowledge transfer from the IS field to medical fields and to practice.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4. Discussion and implications</emphasis></h><p>Our review of HIT publications highlights several key findings about this specialty within the IS academic field: i) HIT research is increasing in scale and scope across top journals in the IS discipline; ii) the topical focus of HIT research, although weighted toward organizational and inter-organizational studies of administrative and clinical systems, is diversifying to new phenomena developing in health care and technology; iii) the majority of HIT publications in leading IS journals articulate contributions to knowledge in terms of IS theory based on empirical research at the intersection of IS and health care concerns; and, iv) a growing number of publications suggests IS researchers are more explicitly addressing specific health industry priorities and information challenges through their research published in IS journal outlets.</p><p>During the review study period (2004-2017), a substantial volume of HIT research has addressed how individual stakeholder organizations apply HIT to solve <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">internal</emphasis> problems and improve processes and outcomes through HIT adoption and use. In the future, we suggest the frontier of practical questions and research opportunities will emerge at the intersection of HIT <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">between</emphasis> the field's diverse stakeholder groups and through field-level (versus organizational-level) transformation.</p><p>Drawing on our observations of health sector trends as scholars experienced in this specialty and through this literature review process, we now highlight areas for future HIT research that we believe could usefully inform IS theory and health care system practice.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4.1. Integration of health data across multiple sources</emphasis></h><p>Two key themes in health care today are patient engagement and personalized medicine. The first refers to building individuals' knowledge and motivation to maintain healthy lifestyles, seek appropriate health care, and follow through with treatment plans. The second term highlights the promise that health \"big data\" (e.g., genomic profiles, digitized clinical data, social determinants of health, and patient reported outcomes), will allow clinical treatments that are more precisely targeted and thus more effective for individuals. HITs and the information they generate are essential to both goals.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0125\"/>Organizational sources of health data, such as clinical documentation systems (e.g., EHRs) or transactional systems such as insurance claims systems, will continue to be useful for these purposes, but these organizational applications capture only a fraction of health data now being generated. Consumers are collecting ever-greater quantities of information about themselves, including information about daily health-related activities (e.g., diet, exercise, and sleep) and measurements associated with the progression of chronic disease (e.g., blood sugar, blood pressure). Advances with Internet-of-Things (IoT) health monitoring devices will generate still more health-related data. Individuals can leverage this information to make lifestyle decisions on an individual basis, and health care providers might also leverage patient generated health data (PGHD) in combination with clinical data to better understand patients' requirements for and responses to treatment (<link><marker>Cortez, Hsii, Mitchell, Riehl, &amp; Smith, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0125\"/></link>; <link><marker>Examining oversight of the privacy &amp; security of health data collected by entities not regulated by HIPAA, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0160\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0145\"/>Further, while EHR vendors initially did not include the ability to import PGHD from patient PHRs and wearable devices, some are now doing so (e.g., <link><marker>Deering, Siminerio, &amp; Weinstein, 2013</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0145\"/></link>). Thus, it is likely that the boundaries between organizational HIT such as EHR systems and consumer applications such personal health records, mobile health applications, personal data stores from wearables devices, and so on, will be significantly blurred in the future (<link><marker>Sanders, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0375\"/></link>). Moreover, new data intermediary platforms (e.g., such as Apple, <link><marker>Arndt, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0020\"/></link>) may in the future succeed in consolidating and aggregating PGHD, clinical data, patient reported outcomes, and even social and genomic data (e.g., <link><marker>Murdoch &amp; Detsky, 2013</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0300\"/></link>), where others, including healthcare provider organizations, have so far failed to do so.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0045\"/>The personal, organizational, and societal implications of integrating PGHD and multiple other health care data sources will present vital research phenomena with practical and theoretical importance for IS research. For instance, the complex entanglement of individual level consumer (patient) and producer (clinician) adoption with organizational phenomena (health systems) and new industry actors (digital intermediary firms) will further challenge existing knowledge about diffusion of HIT and other digital innovations. Adoption as well as resistance to HIT are likely to emerge (e.g., <link><marker>Baird &amp; Nowak, 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0045\"/></link>) as these technologies become intensely personal and potentially intrusive. Theory and policy research to investigate how individual rights to privacy, organizational claims on personal health data, and societal benefits from widespread sharing of PGHD stockpiles will be needed to inform data governance regulations. And, because building necessary infrastructures will be expensive and financed in large part through public sources of health care funding, studies of the efficacy of HIT interventions to improve health systems performance will be vital to justify expenditures.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4.2. Health information- and technology-enabled industry transformation</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0105\"/>Buzzwords such as health system transformation, population health management, and value-based financing are indicators of regulatory and market-based changes promoted by health care organizations, payers (i.e., insurance companies or public sources), and governments to reduce health care costs while increasing quality of and access to necessary services, that is, to increase value (<link><marker>Burwell, 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0105\"/></link>; <link><marker>Porter, 2009</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0345\"/></link>; <link><marker>Porter, 2010</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0350\"/></link>). The success of these changes relies heavily on the collection, processing, and use of health information to diagnose, improve, and maintain health system practices, processes, and outcomes.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0415\"/>Information technologies such as big data analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), and robotics will also play increasingly significant roles in how health care is carried out in future. Accompanying technological change, new norms, logics, and practices for health care that span the continuum of health delivery services are challenging traditional approaches to isolated, individual acute health care episodes, even to the point where the central roles of hospitals and physicians are gradually being supplemented, or even supplanted, by technologies such as telemedicine (<link><marker>Wachter, 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0415\"/></link>). The coordination of care efforts between providers (<link><marker>Bates, 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0065\"/></link>; <link><marker>Bates &amp; Bitton, 2010</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0070\"/></link>) and the shift from human system-centric (e.g., endocrinology, podiatry, ophthalmology) to disease-centric (e.g., diabetes) organizational forms such as accountable care organizations and population health management networks will also drastically impact how health care is delivered and health information is governed and utilized.</p><p>Transformations of professions, of health care work, and of health industry organizations enabled by IT advances are not unique to the health care sector. However, health care settings bring additional theoretical and practical considerations to the forefront, notably, normative expectations about serving the public good and regulatory oversight of how health care resources, many which are publically funded or subsidized, are appropriated and applied. Such developments are likely to accelerate two trends we detected in more recent HIT publications in IS journals. First, more policy-informing studies are likely as health system managers and regulators look for guidance on how to apply these new technologies and how to navigate sociotechnical transformation processes. Second, data analytics of large-scale health data sources will be called for to evaluate the efficacy of process change or HIT interventions. A critical mass of IS researchers who are well informed about health care sector practices and priorities now exists to participate in such studies, ideally in partnership with experts in fields such as medicine, public health, healthcare administration and medical informatics.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0185\"/>Thus, we expect a greater number of HIT publications in IS journals in the future to prioritize developing empirical knowledge relevant to health care professionals, with less emphasis on developing general IS theory. However, opportunities to contribute to IS theory as well as health care practice will continue to arise around health care industry transformations at the intersection of inter- and organizational-level clinical systems, as is evident in the current IS literature. The IS field is particularly well positioned to advance theoretical knowledge of how digital infrastructures develop and contribute to digital innovation (<link><marker>Braa et al., 2007</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0090\"/></link>; <link><marker>Hanseth, Jacucci, Grisot, &amp; Aanestad, 2006</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0185\"/></link>; <link><marker>Henfridsson &amp; Bygstad, 2013</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0190\"/></link>), as well as to contribute practical insights to inform national and industry level projects to develop the health information infrastructures necessary to advance health care delivery systems.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4.3. Scaling HIT innovations</emphasis></h><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0075\"/>Finally, we note the vital challenge of scaling of HIT innovations, where new technologies and processes are moved beyond limited, localized, exploratory applications to wider implementations with the aim of improving health care delivery and health system efficiency. While scaling may be considered as a stage within the broader concept of the diffusion of innovations (e.g., <link><marker>Berwick, 2003</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0075\"/></link>), there are particularly interesting characteristics of health care contexts and digital health technologies which may allow us to more fully explore the shift from smaller scale exploration to larger scale exploitation (<link><marker>Herzlinger, 2006</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0195\"/></link>). We highlight two specific aspects of scaling innovations in health care: 1) internal (organizational and local) HIT innovation scaling, and 2) external (disruptive and entrepreneurial) HIT innovation scaling.</p><p>Internal innovation can stem from the efforts of clinical practitioners in their attempts to facilitate and improve health care service delivery, typically in the local context. Interestingly, such innovations often emerge despite the challenging environments which clinicians face, including lack of time and resources including funding, training, skills, and organizational support (<link><marker>Herzlinger, 2006</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0195\"/></link>). The emergence of innovations under such conditions does not guarantee that scaling will be successful or even attempted beyond the local context. Health care organizations have recognized these issues and, when resources are available, often encourage innovation scaling. The effectiveness of scaling efforts could greatly benefit from additional research focused on the challenges and processes of scaling innovation.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0325\"/>Similarly, organizational efforts to improve efficiency through systems and process innovation, such as outcomes based payments systems and process (e.g., <link><marker>Paulus, Davis, &amp; Steele, 2008</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0325\"/></link>), may be effective in smaller units such as a single department, or an individual hospital, but these innovations will only be effective for improving health systems if they are widely deployed. The challenges of such scaling are evident in practice, particularly transitioning from pilots to programs (<link><marker>Simmons, Fajans, &amp; Ghiron, 2007</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0385\"/></link>). National governments provide some support, such as through agencies including the UK's NHS Innovation Accelerator35 and the US's CMS Innovation Center.40 However, the challenges of determining which innovations established and tested in localized settings can and should scale, as well as the adjustments required for successful scaling across contexts, remain. Thus, we propose this area as a potentially impactful research opportunity for HIT researchers in the IS field.</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0390\"/>A second aspect of innovation scaling in health care is the challenge which external innovators face in entering and sustaining viable products or services within health care markets. For instance, technology companies that have not traditionally competed in health care (or have only periodically experimented in health care markets), such as Apple, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, are more recently making considerable efforts to enter this space (<link><marker>Singer, 2017</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0390\"/></link>).45 Further, consumers increasingly share information directly with each other, through online health communities and social networks, and the use of the Internet to find health care advice and subjectively rate health care providers continues to grow (<link><marker>Yan, Peng, &amp; Tan, 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0420\"/></link>; <link><marker>Yan &amp; Tan, 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0425\"/></link>). Digital health competitors are emerging in ever greater numbers in the mobile health (mHealth) space (<link><marker>Kay, Santos, &amp; Takane, 2011</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0220\"/></link>), where the ability of entrepreneurs to contribute is enabled by data and system interoperability standards such as SMART and FHIR (<link><marker>Mandel, Kreda, Mandl, Kohane, &amp; Ramoni, 2016</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0255\"/></link>).</p><p><anchor id=\"ref5b0120\"/>However, even though innovation in this space is significantly increasing, regulatory and legal requirements, existing organizational and ecosystem structures, as well as legacy systems and technologies, create significant barriers for disruptors seeking to scale innovations beyond prototypes or local implementations (<link><marker>Christensen, Grossman, &amp; Hwang, 2009</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0120\"/></link>). In many countries, health care is a fragmented industry which can stymie efforts to scale across the many boundaries (<link><marker>Mintzberg, 2012</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0285\"/></link>). In some countries, health care may be centralized, but that can make scaling challenging, as it may be difficult to locate, prioritize, and facilitate scaling across large-scale organizational systems. Further, not only must infrastructure be in place to support overcoming such barriers, but innovations themselves must be designed to support \"scalability,\" as designing for growth often requires attention to variation or unexpected workarounds that may be encountered (<link><marker>Milat, Bauman, &amp; Redman, 2015</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0280\"/></link>). An understanding of the challenges and how scaling may be supported for new market entrants would reveal novel modes of innovation activities to inform innovation scaling theory and practice, offering researchers substantial opportunities to contextualize and expand theory (<link><marker>Reimers, Li, Xie, &amp; Guo, 2014</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0360\"/></link>).</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5. Conclusion</emphasis></h><p>Our analysis of 202 HIT articles published from 2004 to 2017 in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Information and Organization</emphasis> and eight other highly-ranked IS journals (the AIS Senior Scholars' basket) highlights how HIT research has grown and contributed to IS research since <link><marker>Chiasson and Davidson's (2004)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0115\"/></link> essay was originally published. The opportunities for IS researchers to contribute to knowledge through theory and to health care practice are now even more important. We highlight three broad areas that are particularly well suited to the research strengths of the IS field, which reflect technology, social, field-level, and societal changes evident in health care and other societal sectors. The challenge for HIT researchers is to seek out the research questions that are highly relevant for the health care field, to apply or develop IS theory and knowledge to address these questions, and to partner with health care researchers and practitioners in order to articulate and translate the contributions to knowledge that such research enables.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Funding sources</emphasis></h><p>This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FOOTNOTES</emphasis></h><p>e.g., Americans Conference on Information Systems (AMCIS), European Conference on Information Systems (ECIS), Hawai'i International Conference on Systems Sciences (HICSS), International Conference on Information Systems (ICIS), and Pacific Asian Conference on Information Systems (PACIS)</p><p>URL: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.aissighealth.com\">http://www.aissighealth.com</url>/</p><p>Source: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.cms.org/uploads/HIT-Terms.pdf\">http://www.cms.org/uploads/HIT-Terms.pdf</url></p><p>Source: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.healthit.gov/patients-families/basics-health-it\">https://www.healthit.gov/patients-families/basics-health-it</url></p><p>The basket of eight includes (in alphabetical order): <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">European Journal of Information Systems, Information Systems Journal, Information Systems Research, Journal of the Association for Information Systems, Journal of Information Technology, Journal of Management Information Systems, Journal of Strategic Information Systems,</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Management Information Systems Quarterly</emphasis> (<url normalizedValue=\"http://aisnet.org/general/custom.asp?page=SeniorScholarBasket\">http://aisnet.org/general/custom.asp?page=SeniorScholarBasket</url>).</p><p>Comparisons of percentages with <link><marker>Chiasson and Davidson's (2004)</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0115\"/></link> findings are not meaningful, as different journals were used in their review, including technically oriented journals that published a greater percentage of healthcare-only papers.</p><p>For more information, see: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.england.nhs.uk/ourwork/innovation/nia/\">http://www.england.nhs.uk/ourwork/innovation/nia/</url></p><p>For more information, see: <url normalizedValue=\"https://innovation.cms.gov\">https://innovation.cms.gov</url>/</p><p>As of the writing of this article, Apple has announced its initiative to make clinical and personal health records available on patient's iPhones (<link><marker>Arndt, 2018</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"reference5b0020\"/></link>).

Republicans indignantly opposed regulating Internet service, currently dominated by a few cable giants. Texas Republican <person><nameText>Ted Cruz </nameText></person>called it \"Obamacare for the Internet\" (in his world, fightin' words).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The lobbying money and muscle of Comcast, AT&amp;T and Time Warner no doubt stoked the lawmakers' passions. And when the Federal Communications Commission voted to prevent Internet service providers from establishin g fast lanes for favored customers, its two Republican members voted against it.</p><p> So why, when the FCC said the Internet would be treated as a public utility, like telephone lines, did Republicans retreat rather than battle on? The most cited reason was the successful campaign by open-Internet activists working alongside heavy broadband users, notably Netflix, Twitter and Mozilla, proprietor of the Firefox browser.</p><p> But there's another reason. A lot of ordinary Americans hate their cable company. They fume with every month's astronomically high TV-Internet-phone bundle bill, the product of the company's monopoly or near-monopoly power.</p><p> High-speed Internet is seen no longer as a luxury but as the staff of commercial and personal life. Many Americans know that they are paying vastly more for far slower service than their friends in France, in the Netherlands and elsewhere in Europe. For huge numbers of us, hating the cable company transcends politics.</p><p> Faced with these realities, the ideologically motivated voices on the right do what they do so well, avoid them. You have Holman Jenkins in The Wall Street Journal writing that the big tech names \u2014 Google, Facebook, Microsoft \u2014 didn't fight against the net neutrality decision \"because they didn't want to be attacked by left-wing groups.\"</p><p> (Yeah, Google, Facebook and Microsoft are so shy about defending their interests.)</p><p> In the real world, these big content providers have been for \u2014 not against \u2014 net neutrality.</p><p> In a letter last spring to the FCC, they warned that permitting the Internet service providers to slow traffic for some sites and speed it for others would pose \"a grave threat to the Internet.\" Did they make themselves clear?</p><p> As for the politics, Barbara van Schewick, an Internet expert at Stanford Law School, offers a wildly different analysis of why Googleand the others didn't rush into the fray. She told Wired they \"risked drawing the ire of the Republicans in Congress who might retaliate in various ways.\"</p><p> Elsewhere in the real world, the cable companies don't seem devastated by the FCC decision. The stocks of Comcast and Time Warner Cable actually rose in its wake. Their proposed merger was being held up by fears of creating a monolith that couldn't be regulated. Now there are regulations, lowering those fears and making the merger likelier.</p><p> Meanwhile, Wall Street analysts have dismissed Republican claims that net neutrality will throttle the cable companies' investment in infrastructure. After all, the service providers paid $44 billion to buy a new wireless spectrum at a recent FCC auction.</p><p> \"They wrote that check full knowing that this was coming,\" Daniel Ernst, an analyst at Hudson Square Research, said on CNBC.</p><p>Googleis pro-net neutrality, though it did have some reservations about regulating the Internet like a phone company. That's because Google's business interests have spread into broadband. But note that the head of GoogleFiber said the impending FCC decision \"did not have any specific impact on (Google's) plans to build more Fiber cities.\"</p><p> All this solves the mystery of why Republican lawmakers did not bark after the FCC rejected their position.

Texas Republican <person><nameText>Ted Cruz </nameText></person>called it \"Obamacare for the Internet\" (in his world, fightin' words).</p><p>The lobbying money and muscle of Comcast, AT&amp;T and Time Warner no doubt stoked the lawmakers' passions. And when the Federal Communications Commission voted to prevent Internet service providers from establishing fast lanes for favored customers, its two Republican members voted against it.</p><p>So why, when the FCC said the Internet would be treated as a public utility, like telephone lines, did Republicans retreat rather than battle on? The most cited reason was the successful campaign by open-Internet activists working alongside heavy broadband users, notably Netflix, Twitter and Mozilla, proprietor of the Firefox browser.</p><p>But there's another reason. A lot of ordinary Americans hate their cable company. They fume with every month's astronomically high TV-Internet-phone bundle bill, the product of the company's monopoly or near-monopoly power.</p><p>High-speed Internet is seen no longer as a luxury but as the staff of commercial and personal life. Many Americans know that they are paying vastly more for far slower service than their friends in France, in the Netherlands and elsewhere in Europe. For huge numbers of us, hating the cable company transcends politics.</p><p>Faced with these realities, the ideologically motivated voices on the right do what they do so well: avoid them. You have Holman Jenkins in the Wall Street Journal writing that the big tech names - Google, Facebook, Microsoft - didn't fight against the net neutrality decision \"because they didn't want to be attacked by left-wing groups.\"</p><p>In the real world, these big content providers have been for - not against - net neutrality. In a letter last spring to the FCC, they warned that permitting the Internet service providers to slow traffic for some sites and speed it for others would pose \"a grave threat to the Internet.\" Did they make themselves clear?</p><p>As for the politics, Barbara van Schewick, an Internet expert at Stanford Law School, offers a wildly different analysis of why Googleand the others didn't rush into the fray. She told Wired they \"risked drawing the ire of the Republicans in Congress who might retaliate in various ways.\"</p><p>Elsewhere in the real world, the cable companies don't seem devastated by the FCC decision. The stocks of Comcast and Time Warner Cable actually rose in its wake.</p><p>Meanwhile, Wall Street analysts have dismissed Republican claims that net neutrality will throttle the cable companies' investment in infrastructure.</p><p>Googleis pro-net neutrality, though it did have some reservations about regulating the Internet like a phone company. That's because Google's business interests have spread into broadband. But note that the head of GoogleFiber said the impending FCC decision \"did not have any specific impact on (Google's) plans to build more Fiber cities.\"</p><p>All this solves the mystery of why Republican lawmakers did not bark after the FCC rejected their position. What's left for the pure ideologues is a bowl of kibbles about the evils of regulation and the selfless good deeds of corporations.

Republicans indignantly opposed regulating Internet service, currently dominated by a few cable giants. Texas Republican <person><nameText>Ted Cruz </nameText></person>called it \"Obamacare for the Internet\" (in his world, fightin' words).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The lobbying money and muscle of Comcast, AT&amp;T and Time Warner no doubt stoked the lawmakers' passions. And when the Federal Communications Commission voted to prevent Internet service providers from establishing fast lanes for favored customers, its two Republican members voted against it.</p><p>So why, when the FCC said the Internet would be treated as a public utility, like telephone lines, did Republicans retreat rather than battle on? The most cited reason was the successful campaign by open-Internet activists working alongside heavy broadband users, notably Netflix, Twitter and Mozilla, proprietor of the Firefox browser.</p><p>But there's another reason. A lot of ordinary Americans hate their cable company. They fume with every month's astronomically high TV-Internet-phone bundle bill, the product of the company's monopoly or near-monopoly power.</p><p>High-speed Internet is seen no longer as a luxury but as the staff of commercial and personal life. Many Americans know that they are paying vastly more for far slower service than their friends in France, in the Netherlands and elsewhere in Europe. For huge numbers of us, hating the cable company transcends politics.</p><p>Faced with these realities, the ideologically motivated voices on the right do what they do so well, avoid them. You have Holman Jenkins in The Wall Street Journal writing that the big tech names</p><p>- Google, Facebook, Microsoft</p><p>- didn't fight against the net neutrality decision \"because they didn't want to be attacked by left-wing groups.\"</p><p>(Yeah, Google, Facebook and Microsoft are so shy about defending their interests.)</p><p>In the real world, these big content providers have been for</p><p>- not against - net neutrality. In a letter last spring to the FCC, they warned that permitting the Internet service providers to slow traffic for some sites and speed it for others would pose \"a grave threat to the Internet.\" Did they make themselves clear?</p><p>As for the politics, Barbara van Schewick, an Internet expert at Stanford Law School, offers a wildly different analysis of why Google and the others didn't rush into the fray. She told Wired they \"risked drawing the ire of the Republicans in Congress who might retaliate in various ways.\"</p><p>Elsewhere in the real world, the cable companies don't seem devastated by the FCC decision. The stocks of Comcast and Time Warner Cable actually rose in its wake. Their proposed merger was being held up by fears of creating a monolith that couldn't be regulated. Now there are regulations, lowering those fears and making the merger likelier.</p><p>Meanwhile, Wall Street analysts have dismissed Republican claims that net neutrality will throttle the cable companies' investment in infrastructure. After all, the service providers paid $44 billion to buy a new wireless spectrum at a recent FCC auction.</p><p>\"They wrote that check full knowing that this was coming,\" Daniel Ernst, an analyst at Hudson Square Research, said on CNBC.</p><p>Google is pro-net neutrality, though it did have some reservations about regulating the Internet like a phone company. That's because Google's business interests have spread into broadband. But note that the head of Google Fiber said the impending FCC decision \"did not have any specific impact on (Google's) plans to build more Fiber cities.\"</p><p>All this solves the mystery of why Republican lawmakers did not bark after the FCC rejected their position. What's left for the pure ideologues is a bowl of kibbles about the evils of regulation and the selfless good deeds of corporations.

Bloomberg</p><p>An antitrust advocacy group called on all 27 members of Facebook's cryptocurrency effort \u2013 which include Spotify, Mastercard, Visa and Uber \u2013 to withdraw from the project immediately amid a hearing before the US Senate to examine the digital currency known as Libra and mounting criticism of the project.</p><p>\"Today's hearing confirmed that there are clear privacy risks, monetary risks, regulatory questions and monopolistic questions that are far from being answered,\" said Matt Stoller, senior fellow at the Open Markets Institute. He said David Marcus, the head of Facebook's Calibra, which is overseeing the Libra initiative, had not addressed privacy issues in his testimony on Tuesday.</p><p>With Libra's regulatory hurdles in the spotlight, cryptocurrency markets have been reeling. Bitcoin dropped below $10,000 (Dh36,725) three weeks after surging above it for the first time in more than a year as US policymakers aired concerns about the viability of digital currencies.</p><p>The largest digital coin by market capitalisation fell as much as 12 per cent on Tuesday, down 25 per cent from its June high of $12,733. Ethereum and Litecoin both declined 13 per cent, Bloomberg reported.</p><p>Criticism from both Republican and Democratic legislators included money laundering, sanctions enforcement and Facebook's recurring missteps in protecting user privacy.</p><p>Senator Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat on the Senate banking committee, compared Facebook to a toddler playing with matches.</p><p>\"Their motto has been move fast and break things,\" Mr Brown said in his opening statement. \"They certainly have. We'd be crazy to let them experiment with people's bank accounts.\"</p><p>Earlier this week, Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell also raised concerns about the project. In Europe, French finance minister Bruno Le Maire told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera that the G7 would examine the Libra proposition at the meeting of finance ministers this week.</p><p>\"The red line for us is that Libra must not transform into a sovereign currency,\" he said.</p><p>Katharina Pistor, a professor at Columbia Law School and expert on global finance law, will testify on Wednesday before the US SenateCommittee on Financial Services that Libra \"has accelerated a debate that has long been coming: a debate about how to harness the opportunities and meet the challenges associated with fast-moving innovations in technology, including crypto technology\".</p><p>Professor Pistor supports a draft bill titled \"Keep Big Tech Out of Finance Act\" that aims to prevent big tech firms \u2013 defined as those generating more than $25 billion in annual revenue \u2013 from becoming financial institutions but called the proposed law a \"game slower\" not a \"game stopper\".</p><p>Mr Marcus said Facebook won't launch Libra until regulators' concerns are fully addressed.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/11/156337256561.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/11/156337256561.jpg</url></p><p>Senator Robert Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey, questions David Marcus, head of blockchain with Facebook, not pictured, during a Senate Banking Committee hearing in Washington.

The speech acknowledged the adaptability and sacrifice of Canadians who have successfully moved their work, schooling and personal lives online over the last six months, but offered no concrete support for getting the millions of Canadians who have struggled to make that transition connected to fast and affordable Internet.</p><p>\"There's no sign of a positive vision for building Canada's Internet back better in today's throne speech,\" said OpenMedia Campaigns Director Matt Hatfield. \"How do you 'accelerate' a broadband rollout that's already fallen far behind? It's now been 18 months since the Universal Broadband Fund was announced. Three months ago, Minister of Rural Economic Development Maryam Monsef said the Universal Broadband Fund would be opened for applications 'in the coming days' - well, 107 of those days have now gone by. How many times will they re-announce the same project, and when will they actually implement it? There's no sign our government is acting on the urgency of Canada's growing Digital Divide, or are conscious that our extremely high Internet access costs - amongst the highest in the world - are a very heavy burden at a time of extreme financial duress for Canadians.\"</p><p>\"If today's speech is any guide, our government is more concerned with regulating people's speech and creativity on the Internet, than with ensuring everyone has access to it,\" said Hatfield. \"Many of us are legitimately concerned by the size and influence of Big Tech companies, and we all want to see Canadian creators and news outlets flourish and succeed. But in talking up the need to go after Big Tech, the government is signalling support for the poorly thought through Link and Streaming Tax proposals that Canadian Heritage Minister Guilbeault has been championing in recent months. Guilbeault's measures will make Big Tech companies even more influential and permanent fixtures of our online lives- while hurting the distribution of Canadian news and creative content. We strongly believe the government should slow down and get wider public input into how to address these issues- while speeding up action on the broadband Internet distribution and affordability challenges we've understood well enough for decades.\"</p><p>Despite including a $2 billion 'Safe Return to Class' fund for re-opening schools to implement COVID-related ventilation and health measures, the government's speech also did not appear to include any funding for connections and devices for students living in poverty who will need to continue their education online. With some schools choosing to re-open fully or partially online, and other schools already grappling with outbreaks in their student bodies and looking at new closures, the absence of this support may be a serious omission if COVID-19's second wave continues to deepen.</p><p>Nearly 20,000 OpenMedia community members have signed a petition or reached out to their MPs this year calling for the government to get everyone in Canada connected to affordable high-speed Internet. Nearly 6,000 people have written Minister Guilbeault directly to protest his proposed link and streaming taxes.</p><p>[Category: Media]</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7244581 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7244581</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60X7-K2W1-JC11-155D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"568\"/><timeReceived>9:02 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 24, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

How much should we care, asks Douglas Heaven</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ONE sure sign of a mature technology is that you only ever think about it when it doesn't work. You don't consider the pipes beneath your feet until your drain gets blocked. Similarly, you don't reflect on the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article-topic/internet/\">internet</url> until your video call dies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The internet's foundational organisational principle \u2013 that it has no organising principle \u2013 has given it an unprecedented reach into our lives. At least in theory, anyone can join it, extend it, write software for it, make money from it. As a result, today's internet isn't just about emails, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article-topic/facebook/\">Facebook</url> updates and hours and hours of Netflix. Information exchange through it has come to underpin essential everyday services from power grids to public transport. Without it, the world we know would stop.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, the internet is continuing to grow apace, as gaps in its global coverage are closed and ever more devices are connected to it, from smartwatches to cars and even refrigerators. Yet at the same time, the very principles of openness that underpin it are under threat from an unholy coalition of government, commercial and other interests. The question is whether that is necessarily all a bad thing. Might a more closed, better regulated internet actually be in all our interests?</p><p>An example of the threats the internet currently faces came with a message on 12 June this year on the Twitter account of internet messaging app Telegram. It announced that \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/telegram/status/1138773578592268288?lang=en\">GADZILLIONS of garbage requests</url>\" had knocked out its network. Telegram's end-to-end encryption makes it popular with privacy-minded users. This huge \"distributed denial of service\" attack came at the height of street protests in Hong Kong against mainland China's attempt to gain greater control. The company later said that the attack appeared to have been orchestrated from China.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4.8</emphasis>gigabytes of data will pass between IP addresses in 2022, three times the amount in 2017</p><p>If so, it wouldn't have been the first time: in 2015, a similar attack on a US website hosting anti-censorship software seems to have come from the same location. The possibility of waging this sort of cyberwarfare is a consequence of the internet's open, borderless structure. Ransomware like <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2139647-ukraine-claims-russia-launched-notpetya-ransomware-attack/\">NotPetya</url> or       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2130983-ransomware-attack-hits-200000-computers-across-the-globe/\">WannaCry</url>, which took computer systems around the world hostage in 2017, is another favoured tool. Once released, such software can spread like wildfire in open grassland through the internet's distributed nodes.</p><p>Cyberwarfare is the stated reason why Vladimir Putin's government wants to follow China's lead and erect borders around Russia's portion of the internet. A \"sovereign internet\" bill, passed earlier this year, requires telecoms companies to monitor and filter all internet traffic passing into Russia, and proposes an off switch <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2194009-russias-plan-to-unplug-from-the-internet-shows-cyberwar-is-escalating/\">to separate the country from the rest of the world during a cyberattack</url>. The details are still hazy. China has been building barriers since the internet arrived there, but Russia's internet is well-connected. Cutting itself off will probably involve the state taking over Russia's internet service providers \u2013 a power with obvious potential for abuse.</p><p>One country, two systems</p><p>China is certainly clear in its antiglobalist internet vision. In 2015, it hosted what it billed as the second World Internet Conference. In an opening address, president Xi Jinping said: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjdt_665385/zyjh_665391/t1327570.shtml\">We should respect the right of individual countries to independently choose their own path of cyber development.</url></p><p>In fact more or less everyone is begining to do this in their different ways. The European Union's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article-topic/gdpr/\">General Data Protection Regulation</url>, or the GDPR, came into effect in May 2018 to strengthen the privacy rights of internet users and limit the power of tech companies over EU citizens' data. Rather than comply with the stipulations, certain websites have instead just blocked access to European visitors.</p><p>In the US, the central principle of net neutrality \u2013 that no data is privileged over any other as it passes through the internet \u2013 is under threat. Rules adopted in 2015 mandating the Federal Communications Commission to ensure net neutrality were <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23831823-600-net-neutrality-officially-ended-this-week-now-what/\">repealed again in 2018</url>, allowing telecoms firms to offer faster, higher-bandwidth connections to customers who pay for them. That is a potential win for big companies such as Facebook and Netflix, but bad news for small businesses and local news sites. Twenty states are challenging the repeal in the courts, and California has passed its own net neutrality laws, effectively asking internet traffic to obey different rules when it enters the state. Other states       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/01/court-says-fccs-unhinged-net-neutrality-repeal-cant-stop-state-laws/\">look likely to follow</url>.</p><p>In a way, all these developments are symptoms of a technology that has outgrown itself. \"The internet was not meant to be used in the ways we are using it today,\" says computer scientist <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~kgk/\">Konstantinos Gkoutzis</url> at Imperial College London. One person's openness is another's borderline anarchy, after all. Whether through concern for national security or user privacy, a desire for control or to protect commercial interests, there are many reasons why countries might want to regulate internet traffic.</p><p>In some cases that might be good, says Gkoutzis. The power of big tech firms and telecoms companies has made the future of the internet precarious. \"If nothing changes, it could soon become borderline unusable, where companies the size of small countries control what you see,\" he says. Regulations such as the GDPR aim to counter that power.</p><p>These problems, and questions of how to regulate them, are only set to become more pressing as the internet continues to evolve. New infrastructures to carry internet traffic are accelerating the rate at which the unconnected half of the world's population can join up (see \u201cSky net\u201d). A truly global internet will undoubtedly bring huge social benefits. In other respects \u2013 not least economically \u2013 the case is less clear-cut.</p><p>As internet connections improve, remote working and virtual commuting are set to become more common. Companies could employ people anywhere in the world, with machines in US factories, for example, operated by workers in Bangladesh or Botswana. With a positive spin, the gig economy, based on internet apps such as Uber that connect those wanting to buy goods or services more efficiently with those willing to supply them, could increase employment, economic output and prosperity.</p><p>That's certainly the view of many in places like South Africa, where unemployment is high, says <url normalizedValue=\"https://researchictafrica.net/people/anri-van-der-spuy/\">Anri van der Spuy</url> at Research ICT Africa, a think tank in Cape Town. The reality could be more nuanced:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/round-up/future-work/\">the global digital economy</url> often works to drive down worker protections and pay in favour of big business, says van der Spuy. \"We tend to neglect the fact that internet access could exacerbate inequalities rather than alleviate them.\"</p><p>It isn't just inequality. The balance between personal privacy and public security is only likely to become more delicate as digital connectivity increases. Again, that raises questions of what sort of internet we want, how it should be regulated and by whom.</p><p>Take the internet of things. This evolution of the internet, in which it isn't just computers and smartphones beaming data to and fro, but also objects from household refrigerators to autonomous vehicles, is now in train. \"We already have smart hairbrushes, noodle forks and fish tanks,\" says internet privacy researcher <url normalizedValue=\"https://people.uea.ac.uk/paul_bernal\">Paul Bernal</url> at the University of East Anglia, UK. \"In 50 years, it will be a very rare thing that isn't online.\"</p><p>The advantages could be big: homes or offices automatically adapting themselves to your preferences when you arrived, or cars drawing up to meet you when you left.</p><p>The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2201513-why-the-uks-grand-plan-to-stop-gadgets-turning-against-us-is-flawed/\">security risks</url>, however, are also significant. Hooking up cars or home appliances to the internet exposes them to the same kind of malicious cyberattacks phones and laptops face. Yet where a hacked phone probably can't kill you, a hacked car or oven perhaps could. Again, maintaining an open internet in an era of universal connectivity brings risks.</p><p>One response could be more personalised security to regulate our access to the internet. A few people have already inserted <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22430003-800-2015-preview-ready-to-start-body-hacking/\">RFID chips in their hands or fingers</url> \u2013 similar to the microchip injected into the scruff of a pet's neck \u2013 that let them open car doors or turn on coffee machines with a gesture.</p><p>But even without going to such extremes, systems such as face recognition are likely to become more widespread, essentially bringing us online too, like it or not. \"We will be recognisable by who and what we are,\" says Bernal. \"Faces, retinas, fingerprints, voice recognition are just the start. How we move our hands, how we use a touchscreen, pretty much anything we do will be recognisable.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">7.5 million</emphasis> distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks worldwide in 2017</p><p>Protesters in Hong Kong already hide their identities from internet-connected surveillance cameras by wearing masks. They have stopped using public transport cards, which record every trip in a central database. And they use encrypted messaging apps to prevent eavesdropping on their conversations \u2013 until they get switched off.</p><p>In 50 years, Bernal thinks we will still both care about privacy and be able to protect it when we need to. \"All technological developments will be accompanied by parallel disruptive technology,\" he says. There will be make-up and clothes that thwart biometric recognition, spoofers that disguise our location or fake our identity, and signal blockers that disrupt Wi-Fi or its successors.</p><p>Haters gonna hate</p><p>Of course, hackers will still hack, scammers will still scam and trolls will still troll. There will still be viral memes and pornography. The trend towards filter bubbles and walled gardens will hardly stop. There will still be hate speech and extremism. \"These are not dependent on tech but on human nature,\" says Bernal. \"It won't be possible to clean up the internet, whatever our governments think.\"</p><p>However we are actually wired up, everyone and everything will be connected. We will probably think about the internet even less than we do now. Being a node in a non-stop, two-way flow of information will be the norm, for most humans and objects alike. Whether we will all be seeing the same thing is less certain.</p><p>In September, an international working group met at the United Nations headquarters in New York to discuss the future of the internet. The meeting made few headlines, but China again took the opportunity to push its vision of an internet broken into state-controlled zones. Others are starting to take notice, drawn by the desire for greater control and protection from outside influence and attack. Besides Russia's plans, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vietnam-security-facebook/vietnam-says-facebook-steps-up-local-content-restrictions-idUSKCN1V523A\">Vietnam</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euronews.com/2018/04/12/tanzania-cyber-law-introduces-900-fees-for-bloggers-compulsory-passwords\">Tanzania</url> have also adopted Chinese-style internet restrictions in the past few years.</p><p>The open internet is no longer a given. It may well be that an internet without borders, allowing free movement of information, enabling commerce and spreading innovation, is better. But as we come to appreciate the significant downsides \u2013 cyberattacks, misinformation and big business running amok \u2013 it is a case that must now be made, rather than simply taken for granted. The internet has changed the world immeasurably in its first 50 years; its next 50 years depend crucially on how that argument plays out.</p><p>SKY NET</p><p>Even as the internet threatens to break apart (see main story), people continue to sign up apace, with a few hundred million new users joining every year. Many are in developing nations such as India and those in Africa, and most do so via smartphones connecting to cell towers or by visiting internet cafes. Coverage in remote areas far from the internet's modern fibre-optic backbone remains patchy though, mainly supplied by a network of a few dozen satellites operated by companies such as O3b Networks and Iridium.A handful of more pie-in-the-sky schemes have aimed to accelerate uptake.

This is issue 222, dated August 20, 2019 The tech required to deliver premium podcasts and bonus content alongside a free (often ad-supported) show is, on the surface, relatively simple. You need a second, private podcast feed and some means of authenticating paying users so that only they can access it. A new clutch of startups has sprung up to handle this, from Supporting Cast[2] to Acast Access[3] to the newly seed-financed Glow[4]. Some larger independent shows are even building their own bespoke solutions[5]. But as anyone who has tried subscribing to a bonus or premium feed knows, it's not always straightforward to get your new paid-for content set up in your podcast app of choice. </p><p>Some publishers get around this by making their paywalled stuff app-specific (the Stitcher Premium way); others provide extensive FAQs[6] and onboarding instructions to help listeners get their feeds working (the Slate Plus route). 'It is a pain in the ass for us, and more importantly, it's a pain in the ass for users,' Slate Plus editorial director Gabriel Roth told Digiday in 2018[7], characterizing the effort to monetize podcasts directly as 'essentially, a customer-service challenge.' That's the state of play right now \u2014 lots of overlapping and competing routes for the podcaster interested in charging their audience for premium content, from Patreon's patron-only audio RSS option[8] to those new startups. Enter Jake Shapiro and Chris Quamme Rhoden, CEO and CTO of RadioPublic respectively, who have a proposal for a new way of handling this. What they're suggesting, laid out in detail in this post[9] and in the draft technical spec[10], is a new open protocol that would enable listener identification and authentication in any enabled app. If it can be built as they're currently suggesting, this would drastically reduce the customer-service difficulties around delivering premium podcast content, since listeners would be able to access their extra paid-for episodes with a few taps inside their usual listening app (here's a mockup[11] of how it could work). They're calling this system PodPass. I spoke to Shapiro and Rhoden yesterday to get a bit more detail on how this might work, and what the practicalities of implementation would be. To start with, Shapiro emphasized that the PodPass proposal is a response to the pre-existing trends in the podcast industry, not an attempt to engineer a new direction. 'We don't need to incentivize or create [the direct-monetization] phenomenon. We are just proposing a way to make it more effective,' he said. This is a moment, Shapiro argued, where apps and providers have a choice to make about how they're going to handle premium feeds. 'You can either choose a strategy where you don't want to support any of these things in a seamless way, where you want to offer your own integrated solution \u2014 Luminary being the most extreme example \u2014 or you turn on an ability for a publisher to offer some kind of gated content on your platform,' he said. He also made the point that there's a gap for an open solution here[12], since none of the big players (Apple, Spotify) have addressed the need for seamless private feeds yet. The idea, therefore, is to develop PodPass as an open, collaborative project \u2014 RadioPublic would not have ownership of it. 'We want to really underscore that this is an open protocol rather than a company's product,' Shapiro said. 'It'd be better to have someone else implement it, or start implementing it, than just us.' The big aim, he said, is to have something completely accessible, almost as an add-on to RSS, as a means of open distribution. Another important element is payment. PodPass is not a means for taking money, merely the mechanism via which paying listeners would be authenticated to receive their content \u2014 although Shapiro doesn't rule out that the protocol could be used for other monetization purposes too. 'The place where [a service] currently takes a cut would stay the same. If you're Patreon and you're providing the service, nothing changes. It's just a more effective service.' The hope is, of course, that a better service for listeners incentivizes more of them to start paying for bonus content, thus benefiting funding platforms and in turn incentivizing those companies to implement PodPass. In order to get a sense of the viability of this, I put out feelers to people at a dozen or so different companies in this space, attempting to test the temperature and interest in PodPass. I got some positive responses back. Michael Mahemoff from PlayerFM says he's excited by the idea and his team are 'actively evaluating the details of the protocol and sharing feedback'; Garret Heaton from Swoot said 'it's especially appealing to us as app makers since it would make it easier for our users to use premium/private feeds'; David Stern from Supporting Cast said 'PodPass is exciting because it would greatly streamline the process for the end listener and make it more robust and secure for the podcaster.' Several others expressed interest privately. Several of those I spoke with pointed out that their apps or platforms alone didn't have the capacity to develop something like this, but that they were keen to participate in a collaborative effort on a new standard. Similarly, everyone who responded was keen on the open nature of the PodPass proposal, feeling that it kept the playing field level and didn't tie podcasters to particular companies. I'm still interested in other responses to this idea, so if you have feelings about PodPass and how it might work with your product, do drop me a line[13]. The big question, of course, is whether PodPass can actually work on a practical level. Chris Quamm Rhoden, who had the original idea and has worked on the draft technical spec, says so \u2014 he's confident that what they've put forward in the specification now can work, but says it's not a final version by any means. 'We want to invite as many people who are interested in having a voice in the final version of the document feel like they've got an opportunity to do that,' he said. 'We've seen other things happen in the past where things sort of stalled because that invitation wasn't loud enough. And so we're making a very loud invitation right now.' 'We're also prioritizing making sure that people have as little work to do as possible to make the UX good,' he added, explaining that each app or platform that wants to offer PodPass will have to integrate it into its own system, and it's difficult to say how easy or hard that will be without intimate knowledge of each product. But both he and Shapiro feel it's eminently possible, and possible fairly quickly. 'I expect we'll see some test implementations this fall,' Shapiro said. 'I would imagine we'll see some early versions of it, round trips through from a publisher to a hosting company to an app happen this fall \u2014 at least one or two if not three or more participating stakeholders for each one of those pieces of the chain, just based so far on momentum and interest that we're seeing. But because this is not a RadioPublic product per se, it's not a road map that we controlThis is more movement building.' In the year that brought us the launch of Luminary and all of the conversations that provoked about what a podcast is and what open distribution means, PodPass indeed feels like a movement \u2014 an idealistic, blue-sky-thinking plan for a new iteration of free and open distribution at a time when ever more big money players are getting into the industry. If it can gather enough momentum, it's still a very long road for the idea to go from proposal to wide implementation.Fun for the kids. A new children's podcast network[14] has launched in the U.K., growing out of Fun Kids, a national children's radio station based in London. As well as the station's own stable of podcasts[15], the network includes The Week Junior Show, an extension of Dennis Publishing's The Week Junior magazine, and Storynory, a storytime podcast that has been in production since 2005. Children's media is a small but growing segment of on-demand audio in the U.K. \u2014 the growth of the sector being influenced in the past by, you guessed it, the BBC. Children's TV and other entertainment is a major plank of public service broadcasting, with provision funded by the license fee and regulated by Ofcom[16]. However, the practical dominance of the BBC in the children's TV space was one of the motivating factors behind the creation of a TV counterpart to that new Audio Content Fund[17] I wrote about back in February, as a way for public money to find its way to smaller and more diverse providers. All of which is to say: Things are starting to change in who makes content for kids and how it is paid for. It's difficult to work out quite how big children's audio is at the moment. The under-10s aren't measured by radio listenership survey RAJAR, and since Fun Kids is aimed at 6- to 12-year-olds, it's a little hard to gauge its audience size, but you can see figures for the teen and adult listenership in London here[18]. Given all of that deep background, I caught up with Fun Kids station manager Matt Deegan over email recently to find out a bit more about this new podcast network venture. The radio station and the podcast network are closely linked, he said, with the latter using the 'infrastructure, team, and relationships' of the radio station. As to how the team is structured: 'At the moment, I'm working with content providers to onboard them to the network. We have four producers working on content and a sales team of four working to help monetize the network.' The focus at the moment is attracting existing shows, although there is some flexibility to add a production element to the relationship, according to Deegan. 'If an existing children's podcast wants to join us, they'll be hosted by us for free, we'll sell and deliver their advertising for them, and they'll be cross-promoted by shows on the network. As we make our own kids content too, we're particularly tuned to the sensitivities about advertising to children,' he said. They're also open to exploring branded shows for kids as well. Advertisers want scale, which in a kids' audio space growing from a small start isn't always easy for shows to offer. This is something that Deegan and the team hope that the network can help with. At the moment, they're seeing half a million downloads a month across the shows currently signed up. 'For smaller podcasters, being part of the network means they have access to campaigns that could be harder for them to get themselves, that we'll sell across the network. We're also able to group together podcasts around certain topics \u2014 like stories.' It's fascinating to me that this development has come out of commercial radio (Fun Kids radio runs short ad breaks on its shows) rather than a grant-funded initiative or public broadcaster. A lot of children's digital radio disappeared from the BBC in 2011[19], after it was found that very few kids actually listened to it, but Fun Kids and the like are showing that there is still a young audience out there for audio. By moving early \u2014 as far as I'm aware, Fun Kids is the only formal children's podcast network operating in the U.K. so far \u2014 Deegan hopes that they can reap the rewards as advertisers and other publishers realize the potential for children's audio in the U.K. Although Pinna[20] in the U.S. has opted for a subscription-based model, Fun Kids is pursuing an ad-supported model. They're starting slow, going for growth while they educate the market. 'Our aim at the moment is to establish ourselves, and the product, in the advertising market whilst talking to new podcasts that are interested in joining,' he said. 'Right now, we're also concentrating on using cross-promotion to grow each of the shows and the network's total downloads. In 12 months, we expect to have an even broader slate and be the obvious choice for advertisers in the U.S. and U.K. to use if they want to reach children and families.'A check-in with Forever35. Back in January, I interviewed Doree Shafrir and Kate Spencer from the Forever35 podcast[21] all about their first year as an independent business. At the time, they had clocked 4 million downloads off just over 90 episodes in 2018, basically handling the entire sponsorship pipeline by themselves. In July, Shafrir and Spencer released a meta-episode[22] that laid out some changes behind-the-scenes: They'd opted to sign a deal with Acast, and in doing so traded total independence for access to more resources. Intrigued, I reached out over email to learn more about the thinking behind their decision to switch things up. Here's that exchange.Hot Pod: What was the motivation behind partnering with a network, after what seemed like a successful start as an independent operation? Shafrir and Spencer: We had a lot of success as an independent \u2014 we were completely sold out of ad inventory in the last three quarters, and we've grown the podcast organically to 125,000 downloads per week on our own. But we felt like we had taken the pod as far as we could without help. We wanted to partner with a network who could access advertising opportunities that weren't available to us.Also, selling ads was turning into a huge time and resources suck for us \u2014 energy that we felt would be better spent on the podcast itself. And we're hopeful that Acast can help us grow, particularly internationally.Hot Pod: What were you looking for in a network? Shafrir and Spencer: We wanted to partner with a network that we felt aligned with content- and strategy-wise. We were already fans of some of Acast's shows, and their signing of the Earios network[23] was also a big plus for us. And we wanted a network that had a clear vision about how we could grow. Hot Pod: How did the shopping process go? Did you feel like there were lots of possible homes for your show? Shafrir and Spencer: Our agent, Oren Rosenbaum at UTA, set up a bunch of meetings for us. (Side note: Oren is the best.) We talked to several different networks, all of which had their strengths. It was really interesting to hear how each network would approach growing our show and why they wanted to work with us in the first place. It was really flattering to have options! Hot Pod: You ultimately decided to work with Acast \u2014 what was the deciding factor? Shafrir and Spencer: We loved that there are lots of women in senior, decision-making positions at Acast \u2014 all of whom had been fans of the show even before we started talking to them. This really made a difference to us, and not just because of optics. It says a lot about a company to have multiple women in powerful roles, and as a women-run podcast, this was important to us. We felt that going into it, they understood how to work with our show, had great ideas, and really wanted to see us succeed. And so far, they've been great! Hot Pod: If you could advise other independent podcasters also looking for a bigger home in the industry, what would you suggest? Shafrir and Spencer: Don't rush into anything. We started getting approached by networks within a few months of launching, and we're so glad we waited for the right partner for us. Make sure that you're really clear on why you're looking for a network partner, and find out if they will truly be able to help you get there.Talk to other podcasters on the networks you're interested in \u2014 are they happy, did the network grow their podcast, etc. Also, don't think that you need to launch with a network \u2014 if your show takes off, you'll be in a stronger negotiating position down the road when you do start talking to networks. Don't sign away your IP. Also: GET A LAWYER WHO WORKS WITH PODCASTS. Even if you have a lawyer, a regular entertainment or contract lawyer who has never done a podcast contract might not know what to look for and ask for. We anecdotally know of multiple podcasts who signed very restrictive contracts with networks that they now regret. Needless to say, we have a great lawyer.

Alan Montecillo[25] combines his work as a producer at Illinois Public Media with studying for an MLIS degree. In this edition of Career Spotlight, Montecillo talks to us about how he got into audio, how his favorite podcast set him on the path to his current job, and the privilege dimension of the volunteer/intern hustle.Hot Pod: Tell me about your current situation. Alan Montecillo: I'm the senior producer of The 21st, a daily, live, hourlong news/talk show produced by Illinois Public Media in Champaign-Urbana, Illinois. (Okay, fine, it's Monday to Thursday). We air on five public radio stations across northern and central Illinois, including the state's largest non-Chicago cities like Springfield, Rockford, Bloomington-Normal, and Peoria. I've been here since February 2017.We cover anything we can tie back to Illinois, whether it's politics, the arts, science, or really anything that we can credibly say affects Illinoisans in some way. I'm also a master's student at the University of Illinois School of Information Sciences, studying for an MLIS degree.Hot Pod: How did you get here? Montecillo: In college, I did a weekend-long Radio Bootcamp run by Planet Money's Robert Smith. But I didn't really pursue radio until a couple of years after that, in about 2015 or so.I was back in Portland, Oregon, after spending a year working in higher ed in Singapore. I knew I didn't want to go back to higher ed, but I also didn't have much of a plan beyond that. I did, however, listen to a lot of podcasts, and often I'd use them to fill many of those empty spaces between jobs that can feel like an eternity. Eventually I realized that I liked audio enough that I should actually try and give that a go. So I started volunteering at a bunch of small nonprofit stations in Portland for a few months, including KBOO Community Radio, XRAY, and Portland Radio Project. I also launched a monthly public affairs show on KBOO focusing on Asian-American issues. Then one day, I went to a Portland meetup for one of my favorite podcasts \u2014 Death, Sex ...ney. I met lots of interesting people (including Anna Sale, of course). I also met Julie Sabatier, a producer at Oregon Public Broadcasting's talk show, Think Out Loud. A few days after the meetup, Anna forwarded along a posting for an internship at OPB. Turns out Julie had sent her the listing and asked if she could pass it along to me. So I applied, and eventually worked at Think Out Loud for a few months as an intern. A few months after the internship, this guy named Zahir Janmohamed sent me an email saying he liked my work at KBOO and wanted to talk about a podcast idea he had about race and food with a chef+writer named Soleil Ho. That idea became a podcast called Racist Sandwich, and for nearly a year or so I was the show's first producer and editor. All the while, I had been applying to salaried public radio and podcasting jobs left and right, because none of those things I just mentioned were enough to financially support myself. I didn't think I'd move to central Illinois for my first public radio job, but the team, the show and the job were just the right fit for me. Almost all of my audio journalism experience has consisted of producing interviews/conversations, actually. It kind of happened by coincidence. If I had applied for an OPB internship at the news desk instead of the talk show, I might be filing spots instead of producing long segments. But I think producing fits me really well, so I'm glad it turned out this way. I should also note that during a large portion of the volunteer/intern hustle, I was relying on financial support from my parents in some capacity. That privilege really bought me the time and space to work on my skills, think about what I wanted, and network with people who fit my interests. So I've been very lucky in that regard.Hot Pod: What does a career mean to you? Montecillo: I have a feeling that it's always going to change. But right now, it's about two things. First, at a really basic level, a career means having the resources to buy the flexibility I need, when I need it.For example, I'm a U.S. citizen but my parents live in the Philippines. In fact, the vast majority of my family lives in the Philippines. Lots of us, I suspect, have many loved ones who are far away from us. A career that doesn't give me the flexibility to see them on a regular basis isn't a good career, no matter how much I enjoy the craft of it. So much of this is about tangible resources like salary and PTO, but it's also about finding workplaces that encourage you to be a person outside of your professional life. That's really important to me. Second, I think I just want to be useful to people who actually need what I'm providing for them, if that makes sense. When I was at Racist Sandwich, it felt like the interviews we had were filling a need for a lot of people. That felt good. Now, I'd like to think our show provides high-quality news and conversations for an enormous part of the state of Illinois that really needs it. So in a radio context, I want my work to be focused on producing clear and honest conversations. And I think every topic deserves clarity and honesty, whether it's a complicated government policy or an intensely personal story. I also appreciate the qualities that working on a talk show forces on me: empathy, yes, but also consistency, calmness under pressure, and the ability to trust your team members.Hot Pod: When you first started out being a person, what did you want to be? Montecillo: When I was a small person? An NBA player. We didn't have PBS or other local English language children's TV in Hong Kong, so instead I grew up watching my dad's NBA VHS tapes from the 80s and early 90s. One of them was a series with individual player highlights set to 80s music, which was a pretty hilarious way to get introduced to lots of American songs.In high school, I thought I'd work in politics on a campaign, or perhaps for an elected official. I was a 'West Wing' kid.Hot Pod: When you look around at what's going in podcasting these days, what are you thinking about, paying attention to, seeing? Montecillo: Pretty much every new daily news podcast pitch goes something like 'the news is just crazy, but we're here to help you understand it!' So I'm wondering whether that's actually happened or not. Have daily news podcasts (a) helped their audiences (or perhaps new audiences!) understand the news more deeply than they would otherwise, and (b) has that depth translated into meaningful civic engagement? Has anyone studied this yet? Hot Pod: What are you listening to these days? Montecillo: I rotate between some of the national daily news podcasts, and lately it's been Post Reports and Today Explained. I also listen to The Lowe Post and Kotaku Splitscreen when I need to give my brain a rest and just think about my non-radio hobbies for a minute.Also: Bundyville. Listen to Bundyville.

The round is led by Industrifonden , with participation from existing investors including Brightly Ventures and Luminar Ventures.   The funds, according to the report, will be used to \"to continue to grow the team and establish the platform in the Nordic and European market.\"   Since its founding in 2017, Open Payments has worked to provide PSD2-compliant API aggregation, allowing for easy, quick integrations with financial institutions.   The idea is for businesses to have the power to develop their own products and brands under their own names and allow third-party partners and businesses to improve the platform even more in the future, according to the report. The concept is somewhere in-between a regular FinTech and the Big Tech business model, with the openness and modularity of the latter distinguishing it from typical FinTechs.   Open Payments Founder and CEO Jonas Kjellin said he believes that Big Tech firms \"will have a big impact on how we perform financial services in the future, but also requires traditional FinTechs, and by bridging the gap between them, we have a great position to offer our customers a flexible solution,\" per the report.   Anna Ljungdahl , investment manager at Industrifonden, said that Open Payments \"makes it easy for companies to take advantage of the enormous business development potential that open banking entails for small and large companies,\" and would offer more flexibility and freedom for payments.   Open Payments has launched services in Sweden and Finland, and plans to expand to more markets soon.   Jason Conibear, CEO of FXPress, recently spoke with PYMNTS and said that a more holistic approach, including the addition of banking services and integration with payments programs, would be necessary as businesses recover from the coronavirus pandemic.   However, there is a lag in open banking implementation due to the differences between various countries. Factors as widespread as differing deadlines, concerns over online security and infrastructure cost, and disparity in resources have all contributed to making the process slower than it could be.   \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014    NEW PYMNTS REPORT: THE FI\u2019S GUIDE TO MODERNIZING DIGITAL PAYMENTS       Instant payouts have become the name of the game for vendors and suppliers facing crumbling revenue streams, but banks can find themselves struggling to facilitate faster B2B payments.

The subtitle was more insightful, and revealed the authors' intentions: \"market developments and potential financial stability implications.\" </p><p><br/>The report's premise is straightforward. The arrival of established technology giants, or Big Tech, on the financial scene could \"affect the degree of concentration and contestability in financial services, with both potential benefits and risks for financial stability.\" <br/>The focus is on companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Ant Financial, rather than the myriad fintech startups in Silicon Valley, Israel, or clustered round the Old Street roundabout in London. Central banks and finance ministries are beginning to ask whether the activities of the tech behemoths, whose market capitalisations now dwarf those of even the biggest banks, will be wholly benign. <br/>In a way, it might be thought surprising that the questions are being raised only now. Phrases like \"bolting stable doors\" come to mind. In Europe, regulatory changes like the Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) have been crucial in opening up the banking system, and regulators like the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority have for some time been running regulatory sandboxes to smooth the way for new entrants by helping them to structure themselves to comply with standards. PSD2, often described as \"open banking,\" requires banks to offer their customer data to non-bank providers of payment and account information services. Aggregators can then present the customer with an integrated view of their finances, and offer add-on services. <br/>Maybe the time to assess the financial-stability risks of open banking was in the consultation period before the directive was passed. Even now, the list of contributors to the FSB work shows that the European Commission, and the key regulators in Europe and North America, were not involved. <br/>So what did the FSB conclude? <br/>The authors begin, tactfully, with a series of bows to Big Tech. They say, correctly, that \"the greater efficiency of new players may enhance the efficiency of financial services in the longer term.\" Certainly, the absence of the cost drag of legacy IT systems and underused branch networks (which have been seen as a kind of public service and are therefore hard to rationalise) allow for cheaper digital delivery mechanisms which banks can only envy. It is also entirely fair to argue, as the authors do, that increased competition in the supply of financial services may benefit consumers by expanding choice, stimulating innovation, and driving down transaction costs. The pressure on traditional providers is generating strong incentives to reduce costs and improve service. Incumbents can no longer afford to sit back and allow inertia to be their friend, as they did in the past when account switching was rare. But the FSB also warns that cross-subsidisation may allow Big Tech firms to gain market share rapidly and knock out existing providers. As a result, \"their participation may not result in a more competitive market over the longer term.\"  <br/>That is a warning policymakers should heed. But the FSB is supposed to be primarily interested in stability. And here the report points in both directions at once. On one hand, the authors argue that greater competition can create a more resilient financial system, with a wider range of companies managing the essential plumbing. On the other hand, the ability of new entrants to undercut banks significantly could make the latter \"potentially more vulnerable to losses.\" The accompanying reduction in \"retained earnings as a source of internal capital,\" the report argues, \"could have an impact on financial sector resilience and risk-taking.\"  <br/>The reader is largely left to decide which of these two scenarios is most likely to play out. But while the report is unambiguously positive about the impact of fintech startups, whether they remain standalone entities, or join exiting banks to create complementary offerings, the authors' conclusions about Big Tech are far more nuanced. Whereas previous analyses have suggested that the financial-stability implications of fintech are either benign or small, the FSB believes that \"this could change quickly with deeper involvement of the large technology providers.\"  <br/>One possible route to financial instability identified in the report is that banks may loosen lending standards unwisely. I would assess that risk as low. Banks have been there before, in recent living memory, and are not keen to go back. But the threat to profitability is real, particularly if \"loss-leader\" pricing strategies are adopted, as the FSB believes is possible. They refer explicitly to the risk of cross-subsidisation. Banks in Europe are not much in favour with investors today, trading well below book value in most cases, and a significant loss of market share in payment services would threaten their viability further.<br/><br/>In response, the FSB, unsurprisingly, argues for \"vigilance\" on the part of banking supervisors. (When, one wonders, have supervisors been told that now is the time to turn a blind eye?). But I wonder if the answer lies with banking supervisors at all. Had a broader range of authorities contributed to the work, they might have more pertinently recommended vigilance by conduct and competition regulators, too.

He wrote about it in his new book, The Square and the Tower: Networks and Power, from the Freemasons to Facebook (January 2018).  <br/>Ferguson was recently interviewed on the subject of technology, societal power, and democracy:  <br/>Why are social networks and their use of emerging technologies threatening to power hierarchies in society?  <br/>Social networks are not something invented over the past two decades by Silicon Valley companies. They have always existed and are indeed one of the defining ways in which we, as a species, organize ourselves. All that has happened in our time is that technology\u2014personal computers, smartphones, and the internet\u2014 have combined to make social networks bigger and faster than ever before. There is a close analogy with the way that the printing press expanded and accelerated social networks in sixteenth-, seventeenth-, and eighteenth-century Europe, except that our revolution in networking has happened an order of magnitude faster.  <br/>Now, as then, established hierarchical structures\u2014 the papacy and Holy Roman Empire then; states, political parties, and established media companies now\u2014 face disruption. That is not necessarily a bad thing, but we should not delude ourselves that this disruption will be without its collateral damage. A good example is the way online social networks appear to be worsening political polarization in many democracies today.  <br/>How do power hierarchies flip technology to use for their advantage in stifling democracy?  <br/>Just seven or eight years ago, it seemed clear to Jared Cohen and Eric Schmidt (technology entrepreneurs) that the internet was on the side of democracy and would help topple authoritarian rulers. That seemed to be true during the (misnamed) Arab Spring. Then, we all underestimated the ability of undemocratic, or semi-democratic, regimes to adapt to the new technologies, and especially to find ways to exploiting network platforms.  <br/>Exhibit A has been the way the Chinese Communist Party has made it hard for US companies to flourish in China, encouraging domestic tech companies such as Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent, which are much readier to cooperate with the government\u2019s policies of social control. Exhibit B is the way the Russian government of Vladimir Putin has not only established state control over social as well as old media, but has also found ways to exploit the opportunities afford by Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter to destabilize the election process in the United States and elsewhere.  <br/>How does a symbiosis between networks and hierarchies lead to stable rule?  <br/>I am not sure it\u2019s as simple as your question implies. As I show in the book, there isn\u2019t really a clear dichotomy between networks and hierarchies: there\u2019s a continuum from very hierarchical or centralized networks to very distributed or decentralized networks. Neither of the extremes is desirable: one gives too much control to a single \u201cnode,\u201d the other runs the risk of anarchy.  <br/>So, successful institutions tend to be hybrids, combining some hierarchical structure with a measure of decentralization. In the international system, I point out the relative success of the pentarchy (the universal rule over all of Christendom by the heads of the five major episcopal sees of the Roman Empire) in the period 1815\u20131914. Yet that system was also sometimes called the \u2018concert of Europe.\u2019 Lesser powers were not powerless; they were just not as powerful as that particular \u2018big five.\u2019  <br/>What is your prognosis for the future of US and Western democracy, given the current tension between hierarchies and networks in our societies?  <br/>I remain an optimist. Despite all the alarms and excursions around the 2016 election, and the forebodings of those who believe the republic is in danger and democracy in a global \u201crecession,\u201d in truth the outlook remains brighter for democracies (provided they maintain the rule of law and a vital civil society) than for autocracies, or even illiberal democracies. The United States has survived worse than this; American society has been more deeply divided, and much more prone to political violence, than it is today. As for our most committed antagonists\u2014 Iran, North Korea, Russia\u2014 they are weak, and their repressive regimes are a reflection of that weakness. Even China may be running the risk of overconfidence these days.  <br/>A one-party state calls into being the biggest bourgeoisie in history at its peril! The societies most likely to strike the right balance between old hierarchies and new social networks will be the open societies, where appropriate regulation of big tech companies is more likely to be worked out than in closed societies.  <br/>In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:editorial@plusmediasolutions.com\">editorial@plusmediasolutions.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PROFFN-RLPMN615338920180222</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PROFFN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RPX-GNW1-DXCW-D4B2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"893\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Premium Official News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"511\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"02\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>February 22, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000DJLY</classCode><className>SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DL87</classCode><className>DEMOCRACIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DL5Q</classCode><className>TYPES OF GOVERNMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001346</classCode><className>POLITICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009TDQ</classCode><className>US POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N813940GM</classCode><className>POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N813400CC</classCode><className>CIVIC &amp;

There is a close analogy with the way that the printing press expanded and accelerated social networks in sixteenth-, seventeenth-, and eighteenth-century Europe, except that our revolution in networking has happened an order of magnitude faster.</p><p>Now, as then, established hierarchical structures the papacy and Holy Roman Empire then; states, political parties, and established media companies now face disruption. That is not necessarily a bad thing, but we should not delude ourselves that this disruption will be without its collateral damage. A good example is the way online social networks appear to be worsening political polarization in many democracies today.</p><p>How do power hierarchies flip technology to use for their advantage in stifling democracy?</p><p>Just seven or eight years ago, it seemed clear to <person><nameText>Jared Cohen </nameText></person>and Eric Schmidt (technology entrepreneurs) that the internet was on the side of democracy and would help topple authoritarian rulers. That seemed to be true during the (misnamed) Arab Spring. Then, we all underestimated the ability of undemocratic, or semi-democratic, regimes to adapt to the new technologies, and especially to find ways to exploiting network platforms.</p><p>Exhibit A has been the way the Chinese Communist Party has made it hard for US companies to flourish in China, encouraging domestic tech companies such as Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent, which are much readier to cooperate with the government's policies of social control. Exhibit B is the way the Russian government of Vladimir Putin has not only established state control over social as well as old media, but has also found ways to exploit the opportunities afford by Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter to destabilize the election process in the United States and elsewhere.</p><p>How does a symbiosis between networks and hierarchies lead to stable rule?</p><p>I am not sure it's as simple as your question implies. As I show in the book, there isn't really a clear dichotomy between networks and hierarchies: there's a continuum from very hierarchical or centralized networks to very distributed or decentralized networks. Neither of the extremes is desirable: one gives too much control to a single \"node,\" the other runs the risk of anarchy.</p><p>So, successful institutions tend to be hybrids, combining some hierarchical structure with a measure of decentralization. In the international system, I point out the relative success of the pentarchy (the universal rule over all of Christendom by the heads of the five major episcopal sees of the Roman Empire) in the period 18151914. Yet that system was also sometimes called the 'concert of Europe.' Lesser powers were not powerless; they were just not as powerful as that particular 'big five.'</p><p>What is your prognosis for the future of US and Western democracy, given the current tension between hierarchies and networks in our societies?</p><p>I remain an optimist. Despite all the alarms and excursions around the 2016 election, and the forebodings of those who believe the republic is in danger and democracy in a global \"recession,\" in truth the outlook remains brighter for democracies (provided they maintain the rule of law and a vital civil society) than for autocracies, or even illiberal democracies. The United States has survived worse than this; American society has been more deeply divided, and much more prone to political violence, than it is today. As for our most committed antagonists Iran, North Korea, Russia they are weak, and their repressive regimes are a reflection of that weakness. Even China may be running the risk of overconfidence these days.</p><p>A one-party state calls into being the biggest bourgeoisie in history at its peril! The societies most likely to strike the right balance between old hierarchies and new social networks will be the open societies, where appropriate regulation of big tech companies is more likely to be worked out than in closed societies.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1121914447</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RPJ-24P1-JCBF-S35S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"866\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"02\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>February 20, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

On one side are big tech companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple, as well as China's big three of Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent. Alongside them are the massively funded, heavily staffed global cyberpowers -- most notably the US, China and Russia -- who are seeking to monitor and control information flows online in the name of national security or political control.Both are intertwined. Sometimes intimately, as in China, where an Orwellian social credit system[1] is taking shape, and private companies are becoming indistinguishable [2]from the state's apparatus. </p><p>In the US, tech companies are now the biggest lobbyists and political donors in Washington[3], while in Russia there is a battle against the message app Telegram[4]. Together, these forces control the vast majority of information that flows online, either through data gathering, surveillance or censorship.There is an opposition: Small, often bare-budget operations run by hackers, nonprofit activists and volunteers. These open-source, decentralized projects and cooperative alternatives aim to protect user security and provide them greater control of their personal data. Some, like TOR or Signal, aim to encrypt and protect digital communication from the peering eyes of governments and corporations. Others, like Orchid, Dat or Blockchain-based protocols such as Ethereum want to return the web to it's initial, decentralized roots. Whether or not they get more people to adopt their alternatives could determine whether the years-long trend toward greater corporate and governmental[5] control of data will continue. At stake is nothing less than the future of the internet itself.\"We need to find a way to balance our own privacy and security and the data economy we have built,\" said Mark Surman, executive director at the Mozilla Foundation. \"We need to look at ways that both companies and governments are reigned in.\"Email, at its core, is simply a protocol to send messages directly from one server to another, without the need for a central system or governing authority. This was how the internet was designed. No matter what browser you're using, or what your operating system is, you can access websites, mailing lists, message boards anywhere due to the use of standard protocols.Today, nearly everyone relies on the same few platforms. Some, like Amazon Web Services, host an increasing amount of websites. Others, like Google's search or Facebook's news feed, are how we find or discover news, or videos. Together, these few big companies now control much of the flow of traffic online.\"Once you're on Facebook or on Instagram, you're locked in, and you're locked in because all your friends are there,\" Surman said. \"We don't have choice.\"Now, the internet is primarily used to access platforms like Google, Facebook, Twitter, and others. This is why researchers have found that in parts of Southeast Asia, people regularly confuse Facebook for the internet itself[6]. \"Unfortunately today the internet is being used as a transport layer for people to build walled garden communication networks,\" said Daniel Kahn Gillmor, senior staff technologist for the speech, privacy, and technology project at the American Civil Liberties Union.Of the more three billion people online globally, two billion of them are on Facebook, with much of the remainder likely behind China's Great Firewall. In fact, in China, apps like Tencent's WeChat[7] dominate not just messaging and social media, but payments, transportation and, in 27 cities, municipal services such as paying electricity bills or traffic fines. Soon, Chinese residents might need WeChat to travel[8].Governments are scaling up too, with the US Army's Cyber Command now including over 19,000 soldiers and civilians. And one can only guess at the size of what might be the biggest operation of them all, China's opaque censorship, security, and online surveillance behemoth, estimated to have at minimum 50,000 staff dedicated to monitoring and controlling the world's largest internet and mobile market.The revelations of government spying by Edward Snowden was the impetus for some of the first generation of privacy apps and protocols to expand. One of the most successful is the TOR Project, a free, open source browser and apps that allows for anonymous browsing and communication and has two million daily users. Lately, there has been a new wave of privacy concerns, stemming from fake, viral news[9], state-sponsored hacking during the 2016 US Presidential election, and, more recently, the Cambridge Analytica scandal[10], in which the firm used Facebook to harvest data from 50 million profiles to do massive data-based psychological targeting.Yet the scale of these alternative projects is quite small. Mozilla, one of the largest non-profit foundations in this space, has a budget of just over $400 million. The TOR project has a total of 35 staff, while Qubes, a secure operating system used by Snowden, has just a dozen core members. Most of these projects count a large number of dedicated volunteers and open source contributors, and are almost always in need of more financial and human resources. In contrast, Google now employs 85,000 staff around the world, while Facebook has 27,000, and the combined market value of the two companies is an astounding $1.27 trillion.Considering the scale, it may too much to expect real alternatives to the dominant technology platforms. The incentives and competitive dynamics of the digital economy might be broken. Snowden's 2013 revelations[11] were a big media story, but in the end had little impact on the bottom lines of the companies mentioned as part of Prism[12] including Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Apple, all of which are bigger today than they were five years ago. Similarly, Facebook saw a rapid drop in it's stock prices right after the New York Times and others broke the story about Cambridge Analytica[13], but it's recovered back to near its all-time highs. Their most recent quarterly figures [14]showed no drop in user numbers either.\"They have not been hit too hard by this massive misuse of user data, and that's troubling because it means that users are so trapped into using Facebook even a massive scandal does not really change their behavior,\" said Nathan Schneider, a professor of media studies at University of Colorado Boulder. \"That is a very disturbing level of monopoly type power.\"Google dominates email, search, maps, and has an even more sophisticated data gathering operation today than 2014. Facebook is selling even more highly personalized ads based on the data they gather about us -- data that is, as many are finding, incredibly personal[15]. Together, the two control an estimated 67 percent of all digital advertising revenue[16], and are capturing an even higher percentage of yearly growth. All of it is dependent on centralization and control of data.\"The way the advertising business works today is the surveillance economy ... their bread is buttered by building detailed dossiers on individuals and on communities so they can do predictive behavioral analytics of individual,\" said Gillmor.Open source projects have spurred action among consumers too, such as the rapid growth in use of ad-blocking plugins[17]. They also occasionally force the giants to take a pro-privacy move, such as Facebook's decision to allow its messaging app, Whatsapp, to have industry-standard end-to-end encryption.Still, it has not been enough. Take, for example, open source. Even though the dominant web server software is open source Apach[18]e, and 59 percent of websites run on the open-source Wordpress content management system software, this hasn't prevented centralization or control of data by Google, Facebook and others. A more clear example of this failure is the world's most popular mobile OS -- Android.\"Android is built on Linux, and is a key piece of open-source software, but also the most powerful tool for corporate surveillance ever invented,\" said Schneider. \"This intellectual property hack has been very amenable to the needs of very centralizing, profit seeking enterprises.\"The growing decentralization movement, which seeks to take the web back to its initial roots, may not be enough either. Email is still technically a decentralized protocol but most of us depends on tools from just a few companies - Google's Gmail, Microsoft's Outlook - to access it. \"Android is built on Linux, and is a key piece of open-source software, but also the most powerful tool for corporate surveillance ever invented.\" Another idea that has been gaining attention is platform cooperatives[19] - user owned, democratically run alternatives. One of the most successful early stage platform co-ops is Resonate[20], a music streaming service that aims to provide an alternative to Spotify, the dominant player in the field and one that is notorious for it's low payments to artists[21]. Resonate would be partially owned by listeners, musicians, and labels, all of whom would have voting rights, and have an ethical, open formula for distributing revenues to musicians. They recently raised $1 million dollars[22] and are quickly approaching a full launch.\"Once we get through that process of really getting things much more stable and user-friendly, then we'll be able to go after more aggressive marketing campaigns and promotional activities and grow the community,\" said Peter Harris, the founder of Resonate.It will be a challenge. Resonate remains a niche player and lacks access to the huge catalog of songs that Spotify has. In essence, this is another variation of the same network effect that keeps users trapped on Facebook or Instagram.One possible conclusion is that governments and other regulatory authorities need to treat digital platforms as monopolies.\"If there isn't enough meaningful market competition to hold these companies accountable, there may be need for antitrust, which is increasingly being talked about,\" said Schneider.The obvious tool -- breaking up a company, as the US did in the 1980s to tackle the Bell monopoly[23], would have to be altered for the uniqueness of the digital space. Companies now operate across borders, and provide a diverse range of digital services that an increasing percentage of the global economy depends on.\"If governments are going to step in and play a regulatory role, we need to really make sure they do it creatively, in a way that focuses on the core principles of the internet -- open APIs, interoperability -- rather than more traditional things like breaking up companies,\" said Surman.Open APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), are protocols or tools that allow apps and internet-based applications to communicate. If designed properly, they could allow various social network alternatives to Facebook to connect with each other, reducing the impact of any network effects that force users to stick to one platform because all their friends and contacts are there. Government action could also force some form of user ownership or control of platforms, shifting the economic model into one that is more cooperative.\"If a company can demonstrate that it can meaningfully self-govern itself, that can be a way of escaping more drastic regulatory oversight,\" said Schneider. And privacy could be one way competing platforms could stand out. Imagine the impact of the Cambridge Analytica scandal if Facebook users had an an alternative platforms they could quickly switch to while still being able to communicate with their friends. In that world, the impact on companies who violate privacy could be big enough to actually change industry practices.It remains a question, however, if governments will act. The US has not broken up a monopoly in decades and the current administration has shown no appetite for a shift. Some pin their hopes on Europe, which, through the implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation[24] could give regulators their the power to hold companies that violate user-privacy accountable, though it only went into force in late May. \"Unless we can actually open up competition it's really impossible to imagine new products breaking into the market.\" There is likely no single solution. That is why Mozilla takes a three-pronged approach -- working to build alternatives, like the Firefox browser, running advocacy campaigns on key issues such as encryption, while also lobbying for better digital policy.\"Unless we can actually open up competition it's really impossible to imagine new products breaking into the market,\" said Surman. \"But unless new products break into the market, regulations aren't going to matter, and if consumers don't say what they want ... you're not going to have a better internet.\"The battle for the future of the internet is likely a battle without an end. Technology is ever-evolving, as is privacy, security, and our expectations of it. As long as corporations control the internet and rely on a economic model that profits from user data, is it likely that we will keep seeing the same battles between individual privacy and control of data for years, if not decades, to come.\"There is no end game for the internet, no final destination,\" said Camille Fassett, a reporter with the non-profit Freedom of the Press Foundation. \"I cannot imagine there will ever be a time at which the internet will become 'secure', when we can stop thinking about and actively pushing for security and privacy.\" This article originally appeared

This means that Opera users can carry out Bitcoin transactions directly in the browser without requiring any extensions or following any other complex processes. The Norwegian company first teased a crypto wallet for its Android app last July[1] in private beta, before launching it to the public in December[2] \u2014 this made it the first of the major browsers to support cryptocurrencies natively. </p><p>Opera later expanded support to Opera on the desktop app[3] and on iPhone[4]. Up until now, Opera's crypto wallet has only supported Ethereum[5], a lower-profile Bitcoin alternative, but back in July the company announced plans[6] to support both Bitcoin and the Tron[7] cryptocurrency and blockchain. So far they have been available in beta, and with today's news, both crypto networks are now officially supported in the main Opera Android app. Above: Opera Crypto Wallet This launch follows a growing trend that has seen the blockchain increasingly embraced by big tech companies \u2014 earlier this week, HTC launched the Exodus 1s[8] blockchain smartphone, which also comes bundled with Opera. Facebook too is making moves in the cryptocurrency sphere with Libra[9], though global regulatory scrutiny has led many of its initial partners to jump ship[10] ahead of the planned 2020 launch. As the original blockchain and cryptocurrency poster child, Bitcoin is a notable addition to Opera's cypto wallet. With some 350 million users across all platforms, Opera's move potentially opens up the world's most popular cryptocurrency[11] to the global masses simply by making it more accessible. 'With this release, Opera opens its crypto wallet to the world's most popular blockchain, making it possible to send and receive BTC directly from the browser the way one would an image or a music file,' the company wrotein a blog post. 'This means anyone can now not only send Bitcoin and Ethereum to another person, but can also use it while interacting with websites to pay for goods or services.' It's worth noting here that while Opera has limited its Bitcoin expansion to Android for now, we can likely expect support to land on other Opera platforms in the future \u2014 its recent launch history has shown that it usually starts with Android, followed by desktop, and then iOS.

One of the first colonial newspapers, the New England Courant, published by James Franklin, Benjamin Franklin's brother, was notorious for articles that would border on libel by today's standards. Brother Ben was so fearful of retribution from those he attacked in his articles that he published under the pseudonym Silence Dogood.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In its infancy, American journalism was written in a fictional, novelistic style that was much preferred by readers over presumably boring objective reporting. It was only as a result of the expense of sending lengthy stories over the telegraph wires that newspapers were forced into a much more abbreviated format confined to just the basics.</p><p> The term Yellow Journalism, named after the New York Journal's comic strip The Yellow Kid, was coined in the late nineteenth century to describe William Randolph Hearst's sensational style of newspaper reporting that tended to reflect his political and social views at the expense of facts and objectivity. Hearst, an ultra conservative, also forbade the use of the word \"socialism\" in any of his newspapers.</p><p> The New York Times, which was founded in 1851, started out much less balanced than it is today, but it gradually abandoned its commitment to conservatism, and by the turn of the century the newspaper had been bought by Adolph Ochs, who created a much more objective journalism format. Ochs gave the NY Times its imprimatur All The News That's Fit To Print, a mantra which was intended to compete with Joseph Pulitzer's New York World and Hearst's New York Journal, the two newspapers of the day noted for their lurid, sensationalist and inaccurate reporting of facts and opinions. The mantra remains the New York Times' guiding principle today.</p><p> In short, objectivity is not bred into the bones of American journalism or for that matter into the American public. The late Roger Ailes exploited this fault line when he created Fox News; and NBC then created MSNBC as a counter balance to Fox News. In both cases, news and opinion have become virtually indistinguishable from one another, thus putting a greater burden on the viewer to get at the facts.</p><p> The internet too has taken objectivity, or lack thereof, to a whole new level, especially since anyone with a computer these days can express his or her views. As a result, fringe groups that used to be cultural outliers are now pseudo-respected members of the national dialogue. The myriad blogs promoting white supremacy are a prime example. Add to this the recent stories about the Russian government running online ads aimed at American voters during election cycles and you get the sense that the internet has become the wild west of information dissemination.</p><p> Perhaps a more insidious force is the use of algorithms to shape the news and other internet content we see. The key to this process is the harvesting of personal data by various commercial enterprises who then use it, or sell it to a third party, to determine your likes and dislikes.</p><p> Initially algorithms were created to enable advertisers to more effectively target their ads, but as time passed, algorithms were developed by those with political agendas to target and sway voters, to, in essence, create echo chambers where the same or similar messages end up on the target's computer.</p><p> Journalist Franklin Foer's recently published book, World Without Mind: The Existential Threat of Big Tech makes the case that indeed our minds are actually being controlled to a degree by algorithms created by companies such as Facebook and Google. These algorithms filter out information we wouldn't be interested in, or in the case of political advertisers, information they don't want us to be interested in that contradicts their message.</p><p> What's an objective person to do?</p><p> A good beginning is to step outside our comfort zone and visit news sites and blogs we would not normally visit, if for no other reason than to understand the subtle ways in which the content and ads on those sites are different from sites and blogs we normally visit. Go to Breitbart and NPR sites to see the ads that appear there.</p><p> If there is a profusion of get-rich-quick, hair replacement or lose-20-pounds-overnight ads, then the algorithm creators have determined that people who frequent those sites are more gullible than those who frequent sites that do not have those types of ads.</p><p> Another constructive exercise is to open the Facebook ad creation program (it's free up until the time you actually place an ad,) and go through the process of identifying the demographics for targeting an audience. To understand how basic profiling works, go to a site that sells a product you might be interested in and see how long it takes for ads for that product to begin appearing on your screen.</p><p> The EU recently enacted General Data Protection Regulations, which will go into effect in 2018. The goal of the legislation is to regulate the ways in which firms, such as Google and Facebook, can use personal information harvested from the internet in Europe for commercial purposes.</p><p> When fully in force, the new regulations will require these organizations to reveal what data they hold, how it is being used and how long it is being kept. In general, European countries have always been stricter in preventing the kinds of false or dubious claims made by American advertisers and in particular claims made by political parties against their opposition.</p><p> With any luck our legislators will see the moral imperative of these types of regulations and implement them in this country, in particular those that have an impact on how we vote.</p><p>     -Michael Weymouth lives at 29 Water St., Hingham and is a regular columnist.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKMA-2763657</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28984CA074FF72 NWBKMA2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PJ3-88K1-JBCN-44P5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399550</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"957\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Norwell Mariner<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

One of the first colonial newspapers, the New England Courant, published by James Franklin, Benjamin Franklin's brother, was notorious for articles that would border on libel by today's standards. Brother Ben was so fearful of retribution from those he attacked in his articles that he published under the pseudonym Silence Dogood.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In its infancy, American journalism was written in a fictional, novelistic style that was much preferred by readers over presumably boring objective reporting. It was only as a result of the expense of sending lengthy stories over the telegraph wires that newspapers were forced into a much more abbreviated format confined to just the basics.</p><p> The term Yellow Journalism, named after the New York Journal's comic strip The Yellow Kid, was coined in the late nineteenth century to describe William Randolph Hearst's sensational style of newspaper reporting that tended to reflect his political and social views at the expense of facts and objectivity. Hearst, an ultra conservative, also forbade the use of the word \"socialism\" in any of his newspapers.</p><p> The New York Times, which was founded in 1851, started out much less balanced than it is today, but it gradually abandoned its commitment to conservatism, and by the turn of the century the newspaper had been bought by Adolph Ochs, who created a much more objective journalism format. Ochs gave the NY Times its imprimatur All The News That's Fit To Print, a mantra which was intended to compete with Joseph Pulitzer's New York World and Hearst's New York Journal, the two newspapers of the day noted for their lurid, sensationalist and inaccurate reporting of facts and opinions. The mantra remains the New York Times' guiding principle today.</p><p> In short, objectivity is not bred into the bones of American journalism or for that matter into the American public. The late Roger Ailes exploited this fault line when he created Fox News; and NBC then created MSNBC as a counter balance to Fox News. In both cases, news and opinion have become virtually indistinguishable from one another, thus putting a greater burden on the viewer to get at the facts.</p><p> The internet too has taken objectivity, or lack thereof, to a whole new level, especially since anyone with a computer these days can express his or her views. As a result, fringe groups that used to be cultural outliers are now pseudo-respected members of the national dialogue. The myriad blogs promoting white supremacy are a prime example. Add to this the recent stories about the Russian government running online ads aimed at American voters during election cycles and you get the sense that the internet has become the wild west of information dissemination.</p><p> Perhaps a more insidious force is the use of algorithms to shape the news and other internet content we see. The key to this process is the harvesting of personal data by various commercial enterprises who then use it, or sell it to a third party, to determine your likes and dislikes.</p><p> Initially algorithms were created to enable advertisers to more effectively target their ads, but as time passed, algorithms were developed by those with political agendas to target and sway voters, to, in essence, create echo chambers where the same or similar messages end up on the target's computer.</p><p> Journalist Franklin Foer's recently published book, World Without Mind: The Existential Threat of Big Tech makes the case that indeed our minds are actually being controlled to a degree by algorithms created by companies such as Facebook and Google. These algorithms filter out information we wouldn't be interested in, or in the case of political advertisers, information they don't want us to be interested in that contradicts their message.</p><p> What's an objective person to do?</p><p> A good beginning is to step outside our comfort zone and visit news sites and blogs we would not normally visit, if for no other reason than to understand the subtle ways in which the content and ads on those sites are different from sites and blogs we normally visit. Go to Breitbart and NPR sites to see the ads that appear there.</p><p> If there is a profusion of get-rich-quick, hair replacement or lose-20-pounds-overnight ads, then the algorithm creators have determined that people who frequent those sites are more gullible than those who frequent sites that do not have those types of ads.</p><p> Another constructive exercise is to open the Facebook ad creation program (it's free up until the time you actually place an ad,) and go through the process of identifying the demographics for targeting an audience. To understand how basic profiling works, go to a site that sells a product you might be interested in and see how long it takes for ads for that product to begin appearing on your screen.</p><p> The EU recently enacted General Data Protection Regulations, which will go into effect in 2018. The goal of the legislation is to regulate the ways in which firms, such as Google and Facebook, can use personal information harvested from the internet in Europe for commercial purposes.</p><p> When fully in force, the new regulations will require these organizations to reveal what data they hold, how it is being used and how long it is being kept. In general, European countries have always been stricter in preventing the kinds of false or dubious claims made by American advertisers and in particular claims made by political parties against their opposition.</p><p> With any luck our legislators will see the moral imperative of these types of regulations and implement them in this country, in particular those that have an impact on how we vote.</p><p>     Michael Weymouth lives at 29 Water St., Hingham and is a regular columnist.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKMA-2763656</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28981B1BC7B710 NWBKMA2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PJ3-88K1-JBCN-44MF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399550</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"957\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Hingham Journal<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

In May 2018, perhaps reflecting the position it finds itself in, Google relegated its pledge \u2018don\u2019t be evil\u2019 from the beginning of its code of conduct to a final aside.  Watching the fate of its counterparts such as Facebook, who been hauled before regulators and managed nervy investors as a result, business leaders outside of the industry would be excused for feeling lucky about not being involved.  But it would be a mistake to think they do not share responsibility for social media malpractice. </p><p>After all, the business practices of technology giants are part-funded by adverts for other businesses. To be blunt, probably your business. As companies take the opportunity to get to know customers better, and to target them online with laser-like precision, we all need to accept our responsibility for engaging with, and benefiting from, the digital advertising industry.  Admittedly, there has been a growing chorus of discontent about fake views, inappropriate advert placement and other examples of digital advertising representing poor value for money. But business leaders must not limit themselves to an economic debate. We need to accept that investment in digital technology has created an ecosystem that exploits individuals\u2019 data. This data has usually been given up unwittingly, and sometimes even unwillingly, through having to comply with \u2018all-or-nothing\u2019 terms and conditions. YOU MAY BE INVOLVED IN CONTROVERSIAL ONLINE ACTIVITY  How much information a business seeks, what it does with it and how it chooses to manage the manipulation of people\u2019s emotions and opinions, are important ethical considerations.  This isn\u2019t a new problem in advertising, but the stakes have never been higher. The ability to reach large audiences using a plethora of messaging that doesn\u2019t need to pass through any regulatory control invites risk-taking that can quickly destroy reputations.  While GDPR may restrict direct access to unconsenting consumers, practices that remain concerning include: online polls that deliberately skew sentiment; the use of social influencers to promote content without a clear indication that they are accepting payment; and the proliferation of fake reviews.  As a result, businesses should incorporate ethical standards into their online activity. QUESTIONS TO ASK ABOUT DIGITAL ETHICS  Here are five simple questions that business leaders can ask their digital teams in order to improve their ethics:      How much human judgement is involved in the decisions about what you do with customers\u2019 data?     Beyond basic legal standards, what additional controls do you have in place to manage segmented, or even personalised, marketing messages that are sent out in the company\u2019s name?     What are the commercial and reputational risks if your use of data were to be exposed to customers?     If your customers could see all your different forms of digital messaging at once would that concern you?     How much control do you hand over to your customers to shape their engagement with you?  These are not easy questions. But without seeking to answer them and recognising the role of your business in the larger ecosystem of digital marketing, then you are accepting the high probability that someone may accuse your business of \u2018doing evil\u2019.

For the United States, the inverse is true. That\u2019s bad news for anyone hoping for a full regulatory reckoning with Silicon Valley\u2019s and Seattle\u2019s giants over their monopolistic tendencies....</p><p>Europe has the motivation, but not the means, to break up Big Tech. For the United States, the inverse is true. That\u2019s bad news for anyone hoping for a full regulatory reckoning with Silicon Valley\u2019s and Seattle\u2019s giants over their monopolistic tendencies.    Washington lawmakers see their job as protecting the consumer first and foremost, while Brussels wants to make sure other companies are allowed to compete with the incumbents. Sadly for Europe, the Americans have all the power but their approach is unlikely to produce radical change (as my Opinion colleague Tara Lachapelle wrote this week).    That isn\u2019t to say the European Union is wasting its time in leading the charge against Big Tech. Congress\u2019s grilling last week of the chief executives of Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Google parent Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc showed that the \"Brussels Effect\u201d is in full force. The European Union plays an outsized role when it comes to regulation because other regions \u2013 even the Americans \u2013 tend to follow its lead. Up to a point, at least.    As US lawmakers made the case against the West Coast giants, time and again their arguments echoed efforts already well underway in Europe. When the Democratic Representative David Cicilline tackled the way Google displays news snippets in search results without reimbursing the publishers, he evoked new copyright laws proposed by the European Union last year.    For two years Brussels has been looking at whether Amazon uses its marketplace data to compete unfairly with the sellers on its website; that\u2019s now a hot topic on Capitol Hill too. The market power of Apple\u2019s App Store and of virtual assistants such as Siri and Alexa, both of which are the subject of new EU investigations, were also on Congress\u2019s agenda.    When people ask Margrethe Vestager and other European trustbusters what power they really have to moderate the behaviour of trillion dollar US companies, this is often their answer: When Brussels uncovers bad corporate behaviour, it lays out a road map for Washington DC to follow.    Tackling companies with combined annual revenue of US$782bil (RM3.28tril), more than the gross domestic product of Switzerland, is a huge challenge, meaning competition authorities benefit from the work that\u2019s already been done elsewhere. Even the British Competition and Markets Authority\u2019s study of the digital-advertising market got a shout out from Rep. Pramila Jayapal, who cited the agency\u2019s findings on Google\u2019s dominant market share.    The European Commission does have the legal authority to try to break companies up, but no one thinks it would ever try this on a US company. The political blowback would be too severe. The Americans could themselves seek breakups, and would have the power to do so, but their antitrust regime has different priorities. While the problems \u2013 and the levels of exasperation at the cavalier behaviour of the companies \u2013 might be the same, the types of punishment that lawmakers have in mind are different, according to Nicolas Petit, the joint chair in competition law at the European University Institute.    That\u2019s because American antitrust law focuses on the interests of the consumer \u2013 primarily around pricing \u2013 while Europe considers the broader market dynamics and effect on competition. While Vestager probably wants to foster the creation of a company that could counterbalance Google and Facebook\u2019s might in search and social media, her US peers only worry if the impact of their dominance is detrimental to consumers.    That narrower American focus limits the likelihood of far-reaching action, says Tommaso Valletti, the head of Imperial College London\u2019s Department of Economics and Public Policy, and a former chief competition economist at the European Commission. \"The US has, de facto, abdicated any enforcement for 20 years in this area,\u201d he told me.    In her submission to the House of Representatives\u2019 antitrust subcommittee, Vestager called for \"common\u201d policy responses, according to a document obtained by the website Euractiv. It\u2019s an admirable goal and should be the logical conclusion of investigations tackling many of the same topics. It\u2019s also a pipe dream.

On Aug 19, just two years after becoming the first US company to boast a trillion-dollar market valuation, it became the first to top US$2 trillion (RM8.35 trillion). Getting to the next trillion may not be such a breeze.    With its shares up roughly 60% this year, Apple is among the Big Tech winners that have benefited from a \"safety premium\u201d. Investors have piled in to the iPhone maker\u2019s shares as well as those of other technology darlings \u2013 including Amazon.com Inc, Facebook Inc and Google parent Alphabet Inc \u2013 betting their business models, robust balance sheets and large cash balances would make them more resilient amid the economic fallout from the global Covid-19 pandemic.    Indeed, Apple did post impressive June quarter financial results last month on the back of strong sales, a perfectly timed lower-cost iPhone launch and a boost from government stimulus. But it faces a more uncertain road ahead. First, Apple\u2019s valuation now embeds elevated future expectations. To illustrate, Wall Street\u2019s current consensus for Apple\u2019s fiscal 2020 sales ending this September is just 3% higher than its revenue two years ago. And yet, the stock price has more than doubled in that time frame, resulting in a heady valuation of about 33 times the next four quarters\u2019 earnings.    Apple\u2019s lofty valuation leaves little room for disappointment, but the success of its upcoming slate of products isn\u2019t a sure thing. In contrast to the cheaper iPhone SE model that boosted its June quarter, the company is going to have to convince consumers to buy higher-priced US$1,000 (RM4,174.30) iPhones when it launches new 5G-enabled models this fall. And these more expensive phones may be a tough proposition with tens of millions of Americans facing job insecurity. Further, I\u2019m still skeptical there will be new apps anytime soon that will need the faster fifth-generation wireless speeds, making phone upgrades less compelling. Finally, according to a Bloomberg News report last week, it doesn\u2019t look like there will be much innovation coming from Apple on the services front either \u2013 just a new virtual fitness-class subscription and some modest subscription bundles.    On top of all this, Apple is facing increased regulatory scrutiny over its dominant position in the smartphone market. In June, the European Union announced it had opened two formal antitrust investigations into Apple, with one of the probes specifically looking into the requirement guidelines of its in-app purchase system. Last month, CEO Tim Cook also had to defend the company\u2019s App Store policies and high fee structure before a landmark House antitrust hearing as well. Obviously, if either of these global regulators clamp down on Apple\u2019s business practices, it could negatively impact its profitability. There is no doubt Apple\u2019s stunning ascent to US$2 trillion is impressive. The climb to US$3 trillion (RM12.52 trillion) may be even more so, because it will be that much harder.

That they did so virtually, through technology that some of them helped create, was perhaps an ironic coincidence. Google's Sundar Pichai, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Apple's Tim Cook and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg represented Big Tech, and their companies were worth a total of about $5 trillion, the size of Japan's economy. While members of Congress were masked, the Tech Titans seemed to wear masks of contrition.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Just a few years back, these men (and they are almost always men) could do no wrong. They were the new idols, creators of new technologies and untold wealth. Their companies and campuses were the new wonders of the world, and it was the tools they were building that would enrich our lives and save our planet; even take us to other planets.</p><p>A few years later, while a large part of the adulation remains, their sheen is rapidly wearing off. Google is accused of monopolizing all of search globally, stifling competition as well as small merchants, and suffocating publishers. Amazon is seen as an apex predator, monopolizing e-commerce and driving small retailers into the ground. Apple makes most of the devices Americans use, and is a single, monopolistic gateway to the apps that power them. Facebook is perhaps the most reviled-for allegedly fuelling hate speech, ruining newspapers, swallowing startups that threaten it, and even swinging the US elections and the UK Brexit vote.</p><p>There are many reasons for this tech-lash. Monopoly power is one of them. The US antitrust laws were created more than a century ago to break the oil and steel monopolies Esso and US Steel. The basic idea of those laws was to keep producers from using their monopoly power to jack up consumer prices. This is where US regulators ran into a conceptual difficulty with tech giants. Their products were either free, or (in the case of Amazon) extremely cheap, and therefore presumably serving consumers well. The other reason for the backlash has been the use, or misuse, of data-the fact that many of these companies are making money off the free information we voluntarily give them. This data is sliced, diced, massaged and sold to advertisers for gobs of money, with the consumer getting nothing. This is the primarily business model of Google and Facebook, and its dangers were highlighted starkly by the Cambridge Analytica scandal; this firm had used the Facebook data of millions of Americans to influence the 2016 presidential polls. Then, there is also the onslaught of fake news, the amplification of hate speech, and the concentration of unimaginable wealth in the hands of a few. While the companies are still hugely admired, a citizen backlash has only just begun. And, predictably, politicians and regulators have started taking note.</p><p>The EU was first off the block with its General Data Protection Regulations, which prioritized consumer privacy. In the US, in response to a clamour to break Big Tech up, members of its antitrust subcommittee realized that while these firms might not raise user prices, their practices could lower the quality of products (on privacy, for example). Facebook and Twitter have been forced to hire thousands of people to weed out the hate spewed on their networks. Amazon is under scrutiny across the world, including India, for being anti-competitive to small traders. \"Facebook suicide\", or getting off the network, has become common among people who do not want to be chased across the virtual world by marketers and spammers.</p><p>These companies started as forces for good, created by idealistic founders who wanted to change the world for the better. Google promised never \"to be evil\", Zuckerberg wanted to connect people across the world, Jeff Bezos wanted to deliver stuff at low prices. Along the way, they grew big, and needed ever more money to fuel their ambitions. All of them went public, investors clamoured for stratospheric growth every quarter to maintain their insane valuations, and idealism gave way to capitalism. Creating cool technology took second place to ratcheting up the financial rewards for investors, employees and themselves, it seems.</p><p>I do believe, however, that these companies are smart enough to learn from this impasse and transform themselves. They do not have far to look. Just two decades ago, one of them was accused of monopoly, fought the battle, changed itself, and emerged ever stronger. It is still highly valued today, far better respected, and was not a part of the $5 trillion that beamed into the US Congress last week. That company is called Microsoft.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from MINT.

Such is the scale of the digital revolution: Decisions made by an alarmingly small number of people on the U.S.</p><p>West Coast have global implications.</p><p>Companies such as Google, Facebook, and Apple have userbases in the billions. Not only is this historically unprecedented, it's also more people than live in any single country. This - along with Big Tech's sheer scale, with profits in the billions and with margins dwarfing similarly sized companies - gives them incredible power, which has collided with politics as we understand it, and democratic life itself.</p><p>That has been further exacerbated by its impetuous \"break things\" culture: It has expanded its lobbying efforts to influence and guide policy, to the extent that some critics feel they've exceeded the definition of traditional lobbying, and now have political jurisdictions at their mercy.</p><p>Consider the past 12 months alone. Amazon's highly public, reality-show-style process to select a new site for a second headquarters prompted cities across North America to prostrate themselves at its feet. Mayors humiliated themselves with Pollyanna boasts about their cities' benefits, as they cajoled Amazon with big tax breaks and incentives. When the company finally chose to build the headquarters in Virginia and Queens, N.Y., the latter deal faced an uprising from the neighbourhood, and Amazon simply took its ball and left, leaving the city and state's politicians bereft.</p><p>This is part of a trend: As reported in The New York Times, Amazon has applied its huge weight to jurisdictions across the United States, getting its way by threatening to pull up stakes and take jobs with them. South Carolina, Texas and even Seattle have eventually caved to Amazon's demands to avoid sales taxes in exchange for opening or maintaining facilities in those areas.</p><p>If Amazon wields jobs as a kind of cudgel, Facebook's influence is less concrete. Its role as a kind of communication infrastructure means it is less directly responsible for the economic welfare of a given place than part of its social health.</p><p>The manner in which the company plays home to discourse of all sorts makes it an arena for connection, but also a place for political subterfuge, anti-vaccine or conspiracy theories, and bigotry of all shades. The social network has played a role in violence in Myanmar, and in communal tensions in India through its WhatsApp messaging service. But while a 2018 post-Cambridge Analytica reckoning made the spectre of socialmedia regulation and privacy enforcement a real threat, The Guardian revealed the company has lobbied extensively (and effectively) to pre-empt this, using data centres as a lure in places such as Malaysia and Canada. Mr. Zuckerberg may be earnest about his desire for a new approach for Facebook, but the reported actions of his company should make us skeptical about its motives.</p><p>A concentration of powerful companies is nothing new. The idea of petro-states is firmly in our political-science lexicon, and multinational companies in industries such as aerospace, pharma and telecom have long lobbied governments for sweetheart deals. But with Big Tech, the scale is far vaster, and the sociological impacts far deeper. So is it time to worry about not just a so-called technostate, but a tech supra-state, where companies supersede the state altogether?</p><p>Tech is not merely a business sector, but an increasingly powerful player in the way in which states are run, organized and experienced by citizens.</p><p>Beyond Facebook and Amazon, there is of course Alphabet, the parent company of Google, which is currently embroiled in a bitter public-relations war with activists who oppose a project by its subsidiary Sidewalk Labs to redevelop Toronto's Quayside neighbourhood. Sidewalk Labs is being accused not simply of using the project as a data-mining operation, but also as a Trojan horse to have private companies become part and parcel of modern urban development, sharing a percentage of taxes and other revenue as it also profits from the running of a city.</p><p>We are faced with a remarkable situation in which a conglomeration of private companies both own a significant part of modern social infrastructure, but are also lobbying to extend that power into other spheres: urbanism, education, governance and more. Tech has already placed new demands on state infrastructure itself. At its peak, cryptocurrency consumed an enormous amount of power, almost as much as the entire country of Ireland. Autonomous cars will force cities to adapt their design, while the advent of artificial intelligence, quantum computing, gene editing and other technologies all pose enormous challenges - and each will come with its own army of well-funded lobbyists, pockets full of Silicon Valley cash and with the best interests of societies not necessarily at the forefront of their minds.</p><p>In one way, of course, these changes are just part of how technology and societies typically adapt through what people feel, in the moment, are extraordinary times. Electricity, for example, went from a revolutionary private concern in which individual factories produced their own power, to more centralized, nationalized systems.</p><p>But if these are indeed extraordinary times, then they at least require similarly expansive, novel thinking. One such shift: It is necessary to understand tech's influence as far more sociocultural than it is material. The shift to digital has produced an array of new forms of culture, not just new forms of technology. The production of a public self through social networking, or persistent forms of connection, or new modes or formats of media - these are all akin to the changes wrought by the printing press, an invention that influenced far more than merely the distribution of information.</p><p>The question that lies ahead of us now: Since these changes are occurring, for whom and to whose benefit will they be directed? Modernity has, since its inception, been a back-and-forth between the needs of capital and those of the state. It was the amassing of vast amounts of wealth through colonialism that first posed a threat to Europe's monarchical tradition, leading to the rise of mercantilism and then capitalism. In subsequent centuries, similar patterns emerged: When power invariably consolidated around large, private stores of wealth or power, whether the Rockefellers or big telecom, the state would react in kind through regulation or nationalization.</p><p>But as we go through one of those pendulum swings again, a weakened state threatens the typical process. Successive U.S.</p><p>governments have been reluctant to regulate digital companies for fear of stifling innovation, and both the Trump administration and FCC chair Ajit Pai are strident free-market boosters. That attitude is historical, part of a post-Reaganite shift toward neoliberalism that sees markets as both self-correcting and inherently good.</p><p>But a laissez-faire reliance on the wisdom of markets seems, in this instance, naive. Facebook's plan to sell itself as a privacy-focused company, for example, was potentially an act of subterfuge.</p><p>In adding encrypted, private messaging to its repertoire, while also merging its WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger platforms, it has potentially headed off regulators who might seek to break the company apart or encourage citizens to consider some public or state-led role in digital social infrastructure. It would be a classic Facebook move: publicly state that it is doing something in the interest of its users, while carefully cementing its position as the world's most dominant social platform.</p><p>This is what should give us the most cause for concern: that this is not an issue related to a single country or a single company, but the globe itself.</p><p>How individual states such as Canada deal with multinational companies that not only operate internationally but, in their very functioning, challenge the notion of physical borders, is a test that the current regulatory framework is ill-equipped to address.</p><p>And as these companies poke and prod at the limits of the nation-state, with their truly global and active constituency of users, these companies will only be emboldened to push those limits further - and potentially disrupt governance altogether.</p><p>In the face of such a historic situation, a first step might be to view each of tech's moves with deep skepticism. A useful second one might be to fight back.</p><p>Fortunately, signs of revolt are appearing. This week, U.S. Senator and Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren put forth a plan for breaking up the tech giants. It is far from certain to succeed, but the mere fact that we must rely on a U.S. senator for salvation should force a recognition of what it is at stake.</p><p>In the back and forth between the needs of companies and society, it's time to push back and defend our own interests. The pendulum, after all, doesn't swing on its own.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOBML-GAM20190309opalangtechnostate</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOBML2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKR-CKX1-F06S-333C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303830</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1595\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

But as some of those startups grew into behemoths, they turned this force on its head. Far from levelling the playing field, Big Tech now largely owns it, and rather than democratizing the economy, the internet has ended up exacerbating the world's inequality problem.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Big Tech's rise has made a few people extremely wealthy. The richest among them, Amazon owner Jeff Bezos, lost $7 billion-more than the total wealth of several countries-in a single day last week. And yet the biggest risk he faces as a result is falling to second place in the global wealth ranking, after another tech founder, Bill Gates.</p><p>Meanwhile, some 736 million people still lived in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 per day) in 2015, and billions more lived on less than $2.50 per day. Many workers worldwide-including low-level employees at tech companies like Amazon and freelancers who use platforms like Uber to find customers-face poor working conditions and stagnant wages. As labour's share of income declines, capital's share increases-trends that benefit the wealthy, above all.</p><p>Given the power of major tech companies to stifle competition, reversing these trends will require government intervention. And, indeed, taming Big Tech has become a major issue ahead of the 2020 presidential election in the US. In particular, Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren-in my view, the two strongest candidates vying for the Democratic Party's nomination to challenge Republican President Donald Trump-have called for breaking [them] up.</p><p>But the solutions being proposed, including by legal scholars like Lina Khan, tend to focus on making better use of antitrust laws. This approach is unlikely to work because markets have changed dramatically since antitrust laws were conceived.</p><p>In the late 19th century, Leon Walras produced the first models of how competitive markets work, showing how buyers and sellers decide, based on prices, how much to buy and sell. Walras visualized an auctioneer responsible for bringing buyers and sellers together, and adjusting prices until market equilibrium-when aggregate demand for each good equals aggregate supply-is achieved. Subsequent work, such as that by Kenneth Arrow and Gerard Debreu, expanded upon the Walrasian model, but the auctioneer remained in the background.</p><p>With the emergence of digital platforms like Alibaba, Amazon and Uber, however, everything changed. These platforms perform the work of Walras's imaginary auctioneer, only they are real-and profit-driven. They may even be willing to make large initial losses-as Amazon did for its first seven years in operation-in order to maximize later gains. They know that they need only reach the point where they can reap the benefits of economies of scale, bringing enough buyers and sellers to the \"auction\" to make search, information and transaction costs plummet.</p><p>In this sense, digital platforms are natural monopolies. Applying antitrust laws to break them up would thus eliminate their most fundamental advantage and destroy their ability to deliver benefits to economies and consumers.</p><p>This dilemma is not altogether new. Some central banks, such as the Reserve Bank of India, were once private organizations. But giving a single private agent power over something as consequential as money creation was quickly determined to be too risky. And dividing the responsibility among several authorities would make it impossible for any to serve a transaction-smoothing function, resulting in a costly fragmentation of the monetary system.</p><p>It is worth noting one other potential barrier to using antitrust laws to break up Big Tech. In the US, at least, such laws have focused primarily on protecting consumers. Recognizing that, many digital platforms have avoided hurting consumers, instead gouging the sellers who use their services to connect to buyers. But there is growing research-such as that conducted by Suresh Naidu, Eric Posner, and Glen Weyl-indicating that antitrust law should also be applied to protecting workers.</p><p>Still, given the ways [in which] digital platforms have transformed markets, governments must think beyond antitrust. One approach worth considering focuses not on breaking up tech giants, but on ensuring that their profits are more widely shared. This could be achieved, say, with regulations that require platforms over a certain size to disperse shares to a large number of individuals and also to funds dedicated to providing domestic and global public goods.</p><p>For the most influential platforms, governments may consider a gradual shift to non-profit models, akin to public utilities. To be sure, this approach should be used sparingly to avoid excessive state intervention. But it is not in society's interest to have a single organization that is integral to the functioning of the entire economy.</p><p>The precise contours of a strategy for constraining Big Tech will emerge over time. But I am hopeful that either Sanders or Warren-who seem to have the right \"moral intention\"-would be able to lead that process in a way that serves the interests of consumers, workers and business owners alike.

Over the course of the day, it dawned on me that, in the not-too-distant future, Google and other social media companies like Facebook and Twitter would have the power to control and manipulate information flow in unforeseen and dramatic ways. That power would give the tech giants the ability to manipulate elections and policy debates and even to re-define what free speech actually means.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That future has arrived.</p><p>In the last week alone we've seen Google attempt to make a co-founder of Greenpeace, Patrick Moore, \"disappear.\" Why? Moore is an unrepentant skeptic of man-made global warming. He's been extraordinarily critical not only of the radical greens that have taken over the environmental movement in general but also specifically critical of Greenpeace.</p><p>Someone must have complained to the overlords at Google, because Moore recently was scrubbed from the search results for \"founder of Greenpeace.\" Google claims its search results are the products of an unbiased algorithm, but clearly the company's biases are showing.</p><p>Now we also discover that a vice president of Google personally helped block a Christian channel from running ads on a video regarding same sex marriage. Why? Because Google employees were offended by the video's message and believed it didn't represent \"Google's values.\"</p><p>But Google isn't alone in its digital censorship. Twitter just confirmed it shadowbanned some tweets of the Federalist's co-founder, Sean Davis. His tweets regarding the transcripts of Lisa Page's testimony in front of Congress disappeared to everyone in his feed but Davis himself, giving the appearance that those tweets were still being seen by others when in fact only Davis could see them.</p><p>Twitter officials finally admitted to Davis this week that they did shadowban the tweets about Page \"to keep people safe.\" Safe from what? Public information? The truth? These tweets were simply screenshots of the Page transcripts with some commentary by Davis.</p><p>I'm sick of it. Every single decision of these tech companies seems to cut the same way-against a conservative worldview, against religious communities, against anything that doesn't fit comfortably within their little Silicon Valley bubble.</p><p>Many of Big Tech's defenders on the Right cry a familiar refrain: \"Oh, let the free market work!\" Great. Except this isn't a free market.</p><p>It's time regulators and the American people wake up and reject the illusion that Facebook, Google, and Twitter are still \"neutral\" technology platforms; they have become publishers and telecom companies with explicit biases and massive consequences for their actions.</p><p>Facebook, Google, Twitter, and the like are functionally monopolies. Google dominates as the de facto search engine of the planet. In many countries, Facebook is synonymous with the internet. Politicians across the country now use social media as their primary form of communication with their constituents.</p><p>People telling you there is no bias and that these companies aren't monopolies-the ones insisting that the tech companies shouldn't be broken up or face any regulatory scrutiny-turn out, typically, to be the kinds of people who have wads of tech company cash falling out of their back pockets.</p><p>Fact is today the internet is a modern day Forum, the Agora, the marketplace for the free exchange of ideas. It might be a shock to the systems of its progenitors ensconced in their Silicon Valley safe spaces, but our republic thrives on that free exchange of ideas, even ideas that make people uncomfortable.</p><p>If the election of Donald Trump taught our coastal elites anything, it's that a huge segment of our country is unheard and unfamiliar to them. It turns out that vast numbers of people have a different view of the world and a different kind of moral compass than those of the coastal elites. They are minimally represented in the halls of Congress, the mass media in New York, or the entertainment giants on the West Coast. We don't see or hear from them unless they're being mocked or pitied. Enough is enough.</p><p>To err in any direction but toward the free flow of information is to sow the seeds of our eventual demise. The Washington Post intones that \"Democracy Dies in Darkness.\" And for once, the paper is right: democracy does die in the darkness when unaccountable techo-elites manipulate the free flow of information, hide their malfeasance from public accountability, and throttle ideas they find inconvenient.</p><p>Many conservatives and lawmakers of all stripes and party affiliations are still asleep in the light. It's time to wake up: the information darkness is coming if we don't do anything about it.</p><p>Ned Ryun is a former presidential writer for George W. Bush and the founder and CEO of American Majority.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>\"It's time the American people wake up and reject the illusion that Facebook, Google, and Twitter are still \"neutral\" technology platforms.\"</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKMI-tdndc574xu8x448x31bks93hnw</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289C944EC2A39E NWBKMI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VWV-M721-DXVP-V0P3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401943</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"802\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Digital First Media [Detroit]<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

He held a cardboard sign that read \"I need a job\". As people would pass him by, they would offer the traditional greeting how and call out to him saying \"how chief!\" At each instance, instead of responding to the traditional greeting by saying how back, he would mutter \"chance\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A woman who had been observing these interchanges for a while walked up to the chief wanting to know why he didn't acknowledge the many greetings by responding to them with the traditional how. The chief looked at her and said earnestly, \"That's because I know &amp;#38;\u2018how' to do plenty of things already. Now all I want is a chance to do them\". I would often use this story to point to my own South Asian Indian heritage and say that I also felt like the chief. I already knew how, and all I wanted was a chance. The story always elicited a chuckle from my interlocutors, and helped me win many a consulting assignment.</p><p>A few days ago, Mint reported that Tim Cook, the chief of Apple Inc., addressed an august audience at an international conference on data privacy in Brussels. In an impassioned speech, which was also excellently written, he opened by conjuring up the ghost of Niccol&amp;#38;ograve; Machiavelli-who wrote a treatise for unscrupulous politicians, he spoke about the need for countries to regulate the use of personal data and to ensure the privacy of their citizens.</p><p>He said he would welcome such regulation while reiterating Apple's oft-used rhetoric about its commitment to user privacy and, by implication, the lack of commitment from his competitors such as Amazon and Google. In my opinion, the latter has bypassed Apple in data-driven Artificial Intelligence, and both Amazon and Googlehave surpassed Apple in voice assistants. These intelligent voice assistants represent the future of how we will interact with phones and computers and will be a large step away from the graphical apps we have on our phones today. After we as consumers have adopted voice as the main means of interaction, enterprises who serve us are bound to invest heavily in voice recognition as well-and Amazon and Googlewill hold the edge.</p><p>Cook didn't stop there. He said that modern technology has created a \"data-industrial complex\", and that this complex doesn't just threaten individuals, but also communities and nation states. \"Platforms and algorithms that promised to improve our lives can actually magnify our worst human tendencies,\" quoth he. \"Rogue actors and even governments have taken advantage of user trust to deepen divisions, incite violence, and even undermine our shared sense of what is true and what is false. This crisis is real. It is not imagined, or exaggerated, or crazy.\"</p><p>Cook said that he would welcome a US federal law that limits the activity of tech titans in much the same way Europe's 28-country General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR.</p><p>Limiting tech titans' activities with regulation may be fine, but does that allow governments to be above such laws? Most reasonable people would say no. In countries like India and the US, a court warrant is required before governments can investigate and impound personal data. The laws in China, however, are different and allow the government wide powers of investigation.</p><p>In February, Apple announced that it would for the first time store the keys for Chinese iCloud accounts in China itself. This was in response to a new Chinese law mandating that such data be stored locally. Oddly, there was no mention of Machiavelli from Cook at that time.</p><p>Reuters reported then that according to legal experts, Apple's move means Chinese authorities will no longer have to use the US court system to seek information on iCloud users and can instead use their own legal system to ask Apple to hand over iCloud data for Chinese users. Human rights activists said they fear the authorities could use their powers to track down the discontented, citing cases from more than a decade ago in which Yahoo Inc. handed over user data that led to arrests and prison sentences for two democracy advocates in China.</p><p>Last week, I wrote that Google's chief has said that his firm could no longer afford to ignore China and was making attempts to test a search engine subject to state censorship there. This despite Google's earlier denials that it was entering the Chinese search engine fray. One set of rules for China and another set for the rest of us. As a Native American would say, methinks the big tech chiefs speak with a forked tongue.</p><p>Siddharth Pai is founder of Siana Capital, a venture fund management company focused on deep science and tech in India.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from MINT.

The trouble is keeping lawmakers from knocking on your door.    Tech titans Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Facebook Inc and Google parent Alphabet Inc managed to do just that until last week, when a House subcommittee summoned the chief executive officers of the four companies. Lawmakers took a dim view of the tech giants\u2019 grip on their respective industries. \"These companies as they exist today have monopoly power,\u201d said Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island, who leads the House investigation into the companies. His prescription: \"Some need to be broken up, all need to be heavily regulated.\u201d The sentiment appeared to be shared widely.    As a matter of public policy, the issue is relatively straightforward. Monopolies are trouble, which is why antitrust laws are designed to stop them. They have the power to raise prices and thereby stifle demand. They often turn into big, lazy, unwieldy bureaucracies that have little incentive to innovate or look after customers, workers and suppliers. And perhaps most problematic, they can use their money and influence to seize political power, making it more difficult to dislodge them.    There\u2019s little disagreement that Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google pose such a threat. Apple controls nearly half the US smartphone market and dominates the distribution of apps; Amazon all but controls e-commerce; Facebook rules social media; and Google has a firm grip on Internet search and online advertising. It\u2019s difficult to overstate their power. The four companies make up just 0.8% of the S&amp;P 500 Index by number, and yet they account for 6.1% of its total revenue, 8.9% of its earnings and 16.8% of its market value.    For investors, the issue is a bit more complicated. Monopolies are impregnable money-minting machines, so everyone wants a piece of them. It\u2019s no accident that Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook are four of the seven biggest companies in the world by market value. Nor is it surprising that their profits have trickled down to shareholders. An equal investment in the four tech giants since Facebook \u2013 the youngest of the bunch \u2013 went public in 2012 has produced a return of 31% a year, including dividends, more than double the return from the S&amp;P 500 over the same period.    It turns out they\u2019re not alone. Stocks of highly profitable companies tend to beat the market. Shares of the most profitable 30% of US companies, sorted on return on equity and weighted by market value, outpaced the S&amp;P 500 by 1.6 percentage points a year from July 1963 through June, according to the longest data series compiled by Dartmouth professor Ken French. And they did so with roughly the same amount of volatility as the broad market, as measured by standard deviation, a common proxy for risk.    Astonishingly, the odds of capturing this profitability premium favoured investors regardless of the holding period. Shares of the most profitable companies outpaced the market 65% of the time over rolling one-year periods, 76% of the time over three years, 83% over five years and a whopping 93% over 10 years, counted monthly.    But markets aren\u2019t supposed to work this way. You shouldn\u2019t be able to reliably beat the market using widely available information without taking more risk. One explanation for the profitability premium is that investors are rubes: They don\u2019t pay attention to profitability when picking stocks, or worse, they errantly favour less-profitable companies, allowing more cunning investors to exploit their mistakes. That seems unlikely. Profitability has long been a key feature of security analysis. More recently, there has been a proliferation of indexes, and funds tracking them, that pick or weight stocks based in part on profitability. And as the market value of Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook show, their shares are hugely popular.    A more plausible explanation is that the profitability premium is compensation for the risk that today\u2019s profits will evaporate tomorrow. Highly profitable companies rarely maintain the same level of profitability. More often, competition squeezes it away or, as in the case of Apple and its cohorts, the competition is crushed or acquired, resulting in greater market share and profitability but also inviting lawmakers and regulators to step in.    Microsoft Inc\u2019s antitrust entanglement with the government in the late 1990s is instructive. Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded the company in 1975, and by the early 1990s, most personal computers ran Microsoft\u2019s operating system, first MS-DOS and then Microsoft Windows. In August 1997, the company became the second largest in the United States by market value, behind only General Electric.    A year later, in May 1998, the US Department of Justice and 20 US states sued Microsoft, accusing it of attempting to illegally protect and extend its monopoly by undermining competitors. By the time the case was argued in early 2001, much of the evidence against Microsoft had spilled into public view. Although profits continued to grow, the legal and regulatory scrutiny around the company clouded its future, and shareholders paid the price. The stock returned a negative 4% from May 1998 to December 2000, even as the Nasdaq Composite Index and the S&amp;P 500 returned 33% and 23%, respectively, over the same time. Several months later, a federal court found that Microsoft had violated federal antitrust laws.    As it turned out, of course, Microsoft has maintained its status as a tech powerhouse. Today, its market value is second only to Apple among US stocks, and shareholders who stuck with the company through its antitrust battles have been richly rewarded. Microsoft has returned 27% a year since it went public in 1986, compared with 11% and 10% a year for the Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500, respectively. But that was far from a foregone conclusion when Microsoft was in the government\u2019s crosshairs. And if lawmakers, regulators or prosecutors muster the will to go after Apple, Amazon, Facebook or Alphabet, their shareholders should prepare for more paltry returns and perhaps worse.    For now, investors don\u2019t seem worried that the tech titans are in danger. All four of their stocks were higher after the hearing than before. And all four companies reported financial results that beat analysts\u2019 expectations a day after the hearing, no doubt emboldening their shareholders.    Still, Big Tech\u2019s faithful should bear in mind that monopolies are only as durable as a government that tolerates them. The profitability they enjoy, and the skyrocketing stock prices that accompany it, are no free lunch. They\u2019re payment for the risk that lawmakers are more serious about breaking up or regulating the tech titans than investors seem to believe.

Meanwhile, Republicans believed admitting to Russian intervention in the election would delegitimize their victory, so they merely shrugged their shoulders and called the Democrats sore losers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Recently, however, even the traditionally \"small government\" Republicans have been calling for regulation to prevent <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>from silencing conservative viewpoints via discriminatory algorithms and account removals. Two congressional hearings, which have been laden with a palpable bipartisan ire, have taken place since April. The social media company appears to be facing down a barrel of red tape, and soon other \"Big Tech\" companies could be facing the same peril.</p><p>Policymakers are increasingly viewing Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook\u00a0as an existential threat, but they are also proceeding with caution that is painstakingly slow. Members of Congress\u00a0have had to acknowledge the fact that each of these five companies in the technology sector have been and continue to be vital components of economic growth in the U.S., and over-restrictive regulation could be severely damaging to the U.S. economy. Is Big Tech too big for government regulation?</p><p>Absolutely not, and the presumption that Big Tech's economic output necessitates or justifies collateralizing consumers is false and abhorrent. Big Tech has taken advantage of the American people for far too long, and our government has failed to hold them accountable for exploitative practices that exceed economic benefit.</p><p>Moreover, the political points awarded at the circus show of congressional hearings are to the detriment of the American people. The real reason policymakers are slow to certainty on regulation is because of intense lobbying efforts on behalf of Big Tech companies fearing that <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>treatment used as precedent.</p><p>Uninformed, vulnerable consumers should not be the means to revenue growth, and the public should not be convinced by corporate PR campaigns that Big Tech will do the right thing this time. There are too many examples to the contrary, and policymakers shouldn't lend credence to these pathetic public relations apologies.\u00a0</p><p>Decisive action is needed to protect vulnerable consumers, but regulators cower behind platitudes, such as that regulation will restrict free markets. However, Big Tech regulation is not an affront to free markets, but a protection of it. The sheer market dominance of these Big Tech companies in a supposedly competitive free market is sufficient evidence. To use the aforementioned example of <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>in 2018 the company controlled 79 percent of the total market share for social network ad revenue.</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>appeal to advertisers is its trove of user data that it had obtained from consumers who never consented to such an invasion of privacy except through pages of dense terms and conditions that no reasonable person could have read and understood. <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>has told the public that it will handle the issue internally, but consumers have had enough of Big Tech impunity and regulators should take notice.</p><p>The sad reality is that much needed consumer protection isn't coming for quite some time. During the congressional hearing of <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>CEO Mark Zuckerberg, one senator asked him the asinine question of how <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>business model worked without consumers paying money. Zuckerberg condescendingly replied, \"Senator, we sell ads.\" Cue the face palm.</p><p>If that question is any indication of how little our members of Congress understand about technology, then Americans will have to hang on the corporate scaffold for at least a few more years.</p><p>Patrick Gagen is a 21-year-old mass communication and finance senior from Suwanee, Georgia.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-3577493</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T94-HMF1-JBSN-34P1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"659\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Reveille: Louisiana State University</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 18, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It was the year that long-simmering concerns about its potential negative effects on our economy, on our personal lives and even on our democracy broke into public debate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was the year that much of the media got serious about tech journalism, when the balance of tech journalism tipped from gadget reviews and chief-executive profiles to treating Silicon Valley as a node of power in society to be held accountable.</p><p>It was the year that tech company employees began holding their employers to account. At Google, walkouts were staged over gender policy, and petitions demanded an end to Chinese expansion plans and to the development of \"warfare technology.\"</p><p>Protests were held over Microsoft contracts with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.</p><p>There was backlash against the use of facial recognition to assist law enforcement at Amazon. And at Facebook, employees started speaking far more openly to the media as the company careened from scandal to scandal.</p><p>It was the year that tech executives awoke to their new operating environment. The U.S. Congress and parliaments around the world ordered CEOs, accustomed to being adored as the leaders of venerated companies, to testify and answer tough questions. It was also the year that these same CEOs, whether motivated by sincere interest in fixing structural problems with their products or concern for protecting public image and shareholder value, began making meaningful reforms to their companies, to varying degrees of success.</p><p>Finally, and perhaps most consequentially, 2018 was the year that tech companies lost the benefit of the doubt from governments. This was a result of a growing body of investigations, academic research and enterprise reporting detailing the ways in which social platforms have been used to undermine democracy. It also stems from a concern that the economic benefits of the digital economy are flowing predominantly to a small handful of U.S.-based global companies. But the final straw for many legislators was a November article in The New York Times revealing a disconnect between Facebook's public statements about abuses on their platform and the aggressive tactics being used by executives to fight the story. To many in government, this confirmed that the tech-sector giants should be treated like any other large multinational corporation, and that it's time to get serious about governing Big Tech.</p><p>Luckily, there are some relatively easy places for governments to start. They can bring sunlight to the world of micro-targeted advertising through new transparency laws. They can overhaul data-privacy regimes that are limited in scope, weak in capacity and unco-ordinated globally. They can mandate the identification of automated accounts so that citizens know when they are engaging with a machine or a human. They can modernize tax and competition policy for the digital economy. And they can fund large-scale digital literacy initiatives for citizens of all ages.</p><p>But beyond these short-term Band-Aids, 2019 must also be the year we start grappling with a set of thornier questions at the intersection of technology and democracy.</p><p>Democratic governments will need to wrestle with how their speech laws apply to the digital world. This is going to require bringing together the private sector and civil society in a hard discussion about the nature and limits of free speech, about who is censored online and how, about responsibilities for moderating speech at scale, and about universal versus national speech norms.</p><p>And while the idea that platform companies are simply intermediaries - and therefore not liable for how their services are used - has been foundational to the innovation, growth and empowerment created by the open internet, the sheer breadth of the economic and social services now provided by platforms might demand a more nuanced approach to how they are governed. If this comes at the cost of that innovation, democracies must be allowed to decide about the trade-off.</p><p>Such democracies will need to start co-ordinating their public-policy efforts around emerging technologies, too. There is currently a disconnect between the global scale, operation and social impact of technology companies and the national jurisdiction of most countries' tech laws and regulations. As former BlackBerry co-CEO Jim Balsillie has argued, the digital economy may need its Bretton Woods moment.</p><p>How we handle these challenges will set the tone for how we'll grapple with the even knottier ones that are to come. As de facto public places increasingly involve private interests - such as Alphabet's planned smart city in Toronto, or Amazon's competition over which city would earn the right to be home to its HQ2 headquarters - governments will need to lead a conversation about what this collision looks like. What, for instance, would it mean to treat the data created by the citizens of cities as a public good?</p><p>And while governments devote substantial resources to growing the business of artificial intelligence, which promises to reshape broad aspects of our lives, we must work ahead to ensure these nodes of decision-making power are brought into the norms of accountability and transparency that we demand in democracies.</p><p>This year was defined by outrage against tech - but 2019 will be the year that the long and messy process of governing it begins.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOBML-GAM20181229opalangturn</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOBML2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V2T-DPR1-JCRP-C1NS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303830</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"925\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

It tracked the government's adoption of electronic transactions and the underlying ecosystems that support digital payments. India ranked 28th, up from the 36th position in 2011.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The fact that Indians are comfortable making C2G (citizen-to-government) payments online-which were traditionally made in cash-shows how far we have come in our quest for a truly Digital India. Not just transaction volumes-behaviours and hard set notions about digital payments have changed post demonetisation. The year 2018 saw a lot of these changes, and I am certain the next year will bring more. Let's quickly rewind before we fast forward to the next year.</p><p>The year that was</p><p>The Supreme Court's verdict of striking down Section 57 of the Aadhaar Act ensured that private companies cannot mandate customers to provide Aadhaar for on-boarding; they must provide alternate ways such as passports, voter's ID or driver's licence. The judgment had some ramifications for the industry. It has increased the cost of doing business. Earlier an e-KYC verification and on-boarding took 2-3 days and cost Rs 15 per person; physical verifications cost up to Rs 80-100 per person and take a much longer time.</p><p>The verdict also affects the subscription industry and recurring payments. Consumers could use Aadhaar to approve e-Mandates and e-NACH debits on their accounts. Now companies can only use Netbanking for obtaining online permission for recurring payments. Or, it's back to paperwork and tediousness.</p><p>But all was not grey and dark. UPI is gaining significant momentum and the launch of UPI 2.0 was a much-awaited event. From being a P2P payment mode, UPI has transformed to a merchant-first platform with overdraft facilities, the features to add invoices, and more. From 30 million UPI transactions in September 2017 to 405 million in November 2018, UPI will become the de-facto method for all online payments by 2020. For all you know, the UPI handle may soon be used as a credit card.</p><p>What we can expect in 2019</p><p>UPI will steal the show: We have only scratched the surface of UPI's relevance for businesses and with features such as higher transaction limit and more secure QR-based payments, UPI will not only drive larger transaction volumes but also significantly increase P2M adoption. From contributing 2% of the total GMV (gross merchandise value) on our platform in January 2018, UPI grew to 12% in November, whereas the GMV share of cards fell from 74% to 55% in the same period.</p><p>Clean sweep by WhatsApp: With its 200 million Indian users, WhatsApp is another disruptor we must watch out for. The launch of UPI payments on WhatsApp would take UPI mainstream, enabling a huge chunk of the Indian public, down to the smallest cities, to have access to digital payments on a trusted platform. This could be a watershed moment for the payments industry; like the Jio launch was for the internet industry.</p><p>Internet population will be directly proportional to financial inclusion: Talking of Jio, it will empower more consumers, increasing financial inclusion, and bring more people online. As the average Indian's disposable income increases, we see them spending more online. However, the Indian millennial is also concerned about wealth management and investments. According to a Credit Suisse report, the likelihood of Indian households investing in stocks and mutual funds has risen from about 13% in 2010 to 19% in 2017. This will continue to increase; it will be interesting to watch how the mutual funds industry will get revolutionised next year.</p><p>Subscription platforms will grow: We can also expect growth in loyalty programs and subscription platforms. The Zomato Golds and Swiggy Supers will continue to entice more consumers as they offer tailor-made solutions for day-to-day issues.</p><p>But it's not going to be all roses and rainbows: It is going to be thrilling to watch how RBI regulation will impact the roll-out of policies and how other payment modes will catch up on their offerings to consumers. Also, because of the 2019 general elections, chances are investors may become cautious on funding start-ups; they will want to understand the political landscape before committing money. Businesses, especially mutual fund companies, will have to look for alternatives to Aadhaar-based digital KYC to ensure that work moves at the same pace as before and consumer experience is not compromised.</p><p>All in all, while we can expect important changes and a watershed moment or two, I believe all these improvements will be channelled towards fuelling digital payments into the mainstream-paving the way for digital inclusion and financial stability.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from MINT.

Music publishers and artists complain that YouTube isn't paying a fair price for all the music available on its site, much of which is uploaded by others.</p><p>The showdown over music is just the latest skirmish in a global showdown with Big Tech.</p><p>Governments everywhere are grappling with how to rein in Google, Facebook and other technology giants that now dominate so much of our online lives.</p><p>Europe is leading the way with legislation, stricter regulation and steep fines.</p><p>In the United States, there are growing calls to break up these giants on anti-trust grounds - as regulators once did with titans of earlier eras such as AT&amp;T and Microsoft. This week, Facebook cofounder Chris Hughes warned that the power now held by CEO Mark Zuckerberg is \"unprecedented and un-American,\" and urged regulators to do something about it.</p><p>\"We are a nation with a tradition of reining in monopolies, no matter how well-intentioned the leaders of these companies may be,\" he wrote in a New York Times opinion piece last week.</p><p>For others, the solution lies in punitive taxes to get Google and Facebook, who now control half of global online advertising, to move to a subscription-based business model.</p><p>These companies are a more significant challenge for regulators than AT&amp;T and Microsoft ever were. It isn't just that the new tech giants may be leveraging their market heft to stifle competition and hog revenues, as critics claim. They're also accused of destabilizing democracies by not doing enough to block the spread of disinformation and hate speech. All the while, they're harvesting users' personal data to sell targeted ads.</p><p>Given all that, governments have a duty to act to prevent a classic economic breakdown known as a \"tragedy of the commons,\" New York University economist Paul Romer argued in a recent New York Times op-ed.</p><p>That's a situation where individuals - or in this case, companies - undermine the well-being of society in the pursuit of their own gain.</p><p>Rather than break them up, governments should aggressively tax tech giants to prod them toward \"a healthier, more traditional model,\" argues Prof. Romer, a co-recipient of last year's Nobel economics prize. He also advised the U.S. Justice Department in its anti-trust case against Microsoft.</p><p>\"Our digital platforms may not be too big to fail. But they are too big to trust and ... may already be too big to regulate,\" he says.</p><p>The rate of the tax could be scaled up to make sure the dominant companies bear the brunt, without discouraging smaller players from entering online markets, Prof. Romer argues.</p><p>That may work in addressing Google and Facebook's ad-based businesses.</p><p>But taxes and financial sanctions may not work elsewhere, including in the music business.</p><p>\"Governments around the world are starting to realize that Google and the big tech companies have responsibilities in many different areas,\" said John Phelan, director-general of the International Confederation of Music Publishers, which represents Sony, Warner, Universal and many independent labels.</p><p>Through its YouTube subsidiary, Google has emerged as a giant in the music distribution business in part by exploiting what he calls \"legal kinks\" in copyright laws in the United States, Canada, Europe and elsewhere that exempt \"passive\" transfers of copyrighted material.</p><p>Unlike subscription streaming services such as Apple and Spotify, YouTube users can upload content (as they did 16 billion times last year). Mr. Phelan says Google has balked at paying licensing fees on a lot of that material, arguing that it has only a passive role in its distribution.</p><p>The new European legislation will effectively close that exemption by making YouTube and other companies legally liable for the material on their platform, according to Mr. Phelan. EU member countries have two years to bring their copyright regimes into line with the new law.</p><p>The music industry is pushing Canada and other countries to replicate the European copyright model.</p><p>Breaking up Big Tech makes for a great slogan. But the challenge of YouTube is a reminder that it will take many different tools to bring order to the online world.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOBML-GAM20190511rbcomckenna</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOBML2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W35-CPD1-F06S-30PP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303830</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"763\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

This will allow companies charged with violation of competition law to correct themselves to avoid punishment at any stage of the investigation. This was part of the recommendations made by the Competition Law Review Committee chaired by corporate affairs secretary Injeti Srinivas that submitted its report in July this year. The move follows the global trend of introducing leniency programmes in competition laws to reduce unnecessary litigation.</p><p>As the government intends to amend the Competition Act, it has the opportunity to have a relook at the law that has been found to be inadequate to address the concentration of power in the hands of corporations. The regulators and lawmakers in the US and Europe are zealously working on ways to tackle market concentration and address the limitations of existing laws. The calls for breaking large technology firms are getting louder by the day.</p><p>This sudden spurt of regulatory/legislative action on competition laws is caused by a change in the character of monopolies in the era of big tech. In the industrial age, the monopoly was defined as \"the exclusive possession or control of the supply of or trade in a commodity or service\". The economic impact of monopolies was high prices and control of the output. The technology and telecommunications industries are currently witnessing a situation where two or three dominant players drive down prices.</p><p>Amazon and Flipkart are shaking up the retail market through aggressive pricing. In the telecom sector, Reliance Jio, Airtel and Vodafone Idea have brought down tariffs to ridiculously low levels. So there is a need to redraft certain provisions of the law to address the new market reality.</p><p>Another area where the competition law needs a relook is the positioning of the CCI among a multitude of regulators. There is a likelihood of regulators stepping on each other's toes. The CCI had a huge setback last year when the Supreme Court dismissed its appeal against a Bombay High Court order that rejected its prima facie order seeking an investigation into alleged cartelisation by Airtel, Vodafone Idea and COAI. The redrafting of the competition law presents the government with an opportunity to clearly define the powers of CCI.</p><p>In July, the OECD Council adopted the \"Recommendation concerning Effective Action against Hard Core Cartels\". One of the objectives of the recommendations was to ensure that competition watchdogs have enough teeth to deal with cartels. These recommendations include arming regulatory bodies with powers to conduct 'dawn raids' and access documents and information, to access remotely stored electronic information and to seek information from third parties including other governments. These powers will be key to create a regulatory environment for technology and e-commerce industries.</p><p>Instead of introducing clauses one by one in a piecemeal approach, the government should rework the entire competition law to equip it for the changing business environment.

Fast forward to today: The economy has slowed down and so, too, has the criticism of Big Tech.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since the COVID-19 outbreak, the world is learning that far from being inefficient, predatory and privacy-invasive monopolies, Big Tech firms are responsive, consumer-centric, dynamic organizations. They are hiring like no other firms in the economy; and researchers, pharmaceutical firms and government agencies are using big data and artificial intelligence to track the pandemic and to assist in clinical trials.</p><p>Let us zoom in. Once panic buying started, Amazon, in just a few days, delivered an inordinate amount of basic goods that had been stripped from shelves at larger chain grocery stores, and it has stuck to its two-day delivery promise for essential items. In addition to a hiring surge, Amazon is giving raises to its current employees. As if this was not enough, Amazon is leapfrogging law enforcement by policing price gouging and removing rapacious merchants from its platform.</p><p>Or take the other tech giants. Google's Verily COVID-19 testing and triage website was operational in days. Apple has released an app and website that provide extensive COVID-19 information from the CDC and other government agencies. Oracle is using its cloud applications to assist researchers to develop a vaccine. All this was accomplished with the backing of companies with the resources of and creativity found at Big Tech firms.</p><p>To date, most of the antitrust and regulatory reform case against Big Tech has focused on narrow market segments where each firm enjoyed a near-monopoly position. The limitations of this synecdoche are clear. There is intense competition between Google, Amazon and Microsoft (as well as IBM, Slack and Salesforce) to supply enterprise and educational tools, applications and software to firms, households and students for remote work and distance learning. Amazon Prime, YouTube and Disney+ are bringing intense rivalry to industry leader Netflix. First-time installations of new entrant Zoom tripled in two weeks, cutting into the market shares of powerhouses Microsoft Teams, Skype, Slack and WebEx.</p><p>The pandemic confirms two equally important inconvenient truths that contradict the critics' claims that Big Tech firms hold bottleneck positions and exploit their market power when demand spikes and supply is interrupted.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/18/us-factories-in-mexico-are-still-open-as-the-coronavirus-spreads-workers-are-dying/\">US factories in Mexico are still open.

In consumer satisfaction surveys, the tech industry outperforms.</p><p>In a 2020 Morning Consult report, Google, Amazon and PayPal were in the top four of the most trusted American brands. Further, a Stanford study quantified that digital goods (such as search engines) create large gains in well-being that are not reflected in conventional measures of GDP and productivity. Policy makers are also realizing that sharing personal data at scale might also improve diagnosis capability and crisis management, putting one more dent in the privacy absolutist view that underpins contemporary regulation.</p><p>Two, unlike classic textbook monopolies, Big Tech firms are not idle organizations that expropriate wealth by restricting supply, increasing prices and extracting excess profits from captive users. Big Tech firms expand output, innovate, enter new markets and experiment to deliver new products and services. Economies of scale, network effects and big data-the essence of Big Tech-are at a premium.</p><p>As net losers of advertisement revenue to Big Tech, powerful voices in the mainstream press have feigned to ignore the contribution of the tech industry to social welfare and doubled down on calls for antimonopoly reform.

Fast forward to today: The economy has slowed down and so, too, has the criticism of Big Tech.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since the COVID-19 outbreak, the world is learning that far from being inefficient, predatory and privacy-invasive monopolies, Big Tech firms are responsive, consumer-centric, dynamic organizations. They are hiring like no other firms in the economy; and researchers, pharmaceutical firms and government agencies are using big data and artificial intelligence to track the pandemic and to assist in clinical trials.</p><p>Let us zoom in. Once panic buying started, Amazon, in just a few days, delivered an inordinate amount of basic goods that had been stripped from shelves at larger chain grocery stores, and it has stuck to its two-day delivery promise for essential items. In addition to a hiring surge, Amazon is giving raises to its current employees. As if this was not enough, Amazon is leapfrogging law enforcement by policing price gouging and removing rapacious merchants from its platform.</p><p>Or take the other tech giants. Google's Verily COVID-19 testing and triage website was operational in days. Apple has released an app and website that provide extensive COVID-19 information from the CDC and other government agencies. Oracle is using its cloud applications to assist researchers to develop a vaccine. All this was accomplished with the backing of companies with the resources of and creativity found at Big Tech firms.</p><p>To date, most of the antitrust and regulatory reform case against Big Tech has focused on narrow market segments where each firm enjoyed a near-monopoly position. The limitations of this synecdoche are clear. There is intense competition between Google, Amazon and Microsoft (as well as IBM, Slack and Salesforce) to supply enterprise and educational tools, applications and software to firms, households and students for remote work and distance learning. Amazon Prime, YouTube and Disney+ are bringing intense rivalry to industry leader Netflix. First-time installations of new entrant Zoom tripled in two weeks, cutting into the market shares of powerhouses Microsoft Teams, Skype, Slack and WebEx.</p><p>The pandemic confirms two equally important inconvenient truths that contradict the critics' claims that Big Tech firms hold bottleneck positions and exploit their market power when demand spikes and supply is interrupted.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2020/04/18/us-factories-in-mexico-are-still-open-as-the-coronavirus-spreads-workers-are-dying/\">US factories in Mexico are still open.

In consumer satisfaction surveys, the tech industry outperforms.</p><p>In a 2020 Morning Consult report, Google, Amazon and PayPal were in the top four of the most trusted American brands. Further, a Stanford study quantified that digital goods (such as search engines) create large gains in well-being that are not reflected in conventional measures of GDP and productivity. Policy makers are also realizing that sharing personal data at scale might also improve diagnosis capability and crisis management, putting one more dent in the privacy absolutist view that underpins contemporary regulation.</p><p>Two, unlike classic textbook monopolies, Big Tech firms are not idle organizations that expropriate wealth by restricting supply, increasing prices and extracting excess profits from captive users. Big Tech firms expand output, innovate, enter new markets and experiment to deliver new products and services. Economies of scale, network effects and big data-the essence of Big Tech-are at a premium.</p><p>As net losers of advertisement revenue to Big Tech, powerful voices in the mainstream press have feigned to ignore the contribution of the tech industry to social welfare and doubled down on calls for antimonopoly reform.

Unlike the blockchain-based Bitcoin, which is a roller-coaster, Libra will be backed by a basket of fiat currencies. It is to be supported by a consortium of large-scale corporate houses, e-commerce players, financial services firms and venture capitalists. Companies such as Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc., Uber Technologies Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc. have all signed up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook has more than 2 billion users worldwide and it is clear that it can influence the system. Yet, it appears as if Facebook will attempt to distance itself somewhat from crypto-coin by not controlling it directly. Members of its consortium, called the Libra Association, will not control the currency directly either.</p><p>The secretive project is actually based on two old methods, one organizational and the other technical. The first is the use of a consortium to back a clearing-house. Each member of the consortium provides a \"node\" for its systems to interact with a common messaging technology platform across the consortium. This is not very different from the earlier methods that bank consortia have used while building settlement systems such as the Global Straight Through Processing Association. This was set up in the late 1990s and early 2000s to allow financial-services firms a technology platform for faster settlement of cash and securities transactions. It is now a relic; just one of the many incremental technological attempts to create a financial payments and settlement system that was close to real time. The second old method is the use of blockchain, a technology that has been in place for a dozen years.</p><p>Governments worry about their fiat currencies and would like to manage exchange rates and liquidity and restrict money laundering and terrorist financing. However, United Nations reports on migrant workers suggest that they lose more than $25 billion a year in exorbitant fees when they send money home using the traditional methods available today.</p><p>Young adults the world over have little to no patience with onerous banking systems of the past. Neither do hundreds of millions of Indians who have come online recently. All of these classes of people would benefit from an easy way to make both national and international money transfers. Facebook and its collaborators are on to something big.</p><p>As I have written before, control over user data will be a new trade barrier that is set up across the world. Last week, US President Donald Trump went so far as to say that countries that mandate that the user data of their citizens remains resident in their own countries will face a backlash in the processing of H-1B work visas for the US. This was a pointed reference to India, which accounts for 70% or more of the H-1B slots that come up every year. This is in addition to minimum wage floors already assigned to these visas.</p><p>The Chinese won't find this particularly bothersome. They built a \"Great Wall\" around their home-grown internet companies many years ago. The wall largely kept Western firms such as Amazon, Facebook, Google and Uber out through draconian laws and other market moves. Facebook is outright banned in China. Cryptocurrencies are banned in India. Other countries, too, have been very wary of allowing cyptocurrency a free-for-all. It is understandable that Facebook is trying to distance itself from the management of the new currency's consortium, the Libra Association. There will be plenty of jockeying in this space before nation-states find common ground, and it is wise to wait. The company has already waited for almost five years. Its first moves came in June 2014 when it hired PayPal's president, David Marcus.</p><p>While countries will be quick to regulate the movement of money, they are not so quick to regulate mental health. This is where the true travesty of Big Tech's omnipotence lies. A disturbing report in The Verge that was mentioned in Mint last week pointed to the underbelly of the social networking world. Facebook, Google and other social networking firms allegedly do not pay much attention to their workers (or, in reality, to the workers of firms on contracts with them) who monitor their giant sites for objectionable content. Some observers feel that this is because these firms believe that Artificial Intelligence will soon be able to take over the jobs of the hundreds of humans who check objectionable content on their platforms.</p><p>The article on The Verge presented a chilling and disturbing view of the operations of an information technology service provider retained by Facebook to monitor content on its platform. The article started off with the story of an employee who died of a heart attack while he was at work, and then described the aftermath of his passing. It also went on to detail the working conditions of these workers and the sheer horror of what they have to see online day after day. These guardians of our mental health are poorly paid and have to endure audio-visual content with graphic depictions of man's inhumanity to man and other sentient beings. These are the manual scavengers of Big Tech who clean up the filth that twisted human beings put up online.</p><p>Maybe the US government can start by mandating that these local workers be paid large sums of money for their heroic service, rather than mandating pay floors for skilled H-1B workers, or putting its police force in charge.</p><p>Siddharth Pai is founder of Siana Capital, a venture fund management company focused on deep science and tech in India</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from MINT.

Detroit?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Most people don't think of the Motor City as an incubator of tech innovation. But as both Big Tech and nimble startup culture have turned their attention to the auto industry over the past half-decade, lured by the promise of driverless cars, both sides have seized on a new opportunity for partnership - one that's partly the product of a joint moment of necessary humility.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As the Silicon Valley mantra of \"move fast and break things\" meets the unforgiving reality of the urban road, Detroit is becoming the natural home to dozens of auto-tech ventures. Harnessed correctly by rational regulation, Detroit can view the emerging industry of autonomous-vehicle technology not as just a job creator, but as a way to improve quality of life for residents and commuters.</p><p>A decade ago, as Detroit was hurtling toward municipal bankruptcy and the region's auto industry was mired in economic crisis, it might have seemed obvious that the next generation of automotive research and development would find its natural home in Silicon Valley. On the software side, Uber and Lyft were building headquarters in San Francisco. On the hardware side, Tesla, too, was making California its home. The West Coast would further build on its advantage: a critical combination of tech brainpower and startup brashness. Who needs lumbering old car companies?</p><p>But in the past few years, tech has absorbed two lessons. First, building a car is hard. Of course, building Google was hard, too. But a company that wants to build a car from scratch or sell a driverless-tech innovation to an existing auto company must understand how a physical assembly line works, something that the non-hierarchical tech world hasn't done on a mass scale, but that the Detroit region has long been perfecting.</p><p>Second, it involves an entirely different testing culture - one in which caution and incrementalism are just as important as being first. Uber learned this the hard way last year, when one of its driverless SUVs ran over and killed a pedestrian in Arizona. The Uber vehicle was travelling at high speed on a complex road with only an improperly trained attendant to monitor its path. The attendant predictably got distracted, helping to precipitate the crash.</p><p>Contrast this experience to how Ford-partner Argo is testing driverless vehicles - passengerless, for now - in downtown Detroit. The company requires two trained workers in each vehicle. One watches the road, while the other watches a computer; both talk to each other to ensure that the road matches the computer map and vice versa. As the cars learn, the company keeps the vehicles confined to limited, mapped areas, being sure not to push it further than it can go.</p><p>May Mobility, an Ann Arbor startup, takes the same approach to its downtown Detroit shuttle, which ferries passengers from parking lots to office buildings in partnership with office-property manager Bedrock. The shuttle, confined to a mapped route and attended by a staffer, travels at slow speeds, and will always err on the side of caution. It stops at yellow lights, for example, and stops if it has any question about a pedestrian's path, letting the attendant take over.</p><p>In terms of how to test and build a complex vehicle or a component for such a vehicle in real-world conditions, it's Detroit, not Silicon Valley or Boston, that has the advantage of a dense network of existing brainpower. Detroit is home to 17 \"original-equipment manufacturers,\" or OEMs, in the industry's parlance, and 96 of the nation's top 100 suppliers, as well as three research universities in the region adept at turning out grads for the industry. It also has an infrastructure of test tracks and regulatory relationships.</p><p>At the Detroit Regional Chamber and Michigan Economic Development Corporation's PlanetM landing zone, companies ranging from Lyft to the pedestrian-safety startup Derq have chosen to take advantage of subsidized downtown office space for the chance to collaborate with competitors and potential partners and customers. And though much of the country boasts diverse weather, it's not a bad thing that Detroit offers rain and snow as well as sun for testing AV resilience.</p><p>The city of Detroit, too, can benefit from a thoughtful approach to driverless tech, particularly as the wild predictions of a few years ago - that everyone would be riding around in a driverless car by the year 2020 or so - have dissipated. The technology to make a vehicle fully autonomous - that is, a car that drivers itself - is complex, difficult to power, and difficult to maintain, meaning that it's likely to remain confined to carefully supervised shuttle services and the like for a while.</p><p>That doesn't mean, though, that the city can't benefit from incremental improvements now as it considers how AV fits into its broader transportation strategy for the future. On this front, Detroit can benefit from some existing disadvantages. On providing mass transit, it has nowhere to go but up. Fewer than 8% of Detroit workers take mass transit to work, according to the U.S. Census.</p><p>That means that the city doesn't face the same problem faced by cities such as New York and Boston: that using AV to enable shared rides, such as the May shuttle, might simply take people off a more efficient subway system, defeating the purpose. Then, too, far too much of downtown is covered by parking lots or garages, an inefficient use of urban space. Encouraging more mass transit means that as Detroit rebuilds its population, it could transform some of that currently needed parking space into office buildings or homes.</p><p>Detroit, then, can lead the way in using tech for mass transit. The city could partner with a company such as Via, which provides shared rides within cities ranging from Berlin to New York, to offer a more frequent and faster bus to and from the airport at a slightly higher price than the $2 bus fare. The city could also work with disabled residents for door-to-door service, combining the on-demand aspect of existing ride-hail technology to map efficient routes for frequent, subsidized, shared vans.</p><p>Detroit can also harness autonomous technology to improve safety. Detroit is one of the nation's most dangerous cities for pedestrians - in part because there are so few people crossing wide-open roads on foot. The best remedy for cutting road deaths is density; walkers and cyclists automatically slow drivers. The next-best cure is design; Detroit is already building protected bike lanes and wider sidewalks in a few key areas, and red light and speed cameras would help, too.</p><p>But tech, too, can play a role. More driverless shuttles on the road could themselves change other drivers' behavior, calming traffic both proactively, with their slow speeds and turns, and reactively, with their eyes-on-the-street vigilance making it harder for a hit-and-run driver to escape without notice.</p><p>Over the past two decades, Americans have adjusted to everyday tech, for better and for worse - and over the coming decades, a well-focused Detroit can be the proving ground to help them adjust to tech on urban streets, for better rather than worse.</p><p>Nicole Gelinas is a contributing editor to the Manhattan Institute's City Journal, where she is doing a research project on autonomous technology and Detroit, as part of the Manhattan Institute's Urban Policy Series.

standard complain that proving consumer harm is impossible when the product or service is free, such as social media platforms.\u00a0 But these same advocates argue that big tech's use of data can and

In the 1990s, the cookie was created to play a fundamental role in helping tech companies alleviate storage problems. Back then, people accepted it as something that made the internet work seamlessly. The flip side of that acceptance is that many companies took advantage of it and abused its power.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So much so that this small (4096 Bytes) piece of code has allowed the dark side of Big Data to rise. As the internet became complexly intertwined, cross-site cookies increased the amount of data being collected and shared between platforms, publishers and marketers for mutual commercial gains. In return, consumers were promised a more \"relevant\" experience. Yet, as the media explored the impact of the digital world on events such as the 2016 US presidential elections and the Brexit campaign when the European Union began working on its data regulation, the full, brute force of the privacy debate hit cookies hard, leading to calls for their eradication.</p><p>Among the big tech companies, Apple was the first to capitalize on the discussion when it added its ITP (intelligent tracking prevention) feature to its Safari browser in 2017. What ITP does in simple terms is to reduce the amount of time that cookies can remain on a computer before being deleted. It used to be several days, but Apple has now cut that to 24 hours. This limits their usefulness and changes the way marketers can target consumers with relevant ads on and across platforms. With Safari constituting 15% of global web traffic, other tech giants, including Google's Chrome and its 64% share*, eventually followed suit.</p><p>The search for what will replace the cookie is on. In a recent blog post, Google announced a new initiative to develop a set of open standards to fundamentally enhance privacy on the web. Some observers see this quest as part of a greater battle between Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon and the likes to enrich their own 'walled gardens' or ecosystem. Cutting out tracking in general and cookies will inevitably lead to revenue losses for digital publishers. Google estimates this at 52%. But even without cookies, data collection goes on.</p><p>The ideal and most ethical way forward is and will continue to be log-in ID data. This level of data is not only deterministic data such as email/phone number, but also opt-in data by consumers. Apple recently introduced its own 'log-in with Apple' solution for its consumers, as they enhance their walled garden with services such as TV, Music, News and others like Apple Pay. This is particularly important in the mobile app space where cookies are not applicable. As log-in data is opt-in data, this approach is the right thing to do from a consumer perspective.</p><p>So, what does this all mean for individuals, businesses, the advertising industry and the tech companies?</p><p>Consumers: They will be the biggest winners. Tracking across platforms and devices will decline and data collection will focus more on opt-in models. People are increasingly ready to pay more for both a better experience (consider the rise of subscription-based services) and brands with an ethical approach to privacy. They may end up seeing less relevant or hyper-targeted ads, but these contextually placed messages will be more 'on-topic'.</p><p>Businesses: Companies will need to decide on which side of the privacy conversation they stand. Successful businesses will be the ones investing in data specialists/partnerships to develop data strategies that will ultimately define their data purpose. One goal is to build opt-in experiences that can give consumers both a personalized journey and continuous communication. Businesses will also need to focus on value-based brand messages for the top of their funnel as performance marketing will be impacted by these changes, as will reporting in the short term. Businesses will need to either reset their reporting or plan for what measurement will look like as these changes take hold. Visitor return and conversion rates will be among the most affected metrics.</p><p>Advertising Industry: Performance marketing budgets will be negatively impacted by the changes and, as a result, so will publishers. They will have to either capture a greater share of audiences or develop more content that lives natively on other platforms. Publishers will need consumers to see this content as an essential part of their Internet experience, paying it more than occasional visits. With retargeting being affected, advertising will move back up towards the top of the funnel, with a growing focus on brand-building campaigns. They will tell stories with a stronger purpose to bring consumers closer to brands until they ultimately opt-in to hear more from them. The over-reliance on performance marketing we've seen over the past couple of years will begin to balance out.</p><p>Tech companies: Everyone in the advertising industry will have to work a lot harder to adapt to the new reality but tech companies have a head start. They just need to remain agile in their objectives and dynamics. One stands to gain the most from all this. The richness of Amazon's data and its deep integration into consumers' lives will make the e-commerce giant the ultimate winner from all these changes.</p><p>Digital marketers and publishers must explore a future beyond cookies, at least in their current form, as consumers' trust is fraying quickly. This doesn't mean they need to go back to square one and abandon all forms of tracking or user identification. But the changes will be significant enough to require a readjustment. There will be some pain in the process but there will also be gains. As consumers keep expecting more, businesses will adapt and lead marketing back to its core, while tech companies will grow by offering convenience-based services for all.</p><p>Fadi Maktabi is the general manager of Hearts &amp; Science MENA</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/55/167/50/156877448512.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/55/167/50/156877448512.jpg</url></p><p>Fadi-Maktabi.jpg<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ARBBUS-154230334</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ARBBUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X2V-Y0H1-JDJN-614S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">343615</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"988\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ArabianBusiness.com - ITP Digital Ltd.

The stakes are high, and the outcome will reverberate across the world in a number of spheres, not least the economy. Yet, thus far, most discussions of candidates' economic policy proposals have been based more on feelings or ideology than rigorous analysis.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Barring a major unforeseen catastrophe, U.S. economic performance will play a decisive role in the election. If the economy remains strong - unemployment is at a 50-year low for all workers, and its lowest-ever level for African-Americans and Hispanics - President Donald Trump stands a good chance of winning a second term.</p><p>Yet downside risks are mounting. If they materialize, a Trump victory would become less likely. According to recent models by Moody's Analytics, it would take a tanking economy - or unusually high voter turnout among Democrats, but not Republicans - for Trump to lose in 2020.</p><p>As center-left former Vice President Joe Biden, the early frontrunner for the Democratic Party nomination, loses ground to the far-left U.S. Senator from Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, Trump's chances of success may be rising. Then again, in the 1980 election, the most conservative Republican candidate, Ronald Reagan, was also labeled unelectable.</p><p>If Trump does win a second term, he cannot always be expected to pursue traditionally conservative economic policies, such as his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which brought the U.S. corporate-tax rate in line with the OECD average. Judging by hints from him and his advisers, however, he can be expected to pursue another round of regulatory and tax reform.</p><p>Meanwhile, Democratic presidential candidates favor expanding the social safety net, beginning with health care. While some want to build on President Barack Obama's 2010 Affordable Care Act - which Trump and congressional Republicans failed to \"repeal and replace\" - others hope to eliminate private insurance, on which two-thirds of Americans depend.</p><p>In place of private health insurance, Democrats like Warren and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders plan to introduce a government single-payer system. The costs would be staggering - over $30 trillion in the first decade, by some estimates. Sanders would raise taxes; Warren is trying to dodge saying so. Given the price tag, that would have to mean massive income or payroll tax hikes, or a Europe-style regressive value-added tax, any of which would fall heavily on the middle class and weaken economic incentives.</p><p>But that is not all: Democrats also plan to introduce expensive subsidies, tax breaks, direct spending, loan forgiveness, and other giveaways, insisting that these proposals can be funded largely by increasing taxes on the wealthiest Americans. Biden wants to double the capital gains tax; Warren would almost double the top marginal income-tax rate from 37% to 70%, and both she and Sanders favor new wealth taxes, which even most Nordic countries have abolished. But their math does not add up, by at least an order of magnitude.</p><p>There is one area where Trump and the Democrats both want to spend more: infrastructure. Repairing and maintaining roads, ports, and airports is partly the federal government's responsibility, but state, local, and private finance should be expanded. Neither Trump nor any of the Democratic candidates seeking to challenge him has put forward a serious plan. With neither party focused on fiscal responsibility, the growing unfunded liabilities in Social Security and Medicare, several times the national debt, mean Americans will face far more damaging tax hikes or draconian spending cuts in the future.</p><p>Trump and his Democratic opponents diverge much more sharply on government regulation. Trump has made rolling back excessive Obama-era regulations a high priority. While courts have blocked some of his efforts, as they did to Obama, he has successfully weakened or repealed a number of measures on energy and the environment, health care, and finance that Republicans deemed too costly.</p><p>The Democratic candidates, especially Warren, hope to do just the opposite. Some favor stronger regulation and antitrust enforcement concerning Big Tech, while Sanders and Warren advocate breaking up the sector's largest companies. All support the $10 trillion Green New Deal, an economically, scientifically, and numerically illiterate program, or even more radical plans. A Democratic president could also be expected to tighten financial regulation, and potentially even introduce radical changes to corporate law.</p><p>On trade, Trump has placed a high priority on changing dynamics that he considers unfair. It is on these grounds that he negotiated a modest revision to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which awaits congressional approval, and introduced escalating tariffs on China.</p><p>But the trade war against China that Trump launched last year has become a drag on business investment, dampening the positive effects of his tax and regulatory reforms. Fortunately, the U.S. and China recently reached a temporary agreement forestalling further tariff hikes while a more comprehensive deal is negotiated. Although the Democrats have often criticized Trump's approach, they are not proposing further trade liberalization.</p><p>A final question to consider when assessing the U.S. presidential candidates is whom each would appoint as the next chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve. Trump - who has repeatedly criticized current chair Jerome Powell for pursuing too little monetary-policy easing - would probably select a dovish candidate.</p><p>A left-leaning Democrat might do the same, given the left's fascination with risky ideas that promote massive amounts of Fed-funded debt. Center-leftists - Biden, Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg - might reappoint Powell, who has done a good job, or select a moderate Democratic economist, such as former Fed Vice Chair Alan Blinder or former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers.</p><p>With so many candidates still on the field, investors and financial markets seem to be awaiting stronger signals about the political future and the considerable, but different, economic and financial risks that a victory by each would entail.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Michael J.

The proposal entails appointing a bunch of regulators to undo mergers that her administration would deem anti-competitive. Warren's plan would classify any company that runs a marketplace and makes more than $25 billion a year as a \"platform utility\" and prohibit them from selling their own products.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Considering the prevalent knee-jerk loathing of Big Tech and capitalism in general, it's likely to be a popular idea. Many conservatives, angered at social media platforms, will also find the notion of breaking up these companies agreeable. But there are number of good economic and idealistic reasons to oppose Warren's plan.</p><p>For starters, Warren's plan wouldn't only strip the incentive for big companies to invest in growth and innovation; it would inhibit small-business innovation, as well. It's true that Big Tech frequently swallows enterprises to eliminate competition. Yet many times smaller tech firms don't have access to capital that allows them to bring big ideas to fruition, or they simply can't take the risk. Big corporations can do both.</p><p>I look forward to the day that market forces, rather than meddling politicians with aversions to the profit motive, smash Apple for good. But does anyone believe a gaggle of technocratic political appointees are going to do a better job of allocating investments?</p><p>\"Twenty-five years ago,\" Warren writes, \"Facebook, Google, and Amazon didn't exist. Now they are among the most valuable and well-known companies in the world. It's a great story -- but also one that highlights why the government must break up monopolies and promote competitive markets.\"</p><p>The fact that Facebook, Google and Amazon didn't even exist 25 years ago tells us the exact opposite. It highlights how quickly innovative ideas can transform the marketplace in an era of relative deregulation. I'd tell you to ask the executives at Woolworth's or Blockbuster -- and soon AOL, MySpace and Sears -- but there aren't any.</p><p>Apple or Amazon were early adapters of the market's new realities. Now, some of their businesses are forced to compete with other giants like Walmart or Samsung. This has been beneficial for consumers. Now, if Twitter and Facebook want to stay on top, they probably should stop antagonizing half of their marketplace. Then again, in 25 years, it's quite likely that a bunch of new platforms will overtake both, no matter what they do.</p><p>That hasn't stopped Warren from acting as if tech companies like Google are the new Standard Oil. \"I want a government that makes sure everybody -- even the biggest and most powerful companies in America -- plays by the rules,\" Warren claims. This misleading turn of phrase has become standard on the left, which often acts as if companies are breaking the law or using \"loopholes\" when they fail to adhere to the imaginary regulations. Tech companies aren't breaking any rules by ignoring Warren's fictitious strictures. We already have a place to adjudicate the usefulness of mergers, and it's called the Justice Department. They already do a terrible job without any more help. And if the DOJ is susceptible to partisan pressure -- Democrats are now arguing that Trump ordered it to block the Time Warner/AT&amp;T merger -- surely a second regulatory body based on capricious progressive concepts of the common good would likewise be ripe for abuse.</p><p>A number of voters, regrettably, seem to believe that increasing regulatory oversight helps alleviate the destructive relationship between government and business. Yet, by giving politically motivated regulators expansive powers to dictate how and when companies can grow, Warren would not only imbue government with more power to pick winners and losers, she would further incentivize CEOs to placate government officials and politicians rather than do what's best for their companies and consumers. It would be a lot more productive if we left markets to compete and instead broke up government power.</p><p>\"Curious why I think FB has too much power?\" Warren recently asked on Twitter after Facebook took down some of her ads. \"Let's start with their ability to shut down a debate over whether FB has too much power. Thanks for restoring my posts. But I want a social media marketplace that isn't dominated by a single censor.\"</p><p>A person doesn't need to be exceptionally perceptive to notice that Warren's grievance regarding a \"single censor\" shutting down debate on social media is weakened by the fact that she went to a competing social media platform to perpetuate the debate. Nor did it take much work to find out that virtually every major news site had thoroughly covered her plan to break up Big Tech.</p><p>Her own tweet debunks the notion that a sole social media site can dominate news coverage or a national debate. Taking Instagram away from Facebook would do nothing to induce the social media giant to embrace truly open debate. However, forcing a private entity to run ads that call for its own destruction is an unambiguous attack on free expression.</p><p>In the end, Facebook contends that they removed Warren's ads because they violated company rules against use of its corporate logo. \"In the interest of allowing robust debate, we are restoring the ads,\" the company explained. That makes the tech giant a far more robust space for free expression than your average news channel. And as sure as state intervention into TV news \"fairness\" would backfire so, too, will opening the door to Big Tech intervention.</p><p>David Harsanyi is a senior editor at The Federalist and the author of the book \"First Freedom: A Ride Through America's Enduring History With the Gun.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>\"Warren's plan wouldn't only strip the incentive for big companies to invest in innovation; it would inhibit small-business innovation, as well.\"</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKMI-tdndc574mgr8janu01l46y2eqf</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289C944EC2A39E NWBKMI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VR5-7XR1-JBCN-42X8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401943</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"945\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Digital First Media [Detroit]<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Impeachment involves the House of Representatives exercising a responsibility clearly bestowed on it with broad latitude by the U.S. Constitution, to punish an act by President Donald Trump that was foolish and improper but also squarely within his constitutional powers.</p><p> House Speaker Nancy Pelosi likes to say Trump violated the Constitution on his call with the Ukrainian president, but there's no serious argument for this. The conduct of foreign policy \u2014 and horse-trading with foreign leaders \u2014 is a core presidential duty.</p><p> The problem was mingling personal political priorities with actions in his official capacity, a symptom of one of the worst aspects of Trump's presidency, namely his inability or unwillingness to distinguish between himself and his office. Trump doesn't think institutionally or constitutionally.</p><p> In contrast to his carelessness and highly personalized view of the presidency, Warren offers a carefully thought-out agenda of open contempt for legal and constitutional boundaries. It's not that she, a former Harvard Law professor, doesn't know that they exist; it's that she doesn't care.</p><p> Her broad approach is if she doesn't like something about America, she'll act as president to ban it or curtail it, whether she has the legal or constitutional authority or not. This isn't a trait personal to her. Instead, it is inherent to progressive government, which from its beginnings in the early 20th century strained against constitutional limits it considered antiquated and unnecessary.</p><p> One of Warren's signature domestic proposals is her wealth tax. Without dwelling on the complex legal arguments, her plan is constitutionally dubious, at best, and would instantly end up in the Supreme Court if it ever passed.</p><p> Someone scrupulously committed to the Constitution would want to steer clear on this basis alone, but \"constitutionally or legally suspect\" is the unifying thread of much of the Warren agenda.</p><p> As conservative writer David French points out, her proposed executive order prohibiting fracking obviously runs afoul of a 2005 federal law protecting it from federal regulation. She is promising to do something illegal, pure and simple.</p><p> And on it goes. She says she would act unilaterally to expand background checks for gun purchases, circumventing Congress. She wants to tax lobbying, an activity protected under the First Amendment, in yet another constitutionally fraught initiative. She wants to break up Big Tech, although it's not clear under what authority.</p><p> Tellingly, almost no one on her side says, \"I appreciate what you're getting at Liz, but you can't do that.\"</p><p> To their credit, a couple of CNN panelists pressed her in July on the constitutional basis of her wealth tax, and she just waved them off. Needless to say, the op-ed pages and airwaves weren't thick with denunciations of her casual dismissal of the Constitution.</p><p> This gets to a marked, and annoying, hypocrisy in the reaction to Trump's Ukraine call. The same people who are most convinced that it is somehow unconstitutional or illegal didn't raise a peep when President Barack Obama rewrote immigration law on his own after repeatedly, and correctly, saying he didn't have the power to do it.</p><p> To be sure, the reliable, consistent constituency for strictly bounded executive action is vanishingly small. It amounts to about a dozen senators, those Republicans brave enough to oppose Trump's emergency declaration to repurpose military funding for the border wall, the most problematic of his executive actions.</p><p> All you need to know about how seriously most of the left takes the Constitution is that at the same time it's freaking out about Trump, it's boosting the prospects of Warren, who is promising to ignore it as a matter of policy.</p><p> @RichLowry</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKTX-36efd8b642e9799eb6224a70ceaee6f1c2cd673</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28D975F56B8A06 NWBKTX2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8P-MTG1-DXVP-V2SV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401983</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"692\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

As Democrats realize, with some broadening of his appeal, Mr. Trump could make that happen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Following that 2020 re-election rally kick-off came the rising tensions with Iran, including a flare-up over the shooting down of an unmanned U.S. drone. Mr. Trump shot down hawks on his foreign-policy team who wanted a vigorous military response.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I'm not looking for war,\" he said.</p><p>How refreshing is that? His Republican Party, because of its trigger-happiness, has often been called the war party. But he's made it clear since being elected that he's more of a peacenik than a warmonger. That's a position that does in fact broaden his appeal beyond his base. It's moving in on Democratic turf.</p><p>The 20 Democrats contending for the party's presidential nomination take to the debate stage to make the case against him Wednesday and Thursday. There will be 10 one night in Miami, 10 the next.</p><p>The race has taken a strange turn. The candidate on the rise now is the one whom many decry as the new Hillary Clinton. That would be Senator Elizabeth Warren who is of similar age and has a somewhat similar look as Ms. Clinton and who, like her, is a highly educated policy wonk from the northeast who has been accused of being shrill and elitist.</p><p>In other words, an ideal target for bottom-feeding, intellectually bankrupt Trumpians.</p><p>Ms. Warren was taken for dead or close to it following a controversy in which she claimed to be of Native American descent. But she has stormed back mainly on account of pitching herself as the candidate of real depth and real change.</p><p>She and her team of brainiacs have put out thick policy books on every subject imaginable. Her rallying cry is \"I have a plan for that.\"</p><p>Her vision is to transform the American economy, rebalancing the power of labour and capital with intrusive, federally directed industrial policy. Seats on corporate boards would go to workers.</p><p>Big tech would be regulated with trust-busting fervour. The ultrarich would be taxed like never before. Her plans include a US$2trillion federal investment in climate-friendly industries, universal child care and free higher education.</p><p>It's a new deal for the country, a frontal attack on income equality. Bernie Sanders was the radical candidate, but he's coming across as same old, same old, while she's a torpedo whose program cuts into his support and makes what Ms. Clinton offered appear wishy-washy.</p><p>What also has allowed Ms. Warren to score well is mistakes by the other lead contenders.</p><p>\"Gaffe machine\" Joe Biden lived up to the billing last week by boasting about how well he used to work with old segregationist senators. He had already drawn fire on racial issues because of his position as a young senator opposing school busing as a path to desegregation. Now he gratuitously raised the controversy again. His performance on the hustings has been halting. He comes across as old, which he is.</p><p>Meanwhile Pete Buttigieg, the policy-vague mayor of South Bend, Ind., who got off to a hot start, has been embroiled in a controversy in his hometown over his handling of the shooting of a black man by a white police officer.</p><p>Senator Kamala Harris, who also started off well, has gone nowhere since because few know where she really stands. Amy Klobuchar has hit the ground strolling and Beto O'Rourke has receded owing in part to a senseless decision to avoid doing televised town halls.</p><p>Of course, the Warren boomlet could well be a temporary thing.</p><p>A month from now, another candidate could steal the momentum and become, to borrow a sports term, the \"Big Mo.\" And a month from then, another. But Ms. Warren is focused and daunting and has an organization of Prussian precision.</p><p>Because there are so many candidates in the debates, each will have only a few minutes to make their case. It's a format that favours fluff over substance, candidates who can get off zingers that TV producers love to replay.</p><p>Ms. Warren will face heavy headwinds. She will be labelled an extremist. The Trumpians will delight in tagging her as the new Hillary. But her all-substance approach is getting traction. In the dumbed-down, knuckle-dragging arena of American politics, that is great to see.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOBML-GAM20190626comartinwarren</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOBML2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WF0-22S1-F06S-34FG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303830</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"710\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.
