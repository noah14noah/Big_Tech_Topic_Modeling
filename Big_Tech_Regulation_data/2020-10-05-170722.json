But while schools and parents have been warned to keep vigilant, and Prime Minister Scott Morrison has demanded TikTok remove the video, there's very little the government can actually do to get rid of it, despite new laws about restricting violent content online passed in the wake of the Christchurch shooting last year.  That's because, according to a spokesperson for the eSafety Commissioner, the video, which depicts a suicide, does not fit within the law's definition of violent and abhorrent material.   It's another reminder that both regulators and tech companies are, for different reasons, utterly useless at cleaning up the internet.\u00a0 <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Christchurch video</emphasis> The most prominent recent example was that of the Christchurch massacre last year. The shooter wanted people to watch his attack, filmed like a video game, and livestreamed on Facebook. It quickly spread across the internet, on YouTube and Twitter, leaving the biggest, most powerful tech companies in the world playing catch-up.   A version of the video <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/15/video-of-christchurch-attack-runs-on-social-media-and-news-sites\">stayed up</url> on Facebook for six hours. Many wildly irresponsible TV news companies broadcast grabs from the video, which made it <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/story/new-zealand-shooting-video-social-media/\">harder</url> for some tech platforms' algorithms to figure out what to remove <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The game</emphasis> Australia's only real legislative response to the Christchurch shootings was to pass laws restricting violent material on the internet. As the TikTok fiasco shows, they've been pretty ineffective, and generally do nothing to stop the spread of reactionary ideas.   As <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2019/10/21/christchurch-shooter-meme-white-supremacy/\">Crikey</url> reported last year, they could not be used to remove the website selling a far-right computer game that allowed users to re-enact the Christchurch shooting. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QAnon</emphasis> In August, Facebook finally began cracking down on groups and pages promoting <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/09/04/qanon-conspiracy-theory-future-of-politics/\">QAnon</url>, the sprawling conspiracy that claims US President Donald Trump is saving the world from a cabal of Satanic paedophiles. But according to the University of Tasmania's Kaz Ross, a seasoned QAnon watcher, the purge had little impact on the community in Australia  \"A number of the bigger Facebook groups didn't openly identify as Q groups at that point, so weren't affected,\" Ross said  \"Lots of smaller groups have continued, and even when the original group has been thrown off Facebook, they've managed to create new groups.\"  But while much of the QAnon infrastructure did remain on Facebook, the threat was enough to drive many in Australia onto Telegram, an anonoymous, far more radical online echo chamber frequented by neo-Nazis and white supremacist types.\u00a0 <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Child pornography</emphasis> Big Tech platforms have a paedophilia problem. On YouTube, predators use comments' sections to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/youtube-pedophile-videos-advertising\">\"advertise\"</url> and sexualise what might be seemingly innocent videos of children. Facebook is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/technology/facebook-cant-combat-child-pornography-as-moderators-tell-all-in-court/news-story/952b79ef989343428ffc008f0fc8a71a\">facing lawsuits</url> from former moderators, in part over trauma caused by the company's inability to get rid of child pornography. Recently, Australian Federal Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw accused Facebook of contributing to the rape and torture of children. You can't regulate for malice The common thread across these disparate issues -- suicide, terrorism, far-right propaganda, child pornography -- isn't the unwillingness of platforms to remove content that there is wide agreement needs to be removed.   Major social media platforms devote substantial resources (though, invariably, never enough to satisfy critics) to identifying and removing content both manually -- a gruesome and deeply distressing job for the workers concerned -- and using complex algorithms designed to identify content automatically.\u00a0  Rather, it's the willingness of large numbers of malicious online actors to defeat those attempts, often with endless variations of content presentation designed to prevent algorithmic blocks, variations often honed in copyright infringement, another area where platforms have worked to take down unwanted content.   The perpetrators might be terrorists, right-wing extremists or child abusers, or they might simply be trolls who derive shits and giggles from disseminating transgressive content for the specific reason that wider society wants to block it.  Stopping them is much harder than simply shutting down a site (e.g. 8chan) used as a meeting place for aberrant communities, or banning a high-profile individual from a platform (e.g. Milo Yiannopoulos). That process might be something akin to whack-a-mole -- the trolls/criminals find another site to congregate at -- but the lives of the moles are significantly disrupted. Short of shutting down Facebook/Youtube/Tiktok/Twitter/this week's social media target, it's impossible to regulate for stupidity and malice.  This is what we gave up for the internet -- the ability of large corporations and governments to play gatekeeper on content. That's now down to consumers themselves. And many consumers are deeply, deeply unpleasant people.   The internet gives them a platform like it gives the rest of us a platform.\u00a0 </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60VC-2HY1-JD6R-T195-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"852\"/><timeReceived>12:35:35 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 10, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But while schools and parents have been warned to keep vigilant, and Prime Minister Scott Morrison has demanded TikTok remove the video, there's very little the government can actually do to get rid of it, despite new laws about restricting violent content online passed in the wake of the Christchurch shooting last year.  That's because, according to a spokesperson for the eSafety Commissioner, the video, which depicts a suicide, does not fit within the law's definition of violent and abhorrent material.   It's another reminder that both regulators and tech companies are, for different reasons, utterly useless at cleaning up the internet.\u00a0 <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Christchurch video</emphasis> The most prominent recent example was that of the Christchurch massacre last year.

But while schools and parents have been warned to keep vigilant, and Prime Minister Scott Morrison has demanded TikTok remove the video, there's very little the government can actually do to get rid of it, despite new laws about restricting violent content online passed in the wake of the Christchurch shooting last year.  That's because, according to a spokesperson for the eSafety Commissioner, the video, which depicts a suicide, does not fit within the law's definition of violent and abhorrent material.   It's another reminder that both regulators and tech companies are, for different reasons, utterly useless at cleaning up the internet.\u00a0 <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Christchurch video</emphasis> The most prominent recent example was that of the Christchurch massacre last year. The shooter wanted people to watch his attack, filmed like a video game, and livestreamed on Facebook. It quickly spread across the internet, on YouTube and Twitter, leaving the biggest, most powerful tech companies in the world playing catch-up.   A version of the video <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/15/video-of-christchurch-attack-runs-on-social-media-and-news-sites\">stayed up</url> on Facebook for six hours. Many wildly irresponsible TV news companies broadcast grabs from the video, which made it <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/story/new-zealand-shooting-video-social-media/\">harder</url> for some tech platforms' algorithms to figure out what to remove <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The game</emphasis> Australia's only real legislative response to the Christchurch shootings was to pass laws restricting violent material on the internet. As the TikTok fiasco shows, they've been pretty ineffective, and generally do nothing to stop the spread of reactionary ideas.   As <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2019/10/21/christchurch-shooter-meme-white-supremacy/\">Crikey</url> reported last year, they could not be used to remove the website selling a far-right computer game that allowed users to re-enact the Christchurch shooting. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QAnon</emphasis> In August, Facebook finally began cracking down on groups and pages promoting <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/09/04/qanon-conspiracy-theory-future-of-politics/\">QAnon</url>, the sprawling conspiracy that claims US President Donald Trump is saving the world from a cabal of Satanic paedophiles. But according to the University of Tasmania's Kaz Ross, a seasoned QAnon watcher, the purge had little impact on the community in Australia  \"A number of the bigger Facebook groups didn't openly identify as Q groups at that point, so weren't affected,\" Ross said  \"Lots of smaller groups have continued, and even when the original group has been thrown off Facebook, they've managed to create new groups.\"  But while much of the QAnon infrastructure did remain on Facebook, the threat was enough to drive many in Australia onto Telegram, an anonoymous, far more radical online echo chamber frequented by neo-Nazis and white supremacist types.\u00a0 <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Child pornography</emphasis> Big Tech platforms have a paedophilia problem. On YouTube, predators use comments' sections to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/youtube-pedophile-videos-advertising\">\"advertise\"</url> and sexualise what might be seemingly innocent videos of children. Facebook is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/technology/facebook-cant-combat-child-pornography-as-moderators-tell-all-in-court/news-story/952b79ef989343428ffc008f0fc8a71a\">facing lawsuits</url> from former moderators, in part over trauma caused by the company's inability to get rid of child pornography. Recently, Australian Federal Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw accused Facebook of contributing to the rape and torture of children. You can't regulate for malice The common thread across these disparate issues -- suicide, terrorism, far-right propaganda, child pornography -- isn't the unwillingness of platforms to remove content that there is wide agreement needs to be removed.   Major social media platforms devote substantial resources (though, invariably, never enough to satisfy critics) to identifying and removing content both manually -- a gruesome and deeply distressing job for the workers concerned -- and using complex algorithms designed to identify content automatically.\u00a0  Rather, it's the willingness of large numbers of malicious online actors to defeat those attempts, often with endless variations of content presentation designed to prevent algorithmic blocks, variations often honed in copyright infringement, another area where platforms have worked to take down unwanted content.   The perpetrators might be terrorists, right-wing extremists or child abusers, or they might simply be trolls who derive shits and giggles from disseminating transgressive content for the specific reason that wider society wants to block it.  Stopping them is much harder than simply shutting down a site (e.g. 8chan) used as a meeting place for aberrant communities, or banning a high-profile individual from a platform (e.g. Milo Yiannopoulos). That process might be something akin to whack-a-mole -- the trolls/criminals find another site to congregate at -- but the lives of the moles are significantly disrupted. Short of shutting down Facebook/Youtube/Tiktok/Twitter/this week's social media target, it's impossible to regulate for stupidity and malice.  This is what we gave up for the internet -- the ability of large corporations and governments to play gatekeeper on content. That's now down to consumers themselves. And many consumers are deeply, deeply unpleasant people.   The internet gives them a platform like it gives the rest of us a platform.\u00a0 </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60W1-0451-JD6R-T4HV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"852\"/><timeReceived>12:35:35 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 10, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But while schools and parents have been warned to keep vigilant, and Prime Minister Scott Morrison has demanded TikTok remove the video, there's very little the government can actually do to get rid of it, despite new laws about restricting violent content online passed in the wake of the Christchurch shooting last year.  That's because, according to a spokesperson for the eSafety Commissioner, the video, which depicts a suicide, does not fit within the law's definition of violent and abhorrent material.   It's another reminder that both regulators and tech companies are, for different reasons, utterly useless at cleaning up the internet.\u00a0 <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Christchurch video</emphasis> The most prominent recent example was that of the Christchurch massacre last year. The shooter wanted people to watch his attack, filmed like a video game, and livestreamed on Facebook. It quickly spread across the internet, on YouTube and Twitter, leaving the biggest, most powerful tech companies in the world playing catch-up.   A version of the video <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/15/video-of-christchurch-attack-runs-on-social-media-and-news-sites\">stayed up</url> on Facebook for six hours. Many wildly irresponsible TV news companies broadcast grabs from the video, which made it <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/story/new-zealand-shooting-video-social-media/\">harder</url> for some tech platforms' algorithms to figure out what to remove <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The game</emphasis> Australia's only real legislative response to the Christchurch shootings was to pass laws restricting violent material on the internet. As the TikTok fiasco shows, they've been pretty ineffective, and generally do nothing to stop the spread of reactionary ideas.   As <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2019/10/21/christchurch-shooter-meme-white-supremacy/\">Crikey</url> reported last year, they could not be used to remove the website selling a far-right computer game that allowed users to re-enact the Christchurch shooting. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QAnon</emphasis> In August, Facebook finally began cracking down on groups and pages promoting <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/09/04/qanon-conspiracy-theory-future-of-politics/\">QAnon</url>, the sprawling conspiracy that claims US President Donald Trump is saving the world from a cabal of Satanic paedophiles. But according to the University of Tasmania's Kaz Ross, a seasoned QAnon watcher, the purge had little impact on the community in Australia  \"A number of the bigger Facebook groups didn't openly identify as Q groups at that point, so weren't affected,\" Ross said  \"Lots of smaller groups have continued, and even when the original group has been thrown off Facebook, they've managed to create new groups.\"  But while much of the QAnon infrastructure did remain on Facebook, the threat was enough to drive many in Australia onto Telegram, an anonoymous, far more radical online echo chamber frequented by neo-Nazis and white supremacist types.\u00a0 <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Child pornography</emphasis> Big Tech platforms have a paedophilia problem. On YouTube, predators use comments' sections to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/youtube-pedophile-videos-advertising\">\"advertise\"</url> and sexualise what might be seemingly innocent videos of children. Facebook is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/technology/facebook-cant-combat-child-pornography-as-moderators-tell-all-in-court/news-story/952b79ef989343428ffc008f0fc8a71a\">facing lawsuits</url> from former moderators, in part over trauma caused by the company's inability to get rid of child pornography. Recently, Australian Federal Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw accused Facebook of contributing to the rape and torture of children. You can't regulate for malice The common thread across these disparate issues -- suicide, terrorism, far-right propaganda, child pornography -- isn't the unwillingness of platforms to remove content that there is wide agreement needs to be removed.   Major social media platforms devote substantial resources (though, invariably, never enough to satisfy critics) to identifying and removing content both manually -- a gruesome and deeply distressing job for the workers concerned -- and using complex algorithms designed to identify content automatically.\u00a0  Rather, it's the willingness of large numbers of malicious online actors to defeat those attempts, often with endless variations of content presentation designed to prevent algorithmic blocks, variations often honed in copyright infringement, another area where platforms have worked to take down unwanted content.   The perpetrators might be terrorists, right-wing extremists or child abusers, or they might simply be trolls who derive shits and giggles from disseminating transgressive content for the specific reason that wider society wants to block it.  Stopping them is much harder than simply shutting down a site (e.g. 8chan) used as a meeting place for aberrant communities, or banning a high-profile individual from a platform (e.g. Milo Yiannopoulos). That process might be something akin to whack-a-mole -- the trolls/criminals find another site to congregate at -- but the lives of the moles are significantly disrupted. Short of shutting down Facebook/Youtube/Tiktok/Twitter/this week's social media target, it's impossible to regulate for stupidity and malice.  This is what we gave up for the internet -- the ability of large corporations and governments to play gatekeeper on content. That's now down to consumers themselves. And many consumers are deeply, deeply unpleasant people.   The internet gives them a platform like it gives the rest of us a platform.\u00a0 </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60T9-6KS1-F0NT-H17R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"852\"/><timeReceived>12:35:35 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 10, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But while schools and parents have been warned to keep vigilant, and Prime Minister Scott Morrison has demanded TikTok remove the video, there's very little the government can actually do to get rid of it, despite new laws about restricting violent content online passed in the wake of the Christchurch shooting last year.  That's because, according to a spokesperson for the eSafety Commissioner, the video, which depicts a suicide, does not fit within the law's definition of violent and abhorrent material.   It's another reminder that both regulators and tech companies are, for different reasons, utterly useless at cleaning up the internet.\u00a0 <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Christchurch video</emphasis> The most prominent recent example was that of the Christchurch massacre last year. The shooter wanted people to watch his attack, filmed like a video game, and livestreamed on Facebook. It quickly spread across the internet, on YouTube and Twitter, leaving the biggest, most powerful tech companies in the world playing catch-up.   A version of the video <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/15/video-of-christchurch-attack-runs-on-social-media-and-news-sites\">stayed up</url> on Facebook for six hours. Many wildly irresponsible TV news companies broadcast grabs from the video, which made it <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/story/new-zealand-shooting-video-social-media/\">harder</url> for some tech platforms' algorithms to figure out what to remove <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The game</emphasis> Australia's only real legislative response to the Christchurch shootings was to pass laws restricting violent material on the internet. As the TikTok fiasco shows, they've been pretty ineffective, and generally do nothing to stop the spread of reactionary ideas.   As <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2019/10/21/christchurch-shooter-meme-white-supremacy/\">Crikey</url> reported last year, they could not be used to remove the website selling a far-right computer game that allowed users to re-enact the Christchurch shooting. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QAnon</emphasis> In August, Facebook finally began cracking down on groups and pages promoting <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/09/04/qanon-conspiracy-theory-future-of-politics/\">QAnon</url>, the sprawling conspiracy that claims US President Donald Trump is saving the world from a cabal of Satanic paedophiles. But according to the University of Tasmania's Kaz Ross, a seasoned QAnon watcher, the purge had little impact on the community in Australia  \"A number of the bigger Facebook groups didn't openly identify as Q groups at that point, so weren't affected,\" Ross said  \"Lots of smaller groups have continued, and even when the original group has been thrown off Facebook, they've managed to create new groups.\"  But while much of the QAnon infrastructure did remain on Facebook, the threat was enough to drive many in Australia onto Telegram, an anonoymous, far more radical online echo chamber frequented by neo-Nazis and white supremacist types.\u00a0 <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Child pornography</emphasis> Big Tech platforms have a paedophilia problem. On YouTube, predators use comments' sections to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/youtube-pedophile-videos-advertising\">\"advertise\"</url> and sexualise what might be seemingly innocent videos of children. Facebook is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/technology/facebook-cant-combat-child-pornography-as-moderators-tell-all-in-court/news-story/952b79ef989343428ffc008f0fc8a71a\">facing lawsuits</url> from former moderators, in part over trauma caused by the company's inability to get rid of child pornography. Recently, Australian Federal Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw accused Facebook of contributing to the rape and torture of children. You can't regulate for malice The common thread across these disparate issues -- suicide, terrorism, far-right propaganda, child pornography -- isn't the unwillingness of platforms to remove content that there is wide agreement needs to be removed.   Major social media platforms devote substantial resources (though, invariably, never enough to satisfy critics) to identifying and removing content both manually -- a gruesome and deeply distressing job for the workers concerned -- and using complex algorithms designed to identify content automatically.\u00a0  Rather, it's the willingness of large numbers of malicious online actors to defeat those attempts, often with endless variations of content presentation designed to prevent algorithmic blocks, variations often honed in copyright infringement, another area where platforms have worked to take down unwanted content.   The perpetrators might be terrorists, right-wing extremists or child abusers, or they might simply be trolls who derive shits and giggles from disseminating transgressive content for the specific reason that wider society wants to block it.  Stopping them is much harder than simply shutting down a site (e.g. 8chan) used as a meeting place for aberrant communities, or banning a high-profile individual from a platform (e.g. Milo Yiannopoulos). That process might be something akin to whack-a-mole -- the trolls/criminals find another site to congregate at -- but the lives of the moles are significantly disrupted. Short of shutting down Facebook/Youtube/Tiktok/Twitter/this week's social media target, it's impossible to regulate for stupidity and malice.  This is what we gave up for the internet -- the ability of large corporations and governments to play gatekeeper on content. That's now down to consumers themselves. And many consumers are deeply, deeply unpleasant people.   The internet gives them a platform like it gives the rest of us a platform.\u00a0 </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60V5-39T1-JD6R-T00Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"852\"/><timeReceived>12:35:35 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 10, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But while schools and parents have been warned to keep vigilant, and Prime Minister Scott Morrison has demanded TikTok remove the video, there's very little the government can actually do to get rid of it, despite new laws about restricting violent content online passed in the wake of the Christchurch shooting last year.  That's because, according to a spokesperson for the eSafety Commissioner, the video, which depicts a suicide, does not fit within the law's definition of violent and abhorrent material.   It's another reminder that both regulators and tech companies are, for different reasons, utterly useless at cleaning up the internet.\u00a0 <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Christchurch video</emphasis> The most prominent recent example was that of the Christchurch massacre last year. The shooter wanted people to watch his attack, filmed like a video game, and livestreamed on Facebook. It quickly spread across the internet, on YouTube and Twitter, leaving the biggest, most powerful tech companies in the world playing catch-up.   A version of the video <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/15/video-of-christchurch-attack-runs-on-social-media-and-news-sites\">stayed up</url> on Facebook for six hours. Many wildly irresponsible TV news companies broadcast grabs from the video, which made it <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/story/new-zealand-shooting-video-social-media/\">harder</url> for some tech platforms' algorithms to figure out what to remove <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The game</emphasis> Australia's only real legislative response to the Christchurch shootings was to pass laws restricting violent material on the internet. As the TikTok fiasco shows, they've been pretty ineffective, and generally do nothing to stop the spread of reactionary ideas.   As <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2019/10/21/christchurch-shooter-meme-white-supremacy/\">Crikey</url> reported last year, they could not be used to remove the website selling a far-right computer game that allowed users to re-enact the Christchurch shooting. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QAnon</emphasis> In August, Facebook finally began cracking down on groups and pages promoting <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/09/04/qanon-conspiracy-theory-future-of-politics/\">QAnon</url>, the sprawling conspiracy that claims US President Donald Trump is saving the world from a cabal of Satanic paedophiles. But according to the University of Tasmania's Kaz Ross, a seasoned QAnon watcher, the purge had little impact on the community in Australia  \"A number of the bigger Facebook groups didn't openly identify as Q groups at that point, so weren't affected,\" Ross said  \"Lots of smaller groups have continued, and even when the original group has been thrown off Facebook, they've managed to create new groups.\"  But while much of the QAnon infrastructure did remain on Facebook, the threat was enough to drive many in Australia onto Telegram, an anonoymous, far more radical online echo chamber frequented by neo-Nazis and white supremacist types.\u00a0 <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Child pornography</emphasis> Big Tech platforms have a paedophilia problem. On YouTube, predators use comments' sections to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/youtube-pedophile-videos-advertising\">\"advertise\"</url> and sexualise what might be seemingly innocent videos of children. Facebook is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/technology/facebook-cant-combat-child-pornography-as-moderators-tell-all-in-court/news-story/952b79ef989343428ffc008f0fc8a71a\">facing lawsuits</url> from former moderators, in part over trauma caused by the company's inability to get rid of child pornography. Recently, Australian Federal Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw accused Facebook of contributing to the rape and torture of children. You can't regulate for malice The common thread across these disparate issues -- suicide, terrorism, far-right propaganda, child pornography -- isn't the unwillingness of platforms to remove content that there is wide agreement needs to be removed.   Major social media platforms devote substantial resources (though, invariably, never enough to satisfy critics) to identifying and removing content both manually -- a gruesome and deeply distressing job for the workers concerned -- and using complex algorithms designed to identify content automatically.\u00a0  Rather, it's the willingness of large numbers of malicious online actors to defeat those attempts, often with endless variations of content presentation designed to prevent algorithmic blocks, variations often honed in copyright infringement, another area where platforms have worked to take down unwanted content.   The perpetrators might be terrorists, right-wing extremists or child abusers, or they might simply be trolls who derive shits and giggles from disseminating transgressive content for the specific reason that wider society wants to block it.  Stopping them is much harder than simply shutting down a site (e.g. 8chan) used as a meeting place for aberrant communities, or banning a high-profile individual from a platform (e.g. Milo Yiannopoulos). That process might be something akin to whack-a-mole -- the trolls/criminals find another site to congregate at -- but the lives of the moles are significantly disrupted. Short of shutting down Facebook/Youtube/Tiktok/Twitter/this week's social media target, it's impossible to regulate for stupidity and malice.  This is what we gave up for the internet -- the ability of large corporations and governments to play gatekeeper on content. That's now down to consumers themselves. And many consumers are deeply, deeply unpleasant people.   The internet gives them a platform like it gives the rest of us a platform.\u00a0 </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60W1-9721-F0NT-H0PP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"852\"/><timeReceived>12:35:35 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 10, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But while schools and parents have been warned to keep vigilant, and Prime Minister Scott Morrison has demanded TikTok remove the video, there's very little the government can actually do to get rid of it, despite new laws about restricting violent content online passed in the wake of the Christchurch shooting last year.  That's because, according to a spokesperson for the eSafety Commissioner, the video, which depicts a suicide, does not fit within the law's definition of violent and abhorrent material.   It's another reminder that both regulators and tech companies are, for different reasons, utterly useless at cleaning up the internet.\u00a0 <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Christchurch video</emphasis> The most prominent recent example was that of the Christchurch massacre last year. The shooter wanted people to watch his attack, filmed like a video game, and livestreamed on Facebook. It quickly spread across the internet, on YouTube and Twitter, leaving the biggest, most powerful tech companies in the world playing catch-up.   A version of the video <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/15/video-of-christchurch-attack-runs-on-social-media-and-news-sites\">stayed up</url> on Facebook for six hours. Many wildly irresponsible TV news companies broadcast grabs from the video, which made it <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/story/new-zealand-shooting-video-social-media/\">harder</url> for some tech platforms' algorithms to figure out what to remove <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The game</emphasis> Australia's only real legislative response to the Christchurch shootings was to pass laws restricting violent material on the internet. As the TikTok fiasco shows, they've been pretty ineffective, and generally do nothing to stop the spread of reactionary ideas.   As <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2019/10/21/christchurch-shooter-meme-white-supremacy/\">Crikey</url> reported last year, they could not be used to remove the website selling a far-right computer game that allowed users to re-enact the Christchurch shooting. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QAnon</emphasis> In August, Facebook finally began cracking down on groups and pages promoting <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2020/09/04/qanon-conspiracy-theory-future-of-politics/\">QAnon</url>, the sprawling conspiracy that claims US President Donald Trump is saving the world from a cabal of Satanic paedophiles. But according to the University of Tasmania's Kaz Ross, a seasoned QAnon watcher, the purge had little impact on the community in Australia  \"A number of the bigger Facebook groups didn't openly identify as Q groups at that point, so weren't affected,\" Ross said  \"Lots of smaller groups have continued, and even when the original group has been thrown off Facebook, they've managed to create new groups.\"  But while much of the QAnon infrastructure did remain on Facebook, the threat was enough to drive many in Australia onto Telegram, an anonoymous, far more radical online echo chamber frequented by neo-Nazis and white supremacist types.\u00a0 <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Child pornography</emphasis> Big Tech platforms have a paedophilia problem. On YouTube, predators use comments' sections to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/youtube-pedophile-videos-advertising\">\"advertise\"</url> and sexualise what might be seemingly innocent videos of children. Facebook is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/technology/facebook-cant-combat-child-pornography-as-moderators-tell-all-in-court/news-story/952b79ef989343428ffc008f0fc8a71a\">facing lawsuits</url> from former moderators, in part over trauma caused by the company's inability to get rid of child pornography. Recently, Australian Federal Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw accused Facebook of contributing to the rape and torture of children. You can't regulate for malice The common thread across these disparate issues -- suicide, terrorism, far-right propaganda, child pornography -- isn't the unwillingness of platforms to remove content that there is wide agreement needs to be removed.   Major social media platforms devote substantial resources (though, invariably, never enough to satisfy critics) to identifying and removing content both manually -- a gruesome and deeply distressing job for the workers concerned -- and using complex algorithms designed to identify content automatically.\u00a0  Rather, it's the willingness of large numbers of malicious online actors to defeat those attempts, often with endless variations of content presentation designed to prevent algorithmic blocks, variations often honed in copyright infringement, another area where platforms have worked to take down unwanted content.   The perpetrators might be terrorists, right-wing extremists or child abusers, or they might simply be trolls who derive shits and giggles from disseminating transgressive content for the specific reason that wider society wants to block it.  Stopping them is much harder than simply shutting down a site (e.g. 8chan) used as a meeting place for aberrant communities, or banning a high-profile individual from a platform (e.g. Milo Yiannopoulos). That process might be something akin to whack-a-mole -- the trolls/criminals find another site to congregate at -- but the lives of the moles are significantly disrupted. Short of shutting down Facebook/Youtube/Tiktok/Twitter/this week's social media target, it's impossible to regulate for stupidity and malice.  This is what we gave up for the internet -- the ability of large corporations and governments to play gatekeeper on content. That's now down to consumers themselves. And many consumers are deeply, deeply unpleasant people.   The internet gives them a platform like it gives the rest of us a platform.\u00a0 </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60VK-1M11-JD6R-T1YF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"852\"/><timeReceived>12:35:35 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 10, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

So, investors must be interested in knowing about Biden's political strategy and its impact on the investment world. Biden Wants Tax Hike: Good for US Manufacturing &amp;#38; Infrastructure?</p><p> His winning means the partial rollback of President Trump's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Notably, President Trump's tax law lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, starting 2018. Analysis by the Tax Foundation reveals that Biden's plan is to hike the corporate tax rate to 28%.Biden is also proposing tolevy a minimum tax rate of 15%,[2]a potentially damaging outcome for some major companies that pay little in taxes. Biden's tax plan points at revenues needed to pay down the huge debt incurred to fight the recession.While tax hike is a negative for Wall Street, Biden's push for tax incentives will encourage domestic manufacturing. Biden proposed a $1.3-trillion infrastructure overhaul last year. The Democratic presidential candidate's campaign aims to invest in restoring highways, roads and bridges, changing water pipes, building out rural broadband access and updating schools and etc.The proposals should boost ETFs like iShares U.S. Infrastructure ETF IFRA[3] and Invesco Dynamic Building &amp;#38; Construction ETF PKB[4] and First Trust RBA American Industrial Renaissance ETF (AIRR). Clean Energy in Sweet Spot Like many other democratic leaders, Biden is a proponent of clean energy investing. If Democrats rule the Congress and White House again, the stocks in the space will get a boost. Biden is forming a plan \u2014 a Clean Energy Revolution \u2014 to address the issue of climate emergency. He sees America becoming a 100% clean energy economy with net-zero emissions no later than 2050.The move could further benefit stocks likeFirst Solar Inc. (FSLR[5])or electric vehicle giantTesla(TSLA) and ETFs likeInvesco Solar ETF(TAN) andiShares Global Clean Energy ETFICLN[6]. The United States has about 40% exposure to the global fund ICLN. Another Strong Spell for Big Tech? Biden's foreign policy appears to be more liberal than Trump's. So, pro-immigrant hiring policies (tech companies are highly immigrant-reliant) and moderate antitrust scrutiny would likely boost Amazon.com Inc. and other Big Tech companies in the Biden era,per many policy analysts, as quoted on S&amp;#38;P Global[7]. This along with better relations with China will provide another tailwind to tech shares.Amazon has solid exposure to funds likeFidelity MSCI Consumer Discretionary Index ETF FDIS[8] while tech funds like Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK[9] are heavy onMicrosoft and Apple. Will Dollar Weaken? Rock-bottom interest rates, higher taxes, ebbing tensions with China and a relatively tepid Wall Street could result in the weakness in the greenback if Biden wins, although that could be tempered by a big fiscal stimulus, per foreign exchange analysts as quoted on S&amp;#38;P Global [10].A weaker dollar would make U.S. exports cheaper, benefiting large-cap stocks with greater exposure to foreign markets. This will also narrow the widening trade deficit. However, we do not expect the weakness to be too grave to hurt the greenback and question its safe-haven status.So, investors looking to play the likely weakness in the U.S. dollar could consider inverse-dollar ETF Invesco DB US Dollar Index Bearish Fund UDN[11], large-cap ETF SPDR S&amp;#38;P 500 ETF Trust SPY[12] and gold bullion ETF SPDR Gold Trust GLD[13]. Notably, metal investing is great in a weaker dollar environment as these commodities are priced in the greenback (read: Winning ETF Strategies to Fight a Weak Dollar[14]). Banks: Short-Term Gain/Long-Term Pain? Banks were a key beneficiary in the lower-tax environment. Big U.S. banks have enjoyed an average 13% increase to earnings per share from the lower rate,per Goldman Sachs[15]. Banks also enjoyed easing of regulatory stringencies in recent years.However, under Biden's plan of tax hike, 10 largest U.S. banks may see their combined annual net income decline by more than $7 billion, according to an S&amp;#38;P Global Market Intelligence analysis[16]. However, many banks have significant deferred tax assets, per the above-mentioned analysis. The impact of higher income taxes will make deferred tax assets more valuable and favor tangible book values - a coveted metric investors are currently looking at, per the article. So, SPDR S&amp;#38;P Bank ETF (KBE) may see short-term gain but long-term pain. Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?

Nothing would be worse for markets.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Getty Images</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With the 2020 election less than two months away, Wall Street investors are weighing the pros and cons of a Trump versus Biden presidency. Polls show former Vice President Joe Biden holding a lead of 7.3% over President Trump, according to RealClearPolitics, though betting markets suggest a narrower spread. Whatever the outcome, one thing is certain: The next president of the United States will be faced with a pandemic that s resulted in the death of over 190,000 Americans and millions more unemployed as the economy struggles to recover from a record drop in GDP growth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> There are few times in recent history where we have approached a presidential election with so many high uncertainties,  says Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.</p><p>The stock market s reaction to the presidential election will depend on which party ends up with control of the Senate and House of Representatives. A Democratic sweep, for example, would almost certainly mean a rollback of Trump s massive corporate tax cut (a negative for stocks), but additional economic stimulus (which investors apparently love despite surging deficit levels) and stability on the China trade front would be a big positive.\u00a0</p><p>Here s what happens to markets under various election scenarios (including delayed results), according to the experts.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Scenario 1: Status Quo</emphasis></h><p>If Trump wins, Republicans hold the Senate and Democrats remain in control of the House, then markets will likely rally 3% to 5% on  no new news,  predicts wealth management firm Hightower Advisors.</p><p>The market initially jumped after Trump first won the 2016 election. He pushed through corporate tax cuts and relaxed business regulation. Investors expect the pro-business environment to continue under a potential second term for Trump, but tensions with China and the coronavirus pandemic could continue to pose challenges for the market. Don t forget, the United States officially plunged into a recession in February 2020 and isn t out of it just yet.</p><p> Markets don t like uncertainty, and while Trump s negotiating style has been unpredictable at times, his commitment to lower taxes and deregulation may provide a consistent, market-friendly policy environment,  says Ryan Detrick, chief investment strategist for LPL Financial. Wall Street analysts largely agree that if Trump wins re-election, sectors like defense, financials, and tech all stand to benefit while retail will take a hit.</p><p>Historically, Republican presidents presiding over a split Congress result in an average gain of 5.3% for the S&amp;P 500, with stocks rallying 60% of the time after the election, according to CFRA data going back to 1944.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Scenario 2: Blue Wave</emphasis></h><p>If Biden wins, Democrats take control of the Senate and retain the House then the market will likely see an initial sell-off of between 2% to 5%, according to Hightower. In this case,  we may actually see more of the Democratic policy changes enacted,  which include Biden s promise to raise taxes, says Ross Hambrick, analyst for William Blair s Dynamic Allocation Strategies Team.</p><p>In the past, a Democratic president supported by a Democratic majority in both houses of Congress usually resulted in an initial market sell-off.  Not surprisingly, the S&amp;P 500 fell an average of 2.4% in November following the shock of a sweep, declining three out of five times,  says Stovall. But stocks recovered by December, rising an average of 3.1% and gaining in price in all five past occurrences. The S&amp;P then gained an average of 10.4% in the following calendar year, rising in price four out of five times, he adds.</p><p>If Democrats score a so-called triple play,  history hints but does not guarantee the initial shock will send stocks lower but then they will recover by December and in the following calendar year,  says Stovall.  Wall Street always tends to worry about a Democratic president yet the years in which we have Democratic majorities, the market s frequency of advance was the highest. </p><p>In the 22 past years when Democrats controlled the executive and legislative branches, the stock market rose an average of 9.8%, rallying 77% of the time after the election, according to CFRA Research. If there is a Democratic sweep, sectors like renewable energy and industrials could benefit from a new focus on infrastructure in Washington, analysts say, while big tech and pharmaceutical companies would likely take a hit from increased government regulation.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Scenario 3: Biden Wins, But Republicans Hold The Senate</emphasis></h><p> This would be the friendliest to the markets as it would likely mean gridlock,  says Hightower, predicting that stocks could rally between 4% and 5% on the result.\u00a0</p><p>If Biden wins but the Senate remains in Republican hands, that would  drastically reduce his administration s ability to quickly implement his policies,  says Hambrick. There would likely still be a continuation of Trump s favorable corporate tax policy and deregulation efforts, though Biden would be more predictable on trade and international policy. This outcome would be  an almost status quo environment without the trade risk,  Hightower observes.</p><p>A Democratic president presiding over a split Congress would be the most favorable to markets, says Stovall. Looking at historical data, this scenario actually leads to the highest stock market returns, with the S&amp;P 500 rising by an average of 13.6% and rallying 75% of the time after the election.\u00a0</p><p> A split Congress historically has been better for stocks, which tend to like checks and balances to make sure one party doesn t have too much sway,  agrees Detrick. A divided Congress results in an annual average return of 17.2%, compared to 13.4% for a Republican Congress and 10.7% for a Democratic Congress, according to LPL s research.\u00a0</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Scenario 4: Delayed Election Results</emphasis></h><p>The worst outcome for the stock market is delayed or disputed election results. Several factors could lead to contested results, especially given the rise in mail-in ballots as the coronavirus keeps many people from voting in-person.</p><p>The last time presidential election results were held up was in 2000, when votes were so tight in Florida that a recount was initiated by the state. The election wasn t fully decided until a Supreme Court decision on December 12, five weeks after Americans cast their vote. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 plunged nearly 10% and the Nasdaq plummeted roughly 20% by the end of November.</p><p>Goldman Sachs  chief U.S. equity strategist, David Kostin, has<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>warned</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>about the possibility of a similar scenario in 2020. Volatility around the election is  extremely high compared with prior cycles,  he said in a note earlier this summer. Goldman has thus advised clients to hedge their market exposure going into December, in order to stem any losses incurred from uncertain election results.  Given the several-week delay in finalizing the results of the 2000 presidential election ... the elevated volumes of mail-in ballots used in recent primary elections, and potential for increased mail in ballots this November, we see heightened risk that election-related volatility could extend beyond Election Day,  Kostin said.</p><p> I would very much expect that if we don t have a concession speech right away, either by the challenger or incumbent, it will be bad for the markets  it will be really bad,  agrees Charles Lemonides, chief investment officer at ValueWorks. Stocks will fall if there isn t a clear winner on election day, he says, and it will be a  bad outcome for America. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FRBCOM-content_5f5a5c1097a4a1000606795c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FRBCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60TF-8WB1-DXVP-518G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">442244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1277\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Forbes LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Forbes.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 10, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Polls show former Vice President Joe Biden holding a lead of 7.3% over President Trump, according to RealClearPolitics, though betting markets suggest a narrower spread. Whatever the outcome, one thing is certain: The next president of the United States will be faced with a pandemic that\u2019s resulted in the death of over 190,000 Americans and millions more unemployed as the economy struggles to recover from a record drop in GDP growth.     \u201cThere are few times in recent history where we have approached a presidential election with so many high uncertainties,\u201d says Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.    The stock market\u2019s reaction to the presidential election will depend on which party ends up with control of the Senate and House of Representatives. A Democratic sweep, for example, would almost certainly mean a rollback of Trump\u2019s massive corporate tax cut (a negative for stocks), but additional economic stimulus (which investors apparently love despite surging deficit levels) and stability on the China trade front would be a big positive.     Here\u2019s what happens to markets under various election scenarios (including delayed results), according to the experts.   Scenario 1: Status Quo   If Trump wins, Republicans hold the Senate and Democrats remain in control of the House, then markets will likely rally 3% to 5% on \u201cno new news,\u201d predicts wealth management firm Hightower Advisors.    The market initially jumped after Trump first won the 2016 election. He pushed through corporate tax cuts and relaxed business regulation. Investors expect the pro-business environment to continue under a potential second term for Trump, but tensions with China and the coronavirus pandemic could continue to pose challenges for the market. Don\u2019t forget, the United States officially plunged into a recession in February 2020 and isn\u2019t out of it just yet.     \u201cMarkets don\u2019t like uncertainty, and while Trump\u2019s negotiating style has been unpredictable at times, his commitment to lower taxes and deregulation may provide a consistent, market-friendly policy environment,\u201d says Ryan Detrick, chief investment strategist for LPL Financial. Wall Street analysts largely agree that if Trump wins re-election, sectors like defense, financials, and tech all stand to benefit while retail will take a hit.    Historically, Republican presidents presiding over a split Congress result in an average gain of 5.3% for the S&amp;P 500, with stocks rallying 60% of the time after the election, according to CFRA data going back to 1944.   Scenario 2: Blue Wave   If Biden wins, Democrats take control of the Senate and retain the House then the market will likely see an initial sell-off of between 2% to 5%, according to Hightower. In this case, \u201cwe may actually see more of the Democratic policy changes enacted,\u201d which include Biden\u2019s promise to raise taxes, says Ross Hambrick, analyst for William Blair\u2019s Dynamic Allocation Strategies Team.     In the past, a Democratic president supported by a Democratic majority in both houses of Congress usually resulted in an initial market sell-off. \u201cNot surprisingly, the S&amp;P 500 fell an average of 2.4% in November following the shock of a sweep, declining three out of five times,\u201d says Stovall. But stocks recovered by December, rising an average of 3.1% and gaining in price in all five past occurrences. The S&amp;P then gained an average of 10.4% in the following calendar year, rising in price four out of five times, he adds.    If Democrats score a so-called triple play, \u201chistory hints but does not guarantee the initial shock will send stocks lower but then they will recover by December and in the following calendar year,\u201d says Stovall. \u201cWall Street always tends to worry about a Democratic president yet the years in which we have Democratic majorities, the market\u2019s frequency of advance was the highest.\u201d    In the 22 past years when Democrats controlled the executive and legislative branches, the stock market rose an average of 9.8%, rallying 77% of the time after the election, according to CFRA Research. If there is a Democratic sweep, sectors like renewable energy and industrials could benefit from a new focus on infrastructure in Washington, analysts say, while big tech and pharmaceutical companies would likely take a hit from increased government regulation.   Scenario 3: Biden Wins, But Republicans Hold The Senate   \u201cThis would be the friendliest to the markets as it would likely mean gridlock,\u201d says Hightower, predicting that stocks could rally between 4% and 5% on the result.      If Biden wins but the Senate remains in Republican hands, that would \u201cdrastically reduce his administration\u2019s ability to quickly implement his policies,\u201d says Hambrick. There would likely still be a continuation of Trump\u2019s favorable corporate tax policy and deregulation efforts, though Biden would be more predictable on trade and international policy. This outcome would be \u201can almost status quo environment without the trade risk,\u201d Hightower observes.    A Democratic president presiding over a split Congress would be the most favorable to markets, says Stovall. Looking at historical data, this scenario actually leads to the highest stock market returns, with the S&amp;P 500 rising by an average of 13.6% and rallying 75% of the time after the election.     \u201cA split Congress historically has been better for stocks, which tend to like checks and balances to make sure one party doesn\u2019t have too much sway,\u201d agrees Detrick. A divided Congress results in an annual average return of 17.2%, compared to 13.4% for a Republican Congress and 10.7% for a Democratic Congress, according to LPL\u2019s research.    Scenario 4: Delayed Election Results   The worst outcome for the stock market is delayed or disputed election results. Several factors could lead to contested results, especially given the rise in mail-in ballots as the coronavirus keeps many people from voting in-person.    The last time presidential election results were held up was in 2000, when votes were so tight in Florida that a recount was initiated by the state. The election wasn\u2019t fully decided until a Supreme Court decision on December 12, five weeks after Americans cast their vote. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 plunged nearly 10% and the Nasdaq plummeted roughly 20% by the end of November.     Goldman Sachs\u2019 chief U.S. equity strategist, David Kostin, has warned about the possibility of a similar scenario in 2020. Volatility around the election is \u201cextremely high compared with prior cycles,\u201d he said in a note earlier this summer. Goldman has thus advised clients to hedge their market exposure going into December, in order to stem any losses incurred from uncertain election results. \u201cGiven the several-week delay in finalizing the results of the 2000 presidential election ... the elevated volumes of mail-in ballots used in recent primary elections, and potential for increased mail in ballots this November, we see heightened risk that election-related volatility could extend beyond Election Day,\u201d Kostin said.    \u201cI would very much expect that if we don\u2019t have a concession speech right away, either by the challenger or incumbent, it will be bad for the markets\u2026 it will be really bad,\u201d agrees Charles Lemonides, chief investment officer at ValueWorks. Stocks will fall if there isn\u2019t a clear winner on election day, he says, and it will be a \u201cbad outcome for America.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43045665162</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60TC-RNJ1-JCSC-J1YY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1303\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Forbes.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 10, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>LPL Financial Holdings Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>LPL Financial Holdings Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>LPL Financial Holdings Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>LPL Financial Holdings Inc</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.ticker\"><classificationItem><className>7LI</className><className>BER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>7LI</className><className>FRA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>7LI</className><className>STU</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>LPLA</className><className>NAS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST00097CZ</classCode><className>ELECTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp;

It has two bedrooms and two bathrooms and nearly 700 square feet of space. It comes furnished.

They suggest that everyone should worry about the drivers and consequences of inequality -- even venture capitalists.</p><p>***</p><p>Since the middle of the 1980s, a gap has been widening between what the best-paid Americans earn and what everyone else in the country earns. There has also been a gap between how much money those two groups spend, but for a long time that gap didn't grow as much, because \"everyone else\" borrowed heavily to try to keep up with the folks at the top.</p><p>The Great Recession cut off that borrowing. It also reduced real incomes for the bottom 90 percent of American income-earners. Smaller paychecks and less access to credit left those Americans with only one choice: spend less than they had been. The top earners didn't increase their own spending by nearly enough to make up the difference. That is a big reason the U.S. economy has recovered so sluggishly from the recession, the economists Barry Z. Cynamon and Steven M. Fazzari declared in a new paper presented at the conference.</p><p>\"Rising income inequality,\" the wrote in their research paper, \"is now a significant barrier to economic growth and full employment.\"</p><p>There was already some irony in that paper, and so many others on inequality, landing in the northern outpost of Silicon Valley. Graham's essay cranked that irony to foghorn decibels.</p><p>Inequality, Graham argues in his\u00a0piece, is not bad \"per se.\" It can stem from rich people exploiting tax loopholes or poor people being locked in prison at high rates, which are both bad things. Or, it can result from more tech entrepreneurs getting rich, which is a good thing, because those entrepreneurs are making valuable things for the economy.</p><p>The argument takes several turns, but it boils down to two points. First, whether inequality comes from good or bad sources, it does not, by itself, hurt anyone; just because the rich get richer does not mean the poor and middle class can't get richer, too. He concedes that some rich people got that way by taking money from the poor, but not most of them.</p><p>That's his second point: We shouldn't try to reduce inequality, because doing so would necessarily mean killing off the innovators and entrepreneurs who get rich for socially good reasons. He writes:</p><p>\"Eliminating great variations in wealth would mean eliminating startups. Are you sure, hunters, that you want to shoot this particular animal? It would only mean you eliminated startups in your own country. Ambitious people already move halfway around the world to further their careers, and startups can operate from anywhere nowadays. So if you made it impossible to get rich by creating wealth in your country, the ambitious people in your country would just leave and do it somewhere else.\"</p><p>Research suggests Graham is both overestimating the importance of startups to inequality and underestimating the damage high inequality can inflict.</p><p>There is evidence to support his contention that returns to entrepreneurship are making inequality worse. The problem for his argument is that the effect doesn't appear to be large, comparatively.</p><p>At the conference, a group of five economists, including Philippe Aghion of College de France and David Hemous of the University of Zurich, unveiled a study that speaks directly to the Silicon Valley effect on inequality. They looked at levels of innovation (as measured by a particular kind of patent production) across individual states over time. They found a significant relationship between increased innovation in a state and the increased income share of the top 1 percent of earners in the state.</p><p>When the math cleared from their analyses, the economists estimated that 14 percent of the increase in the share of income going to the top 1 percent of Americans between 1975 and 2012 \"may be explained by an increase in innovation.\" The economists say those increases are temporary, they generate economic growth and they're associated with stronger upward mobility. Those are all good things. Point, Graham.</p><p>If you take that as a proxy for the Silicon Valley effect, though, you're left with a problem: 86 percent of the recent inequality increase can't be explained by innovation. You're also stuck with the fact that startup formation for tech companies\u00a0has been falling for more than a decade even as inequality has been widening, and not rising, as Graham implies. Total venture capital funding remains well below late-1990s levels, even before you adjust for inflation, according to data from the National Venture Capital Association.           </p><p>In light of all that, it's difficult to conclude that startups are mostly driving the income gap.</p><p>Economists have suggested all sorts of other things that might be contributing to the gap. There's the \"superstar effect,\" which says the opening of global markets is delivering big payouts to the very top players in a variety of industries now rolling in cash from around the globe. There's a broader theory that advancing technology is delivering higher payouts to the most skilled workers, and leaving lower-skilled workers to compete with robots and less-expensive foreign labor, pushing down their wages.</p><p>There is also mounting evidence that some, or even a lot, of inequality has nothing to do with superstars or skills -- at least not in the way that we tend to think about them. The culprit in this theory is what economists call rent-seeking. Really simply put, it's people making extra money not because they deliver a good or a service that the market values, but because they've bent the rules of some system to shuttle more compensation their way.</p><p>Examples of this would include chief executives who pad their profits by lobbying for government favors, and reap big bonuses as a result. Or financial pros who score huge fees helping clients game the tax code to pay less to the IRS. There are all sorts of other examples, but a basic rule is, if you're earning more money without doing anything to add additional value to the economy, you're rent-seeking.</p><p>Several papers presented in San Francisco hinted at, or directly identified, rent-seeking as a prime cause of growing inequality. Most forceful was the liberal economist Dean Baker, from the Center for Economic and Policy Research, who argued in a paper that rent-seeking in copyright protections and the financial sector, along with excess pay for CEOs and other highly educated professionals, explains \"the bulk\" of the growth in top incomes.</p><p>If his argument is correct, Baker writes, \"it means that there is nothing intrinsic to capitalism that led to this rapid rise in inequality.\" It would mean you couldn't reduce inequality simply by raises taxes on the rich -- you'd need policies to straighten kinks in the market, by shrinking the financial sector or reducing copyright windfalls. It would also mean that reducing inequality shouldn't dampen entrepreneurship.</p><p>Other recent studies also suggest high levels of rent-seeking are driving inequality. Brian Bell and John Van Reenan, a pair of economists in Britain (which resembles the United States in many ways when it comes to inequality), reported in 2014 that increased bonuses for bankers accounted for two-thirds of the growth of top 1 percent incomes in Britain\u00a0after 1999. There are all sorts of reasons to believe that premium financial sector pay is almost entirely rent-seeking; the British\u00a0paper would suggest that at least two-thirds of inequality could be linked back to \"bad\" sources, in other words.</p><p>Oliver Denk, an economist for the\u00a0Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, expanded on that work in two papers for the conference. He dove into statistics for every country in Europe and pieced together a composite of the men -- they're almost all men -- who make up the top 1 percent of earners on the continent. Again, his findings give us a window on America, where inequality is even more pronounced than in Europe.</p><p>\"Workers in the top 1 percent,\" Denk\u00a0found, \"tend to be 40 to 60 years old, be men, have tertiary education, work in finance or manufacturing and be senior managers.\" At worst, that's a group ripe for rent-seeking. At best, it doesn't sound much like the innovators Graham is so worried about discouraging. The liberal Economic Policy Institute has done similar work on America's top 1 percent, and found that at least a quarter of its increased income share since 1979 can be attributed to finance.</p><p>Taken together, that evidence suggests Graham may be\u00a0overly worried about inequality \"hunters\" discouraging today's crop of startup founders; they just aren't that prevalent in the ranks of the super rich who are pulling away from everyone else.</p><p>Other evidence suggests he's wrong on his second point, too: Inequality appears to have consequences for the economy, no matter what's driving it.</p><p>At one point in his essay, Graham suggests replacing concern over inequality with concern over poverty and social mobility. He suggests those are distinct from the growth of incomes for the very rich. Americans, he writes, fall prey to \"the pie fallacy: that the rich get rich by taking money from the poor.\" He says it's possible, but not always true, that the pie can grow such that\u00a0everyone gets more, even if the rich get a lot more.</p><p>It is indeed possible for that to happen. It just doesn't appear that's what's been happening in America in recent years. Instead, it appears the very rich have been enriching themselves further at the expense of workers. That's what researchers from the International Monetary Fund found in a paper\u00a0presented at the conference, which argues that the rise in top-level earnings is correlated with a decline in union membership; when workers get less, essentially, their bosses and shareholders get more.</p><p>A similar argument lies at the heart of the paper by Cynamon and Fazzarri, who are economists at the St. Louis Fed and Washington University in St. Louis. Their contention is that the lack of pie growth, if you will, for most Americans created a shortage of consumer spending that has kept the recovery from recession at historically weak levels. The stagnation of most incomes below the very rich \"has opened a large gap in demand generation that has not been filled,\" they write.</p><p>Perhaps most resonant to Graham is the idea that inequality might be discouraging smart workers from working at all -- in startups or elsewhere. A paper\u00a0from economists at the New York Fed and the University of Southern California finds a link between growing inequality and declining labor-force participation among highly educated women, whose exit from the workforce hurts the economy. The economists find that as some highly educated men's wages rose quickly, their highly educated wives earned and worked less.</p><p>If there is middle ground between Graham and this body of research, it's the idea that policymakers shouldn't go after inequality with blunt instruments, like big tax hikes just for the sake of soaking the rich. Perhaps, instead, they should target rent-seeking, which economists agree is bad for everyone who isn't a rent seeker.</p><p>That could mean taxing financial transactions to discourage excessive Wall Street trading, or taxing income from investments at the same rate as income earned on the job, in order to discourage expensive financial engineering. It could mean simplifying tax and regulatory codes to reduce companies' gains from lobbying -- which, by the way, big tech firms are increasingly chasing via ramped-up presences in Washington.</p><p>If you curbed rent-seeking -- or what conservatives like to call cronyism, in a solely government-focused form -- you'd almost certainly improve growth and help more people share in its returns. Graham's worry is that you wouldn't actually reduce inequality in that case. All the former rent-seekers, he writes, would flow into entrepreneurship: \"If the only way left to get rich is to start startups, they'll start startups.\"</p><p>In economic terms, that would be a great problem to have.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-082a7bccbc0011e5b6824bb4dd403c7d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HWC-9FM1-JB4M-V4BM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2299\"/><timeReceived>12:05 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"01\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>January 14, 2016 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DIDA</classCode><className>COMMUTING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001457</classCode><className>RECESSION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N523910MM</classCode><className>VENTURE CAPITAL</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp;

Total venture capital funding remains well below late-1990s levels, even before you adjust for inflation, according to data from the National Venture Capital Association.           </p><p>In light of all that, it's difficult to conclude that startups are mostly driving the income gap.</p><p>Economists have suggested all sorts of other things that might be contributing to the gap. There's the \"superstar effect,\" which says the opening of global markets is delivering big payouts to the very top players in a variety of industries now rolling in cash from around the globe. There's a broader theory that advancing technology is delivering higher payouts to the most skilled workers, and leaving lower-skilled workers to compete with robots and less-expensive foreign labor, pushing down their wages.</p><p>There is also mounting evidence that some, or even a lot, of inequality has nothing to do with superstars or skills -- at least not in the way that we tend to think about them. The culprit in this theory is what economists call rent-seeking. Really simply put, it's people making extra money not because they deliver a good or a service that the market values, but because they've bent the rules of some system to shuttle more compensation their way.</p><p>Examples of this would include chief executives who pad their profits by lobbying for government favors, and reap big bonuses as a result. Or financial pros who score huge fees helping clients game the tax code to pay less to the IRS. There are all sorts of other examples, but a basic rule is, if you're earning more money without doing anything to add additional value to the economy, you're rent-seeking.</p><p>Several papers presented in San Francisco hinted at, or directly identified, rent-seeking as a prime cause of growing inequality. Most forceful was the liberal economist Dean Baker, from the Center for Economic and Policy Research, who argued in a paper that rent-seeking in copyright protections and the financial sector, along with excess pay for CEOs and other highly educated professionals, explains \"the bulk\" of the growth in top incomes.</p><p>If his argument is correct, Baker writes, \"it means that there is nothing intrinsic to capitalism that led to this rapid rise in inequality.\" It would mean you couldn't reduce inequality simply by raises taxes on the rich -- you'd need policies to straighten kinks in the market, by shrinking the financial sector or reducing copyright windfalls. It would also mean that reducing inequality shouldn't dampen entrepreneurship.</p><p>Other recent studies also suggest high levels of rent-seeking are driving inequality. Brian Bell and John Van Reenan, a pair of economists in Britain (which resembles the United States in many ways when it comes to inequality), reported in 2014 that increased bonuses for bankers accounted for two-thirds of the growth of top 1 percent incomes in Britain\u00a0after 1999. There are all sorts of reasons to believe that premium financial sector pay is almost entirely rent-seeking; the British\u00a0paper would suggest that at least two-thirds of inequality could be linked back to \"bad\" sources, in other words.</p><p>Oliver Bank, an economist for the\u00a0Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, expanded on that work in two papers for the conference. He dove into statistics for every country in Europe and pieced together a composite of the men -- they're almost all men -- who make up the top 1 percent of earners on the continent. Again, his findings give us a window on America, where inequality is even more pronounced than in Europe.</p><p>\"Workers in the top 1 percent,\" Bank found, \"tend to be 40 to 60 years old, be men, have tertiary education, work in finance or manufacturing and be senior managers.\" At worst, that's a group ripe for rent-seeking. At best, it doesn't sound much like the innovators Graham is so worried about discouraging. The liberal Economic Policy Institute has done similar work on America's top 1 percent, and found that at least a quarter of its increased income share since 1979 can be attributed to finance.</p><p>Taken together, that evidence suggests Graham may be\u00a0overly worried about inequality \"hunters\" discouraging today's crop of startup founders; they just aren't that prevalent in the ranks of the super rich who are pulling away from everyone else.</p><p>Other evidence suggests he's wrong on his second point, too: Inequality appears to have consequences for the economy, no matter what's driving it.</p><p>At one point in his essay, Graham suggests replacing concern over inequality with concern over poverty and social mobility. He suggests those are distinct from the growth of incomes for the very rich. Americans, he writes, fall prey to \"the pie fallacy: that the rich get rich by taking money from the poor.\" He says it's possible, but not always true, that the pie can grow such that\u00a0everyone gets more, even if the rich get a lot more.</p><p>It is indeed possible for that to happen. It just doesn't appear that's what's been happening in America in recent years. Instead, it appears the very rich have been enriching themselves further at the expense of workers. That's what researchers from the International Monetary Fund found in a paper\u00a0presented at the conference, which argues that the rise in top-level earnings is correlated with a decline in union membership; when workers get less, essentially, their bosses and shareholders get more.</p><p>A similar argument lies at the heart of the paper by Cynamon and Fazzarri, who are economists at the St. Louis Fed and Washington University in St. Louis. Their contention is that the lack of pie growth, if you will, for most Americans created a shortage of consumer spending that has kept the recovery from recession at historically weak levels. The stagnation of most incomes below the very rich \"has opened a large gap in demand generation that has not been filled,\" they write.</p><p>Perhaps most resonant to Graham is the idea that inequality might be discouraging smart workers from working at all -- in startups or elsewhere. A paper\u00a0from economists at the New York Fed and the University of Southern California finds a link between growing inequality and declining labor-force participation among highly educated women, whose exit from the workforce hurts the economy. The economists find that as some highly educated men's wages rose quickly, their highly educated wives earned and worked less.</p><p>If there is middle ground between Graham and this body of research, it's the idea that policymakers shouldn't go after inequality with blunt instruments, like big tax hikes just for the sake of soaking the rich. Perhaps, instead, they should target rent-seeking, which economists agree is bad for everyone who isn't a rent seeker.</p><p>That could mean taxing financial transactions to discourage excessive Wall Street trading, or taxing income from investments at the same rate as income earned on the job, in order to discourage expensive financial engineering. It could mean simplifying tax and regulatory codes to reduce companies' gains from lobbying -- which, by the way, big tech firms are increasingly chasing via ramped-up presences in Washington.</p><p>If you curbed rent-seeking -- or what conservatives like to call cronyism, in a solely government-focused form -- you'd almost certainly improve growth and help more people share in its returns. Graham's worry is that you wouldn't actually reduce inequality in that case. All the former rent-seekers, he writes, would flow into entrepreneurship: \"If the only way left to get rich is to start startups, they'll start startups.\"</p><p>In economic terms, that would be a great problem to have.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-d25c5b0bf9b4400ab0657b27ad52acba</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HVH-M3T1-JB4M-V1VS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2299\"/><timeReceived>12:05 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"01\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>January 14, 2016 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DIDA</classCode><className>COMMUTING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001457</classCode><className>RECESSION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N523910MM</classCode><className>VENTURE CAPITAL</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp;

Here's a look at the week's tech news: </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Big tech is about to face a reckoning. Probably.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  The federal government is reportedly considering antitrust inquiries into Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon. The Justice Department will handle Apple and Google; the Federal Trade Commission takes Facebook and Amazon. The House Judiciary's subcommittee on antitrust also plans to investigate possible anticompetitive behavior and decide whether current antitrust laws need to be updated.</p><p>  This is what vocal critics, as varied as a Facebook co-founder and Senator Elizabeth Warren, have been waiting for: the chance to hold these companies to account and use antitrust law to break them up.</p><p>  But how far will the new wave of investigations go?</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Don't expect this to be quick. When the government went after Microsoft in the 1990s (the last major United States tech antitrust case) it took 12 years, from the first F.T.C. investigation to a court-approved settlement. The work now may be more substantial: Harry First, an antitrust law professor at New York University, said that the agencies taking on these four companies were ''clearly ambitious.''</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Forget wholesale change. All the companies have multiple fronts on which antitrust battles could be waged: Google could be pursued for dominance in ad tech, search, Android or something else. ''You can't do everything,'' Mr. First said. ''They will have to find a focus, quickly.'' So the agencies will chase specific problems.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Legal action isn't guaranteed. The agencies usually take to court only the cases they're confident they can win, so many investigations fizzle well before that point. And big tech has huge legal and lobbying teams, so the bar for a government slam dunk is high.</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Punishments may disappoint. Remedies to antitrust violations must be tailored to the harm. If WhatsApp and Instagram were the root of anticompetitive behavior by Facebook, then, sure, force a spinoff. But the remedy is dictated by the (very specific) violation, not vice versa, and it may be that limits on business practices are more relevant.</p><p>  All of which is to say: The antitrust showdown will be long, difficult, uncertain and, for some, potentially disappointing.</p><p>  That doesn't make it a bad idea. Even abandoned investigations can yield some change: Google made voluntary business changes after the F.T.C. dropped a 2011 antitrust investigation into it. And the point isn't just fixing the current problem: It's also about deterring future bad conduct.</p><p>  ITunes lives on</p><p>  In 2003, Apple made a masterstroke: Its music software, iTunes, was released for Windows as well as MacOS. ITunes became a Trojan horse, putting Apple products in the hands of non-Apple users and democratizing the iPod, which exploded in popularity.</p><p>  Fast-forward to this past week, when Apple killed iTunes. Yes, the software was bloated and slow. But it was also a hangover of an older Apple built on the success of the iPod, then the iPhone.</p><p>  Now, Apple's iPhone sales have plateaued, and the company is having to find new ways to grow, said Roberta Cozza, a senior research director at Gartner. Its strategy for that was on display in announcements at its developer conference.</p><p>  ITunes is being split into Music, Podcast and TV apps, the latest part of Apple's push to compete on services with the likes of Spotify and Netflix. Its Watch will get a dedicated App Store, so people won't need an iPhone to use one. And a new universal authentication tool promises more secure logins, not limited to Apple platforms.</p><p>  Together, those announcements show Apple experimenting again with how to put its products in the hands of more people. ITunes is dead; long live iTunes.</p><p>YouTube's new rules</p><p>  Rules can be useful. If we all follow them, they help us coexist in harmony. But sometimes new things happen and rules don't change. Then things go wrong, people get upset (or worse), and it's time to invent new rules. That's also good!</p><p>YouTube announced on Wednesday new rules that mean ''videos alleging that a group is superior in order to justify discrimination, segregation or exclusion'' will be banned. So will those denying violent events, like the 2012 school shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in Connecticut. A three-strike rule will apply to users sporadically uploading such content, and those who repeatedly come close to violation won't be able to profit from YouTube ads.</p><p>  Sounds positive. Only, YouTube also showed this past week that it struggles to live by its rules. It came to light that Steven Crowder, a popular conservative commentator on YouTube, had repeatedly insulted Carlos Maza, a journalist from Vox, using racial and sexual slurs. Initially YouTube said Mr. Crowder's comments did not break its rules. Later, after an outcry, it appeared to backtrack and said he couldn't earn ad revenue on his channel unless he changed some practices.</p><p>  So, rules. Great if you enforce them effectively. But ... kind of pointless if you can't?</p><p>  What's in an I.C.O.?</p><p>  Imagine you run a company and need money. One idea: Promise a thing to people, take some money and send the thing later. That's O.K. It's crowdfunding. What if, instead of offering a thing, you offer a cryptographic token to exchange for a thing in the future? That may be less O.K.</p><p>  On Tuesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Kik Interactive, a Canadian social media company, over this. In 2017, Kik sold $100 million worth of digital ''coins'' called Kin that would be used to buy and sell digital services. This is an initial coin offering, a practice with a bad rap thanks to some less than scrupulous companies. Kik isn't accused of fraud; it's accused of not properly registering the offering with the S.E.C.</p><p>  This rests on what, exactly, Kik was offering. The S.E.C. says Kin counted as a security, like stocks, because it couldn't be used to buy anything when it was launched. The S.E.C. also claims Kik said Kin investors could ''make a ton of money'' from appreciation, as with securities. Kik says that Kin is now a proper medium of exchange and that investors didn't expect to profit, so it's not a security and didn't need to be registered.</p><p>  Well, it either is or isn't, and now a court will decide. The distinction will be important: It will shape the S.E.C.'s ability to regulate the industry, and help the crypto world understand what it can, and can't, do.</p><p>  Some stories you shouldn't miss</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 YouTube is a safe haven for pedophiles.

They get paid handsomely for advising buyers and sellers, and helping arrange the financing.&lt;nl/&gt; That's all starting to change. Investors are starting to anticipate the Federal Reserve will lift interest rates from zero [1]and worry about an economic slowdown and what that means for borrowers.\u00a0&lt;nl/&gt; The net effect: bond prices (especially for risky high-yield debt) are tumbling, and that's driving the cost\u00a0of\u00a0new borrowings\u00a0higher fast.&lt;nl/&gt; It's been a \"dramatic\" move in a very short period of time, said Howard Marks, the co-founder of debt investor\u00a0Oaktree Capital Partners. \"The buyers are gone.\"&lt;nl/&gt; 'We have bonds that have gone from 90 to 60 in the last couple months, not only in the energy sector,\" he said\u00a0Tuesday December 8 at the Goldman Sachs Financial Services Conference in New York.&lt;nl/&gt;So what's all this mean for M#38;A?&lt;nl/&gt;To understand how this translates to the M...arket, consider Dell's $67 billion acquisition of EMC Corp. The Wall Street Journal's\u00a0Matt Wirz and Liz Hoffman reported[2]\u00a0this month\u00a0that Dell could have to pay as much as 12% on\u00a0loans to fund the takeover - twice the recent going rate.\u00a0That would add hundreds of millions of dollars to the interest bill affiliated with the deal, the Journal reported.\u00a0&lt;nl/&gt; It's happening because banks are trying to ensure they can find buyers for the debt.\u00a0&lt;nl/&gt; \"The credit market is under a lot of pressure; banks are going to be a lot more cautious,\"one senior M...anker told Business Insider, speaking on the condition of anonymity. \"Prices are substantially higher than they were a year ago,\"\u00a0&lt;nl/&gt; Baker Mackenzie LLP[3], the law firm, predicts completed M...olume in 2016 will rise to about $3 trillion, from an expected $2.7 trillion in 2015.\u00a0&lt;nl/&gt; But if debt investors overreact to the Fed then that total\u00a0could fall by $800 billion - or about a one third drop\u00a0that would be \"primarily the result of increasing cost of capital making some transactions more difficult to execute.\"&lt;nl/&gt; Currently, the law firm is putting only a 10% probability on that happening.&lt;nl/&gt; Not everyone's going to be bothered by rising rates. Some large acquirers - like big tech companies - are loaded and don't need to worry about borrowing costs, for example.\u00a0&lt;nl/&gt; \"Having cash on hand makes doing a deal easier,\" Baker Mackenzie global head of M...ike DeFranco said.\u00a0&lt;nl/&gt;NOW WATCH: HENRY BLODGET: This is where digital media is headed next[4]&lt;nl/&gt;See Also: The biggest bank in the US is miffed at the Federal Reserve[5]Regulators want to block the Staples-Office Depot merger, and now both stocks are crashing[6]Insiders say we're about to see Wall Street do some eye-popping M...eals[7]&lt;nl/&gt;

They get paid handsomely for advising buyers and sellers, and helping arrange the financing.&lt;nl/&gt; That's all starting to change. Investors are starting to anticipate the Federal Reserve will lift interest rates from zero [1]and worry about an economic slowdown and what that means for borrowers.\u00a0&lt;nl/&gt; The net effect: bond prices (especially for risky high-yield debt) are tumbling, and that's driving the cost\u00a0of\u00a0new borrowings\u00a0higher fast.&lt;nl/&gt; It's been a \"dramatic\" move in a very short period of time, said Howard Marks, the co-founder of debt investor\u00a0Oaktree Capital Partners. \"The buyers are gone.\"&lt;nl/&gt; 'We have bonds that have gone from 90 to 60 in the last couple months, not only in the energy sector,\" he said\u00a0Tuesday December 8 at the Goldman Sachs Financial Services Conference in New York.&lt;nl/&gt;So what's all this mean for M#38;A?&lt;nl/&gt;To understand how this translates to the M...arket, consider Dell's $67 billion acquisition of EMC Corp.The Wall Street Journal's\u00a0Matt Wirz and Liz Hoffman reported[2]\u00a0this month\u00a0that Dell could have to pay as much as 12% on\u00a0loans to fund the takeover - twice the recent going rate.\u00a0That would add hundreds of millions of dollars to the interest bill affiliated with the deal, the Journal reported.\u00a0&lt;nl/&gt; It's happening because banks are trying to ensure they can find buyers for the debt.\u00a0&lt;nl/&gt; \"The credit market is under a lot of pressure; banks are going to be a lot more cautious,\"one senior M...anker told Business Insider, speaking on the condition of anonymity. \"Prices are substantially higher than they were a year ago,\"\u00a0&lt;nl/&gt; Baker Mackenzie LLP[3], the law firm, predicts completed M...olume in 2016 will rise to about $3 trillion, from an expected $2.7 trillion in 2015.\u00a0&lt;nl/&gt; But if debt investors overreact to the Fed then that total\u00a0could fall by $800 billion - or about a one third drop\u00a0that would be \"primarily the result of increasing cost of capital making some transactions more difficult to execute.\"&lt;nl/&gt; Currently, the law firm is putting only a 10% probability on that happening.&lt;nl/&gt; Not everyone's going to be bothered by rising rates. Some large acquirers - like big tech companies - are loaded and don't need to worry about borrowing costs, for example.\u00a0&lt;nl/&gt; \"Having cash on hand makes doing a deal easier,\" Baker Mackenzie global head of M...ike DeFranco said.\u00a0&lt;nl/&gt;NOW WATCH: Animated map shows all the major oil and gas pipelines in the US [4]&lt;nl/&gt;See Also: The biggest bank in the US is miffed at the Federal Reserve[5]Regulators want to block the Staples-Office Depot merger, and now both stocks are crashing[6]Insiders say we're about to see Wall Street do some eye-popping M...eals[7]&lt;nl/&gt;

The last few weeks have not been good to the likes of Facebook, Google, and Twitter, which are taking increasing heat for their unwillingness \u2014 or inability \u2014 to grapple with the their outsize influence, particularly as it relates to the results of the 2016 presidential election. This week, however, has been particularly rough for the companies. </p><p>Here are a few standout stories.  Facebook's exemption to political ad disclosure laws is under threat. On Thursday, senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Mark Warner (D-VA), joined by John McCain (R-AZ), introduced the Honest Ads Act[1], legislation that would force Facebook and other tech companies to publicly disclose who is paying for ads that users see on their platforms. This disclosure would include who was targeted by the ads, as well as how many people saw them. More regulation usually comes as the expense of revenue, which is why the big tech companies plan to fight proposed legislations by mobilizing their own lobbyists, who are likely to focus on ways to water down any regulations. Twitter's broken promises: Twitter this week said it plans to redouble its efforts to keep users safe on its own platform. Those promises, however, ring a bit hollow when you realize that the company has made at least five other similar \u2014 and unfulfilled \u2014 ones in the last four years, as Axios' Ina Fried pointed out today[2].pic.twitter.com/RDgp7fOvwo[3] \u2014 Gwendolyn Ann Smith (@gwenners) October 19, 2017[4]Why should anyone believe Twitter this time? According to a Twitter spokesperson, what's different now is that Twitter has publicly published a calendar with its planned improvements. 'Now \u2014 for the first time \u2014 everyone can see exactly what updates we have planned and where we're headed, and most importantly, hold us accountable for delivering on those specific promises,' the spokesperson told Axios. Facebook employees: 'We're the victims.' A lot of the reports about Facebook's reaction to its recent criticism have focused on the company's public stances, which have ranged from dismissal to outright denial. Internally, things are just as fraught. BuzzFeed's Charlie Warzel talked to numerous staffers[5] about how Facebook staffers are responding to the ongoing election tumult, and many aren't taking it well. Some say the company is being used as a scapegoat for the election result, which they say was largely influenced by factors outside of Facebook's control. Frustration is rampant.This seems like a fleet of naive people in the pursuit of crushing code and breaking things too quickly run amok <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/Fq7mhH0ZZF\">https://t.co/Fq7mhH0ZZF</url>[6] pic.twitter.com/nfEXJEvNvP[7]; \u2014 Landon Noss (@landongn) October 20, 2017[8]The article's kicker comes from a distraught former Facebook employee, who captures well Facebook's core dissonance: 'There are times when people at Facebook would gloat about the power and reach of the network,' a former senior employee said. 'Somebody said with a straight face to me not terribly long ago that 'running Facebook is like running a government for the world.' I remember thinking, 'God, it's really not like that at all.'' Move slow and fix things? For years, Facebook's 'move fast and break things' mantra has been an endearing encapsulation of the company's engineering philosophy, and a core factor to its success. But that calculus might need to change now that the company wields such immense influence over so much of society. In a leaked recording, Facebook security chief Alex Stamos said that[9] the company needs to take security in particular more seriously. 'The way that I explain to [management] is that we have the threat profile of a Northrop Grumman or a Raytheon or another defense contractor, but we run our corporate network, for example, like a college campus, almost,' he said. Is the sun setting on Silicon Valley? Former Google Ventures CEO Bill Maris[10] said so at a Wall Street Journal conference on Wednesday. He also argued that Google and Facebook 'are more powerful than AT...ver was,' which is why he wouldn't be surprised to hear regulatory calls to break up the companies in the future.Photo of dislike grafitti by zeevveez[11] used under a Creative Commons license.

There is the hardy perennial of the Tory chancellor Reginald Maudling leaving a note in 1964 to his Labour successor and friend Jim Callaghan, saying: \"Good luck, old cock. Sorry to leave it in such a mess.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">More recently, Liam Byrne, Treasury chief secretary under Gordon Brown, achieved legendary status by leaving a note for his successor in 2010, saying: \"I'm afraid there is no money.\" Byrne, who was quietly working away before the election campaign as shadow minister for digital, and held his seat on Thursday, knows he will have to go some for that not to be his political epitaph.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There was no need for an exchange of letters this time, unless Sajid Javid penned a note to himself, and the Tories' overwhelming victory has removed the risk of a Corbyn government. As noted here in recent weeks, that had become the big fear for business, and there has been a collective sigh of relief.</p><p>Boris Johnson's comfortable victory has not, however, removed the challenges facing the economy which, if not successfully tackled, will mean that Thursday's triumph will be followed by disappointment.</p><p>As it happens, the latest official figures went a long way to setting out the post-election economic challenge. There are two ways of measuring the economy's annual growth rate. The conventional way is to compare the latest estimate for gross domestic product with that a year earlier. On this basis, growth in October was just 0.7%, its weakest since 2011.</p><p>The other way to measure growth is through the year, where GDP is at the end of the year compared with the beginning. On this basis, the figures tell us that monthly GDP in October was exactly the same as in February.</p><p>It would be foolish to deny that uncertainty has played a role in this: two separate bouts of no-deal worries in March and October, and the election itself. But I note that the economy was far less troubled during the election periods of 2015 and 2017, and that the growth slowdown of the past three years, its slow puncture, has now lasted long enough to be regarded as a trend.</p><p>How do we revive growth? It is always possible to bump it up temporarily through higher government and consumer spending. A significant public spending boost for 2020-21, more than 4% in real terms on day-to-day expenditure, was announced by chancellor Sajid Javid in September.</p><p>There was, you will recall, a short-term boost for consumer spending, mainly in the form of sharply higher retail sales in the months following the EU referendum. That has been replaced by today's phenomenon - of many well-known retailers hanging on for dear life.</p><p>The pictures for both consumer and government spending do not point to sustainably stronger growth, or offer the prospect of lifting the economy's growth rate much above a paltry 1% in 2020. The British Chambers of Commerce, whose new forecast for growth next year is precisely 1%, warns that higher government spending will not offset falling business investment and weakening net trade.</p><p>There are thus two big challenges. The first is one that has preoccupied policymakers for a long time - the economy's unbalanced nature. Last week, I highlighted figures showing the deterioration in Britain's net overseas investment position. Since then, we have had statistics showing that, in the year to October, the trade deficit in goods was a whopping \u00a3155bn, against \u00a3136bn in the previous 12 months. Of this, about two-thirds was in industrial products. Until 1982, Britain had never had a trade deficit in manufactured goods. Now it is about \u00a3100bn a year.</p><p>An economy overly dependent on consumer spending does not have to run eyewateringly large trade deficits. Thanks to the peculiarity of the UK industry - we export most of the cars we make here, while importing most of those we buy - trade in cars was roughly in balance in 2017 and 2018. But the writing is on the wall for the model that UK-based car-makers have relied on - frictionless trade with the EU by virtue of the single market, allowing integrated supply chains. UK car production in the first 10 months of the year was down by 14.4% on a year earlier.</p><p>Correcting those wider imbalances would, moreover, require something for which there has been scant evidence recently. Although holidaying at home has become more popular as a result of sterling's weakness, consumers and businesses have not switched to any significant degree to domestic rather than imported products - hence the widening of the trade deficit - and the investment in new industrial capacity to change that has not been there.</p><p>This relates to the second big challenge. The only way of generating sustainable long-term growth is to increase investment - public and private - and turn around a dismal productivity record. I had forgotten, but there was a brief period early in the economy's post-crisis recovery, in 2010 and 2011, when productivity growth temporarily hit 2%. That is now a distant memory: over the past 12 months, it has fallen by 0.5%. Business investment, meanwhile, is stuck pretty much where it was in the second quarter of 2016.</p><p>The better the quality of investment, and the more R&amp;D intensive it is, the more it can result in the innovation that changes the economy and increases its dynamism. I recently quoted a paper by Professor Richard Jones of Sheffield University, which used this as the basis of what he describes as the resurgence of the regions; it is well worth reading.</p><p>I have tested the idea of a reboot of the UK economy - driven by an upsurge in investment and a productivity revival - on business people, and been met with bucket loads of scepticism. For many businesses, the current period is all about managing a change they mainly did not want. When I wrote in the run-up to June 2016 that a vote for Brexit would preoccupy business for years, to the exclusion of much else, it was very much with this in mind. So it has proved.</p><p>Many businesses also have plenty of reasons to hold back on investment. Most obviously, they want to see what the future trading arrangement will look like, but they have also seen little so far from this government to suggest that its broad approach will be a business-friendly one. Merely avoiding the very unfriendly alternative is not enough.</p><p>There are exceptions - big tech companies, less directly affected by Brexit, have continued to invest in Britain. But this has not been enough to lift the pall hanging over business investment, which, if we are not careful, will be with us for a long time yes.</p><p>                    PS                   </p><p>This has been a big few days for central bankers. Paul Volcker, former chairman of America's Federal Reserve - credited with, among other things, taming US inflation in the 1980s - passed away. In his war on inflation, one key US interest rate, the prime rate, rose to more than 20% in 1980. He later became known for the Volcker rule, part of America's post-crisis regulatory clampdown, which restricted banks from engaging in speculative proprietary trading.</p><p>One door closes, and another opens. Christine Lagarde held her first meeting as president of the European Central Bank on Thursday, which left policy unchanged, and then vowed not to be a dove or a hawk, but a wise owl. Minouche Shafik, the former Bank of England deputy governor, once said something very similar.</p><p>It is even possible that we will soon get an announcement on the new governor of the Bank. Whether the successful candidate can secure the reviews Lagarde is already receiving - Andrea Iianelli of Fidelity International described her as \"elegant and convincing\" - remains to be seen.</p><p>In thinking about Lagarde's responsibility, it is clear that, while the eurozone's growth is stronger than Britain's, there is work to do. The German economy, often its locomotive, has been badly hurt by Donald Trump's trade wars, and is now a drag on eurozone growth.</p><p>That drag is expected to lift, according to the latest forecast from the Ifo Institute, a leading German research group. It predicts a pick-up to 1.1% growth next year, from 0.5% this year.</p><p>One interesting thing about Germany, which stands in contrast to Britain at the moment, is that its companies have continued to invest through its current period of weak growth. Overall investment is up by 2.7% this year and is predicted to continue to grow at a reasonable pace over the next two years. We could do with some of that.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:david.smith@sunday-times.co.uk\">david.smith@sunday-times.co.uk</email><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:david.smith@sunday-times.co.uk\">david.smith@sunday-times.co.uk</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-58691492</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XRK-XSM1-JCJY-G32K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1435\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 15, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000551</classCode><className>ECONOMIC NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001960</classCode><className>PUBLIC POLICY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000816</classCode><className>GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp;

He said the data disaster is just the \"tip of the iceberg.\" Facebook and Google are \"ripe for the plucking\" by governments around the world, he added. </p><p>Jim Mellon, the billionaire British investor, has predicted that Facebook faces \"decimation\" over the Cambridge Analytica data disaster. Speaking on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\"[2] after a tumultuous two weeks for Mark Zuckerberg's social media company, Mellon said the fallout will be far-reaching after Facebook was plundered for the data of 50 million US users. The scandal has wiped around $80 billion (57 billion) off Facebook's value, and Mellon said the firm's share price could halve over the next two years. He said the threats come from amid increased government regulation and further fiascos over how it handles the personal information of its users. Facebook shares closed at $153.03 on Wednesday.[3] \"The Cambridge Analytica thing is just the tip of the iceberg,\" said Mellon, who is typically bearish on big tech. \"We're going to see decimation of particularly Facebook and quite right too, it's a trivial use of modern technology and one that's rather sinister.\"Mellon added that Facebook and Google's scale and increased public accountability has left them vulnerable to government regulation around the world. He predicted that Google will be hit by \"enormous\" fines, like the \u20ac2.4 billion ($3 billion) one meted out by the EU last year[4], and parent firm Alphabet could be broken up by US and European administrations. \"These fatted calves are now ripe for the plucking by governments everywhere,\" Mellon told CNBC. Mellon's net worth stands at 920 million ($1.3 billion)[5], according to The Sunday Times Rich List. His investment company Burnbrae Group has a number of biotech interests, such as the experimental cancer drug firm SalvaRX, which began trading on London's junior Aim market in March 2016.[6] Mellon made his money in mining and property, and supported the campaign to take Britain out of the European Union in 2016.NOW WATCH: How a woman from the 1800s became the first computer programmer[7]See

But, in the age of digital data, there is hope for the billion people worldwide who lack such information.</p><p>While much of the developed world is properly worried about myriad privacy outrages at the hands of Big Tech and demanding \u2013 and securing \u2013 for individuals a \u201cright to be forgotten,\u201d many around the world are posing a very different question: What about the right to be seen?</p><p>Just ask the billion people who are locked out of services we take for granted \u2013 things like a bank account, a deed to a house, or even a mobile phone account \u2013 because they lack identity documents and thus can\u2019t prove who they are. They are effectively invisible as a result of poor data.</p><p>The ability to exercise many of our most basic rights and privileges \u2013 such as the right to vote, drive, own property, and travel internationally \u2013 is determined by large administrative agencies that rely on standardized information to determine who is eligible for what. For example, to obtain a passport it is typically necessary to present a birth certificate. But what if you do not have a birth certificate? To open a bank account requires proof of address. But what if your house doesn\u2019t have an address?</p><p>The inability to provide such basic information is a barrier to stability, prosperity, and opportunity. Invisible people are locked out of the formal economy, unable to vote, travel, or access medical and education benefits. It\u2019s not that they are undeserving or unqualified, it\u2019s that they are data poor.</p><p>In this context, the rich digital record provided by our smartphones and other sensors could become a powerful tool for good, so long as the risks are acknowledged. These gadgets, which have become central to our social and economic lives, leave a data trail that for many of us is the raw material that fuels what Harvard\u2019s Shoshana Zuboff calls \u201csurveillance capitalism.\u201d Our Google location history shows exactly where we live and work. Our email activity reveals our social networks. Even the way we hold our smartphone can give away early signs of Parkinson\u2019s.</p><p>But what if citizens could harness the power of these data for themselves, to become visible to administrative gatekeepers and access the rights and privileges to which they are entitled? Their virtual trail could then be converted into proof of physical facts.Image: World Bank</p><p>That is beginning to happen. In India, slum dwellers are using smartphone location data to put themselves on city maps for the first time and register for addresses that they can then use to receive mail and register for government IDs. In Tanzania, citizens are using their mobile payment histories to build their credit scores and access more traditional financial services. And in Europe and the United States, Uber drivers are fighting for their rideshare data to advocate for employment benefits.</p><p>But much more could be done. For example, after homes are destroyed by storms, victims are often unable to qualify for rebuilding assistance because they can\u2019t prove they are the homeowner or occupant. Yet they could use their Google location history to show authorities that for the last five years they had slept in the very spot on which the home had stood. They could present their mobile payment records to show that they paid to put a new roof on the home or a fence around the yard. Or they could present a series of geotagged Facebook photographs of themselves and their family in the living room of their home.Have you read?</p><p>How privacy tech is redefining the data economy China is waking up to data protection and privacy. Here's why that matters 83% of Americans want tougher regulations for data privacy</p><p>None of these individual data points is dispositive, but together they weave a rich tapestry of evidence. In places where no alternative record exists, or where the record has been destroyed by conflict or disaster, this digital proof can be life-changing.</p><p>The crucial question, of course, is how to balance the risks of a surveillance state against the power of technology to deliver services and protect fundamental rights. Put more simply, it\u2019s not as if those who would like to use their data for good want to sacrifice their privacy; they want the power to control that balance themselves, rather than being at the mercy of corporate giants and government agencies.</p><p>The answer lies, at least in part, in empowering people to use their own data to prove vital facts about themselves, advocate for their own interests, and advance their own goals. This bottom-up approach upends the traditional power structures in which governments and commercial actors collect large troves of data to advance their own goals. It\u2019s a powerful leveler.</p><p>The Center for Data Innovation has observed that \u201cto take advantage of [data-driven innovations], individuals must have access to high-quality data about themselves and their communities.\u201d This is absolutely true, and it speaks to the problem of data poverty and the social and economic inequalities that result from a lack of collection or use of data about certain groups of people. But we must go a step further: individuals must be empowered to have good data about themselves and also to use that data to advance their own goals.</p><p>Privacy advocates are leading important efforts to allow citizens to control who uses their data, for what, and under which circumstances. These endeavors allow us to say \u201cno\u201d to surveillance and over-exposure.

But when the European Union (EU) lined up against Microsoft, the decision of 13 begowned judges of the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg was of interest. The judges' ruling on Monday September 17th, which amounted to a trouncing for the software giant, even provided some drama. Microsoft's appeal against an antitrust punishment imposed by the European Commission in 2004 was rejected almost entirely.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Neelie Kroes, the EU's competition commissioner, did not betray the delight of Europe's regulators. She called it a \"bittersweet\" victory and added that \"Microsoftmust now comply fully with its legal obligations\". Those obligations refer to demands made by the commission in 2004 after it decided against Microsoftin a case begun nine years ago. Then Sun Microsystems charged that Microsoftwas refusing to share information that would allow \"interoperability\" between its servers and equipment produced by the software giant.</p><p>Along the way another complaint over \"bundling\" was added to Microsoft's charge sheet. As with a similar antitrust action brought in America, Microsoftwas accused of abusing its market dominance, and thus damaging excluded rivals, by tying its own media software to its Windows operating system. An American judge ordered Microsoftto be broken up, a punishment overturned on appeal in 2001 when a toothless remedy was imposed instead. Microsoft's model of expanding into new markets by adding products to its dominant operating system endured.</p><p>In Europe Microsoftfought a hard legal battle while simultaneously mounting a charm offensive (a tricky proposition for Steve Ballmer, the firm's pugnacious boss). The firm hoped that the EU would also settle rather than pursue its decisions to force Microsoftto disclose or license its server protocols, supply Windows without a media player and impose a fine of E497m ($612m).</p><p>Although keen to reach a settlement, Microsoftalso argued that it had done nothing wrong. It used Apple's iTunes software as an example of competition in the media-software market. Microsoftalso argued that consumers were indifferent, noting that only a handful of copies of Windows had been sold without a media-player compared with millions including it. And the firm insisted that it should not be forced to give up server data which amounts to valuable intellectual property. The EU, for its part, was keen to pursue the legal case against Microsoft. Mario Monti, a previous competition commissioner, made it clear that he wanted a court to set a precedent and act as a caution to other tech firms in dominant positions. </p><p>At the weekend Microsoftgave warning to rivals which had lined up to support the European case that a newly emboldened Commission could have them in its sights too. The decision will certainly provide fresh impetus for outstanding cases against Intel, Rambus and others. And other big tech firms like Apple and Google may yet feel the Commission's breath on their necks. There could also be more action against Microsoft.</p><p>But Microsoft's greater concern may well be the advance of open-source software and open standards. Linux, an open-source operating system, is widely used in servers and among the technically minded but--for now--constitutes no threat to Windows. Firefox, an open-source browser, is used by at least one in ten instead of Microsoft's Internet Explorer. Windows and Office, the firm's word-processing and other applications, are the backbone of Microsoft. But increasingly the rise of online applications will lessen the importance of operating systems and may eventually chip away at Microsoft's dominance. </p><p>The Commission's tough line may at least offer some succour to Microsoft's rivals. But Ms Kroes's desire to see Microsoftsuffer a \"significant drop in [market] share\" that Windows enjoys (95% of the world's one billion or so computers use the system) looks fanciful in the short term. Microsoft's pride may have been hurt by the court, but its dominance is hardly under immediate threat.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECOCOM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECOCOM2007</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4PPH-BFM0-TXDN-C16G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">251202</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-12-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"695\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2007 Economist Newspapers, NA, Incorporated All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Economist.Com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"09\" year=\"2007\"><dateText>September 18, 2007 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC000243V</classCode><className>ORACLE AMERICA INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS334111 ELECTRONIC COMPUTER MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC5045 COMPUTERS &amp;

But when the European Union (EU) lined up against Microsoft, the decision of 13 begowned judges of the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg was of interest. The judges' ruling on Monday September 17th, which amounted to a trouncing for the software giant, even provided some drama. Microsoft's appeal against an antitrust punishment imposed by the European Commission in 2004 was rejected almost entirely.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Neelie Kroes, the EU's competition commissioner, did not betray the delight of Europe's regulators. She called it a \"bittersweet\" victory and added that \"Microsoftmust now comply fully with its legal obligations\". Those obligations refer to demands made by the commission in 2004 after it decided against Microsoftin a case begun nine years ago. Then Sun Microsystems charged that Microsoftwas refusing to share information that would allow \"interoperability\" between its servers and equipment produced by the software giant.</p><p>Along the way another complaint over \"bundling\" was added to Microsoft's charge sheet. As with a similar antitrust action brought in America, Microsoftwas accused of abusing its market dominance, and thus damaging excluded rivals, by tying its own media software to its Windows operating system. An American judge ordered Microsoftto be broken up, a punishment overturned on appeal in 2001 when a toothless remedy was imposed instead. Microsoft's model of expanding into new markets by adding products to its dominant operating system endured.</p><p>In Europe Microsoftfought a hard legal battle while simultaneously mounting a charm offensive (a tricky proposition for Steve Ballmer, the firm's pugnacious boss). The firm hoped that the EU would also settle rather than pursue its decisions to force Microsoftto disclose or license its server protocols, supply Windows without a media player and impose a fine of E497m ($612m).</p><p>Although keen to reach a settlement, Microsoftalso argued that it had done nothing wrong. It used Apple's iTunes software as an example of competition in the media-software market. Microsoftalso argued that consumers were indifferent, noting that only a handful of copies of Windows had been sold without a media-player compared with millions including it. And the firm insisted that it should not be forced to give up server data which amounts to valuable intellectual property. The EU, for its part, was keen to pursue the legal case against Microsoft. Mario Monti, a previous competition commissioner, made it clear that he wanted a court to set a precedent and act as a caution to other tech firms in dominant positions. </p><p>At the weekend Microsoftgave warning to rivals which had lined up to support the European case that a newly emboldened Commission could have them in its sights too. The decision will certainly provide fresh impetus for outstanding cases against Intel, Rambus and others. And other big tech firms like Apple and Google may yet feel the Commission's breath on their necks. There could also be more action against Microsoft.</p><p>But Microsoft's greater concern may well be the advance of open-source software and open standards. Linux, an open-source operating system, is widely used in servers and among the technically minded but--for now--constitutes no threat to Windows. Firefox, an open-source browser, is used by at least one in ten instead of Microsoft's Internet Explorer. Windows and Office, the firm's word-processing and other applications, are the backbone of Microsoft. But increasingly the rise of online applications will lessen the importance of operating systems and may eventually chip away at Microsoft's dominance. </p><p>The Commission's tough line may at least offer some succour to Microsoft's rivals. But Ms Kroes's desire to see Microsoftsuffer a \"significant drop in [market] share\" that Windows enjoys (95% of the world's one billion or so computers use the system) looks fanciful in the short term. Microsoft's pride may have been hurt by the court, but its dominance is hardly under immediate threat.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECOCOM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECOCOM2007</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4PP9-CBW0-TXDN-C1F0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">251202</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-12-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"695\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2007 Economist Newspapers, NA, Incorporated All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Economist.Com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"09\" year=\"2007\"><dateText>September 17, 2007 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC000243V</classCode><className>ORACLE AMERICA INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS334111 ELECTRONIC COMPUTER MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC5045 COMPUTERS &amp;

Wall Street banks enjoyed decades of unfettered growth before coming to be seen, as Matt Taibbi, a journalist, described Goldman Sachs, as a \"vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity\". Today another backlash is gaining strength, this time against the giant digital squids, whose tentacles are encircling both public and personal life. In June the European Commission fined Google a record-breaking ?2.4bn ($2.7bn) for suppressing rival comparison-shopping sites. (The firm filed an appeal this week.) The tech giants continue to snap up or shamelessly copy smaller rivals. </p><p>A rising figure in the cohort of tech-company critics is Franklin Foer, a journalist at the Atlantic. His new book \"World Without Mind\" decries society's capture by big technology companies, mainly Amazon, Facebook and Google. His criticisms are wide-ranging, but centre on the idea that they have become monopolies. Their dominance has gutted the financial health of publishers and music companies. He even charges tech firms with having bruised democracy: they serve up information based on opaque algorithms, suggesting what people should think, and so supplanting individual thought. Mr Foer compares tech's lack of transparency to Italy, \"where it's never entirely clear how power really operates\". </p><p>The book flits between history, philosophy and politics, but it is also a first-hand tale. Mr Foer was editor of the New Republic under Chris Hughes, one of Facebook's founders, who bought the well-respected but loss-making magazine in 2012. An amicable partnership soured as Mr Hughes tried to push the New Republic to chase superficial, bite-sized stories to win cheap digital advertising. Mr Foer and most of the staff left in protest. His recounting of this clash between old and new media is authentic and absorbing. </p><p>But Mr Foer does not want to seem \"fuelled by anger\", and he makes a few important points. One is that tech firms exert so much power that people demur from criticising them. Mr Foer saw this first-hand when he became an activist against Amazon's treatment of authors and publishers. Because the online giant could influence the success of books, many lawyers and publishing executives feared speaking out.</p><p>Mr Foer's concern about opacity is also spot-on. For example, Facebook and Google are not bound by requirements to report sales of political advertising as traditional media firms are. Recent revelations of Russian ad-buying on Facebook during America's presidential election underscore the risk of so little oversight.</p><p>\"World Without Mind\" joins books such as \"Move Fast and Break Things\" by Jonathan Taplin, published earlier this year, and Tim Wu's excellent \"The Master Switch\", from 2010, in arguing that regulators need to look at these world-changing companies more critically. But readers looking for an enduring, well-researched manifesto about big tech's dangers will be disappointed by the book's lazy generalisations. Mr Foer is not a business journalist or economist, and he cares little for financial and legal details. He uses the word \"monopoly\" liberally but not specifically, consigning to a footnote that \"My hope is that we revive monopoly as a core piece of political rhetoric that broadly denotes dominant firms with pernicious powers.\"</p><p>Mr Foer also claims that the tech giants, compete only \"on the fringes of empire\", betraying a weak grasp on their business models. Facebook and Google battle for digital advertising. They both, along with Amazon, compete vigorously to offer video\u2014a growing segment. And he conflates Amazon's control of so many sectors with Jeff Bezos's ownership of the Washington Post, without showing that Mr Bezos's business interests have influenced the paper's coverage. (Indeed, the Post recently published an excerpt from Mr Foer's book.)</p><p>When it comes to solutions, he is also breezy. He suggests that much as some consumers have shunned packaged, unhealthy foods in favour of artisanal options, they might opt for new ways to spend time online. This optimistic solution misses a critical point. There is no local-farming equivalent of a search engine or an online social network. And tech firms are pushing into new sectors, even buying up the local alternatives that Mr Foer suggested as solutions in his food analogy (this summer Amazon bought Whole Foods, a grocer). Examining tech firms is more urgent than ever. Mr Foer is right to be sceptical, but his is not the final word.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>World Without Mind: The Existential Threat of Big Tech.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-VU6NKEF</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PGD-WD31-DY2R-2183-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"760\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

Yet our government has mostly been content to sit on the sidelines, ducking the tough issues raised by the likes of Google and Facebook.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As of this week, it has no excuse for further inaction. A blue-ribbon panel appointed by the government itself has produced a set of bold recommendations designed to make sure the digital giants contribute a lot more to the system they profit from so generously.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Aside from scores of specific suggestions for change (97 in all), the panel offers something sadly lacking in government policy so far in this vital area: a sense of urgency.</p><p>It calls for immediate action in a few areas. That includes applying sales taxes to digital subscriptions with foreign-based companies like Netflix and Apple TV, in the same way they're charged for Canadian companies. This is a total no-brainer and should be implemented without delay. In fact, Quebec and Saskatchewan already do it.</p><p>Beyond that, the panel recommends a series of actions guided by a simple and incontestable principle set out by its chair, Janet Yale: \"If you benefit from operating in the Canadian system, you should contribute.\"</p><p>For example, it says, foreign-based streaming services, with Netflix again most prominent, should contribute to Canadian content, just as domestic content producers must do. The Trudeau government has promised legislation along these lines; this recommendation gives it more ammunition to go ahead.</p><p>It also calls for companies like Facebook and Google with \"significant Canadian revenues\" to register in this country and be subject to regulation by the CRTC or a new organization it suggests be called the \"Canadian Communications Commission.\"</p><p>That would bring an end to the current situation in which foreign-based tech giants make huge amounts of money in Canada, but because they have little or no physical presence in this country, escape meaningful government scrutiny. It's high time to stop giving them a free pass.</p><p>The panel takes aim at another unacceptable situation: the foreign tech giants have made billions by parasitizing off companies that produce original news content (the Star and similar organizations among them).</p><p>Tech platforms, principally Facebook and Google, \"facilitate the sharing of content produced by other news media typically without any form of compensation to the journalists and media outlets that created the content,\" it says. \"The problem is exacerbated by the imbalance in negotiating power between the dominant platforms and the great number of creators who actually produce the news.\"</p><p>It suggests ways to foster a \"strong, financially stable and independent news sector\" by, among other things, ensuring that news creators \"are compensated for the use of their original content by online platform providers.\" It would also extend a tax credit on labour by news organizations beyond its planned expiration date, and broaden to include broadcast and digital platforms as well as print.</p><p>That's a good idea, but it should be noted that the government's first task is to deliver on the aid package to media that it set out last year. Much of that is still stuck in the federal bureaucracy.</p><p>Another excellent idea is to tear away the secrecy surrounding the algorithms the digital giants use to determine how information is conveyed and displayed. The panel suggests empowering the CRTC to have the companies reveal more about their internal workings, which would help to redress the power imbalance between them and those who actually produce the content they profit from.</p><p>There's much more in the report. It proposes a fundamental rethink of the CBC, including doing away with advertising on all the corporation's platforms within five years.</p><p>That, it says, would allow the corporation to focus exclusively on its public purpose instead of being torn between its public mandate and the commercial imperatives that come from relying on advertising revenue.</p><p>That would come with a hefty price tag if the government was expected to replace all the ad dollars. It could usefully start, therefore, by focusing on weaning the CBC off digital advertising on its website. That competes directly with private-sector news organizations (such as the Star) and makes it that much harder for existing local news operations to pay their way.</p><p>This ambitious report will be extensively debated and is already being hotly contested.

Good morning, everybody, ladies and gentlemen, both in the room as well as on the webcast and, of course, our ABN AMRO colleagues, a warm welcome as well. I'm Dies Donker, Head of the Investor Relations team, and I will be moderating this day today.</p><p>We would like to welcome you to the first Investor Day of ABN AMRO. And today is actually a very special day for us because exactly 3 years ago, on the third Friday in November, we were in the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, and that was for the gong ceremony of our IPO. And today, 3 years later, we're hosting our first Investor Day in the London Stock Exchange.</p><p>Now let me start with a few logistical remarks. Would you mind switching off your phones, please? That's always the one thing that can trouble systems. Secondly, the fire exits. There's 1 in the back over here and 2 on either sides. Sorry, I feel like a stewardess, but we have to do that. And this is a paperless Investor Day. We have sustainability as one of our targets, so hopefully, you've brought your computers and your mobile devices. If not, please raise your hand. We have a backup plan. I don't see any hands raising. Very good. All the disclosures, in case you haven't found them, also for the people on the webcast, they're on the IR website under Financial Disclosures.</p><p>Now before we start, I would like to introduce the people in the front row, our executive committee who are present here today. Would you mind standing up quickly, so the audience can see you? And I'll start with Kees van Dijkhuizen, CEO. I'll go down the route. Tanja Cuppen, our CRO. Let me see who's next, Pieter van Mierlo, our Head of Private Banking; Christian Bornfeld, Head of Innovation and Technology; Daphne de Kluis, CEO of Commercial Banking; Rutger Nouhuijs, CEO of Corporate &amp; Institutional Banking; Frans van der Horst, Head of Retail Banking; and lastly, Clifford Abrahams, our CFO.</p><p>Now the program is as follows, you can see that over here. What you will see is that in the first block, we will discuss Strategy, IT and Risk to be followed by Q&amp;A. Then, we have a block with 2 of our businesses: Retail and Private Banking. After lunch, we will have another 2 businesses, Commercial and Corporate Banking. And then Clifford will wrap up the day with the financial implications of all the speakers before him.</p><p>There's ample time for Q&amp;A, and we've structured it in blocks. So if you have any questions during the presentation, please keep them for the Q&amp;A block. We will use a microphone, by the way, because people will follow us on the webcast as well, and then they can hear you.</p><p>Now before I hand over for Kees to start off the program, there's a little movie we would like to show you.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>KEES C. VAN DIJKHUIZEN, CHAIRMAN OF EXECUTIVE BOARD &amp; CEO, ABN AMRO GROUP N.V.: Good morning, everybody. Welcome today here in London. We're very happy we're here with so many. There's a lot going on in the market, so we appreciate very much your time here, and we hope to use it efficiently. Also efficiently in the sense that we've come now here to London, which also helps I think a bit. I'm very happy here -- to be here, as already said, 3 years after IPO in the Netherlands. I have been CEO now since the first of Jan last year, and before that, I was 3.5 years the CFO of the bank.</p><p>I think it's a good moment now to present our plans but also what we have delivered and also the team. I'm very proud to present the current team, and everybody is already, as Dies said, available for questions. I think the team is a good mix, very good mix actually, of people from the business. All the business CEOs are from within ABN AMRO, and from outside, we have CFO, CRO, CITO. So it's a good balance. I'm around as CEO since the first of Jan last year, as I said, and I've been able to build this team, and I'm very proud of the team.</p><p>I think we delivered very good on our IPO results, what we promised there, and that is also done by this team already for the last 1 to 2 years. After me, Christian will tell you more about how we are innovating the bank at the moment and also preparing ourselves for the future, as you've seen in the movie. Tanja then will elaborate on moderate risk and, of course, also on stress test results. The business CEOs will then update you on priorities but also how we are going to deliver on our refreshed strategy, how we're going to execute it actually, and Clifford will wrap up the financial position of the bank. And well, we can show you then that also, for the future, you can expect from us good results, attractive results and a high capital capacity to return also capital.</p><p>I will now start with the delivery of the IPO 3 years ago, then I will talk you through the strategic steps we've taken already in recent years and then, as said, elaborate on the 4 business lines and say something on income, cost, financial targets and capital, of course.</p><p>If we look at what we realized since IPO, then we have delivered actually on 3 -- since 3 years on ROE, on capital and also on dividends. And of course, it's also based on the good performance of the Dutch economy. If you look at the ROE, 12% in 2015. We've increased it to 14.5% last year, 13.1% the first 9 months of this year. If I look at the core Tier 1, 15.5% in 2015, increased to 18.6% today, year-to-date.</p><p>The only target we're still working on is the C/I ratio, but we're making good progress there as well. And this has always been a bit of a difficult thing for ABN AMRO, the C/I ratio. I think we have already delivered there since the start of the bank with -- coming from 70% cost/income ratio in 2010 to 64% when I became CFO in 2013. And this year, for the first time, we will get clearly into the 50 area. 2 years ago, we sharpened our cost/income target from 56-60% in 2017 to 56-58% in 2020, and today, as you've seen, we've sharpened it further to below 55% in 2022.</p><p>We have delivered on all our promises in a disciplined way, and we're also committed to continue to do that. And as you can see on the right side of the slides, you can see that our share price increased by 25% while the euro stock banks went down by 25% in the same period during -- in the last 3 years since IPO.</p><p>As said, the current team has already taken a lot of strategic steps in the last couple of years. I already mentioned the sharpening of the C/I ratio in 2016, but we also increased significantly the digital performance of the bank. 3 years ago, in the retail bank, 1/3 of our offerings was digital. Today, it's 2/3. We have sharpened the focus of the private bank in Northwest Europe. We bought EUR 6 billion assets under management in Belgium.</p><p>3 months ago, we mentioned around CIB that we're going to sharpen also there. The performance of CIB, getting above hurdle again, lowering RWAs from to EUR 39 billion to EUR 34 billion. And ultimately, 2021, we will deliver also there an ROE again above 10% coming from mid-single digits for a couple of years now.</p><p>And last, but not least, sustainability. A year ago, we already told you about the EUR 150 billion mortgages we have to book, that we want to increase, improve actually the energy label from a D label to an A label in 2030. And that's about 800,000 clients, so that takes, of course, a few years.</p><p>And finally, in the private bank, what we see at the moment, we have started it also, by the way, last year. If we ask new clients if they want Green offerings, 80% says yes to that, so that's also a good thing.</p><p>These 3 steps -- these steps, I think, are very important going after the IPO, but we have, of course, now new plans because we cannot be complacent about what we did. Because banks are challenged actually every day with ambitious models, and it's not new. Because if we look at our bank 10 years ago, we had around a retail branch network of 500 branches, and today, it's 135. We had around 26,000 people, today, it's 19,000. We made a profit 2010 of around EUR 1 billion. Last year, it was EUR 2.8 billion, and the first 9 months, it's actually EUR 2 billion. So we clearly managed also the last decade, the results.</p><p>And as all banks were, are, were, they were very much vertically integrated, advised clients and then gave clients actually the products they wanted. And what you see now, if you look at the trends at the left side, it's very clear there are a lot of trends now in society, and in banking around technology, about unbundling value change, disintermediation, open banking and also the megatrends already mentioned to you with respect to climate change and sharing economy.</p><p>And there's also new competition, of course, from fintechs. They are offering, of course, targeted products but also the big techs, who are very -- getting very close to customers. And also, we see a rise of new forms of dealing with clients in the form of platforms.</p><p>I mentioned already a clear megatrend, sustainability. The Paris agreement, we think, has been a clear game changer there. Every stakeholder knows how important that is. And if we look at sustainability, we also have made that an important part of our new strategy, banking for better for generations to come. And our purpose is also the basis for the refreshed strategy.</p><p>And what we see is that customers, they want, of course, effortless experience and also proactive advice. And if we look at investors, they want, of course, attractive returns but also a responsible investment opportunity. And employees like to work for a purpose-led bank, value-driven. And society wants, of course, all, integrate all the social impacts.</p><p>And what we have done in response to this, we have now decided to be even more as we are, a purpose-led organization that benefit all our shareholders, addressing the changes of the world. And that's the reason why we have refreshed, actually, our strategy into a 3-pillar approach. And the 3-pillar approach is based actually on sustainability. It's actually support our clients in that transition to sustainability, reinvent the customer experience and build a future-proof bank.</p><p>Sustainability, as already also mentioned in the movie, is we think a clear business case. And that means about engaging with clients, not excluding clients, very important. And we want them to help and also, of course, lead by example by what we do. And we are already known for that. We're in the top 5% of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index today. And our engagement survey shows that 93% of our staff wants to help in building a sustainable bank.</p><p>The second pillar is customer experience, and what we want to do there, of course, is first time right, always right. And we also want to move from products to customer journeys. We want more touchpoints actually with our clients, and Christian will tell you more about that. And also, we see an extension of other services to adjacent industries, and we want to become also a service aggregator. We will build on our strengths, build on platforms and keep treasuring the customer relationship, very important. And we have a good starting point with our banking apps, take Tikkie, for instance, a bit over 2 years now, 5 million users.</p><p>And the third pillar is the future-proof bank. And I'm already very proud of our staff. If you look at all what happened and what was delivered, that's been done by our staff. I'm very, very proud about that. And in the future, we want to improve their engagement further by making their employee journeys easier, better IT systems, also invest more in staff, very important, and also improve our future -- our culture, sorry. Yes, future, of course, as well.</p><p>You will hear throughout the day that these pillar are the basis of our new, refreshed strategy and how we implement that actually in the business.</p><p>Now let's start with the retail bank. Retail bank, 5 million clients, 20% of the Dutch population's primary bank; strong profitability, 33%; digital sales, already mentioned, from 1/3 to 2/3; decline in branches; clear sustainability opportunities in the mortgage portfolio. And we see also strong competition in the mortgage part. But we will stay disciplined in our margin -- in our margins. We expect that when the interest situation will normalize in the coming years actually, we expect market share for mortgages to come back more to banks than it is now, right now, with pension funds and insurance companies because clients will go back to shorter-interest periods. And with the continued focus now here in this part of the bank on digital and strengthening the customer engagement, we want to build additional revenue streams, and Frans here will talk more about that.</p><p>Then if we go to the private bank, we are a market leader by far in the Netherlands and also have a good position in Germany and France, third and fifth position. Our year-to-date ROE, 23%. We managed a little under EUR 200 billion assets under management and 100,000 clients. We focus on the private bank in Northwest Europe, onshore. That's the reason why we sold actually Asia and Luxembourg, and that we have now bought Societe in Belgium. And as explained before, in the private bank, sustainable investments are now the norm; 80% new clients takeup. We want to lower the C/I ratio in the private bank to below 70% in 2021, and Pieter will talk more about that, then the commercial bank, Daphne.</p><p>Leading SME bank and also clear sector focus. We serve over 350,000 clients, Dutch SME clients actually turnover until around EUR 250 million. And we're a primary bank for 25%, 1 out of 4 in the Netherlands Dutch enterprises. ROE is good, 15%. With New10 actually, we launched a successful innovator bank and set new standards actually for online borrowing. And 85% of all contacts, we want to initiate -- be initiated digitally in 2022. And we've also EUR 1 billion available for circular business model to help clients to get to a circular business model. Daphne will say more about that.</p><p>And then to CIB. There, we have around 3,000 large clients, financial clients, corporates, in Northwest Europe and also in some specific global sectors. And we leverage that also on our sector knowledge also to neighboring countries actually. We have issued now 12 Green bonds, EUR 8 billion. There are also challenges and opportunities here, especially in the energy and the shipping area, and we will focus actually here also on improving our cross-sell and maximize efficiency. And we want, as said, to improve mid-single digits to above hurdle again. And we have seen now that the decline already from EUR 39 billion RWA went down to EUR 37 billion, and we want to go to EUR 34 billion. If we are there and ROE is clearly above 10% and we also feel comfortable about the Basel IV implications in this portfolio, we can grow modestly again also in this area by 2% or 3%. And Rutger will explore this further.</p><p>Well, how does this all add up to the group? As said, when I joined in 2013, operating income was EUR 7.5 billion. Last year, it was EUR 9 billion. That's a 20% increase in 4 years' time, so we grew significantly. But we have done it profitably. We've done it profitably because we went from 5.5% ROE to over 14% last year. So if we have to choose about operating income growth or profitable growth, we choose for profitable growth.</p><p>And so for the coming years actually, the coming 2 years, next year and 2020, we actually expect a bit of, as we mentioned here, a bit of a flattish loan book, which is based on our market discipline. It's based also on the interest environment. It's based also on pressure on deposits. And as said, we expect interest rates to increase over time, which will improve, but we will stay disciplined for the coming years.</p><p>You will hear throughout the day, there's a lot of initiatives also here to grow fees, and I think especially also investments -- in the investment area and the insurance area of the retail bank. We're also originating to distribute models in the area of especially Rutger. And we also think about inorganic growth. But when we will do that, we will do that not transformational, we will do it bolt-on, and we will maintain a clear, strong capital position.</p><p>So wrapping up, we expect some flattish growth book for the -- flattish loan book for the coming 2 years and afterwards, modest growth again in the coming years. Oh, now I do something different.</p><p>If we go to cost, you can see we delivered there, I would say, for the -- well, for a long time, for the first time actually for a long time, it went down significantly since 2010. And we see further cost opportunities, cost savings opportunities, and that's the reason why we have sharpened our C/I ratio. It's also very much related to our IT landscape, and Christian will tell you more about that. And there are, of course, also some new revenue initiatives, which also helped to bring down the C/I ratio, and Clifford, of course, in the end, he will also mention this further.</p><p>If we go to capital, we have significantly improved our capital position in the last couple of years, 39% when I joined in 2013 to 18.6% and also paying increasing dividends. We are well positioned for Basel IV. We mentioned last week that our core Tier 1 Basel III terms went up from last -- this year, year-to-date from 17.7% to 18.6%. But actually, the Basel IV was more or less flattish, which actually around 13%, and you know our target is 13.5%. And that means that the RWA inflation, and Clifford will talk more about it, the RWA inflation went up from 35% to 43% from Basel III to Basel IV.</p><p>We have now defined mitigating actions for that to bring back the Basel IV RWA inflation to 35%. And that will bring, of course, again the core Tier 1 Basel IV above 13.5%, which is good. And that's the reason why we now also have defined our targets for next year for Basel III. We continue, actually, out to '18 target, 17.5%, 18.5%, also for 2019, subject to SREP, we did not have that letter yet. And that actually means positioned at 18.6% is, of course, a very good starting position for the new year. Stress tests also show that we were very resilient also there.</p><p>There's a constraint, however, which is the leverage ratio in the short term. It's around 4.1x. And we are exploring at the moment a legal merger between bank and group for next year, and that might improve leverage ratio by 20 bps. There's also in Clearing a discussion around the CCR method, which will help us by 50 bps in 2021 at the latest. If possible, we would like to, of course, have that earlier, but that depends on negotiations, which are taking place right now in Brussels.</p><p>So in the short term, it's a constraint, in the medium term, actually perhaps even after next year, if we would realize a merger, much less. We have reserved 60% of our year-to-date results for dividend, and we'll take the final decision in 2019 February, also subject to SREP.</p><p>So we expect for the coming years actually, again, strong ROE, strong capital position and creating clearly a room for a dividend payout above 50%. Then the targets, we sharpened the cost/income ratio. As you can see, it's in green. And we updated the financial -- and we updated the capital target ratio for 2019. And our core Tier 1 is 18.6%, as said.</p><p>Wrapping up, we are a domestic champion in retail, private, commercial and corporate banking in a digitally savvy, strong Dutch economy. We have refreshed our strategy, support our clients, accelerating their sustainability shift. We think this is the right thing to do, but it's also a clear business case. We treasure the customer relationship, very important, increasingly working with partners.</p><p>And we expect in the coming year, as said, a flattish loan book and, from 2020 onwards, again moderate growth. We will deliver on cost savings and while maintaining room for investments in innovation. And our risk profile will stay moderate. In the coming years, we will again deliver attractive returns, and a high capital return capacity will be there. So as a management team, we will continue to do what we did since the last IPO. You can count on that, and we will do that in a disciplined way.</p><p>I would like to thank you very much, and I would now like to hand over to Christian. Thank you very much. I'll take questions later.</p><p>CHRISTIAN BORNFELD, CHIEF INNOVATION &amp; TECHNOLOGY OFFICER AND MEMBER OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD, ABN AMRO GROUP N.V.: Yes. Thank you, everyone. For those of you who I haven't had the pleasure to meet yet, my name is Christian Bornfeld. I'm the Chief Innovation &amp; Technology Officer of ABN AMRO. I'm the latest addition to the management team. I joined ABN AMRO 9 months ago. Before I joined ABN AMRO, I've been working with or for banks for about 20 years, first 10 years with IBM and then 10 years with various Nordic banks in technology innovation-related roles. That's a little bit of background about me.</p><p>At ABN AMRO, I now run a part of ABN AMRO that we also call Innovation &amp; Technology, which covers the group innovation unit, it covers IT, back-office, a number of support functions and various group programs as well. So that's sort of the mandate.</p><p>Okay. So during the next 20 to 25 minutes, I'll give you a short update on 3 topics: one is my current view at the moment on where do we stand when it comes to IT, to digitalization and also to innovation. I'll tell you a little bit about how we're evolving our overall IT delivery model and what that means both from an output point of view but also from a financial perspective. And finally, I will talk about how we are going about reinventing the client experience, both to generate new -- or to leverage new opportunities but also to consider what does that mean for how we configure ABN AMRO going forward, so we're well positioned in the future.</p><p>But before I go into detail on that, I think Kees just introduced the 3 pillars of our refreshed strategy, and for the topics that I'm mentioning, 2 of them are extremely -- well, the 2 -- the topics I'm touching on are core to these 2 other pillars. So one is the reinvent the client experience, and the other one is the future-proof banking piece. I'll come back to the reinvent customer experience a little bit later, but let me just introduce a little bit more on the future-proof banking part because it's a quite broad topic.</p><p>We have spent a quite extensive time, of course, on refreshing the strategy. That's been a process that's been going on for the last 6 to 9 months, and we've been detailing our very specific initiatives and KPIs for each of these pillars. Under the future-proof banking, we have come to the clear conclusion that it's not one thing, it's many things that is required to actually become future-proof.</p><p>So this area covers topics related to people and culture. So we know how important it is, not just to have good people today, but to retain them, to have great people in the future. So there are initiatives that are related to developing, attracting and also retaining the key skills that we will need in the future. There is also a number of initiatives related to driving the employee engagement also going forward.</p><p>There's another category of initiatives under future-proof banking, which go to how we streamline and simplify the bank and make it more focused. And then finally, there is initiatives ready to building capabilities, which is what I will touch on in just a second, and capabilities in various different areas that we feel are essential for us to compete in the future. That includes innovation, it includes partnerships, not least, data is becoming more and more important but also IT and information security. So also, quite some capability building.</p><p>But let me move on to the status on where we are today. So as I said before, I joined 9 months ago and, of course, very eager because when you come in, freshly prepared as you've heard all the sales pitch when you are going through the recruitment process and very eager to look under the hood and see what's actually there, what's working, what's not working. So let me share my observations for each of these pillars one at the time.</p><p>On the IT piece, I don't -- you all know the history of ABN AMRO 10 years ago being pulled apart and then put back together again. That's not something that gives you simplicity. That is something that drives complexity, and indeed, ABN AMRO has had quite a large number of application and a quite complex IT landscape. So around 5,000 applications or so was sort of the net portfolio, which is big for a bank of our size and our scope.</p><p>Luckily, I would say the team has been quite diligent and focused in execution over the last 4 years and through a targeted effort, decommissioned a lot of applications and also re-platformed them, which has really brought down our application portfolio to a level, so we're now not at 5,000 but at 3,000, and this has reduced both the complexity but also the operational risk and at the end of the day, allows us to take out efficiency over time. So a good effort there and provides a solid base for us on the IT piece.</p><p>Another distinguishing factor from ABN AMRO is the adoption of agile development practices. So for those of you who don't know, so we're putting together teams from the business side and the IT side into small integrated teams, removing some of the inefficiencies that are traditionally in IT development due to the friction between the silos. ABN AMRO has done this, not just piecemeal in some areas like most banks, but has done it across the board. I think that's a good move, and it positions us very well for sort of the next steps in creating efficiency in the IT setup.</p><p>So where does that leave us now? And what are we working on the last half year? Well, the last half year or so, we have been sharpening up the rejuvenation plan. So even though we have brought down complexity, we still have legacy systems that will continuously need to be rejuvenated and replaced over the coming periods. The good news is it's not going to be a big wall-to-wall replacement. It's going to be a stepwise replacement, and we have clarified and sharpened the road maps in those areas. The main focus for us when it comes to rejuvenation in the next couple of years will be in the risk and capital area, where we have a complex system landscape, and also in the area of credits, where we believe we can add a lot more value to our clients if we rejuvenate that piece.</p><p>If you look at the digital part, of course, an observation when you come into the Netherlands is that it is a quite digitally mature environment, also compared to the rest of Europe. And that's certainly the case. We also see that in the statistics when you look at the adoption of mobile apps, Internet banking, extremely high for us and our clients and good experience there. That gives us a luxury in that we can actually design our processes from a digital-first perspective. We can assume that people want to be served digitally, and also that they -- that we can actually process things in a digital manner.</p><p>We've been leveraging that opportunity in the last 2, 3 years to really drive efficiency in the back-office side, and you will see the number of people we have in back-office. We have been able to reduce that gradually over the last couple of years, and we certainly need to continue that. I would say my observation is what we can do within that narrow context today is probably tapped. But I think the next step for us is to look much more holistically across front office, mid-office and back-office, especially as we shift even more to digital in our engagement with clients, we can do even more.</p><p>When you look at the digital engagement part, Kees already mentioned that we're pretty happy with where we are, and I would concur to that. I think retail has managed to establish, not just 1 strong digital presence, but a portfolio of applications that we provide to our clients, which cover a broad range and provide a very strong service to them. So I think from a retail point of view, I think we can truly say that we are leading in the Dutch market when it comes to serving them digitally, which is a great achievement because that's not where we were 2 years ago.</p><p>When it comes to digital interface, I think we are trying to -- or we will take the good experiences that we have from retail, and we will leverage those for private banking and CB. We've already done that in some areas, but you will see our road map being executed over the next year or 2, and both Daphne and Pieter will come back to the activities in that space.</p><p>So overall, pretty good place from a digitalization point of view, more to do internally. On the client side, I think we're doing reasonably well, but that's an area that's always moving. So we need to keep the pace.</p><p>On the innovation side, I must say that's one of the areas where I was most surprised when I came into ABN AMRO positively, and well, I guess that's also one of the areas where I'm also quite proud still that ABN AMRO has done quite a lot of things, given the sort of bank we are in the area of innovation. I think a lot of that comes back to DNA in the ABN AMRO employee base, which is extremely entrepreneurial so which is really good. And you can see that sort of in the innovation efforts we do, lots of engagement. Everybody wants to get involved.</p><p>Over the last 2, 3 years, the building blocks around innovation have been put in place. We have a strong group innovation team with knowledgeable people from a broad range of backgrounds. We have a digital impact fund. We have the challengers. So I think the starting point is very good. What we're missing in innovation today is focus. So with the new strategy, with the refreshed strategy that we are putting in place now, that will give us the focus and will accelerate us in the innovation piece and make it even stronger. So I'm very positive when it comes to the innovation area and our position there.</p><p>If we dive into the IT piece and the IT delivery model, just to give you a little bit of historical context or a little bit context where we're coming from. So these are average 2015 to '17 numbers, ABN AMRO as a group spends around EUR 1.5 billion a year on IT. That cost is spent on 2 things. One is running the bank, basically keeping the lights on, running applications, fixing errors as they occur, and then on changing the bank. This sort of split between 50 -- the split today is 55%, 45%. Just to give you a reference point, most banks today that I work with across Europe when I talk to them are somewhere in the range between 30% to 40% of change spend. So actually, being at 45% is above that range. So we generally do more change at ABN AMRO than our peers do around Europe. So that's a good place to be, and that's where new value is generated.</p><p>It also gives us, of course, some reflections on can that be optimized in one way or another. So therefore, we look into what do we actually use to change spend for? In ABN AMRO, we have a target to spend a certain amount of all our change effort on actually rejuvenating the IT systems, keeping them up-to-date and replacing them stepwise, as I mentioned before. I think that's a very smart thing to do, something we will continue to do. This is like replacing the spare parts in your car as they break instead of buying a new car every year. It is more efficient, and it's also better from a risk profile to keep your systems updated all the time. So if you see banks go below 10% or so of their change capacity for that sort of thing, that's normally a warning sign.</p><p>We also use quite an extensive -- quite a substantial part of our change effort on regulatory agenda, and we will continue to do that also through the coming years. So somewhere in the range of 20% to 30% of our change effort actually goes to purely regulatory requirements. But that's something that we are managing. It's certainly an area that we are prioritizing. That leaves about 50% of the change spend for business development, and that's where we're also targeting to be going forward.</p><p>From a financial point of view, one thing that's worthwhile noting that is also different at ABN AMRO compared to peers is that we don't capitalize or we do very little capitalization of our IT development spend. That has that one -- it has -- well, over time, it shouldn't make a difference, but in the shorter term, it does give us more flexibility in order to adjust our IT spend year-over-year. We are not carrying amortizations from previous years' IT investments into our budget for the coming years. That's a good place.</p><p>But this is just where we are, and of course, IT is the most interesting place to be because things change all the time. So the way we developed IT systems 5 years ago is different from how we do it today, and if you look back 10 years, it's completely different. So that also means that new opportunities are arising all the time to become even better. So we have put together now a plan on how to take IT to the next step, both continuing on the levers that we had already identified and also adding some new levers.</p><p>I think the main characteristic of the new plan for us is that it's truly a joint effort across the entire team that you see here on the front row. It's not something that IT can do alone, it's something that we will do together as a group. Because there are several levers, and they cover these sort of 4 groups that you see on the slide. One related to demand, being even more focused in where we develop or where we put our IT investments but also to do it together with the rationalization that we will be doing in our products and processes and coming together on joint platforms. So the demand side will be much more focused.</p><p>On the productivity side, I mentioned before, we had shifted from traditional development into agile development. We will now over the coming years take the further shift into what we call DevOps, which is even more integrating teams and automating how we deliver software going forward. That will drive even more efficiency. Together with that, we have a quite extensive offshoring set up in ABN AMRO today, which has been around for some years. There's also room there to drive additional efficiency, and we will also address that during the coming years.</p><p>Finally, on the supply side, the entire industry is currently looking at what do you deliver out of your own basement, your own data centers versus what can be delivered from cloud providers. We have been quite early adopters in that space, and we see certain opportunities there also for optimizing the way we deliver IT. So this combination of several levers gives us confidence that we can actually move the needle and stay ahead, not just in efficiency, but also be the fastest in the market and also have the best access to the newest technology. So a quite broad plan.</p><p>But if you look at this in sort of the broader context of the industry -- next slide, please. Thank you. This is sort of a simple framework that when the CIOs of this world come together and drink coffee, we used to compare ourselves sometimes. On the one hand, you have the C/I ratios or the cost/income ratio. On the other, on the x-axis, you see the IT spend a share of operating income. It gives you some sort of feel of how much are you actually spending as a bank compared to your size.</p><p>ABN AMRO has in this context been what we call a type 2 bank for quite some time. We have been spending quite a lot of our money on IT every year, so we have been investing heavily. We've also been above the European average or the sample average when it comes to cost/income ratio, so it also makes sense. Invest in IT to drive down your cost/income ratio by reducing cost or increasing income. So the logic is certainly there. We've been a high investor in IT.</p><p>Over the last year or so, the levers that we have been applying over the last 2 to 3 years on reducing the number of applications and other things has allowed us to gradually reduce, again, the IT spend while still delivering the same. We expect that trend, given the levers that I just mentioned, to continue. So we will gradually be delivering the same or even more, if we can, but gradually be pulling back our IT investments as the cost/income ratio also goes down. So directionally, that's where we're going. Next slide, please.</p><p>So on the IT piece, to summarize, some of the key levers that we are pulling here on the demand side, as I said, continuing the work that has been going on for some years on reducing the number of applications, so you can say, well, the curve is not that steep anymore, but I would also tell you with the first 2,000 are the easy ones. The next ones become a little bit more difficult and more difficult. So certainly, we expect the pace to be slower, but we still see quite some potential in simplifying the application landscape, and it will be a strong driver for efficiency. We're also shifting, as I said, teams towards DevOps, that means, more integrated teams, smaller teams and highly automated teams. So that projection, you will see going forward from now and until 2020, we will have shifted quite a -- probably, the majority of our teams into a DevOps mode.</p><p>And finally, the shift towards cloud. We see good potential for that for most of the new workloads that we put in place that we can leverage cloud and that will be more substantial part of our installed base over the coming years.</p><p>So in conclusion of that, or the result of that is that we will shift our IT cost as part of -- a share of operating income from 16%, which it was in 2017. I already showed you we've already made a shift in 2018, and we will keep sort of directionally going there until we hit what we define as the sweet spot, which is around 12% to 13%, as you saw on the previous slide. So this is directionally where we are taking IT. Yes, next slide.</p><p>So let me shift to the next topic and over the next 5, 6 minutes, give you a short introduction also to how we're approaching -- reinventing the client experience. I will give you sort of an overview on how we're approaching it, then each of the business lines will provide you with numerous examples on how they are actually doing it in each of their business lines because this is truly a joint effort between the I&amp;T team and the individual business lines on how we go about this.</p><p>We have chosen to do a two-pronged approach. So approaching the reinvention from 2 perspectives: one is a step-by-step incremental improvement of the client experience that you see sort of here on the left-hand side. It covers basically 3 focus areas that we have at the moment. One is improving the accessibility, so clients' ability to engage with the bank, big topic there is introducing video meetings, chat, driving up the adoption there, key focus area, you will hear that from many of the business lines.</p><p>The next part is moving to instant or we call it instant gratification, shortening the time that -- between clients engaging with us to they actually get the answer they need. We have done some things in that area, but we still need to move from days to hours to minutes in some of these processes, and that's by further automation, digitalizing inputs and outputs, but also automating decisions through the use of AI and other technologies going forward.</p><p>And finally, using data analytics, continuing to extend our use of that to make sure that we become even more proactive in our engagement with clients and also relevant when we then engage with them that we know exactly what to talk to them about, providing a better client experience, but also increasing conversion rates for most of these processes.</p><p>So the step-by-step approach, we will continue to accelerate that, and we are doing that at the moment, also by leveraging synergies across the business lines, but we need to combine that with another approach, which is more of a greenfield approach because we have been doing incremental improvements for quite some years, and there is that -- the downside with that is you shouldn't lose sight of the bigger picture. So we believe that now is also the time to really start zooming out in a number of areas and zooming out in order to identify new opportunities, new revenue streams and also, specifically on fee income. Zooming out in order to also identify other areas where we can start engaging with clients even earlier also from a defensive point of view, so we can counter potential disintermediation.</p><p>And finally, also zooming out, to understand the dynamics in the value chain before they engage with, our clients engage with us and after because many of the megatrends that we were discussing earlier or in Kees' presentation, be that sustainability or others like urbanization, sharing economy or privacy issues. You need to understand the broader context to position yourselves well. So the zoom out part of the reinvention is really key also to our approach. But to make that a little bit more concrete, let me just show you a quick example. So what we do is that we select -- we have already selected, and we are working with a set number of client journeys. We look at client journeys very holistically also most -- more holistically than most banks that I know of at least, to really do the zoom out exercise. So the example you see here, we call realizing the entrepreneurial dream. So it's actually co-developed together with Daphne's team. We also have other journeys. Give you another example: comfortable and sustainable living, which is in Frans' area, related to mortgages. So we do this for the selected journeys. We map them out, as you can see here for realizing my entrepreneurial dream. This gives you sort of -- we've identified 33 sort of key decision point for our client as they go through that process from waking up one morning and saying, I would really like to start a company to they're actually up and running. When we then look at these decision points, we identify that there are 4 out of the 33 where ABN AMRO today actually engages with the clients, so it's only a quite small subset. Our main focus is, of course, to make sure that those 4 are really good. So we do that first. And within living by -- realizing my entrepreneurial dream, there are currently 2 areas that we're focusing on, one is the onboarding process, which is still too cumbersome. We've done great strides in that space when it comes to retail on onboarding through mobile app. We're trying to replicate that experience also for entrepreneurs.</p><p>The other part is time to credit decisions. So as I mentioned before, days is the norm, move that to hours or even minutes. And we're using our challenger banks like New10 to actually test that out and see how fast can we actually make that happen, and we've made great strides there. But that's again just focusing on what we're already good at. Now if we zoom out and look before at what we normally engage. We are looking at identifying various opportunities for engaging clients earlier. So in this example, it's by building communities where we bring together different people who are thinking about being entrepreneurs. It's by looking at new revenue opportunities where we partner with the traditional partners like insurance companies, legal advisers, accountants, to add additional services that we can put in front of the client. But also after the normal engagement with clients, that we look at how can we help them to grow their business later on by hiring additional staff or as they record to our new purpose and strategy as well, how can we ensure that they don't become just good entrepreneurs, but also sustainable entrepreneurs going forward.</p><p>So again, identify new opportunities. And each of the teams working on these journeys are identifying numerous opportunities every time, and we're pursuing those at the moment. But a characteristic of these opportunities, next slide, please, is that a lot of it, we are not going to do ourselves. So us, moving broader into the value chain does not imply that ABN AMRO needs to do everything. And I think that's something partly new for a bank. So most banks, as Kees mentioned earlier, said, they are used to being virtually integrated or at least that's where we come from 10 to 15 years ago. So we produce what we sell, we sell what we produce. It's been a sort of simple model. That's no longer the case. And as many of you, I also know that 5, 6 years ago, the doom and gloom of banking was announced, fintechs are coming to disintermediate all of you and then banks will no longer be vertically integrated, they will be horizontal. They will be big production factories behind a lot of fancy fintechs that will engage with your clients. So that was our scary scenario, and what we were positioning ourselves towards 5 or 6 years ago. That did not play out. The fintechs that engage with clients have struggled at least in the continental European market, to really generate revenues and also, bottom line, to be honest, because client acquisition costs remain high. The fintechs that we were concerned about have no -- not entered the market aggressively yet, but are more searching for -- to us and others to look for partnerships. Part of that can also be due to the Netherlands, while we think Netherlands is big in the bigger scheme of things, maybe Netherlands is too small for a big tech. So I think, from that point of view, we are also lucky that we -- to some degree are geographically protected in that sense. So how do we see this play out? We don't see it play out as a vertical, we don't see it playing out as a horizontal. We see it play out more or less in the what you see depicted here. So we see in the distribution piece that we still will play a very strong role with our strong digital propositions, but more and more, together with our partners and also, with our fintechs, working together with them to provide very strong experiences towards our clients through the platforms that they wish going forward.</p><p>On the production side, where people predicted that this would only be banks producing, we're actually seeing a different dynamic there. We're engaging a lot more with fintechs now in the production side, and we see that we can narrow our scope as a bank more and more in the production side and actually work with fintechs to provide core systems, processing end-to-end or specific solutions that we would not want to produce ourselves.</p><p>So actually, as much partnership discussion going on in the back-end as there is on the front-end, which is not something we thought a couple of years ago.</p><p>The final dynamic we see is that a lot of the services that banks produced historically, have enormous scale effects, and they have also become commoditized, which means there's a strong incentive to push into utilities where you can share the scale with other banks. We've not had a strong tradition for that in the Netherlands, but that is picking up at the moment. Latest example being the collaboration with Rabo and ING on ATMs and cash handling that we announced not long ago.</p><p>Okay, next slide, please. Final point from my side, challenger banks. This is an area where we have been a front-runner. We have launched several challenger banks from ABN AMRO over the last couple of years, and we've done that basically for 2 reasons: one is to develop and to test new propositions, and we have traditionally said, it's also fine that you cannibalize the main bank. So we've really used this to give these new challengers the confidence, the space, to really develop, which can be constraining within a bank. But also to be a canary in the coal mine. So to really see how powerful is their disruptive forces. So we've learned quite a lot from that. The other thing that we use the challengers for is actually to test technology. So as an IT person for a bank, typically, we are as risk-averse as Tanja, who will be here in just a second, we are very cautious about replacing IT systems that are doing millions of transactions a day and need to run all the time. But by having the challengers, we've been able to, in combination with the digital impact fund, where we invest in certain fintechs, actually to bring that technology in, test it at a smaller scale in a challenger bank and then based on that experience, to leverage it much faster within the main bank than what we otherwise could. And you will see that sort of flow happening more over the next couple of years. So hopefully, we will be able to actually skip a generation of technology based on the experience that we build through our challengers. So 2 strong propositions for still doing that. That being said, over the coming months, we will review and continue to evolve the challenger concepts so we ensure that we maximize the return that we get out of these challengers, both from a financial point of view and also, from a learning point of view, as I just said. Next slide, please.</p><p>So finally, wrapping up. I think solid starting point -- solid base when it comes to the IT piece. Pretty comfortable where we are. Very happy, proud of what the team has accomplished the last couple of years through disciplined execution. We have a lot more we can do and should do and that never stops in IT. So I'm sure when we've done that, there will be another sort of mountain to climb behind that. So looking forward to that. But lots of potential still.</p><p>And finally, I think we are taking a quite holistic approach to how we reinvent the client experience and look for new revenue opportunities and also face off potential threats to our business model. And I think given, if you look at sort of how we're restructuring ourselves and with our lengthy experience in working with fintechs, having challengers ourselves, being one of the most progressive in the Netherlands, when it comes to working with APIs, I think we're really well positioned when you look also for the coming years. So thank you. I will hand over to Tanja.</p><p>TANJA J. A. M. CUPPEN, CHIEF RISK OFFICER &amp; MEMBER OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD, ABN AMRO GROUP N.V.: Yes, I don't need this one. Okay, thank you, Christian. Good morning, everyone. Very nice to meet you in person. It's -- I will first introduce myself before going into the slides. My name is Tanja Cuppen, and I joined ABN AMRO as Chief Risk Officer slightly over a year ago. Well, enough time to get a good grip on the risk profile of the bank. I'm a person that tends to have a positive stance, but it's my role as well to voice the negatives. With my team, I ask attention for the concerns, the adverse scenarios to be considered before decisions are taken and also ask for investments before go live, and you heard Christian talking about risk awareness in his department.</p><p>I will share today how we do this. I see it as my role to make sure that we take risks, risks that we understand, that we can monitor over time and risks that we can price properly.</p><p>So risk management is not about not taking risk. It's about taking the risk that we understand and to make sure that the risk profile of the bank is safeguarded. That is hard work, every day, again, it requires a lot of fine tuning and discipline and disciplined execution of the plans that we will hear about today. And about execution of plans, Kees already alluded to our strategy, and on my next slide, I will address how risk management is contributing to the execution of the strategy of the bank.</p><p>And allow me first to say a few words on strategy before I go to the items on the slide. The strategic choices we make today will be very important in the risk profile of the bank of the future. I want to make sure that this current strategy and the choices we make keep us in a moderate risk profile. A few elements that I would like to mention how this will be safeguarded are the following: by focusing on supporting clients in the sustainability shift and our purpose, banking for better, for generations to come, we have our customers in the core of our strategy. This puts vigor around our choices on products, on sectors and on partnerships. It steers us away from the standard assets of the future. And it also puts the duty of care and knowing our customers central to what we are doing. Our refreshed strategy is not only close to my heart as a person, but also, as a CRO. I believe, it's a very sound basis for a moderate risk profile.</p><p>So now moving to the bullet here on the slide, outlining our commitment in the strategy. Our geographical focus will continue to be mostly on the Netherlands and Northwest Europe. Strong economies. We will focus on assets with the right risk return, and we will stay committed to a sound asset quality and strong balance sheet. We anticipate changes to come, where there will be changes in economy, changes in regulations or changes in technology.</p><p>Before I'm going to address the developments in the nonfinancial risk area in my outlook, I'll first go into credit risk because that's one of the most significant risk categories that I would like to address with you.</p><p>So let's first go to the next slide and look at the strong economies that we serve. I said, Netherlands and Northwestern Europe are our dominant locations and in the slide, you see that 70% of our clients are in the Netherlands and over 85% in Northwest Europe. GDP is expected to grow with over -- with 2% in 2019 in these regions. So we are due perfectly concentrated, but our business is actually quite well diversified over the 4 business lines you see here and each business line will present today, and you will see that performance and risk drivers are quite diverse.</p><p>The loan books vary by business line in size. But if you look at capital expressed in risk-weighted assets, it's actually quite evenly spread. It's commercial banking and retail, both good for 1 quarter and C&amp;IB, almost -- slightly over 1/3. Impairments this year definitely had my attention and probably also yours. I would like to point you to the bottom 2 lines of this slide, and you will see that the average impairments since 2015 were well below the through-the-cycle cost of risk as we indicated at IPO. But this average, however, doesn't tell the full story. And for that, I would like to take you to the next slide.</p><p>Before I go to the charts on the slide, I want to emphasize that most loan portfolios performed well and benefit from the strong economy. You see that our nonperforming loans ratio has dropped from 3.5% in 2014 to 2.2% now. And I expect this trend will continue. Now going to the slide, and first to the left-hand side. On the slide, actually both charts, you see that the lines are -- show a rising trend. I do not expect this trend to continue, and I will tell you why. On the left-hand side, you see the rolling average over the longer period of time, and this trend shows that currently, the cost of risk is well below the through-the-cycle cost of risk. From the low point in 2017, it goes up in 2018. And on the right hand, I zoom into this. The different lines you see here are by product. You see 2 lines: one for mortgages and one for consumer credit and the risk cost for both products are close to 0 over the past years.</p><p>So actually, the elevated impairments are concentrated in our corporate loan book. And I will address that in the next slide and give you some more detail there. These elevated impairments were very much in specific segments. I have taken out 4 of subsegments and these 4 make up 75% of the year-to-date impairments that we have written. The segments are Offshore, TCF, Diamonds, Shipping and domestic hospitals. The first 3 portfolios are in C&amp;IB and managed by Rutger, the last one is in commercial banking and managed by Daphne. As discussed in the analyst calls over the past quarters, the level of impairments were really disappointing. These developments have, of course, my full attention, and were assessed in great detail.</p><p>We have tightened several policies, standards and procedures to make sure that we address any weaknesses underlying these portfolios. The CIB refocus is also used to reduce the exposure and the risk to the most cyclical parts of the portfolio, being offshore energy and offshore supply vessels. Rutger will discuss this in more detail later today. The challenges in these sectors are not over yet, however, but the market seems to bottom out. I expect still some further impairments can follow, but not a new wave of elevated impairments. Also, in TCF, Diamond, we have decided to de-risk the book further. And the health care sector, we monitor closely, especially focused at hospitals. We do not expect any issues here, however, in the short run.</p><p>So to summarize, I do not expect impairments to rise as indicated earlier. So let's go to the next slide and see how we maintain a clean and strong balance sheet for the bank. I already mentioned, we have a risk appetite that fully aligns with our strategy and is aimed at maintaining our moderate risk profile. We do this by defining clear limits for countries, sectors, products and clients. We set limits for the bank as a whole and by business line and actually this is not a -- it sounds very easy, but it's not an easy task. As we, well, sometimes -- well, yes, have discussions and frictions with the business lines, when we at risk want to set limits at tighter levels or want to reduce the underwriting standards or tighten the underwriting standards in specific subsegments. So I'm sure that when you talk to Frans, Daphne, Pieter and Rutger, you can -- they can give you examples of some of the discussions that we have from time to time.</p><p>On this slide, here, at the left-hand slide, I set out a few examples of limits we apply. For example, last quarter, as part of the CIB refocus, we set exposure limits and tightened underwriting standard for the subsegments that I just mentioned on the previous slide. Another example is in shipping, where for some time already, we are focusing on the environmental impact. And by setting policies, we prevent financing the most polluting vessels, and this will actually avoid us to finance the stranded assets of the future. So setting limits is not only good for the risk management in the short run, but also, first -- has a positive impact in the long run. We also actively engage with clients, so it's not only about limits, and we actually define specific small envelopes in areas where we want to take some more risk to gain experience, to develop new activities. For example, innovative solutions in the area of energy transition and sustainability.</p><p>Next, to risk appetite setting. We take a forward look on our risk profile, and I want to take you to the right-hand side of the slide, where we look at stress testing. We are testing our portfolios and limits against general economic scenarios and, of course, adverse scenarios, but also individual developments, such as drop in oil price, rising interest rates or a correction in real estate prices. Most of these reviews are internal and focus on capital adequacy or liquidity or developments of specific portfolios and an example of that is a deep dive we did earlier in the year on resilience for the commercial real estate portfolio we have.</p><p>Well, these are all internal. Of course, there are also public stress tests, and Kees already alluded to the EU-wide stress test, for which the results were published 2 weeks ago. And well, let's go to the next slide to look at the results.</p><p>Where you see our results vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis some of the peers as well on the right-hand side. Well, I was very pleased with the results of the stress test. We scored very well in terms of impact of stress as well as resilience to stress and the capital ratio remaining after stress, 14.9%, I think better than some of the starting points of other banks.</p><p>In 2016, our CET1 ratio declined by 5.9% and now it's only 2.7%, a big step up. We rank in the top quartile of all the banks participating and to me, this confirms as well our resilience to adverse economic developments. So, so far, I've discussed what a risk profile -- moderate risk profile means, how we manage it and how we maintain the profile -- this profile by using the tools that I just mentioned. I also highlighted that the areas driving the year-to-date impairments are concentrated in specific, mostly global subsegments, and that we took measures to control these risks. And last, I want to make clear that these subsegments are not representative for the whole portfolio.</p><p>So let's go to my outlook for 2019. At first, I haven't touched a lot on that this yet on our mortgage book, of course, a very important part of our portfolio. Our mortgage book is very healthy. I think this is a reflection of the Dutch economy and also sound underwriting standards we use. We see a strong increase of amortizing mortgages in our book and also, a decline in full interest-only mortgages.</p><p>Loan-to-values are improving and are now on average 66%. And if you compare that to 2012, it was 82%. So a big step forward. You also see that the share of mortgages that have a loan-to-value of over 100% is disappearing, only 3% left and if you compare that with 2012, it was still 21% of our portfolio</p><p>A development that we are closely monitoring is the rapid rise in prices -- house prices in the Netherlands and, especially in the large cities. While the fact that we have in the Netherlands an affordability criteria, loan-to-income measure is somewhat of a risk mitigant here. But the fact that our mortgage book is kind of developing flattish, and I think Kees alluded to this already. As such, is for me, as a Chief Risk Officer, a good development.</p><p>Let's now focus to the corporate loan book in the middle of the slide. The corporate loan book is also benefiting from the positive global economy. But of course, also some clouds on the horizon. Well, Brexit is very much top of mind here, but also, we see the impact of trade barriers. Both developments could have -- could hit our individual clients quite hard.</p><p>So we have performed an assessment in commercial banking and CIB to look at the most vulnerable segments in our portfolio. Dutch clients with large trade flows with U.K., but also container vessel companies active in international trade. This analysis has shown us that the impact on our portfolio of these developments is limited. But of course, as I mentioned, individual clients can be hit hard. And we see, especially in the SME segment in the Netherlands, that the level of preparedness is still quite low if it comes to the implications of a Brexit.</p><p>Well, I think what has more my attention is actually the indirect effects of Brexit and potentially escalating trade wars, as that could mean a slowdown in the economy. Still, under such a downturn scenario, I'm positive on our ability to deal with such a scenario. And I just discussed our resilience to an economic downturn in the stress test.</p><p>In my opinion, the CIB refresh and tightening of our limits and underwriting standards is well timed if we look where we are in the credit risk cycle.</p><p>So to conclude, my outlook for 2019 is that under our refreshed strategy, the cost of risk will stay below our average cost of risk to the cycle of 25 to 30 basis points. And with that, I would like to move from credit risk to regulatory developments and share some views there. Because we see that our regulators are using this period of positive economic developments to strengthen capital.</p><p>Let's start with capital first and then discuss TRIM. Regulators are in the process of finalizing capital regulations. You know we are well prepared for Basel IV and Clifford later on will discuss that in a lot of detail.</p><p>ECB is less focused on Basel IV. They are more focused on TRIM that aims at harmonizing the models for the credit risk and risk-weighted assets. We have received TRIM feedback for our market risk models and mortgage models on credit risk and actually the impact of that was quite limited, if it comes to our RWA.</p><p>For 2019, we will get a review of our low default portfolio and here, I expect some more impact as these models are quite a bit expert-based and this is not something that is favored under the TRIM regulations. Well, it's good to know that impacts of TRIM on Basel III will not have an impact on RWAs under Basel IV. So it will also not impact -- any increases of TRIM effects will not impact our Basel IV readiness.</p><p>Now go into the development in prudential regulations. Regulators also started to focus on nonperforming loans, and they use current economic strengths to reduce the stock of nonperforming loans on bank's balance sheet before the next downturn will hit us.</p><p>ECB regulators require banks to apply prudential backstops and maintain a level -- a higher level of provisions to nonperforming loans as time progresses. Up to 100% after 7 years, even for collateralized exposures. Well, as our NPL ratio is only 2.2%, we expect that the impact of this new regulation will be manageable. It appears that the regulators are picking up the dialogue on a phase-in of this regulation, and we expect discussions as part of SREP. While the implications here of our -- are not yet clear, so it's too early to comment further on this.</p><p>So let's now go to the next slide and further discuss nonfinancial risks. Important in the developments of today, technology is developing rapidly, which means that nonfinancial risk can become more dominant also. Cyber risk is managed by Christian, as mentioned, on a daily basis and risk management, we make sure that cyber risk is an integral part of our control framework. Then go into compliance. Compliance is another topic that is top of my agenda. The topic of conduct, risk and role of banks as a gatekeeper to counter anti-money laundering and terrorist financing is only increasing in importance. We take our role as gatekeeper very serious, and we invest a large amount of resources in fulfilling this key role.</p><p>We have a very open and transparent relationship with our regulators, including DNB and the Dutch Financial Intelligence Unit.</p><p>ABN AMRO is one of the front-runners in developing public-private partnerships in the area of fighting financial crime. As we believe these partnerships add in the best way to the common objective of identifying and stopping financial crime. Although we take our role very seriously, there's always room for improvement and, therefore, we continue to be -- to develop and invest in this area. This is not only my role, it's my colleagues in the executive committee are involved in managing these risks all on a daily basis.</p><p>Lastly, on this slide, I would like to call out the rapid technological and digital developments that change our lives, but also banking. I think, Christian alluded to that already. They are both a threat and an opportunity, a threat to our business model, which we are addressing by our strategy, but also, an opportunity for new business, as my colleagues later today will highlight.</p><p>In capturing these opportunities, we will take new avenues. We will try new technologies. We will work together with new partners, and we will introduce new risks to the bank. It's very important. I would like to reiterate that we invest in knowledge and expertise to ensure we understand the risks. And if we don't understand the risks, we leave it to others. This approach will make sure the bank can take the next steps in a confident way. That brings me to my last slide.</p><p>I conclude that we are very well positioned to maintain our moderate risk profile. We are committed to building meaningful relationships with customers in strong economies. Only taking risks we understand, and we can afford. And we are well prepared to anticipate and absorb the impact of changes. Thank you very much. And I would like to invite Kees and Christian to take some Q&amp;As.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>DIES DONKER: There is a 30-minute -- 25 to 30 minutes of Q&amp;A. For those who would like to ask a question, indeed raise your hand. I see some already. We will use the mic. If you can start by saying your name and using the mic, people on the webcast can follow us as well.</p><p>PAWEL DZIEDZIC, EQUITY ANALYST, GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Pawel from Goldman. Two questions. The first one is on your targets. You still reiterated above 50% dividend payout. You obviously accrue a little bit more than that already for this year. And you highlighted flexibility. Can you help us understand how will you calibrate the ratio -- the payout ratio going forward? Should we assume that anything that complies with, let's say, Basel IV core Tier 1 ratio and leverage will be distributed. So that's the first question. The second question is on your cost. This is one of the targets that we actually revised today. You aim to deliver EUR 5 billion cost base by 2020. Beyond that, you're pointing to growth in income. Can you give us a sense of what growth and cost base you assume there? And maybe within that and this is, Christian, for you, I was a little bit surprised to hear that you want to lower IT spend, and I know, and I appreciate it's in relation to income, but why does it make strategic sense?</p><p>KEES C. VAN DIJKHUIZEN: With respect to capital, as said already earlier that we have this target range of 17.5%, 18.5%, which is actually calculated from the Basel IV framework and updated now on a Q3 level, we don't do that -- are not going to do that also in the future every quarter, but I thought for Investor Day, it's good to give you an update there. Our normal procedure will be every year actually that we give you a new target range. And that is, as said, now with mitigation actions, we feel comfortable now that the Basel IV is above 13.5%. And the Basel III is 18.6%. And with -- so you start the year actually above your target range, and you're also very well positioned for Basel IV. But still, I have to say, it's 10 years down the road. It's hundreds of pages and EUS implemented and there's a lot of discussion about it. So it's not certainty yet, it's not a law. So it's all estimates. And that makes us keeping some flexibility around the figures, as you can see, already this year, the big divergence between Basel III and Basel IV. So we need that kind of a flexibility for ourselves. But we're very well placed actually for 2019, and as said, for 2018, we have reserved now 60%, and then we'll decide on that. But our basic position has always been and also communicated since IPO, I was CFO, I very well remember that we said that if we don't need the money for growth or for -- well, if we do acquisitions, then the money is available for shareholders, that's what we've said. Of course, coping with Basel IV, with Basel IV, we're well placed. So yes, we're in good position, good shape. And the cost question was around the EUR 5 billion 2020, that's our target, indeed. And then what... yes, well, we don't give nominal figures actually, although in a way, when we say, it's a flattish loan book, although that's interest related, and there's also deposits, and there's fees. So it's not a complete guidance around operating income actually. But a bit off because, of course, a large part of our book is driven by interest, that's not part of our profits. It's driven by interest. So you can calculate. It means lower -- it means nominal lower cost base, that's right.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Okay.</p><p>PAWEL DZIEDZIC: (inaudible)</p><p>DIES DONKER: Can you use the mic, sorry. The people can't hear you...</p><p>PAWEL DZIEDZIC: Apologies. Will the cost decline be true beyond 2020? Do you still aim to maintain cost flat, shrink them further by 2022?</p><p>KEES C. VAN DIJKHUIZEN: Well, we shrink from this year. Don't have figure yet for this year, but it will be above the 5% clearly. We have the guidance now 5% in 2020. And then it depends a bit. We gave a cost/income ratio, so we don't give nominal figures, actually. Depends on are we going to grow by 1% or by 2% or by 3%. That -- and how much money is needed for innovation, what can we do on cost cutting, all the stuff. So it's driven by CI and not so much -- and that relates to operating income growth as well.</p><p>CHRISTIAN BORNFELD: Maybe I should answer my question.</p><p>KEES C. VAN DIJKHUIZEN: Yes.</p><p>CHRISTIAN BORNFELD: On the IT investment side, I fully understand your question. It's something that we're managing also from a strategic perspective because IT is still -- it's a certain part of your cost base. It's also used to drive down or generate additional cost efficiencies and to drive down cost. And it's also an enabler, as we talked about, in regards generating new revenue streams. So it's something that we are evaluating sort of that trade-off all the time. I would say, looking at where we've been historically, also compared to the benchmark, we've been investing quite extensively. And we're gaining benefit from that right now, that's why cost is also coming down. I feel comfortable with the levels we have right now, that we can pull back on the absolute euro spend on IT and still get the capacity we need to stay competitive with the peer group that we compare ourselves to.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Okay. Who's next? Marcell?</p><p>MARCELL HOUBEN, RESEARCH ANALYST, CR\u00e9DIT SUISSE AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: Marcell Houben, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. I have 3 question, please. First, on the lending growth -- or the growth of 1% to 3% post 2020, guys, can you give a split regarding the -- at least the products or the divisional that you're trying to realize there as well as what would need to happen to realize 3% growth? That's my first question. The second question is on bolt-on M&amp;A. This time, I didn't see Private Banking in there. Do you expect to do some bolt-on M&amp;A in other divisions as well? And the third question is on -- Christian, on the IT spend. You just highlighted a little bit already. The EUR 1.5 billion, which, I think, increased to EUR 1.2 billion, to what extent is that a sticky number? How much flexibility do you have to lower it in case of lower revenues?</p><p>KEES C. VAN DIJKHUIZEN: Thank you very much for the question. Let's start with loan growth. I would say, guidance -- our large book, you've seen it, the EUR 150 billion mortgages. We expect that now due to the competition and margin pressure a bit. As said, flattish. And perhaps that book can even go down a little bit. It has gone down year-to-date, our loan book -- mortgage book. As said, when we expect a more normalized interest environment, we think that it will be a bit more in the sweet spot of banks again, instead of insurance companies and pension funds. I'm talking about then after 2020, by the way. So then it can stabilize or even grow a bit, depending on the market developments, in general, of course. The portfolio of Daphne, EUR 40 billion, EUR 42 billion Commercial real -- Commercial Banking loan book as very much related to Dutch economy, so 1, 2, 3, depending on -- and our forecast is based on the Economic Bureau consensus, more or less 2% or something. And you can have some inflation, perhaps, down the road. And then Corporate investment book -- Corporate &amp; Institutional book is going, presumably, a bit down as said because of the refocus in the coming 1, 2 years. But that can grow, I think I mentioned 2% to 3% moderately going forward. So it's a blend of the 3, actually. Inorganic growth, we have always said indeed Private Banking, and that's still, I would say, well, nice sweet spot. That's the sweet spot of our inorganic growth still because, there, we are looking in Northwest Europe if there's something which we like. We do not exclude other sectors, if we see something nice in other areas we might look into it, but it's -- it will be smaller set, not transformational, and we will keep capital in mind.</p><p>CHRISTIAN BORNFELD: Just on the IT-related question, first of all, a clarification. I think you mentioned EUR 1.2 billion, EUR 1.5 billion. I think earlier this year, we communicated, as part of another event, a number called EUR 1.2 billion. That's for the Netherlands' centralized IT. The EUR 1.5 billion you saw today is our group level IT spend, so it's actually -- it's a slightly different number. So it includes all the international units, all the subsidiaries we own, including the Challenger banks that I also mentioned today. So that's why the number is a little bit different, so just be aware of that. When you look at the flexibility in the cost base, I think we do benefit from being quite extensively outsourced historically. So we have quite a lot of our spend as external, which is something that is more variable than if it's internal staff. The other part would be, as I mentioned in the presentation, that as we don't put things on the balance sheet, we don't put the development on the balance sheet. We don't have depreciations going through. So I think we can realize those savings quite quickly.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Okay. Who's next? Where's the mic going? Yes, Robin? Maybe just a reminder. We've got Clifford, of course, at the end. So any finance-related questions, please make sure that we still have some for Clifford, as well, okay?</p><p>KEES C. VAN DIJKHUIZEN: And Tanja is here as well. Tanja is here as well.</p><p>ROBIN VAN DEN BROEK, BANCA DI CREDITO FINANZIARIO S.P.A., RESEARCH DIVISION - RESEARCH ANALYST, MEDIOBANCA: Robin van den Broek of Mediobanca. My first question is on mortgages. You assume, basically, that the market will move back towards your sweet spot. But say that doesn't happen and the mortgage broke base and annuity framework starts to shrink, that basically feeds into your capital generation, while your capital generation could actually be above your earnings for the next 2 years, so to speak. Given where you are on capital, can you pay that out fully? Can the payout ratio go that high, basically? That's my first question. Second question is on AML. Based on what the -- what you said on the systems and the complexity of that pulling it back out, pulling it back in, I think the ING case shows that it's more about procedures rather than wrongdoings within the bank. How comfortable are you that you are safe there? I think the field also gave some numbers last week saying that the number of suspicious transactions coming from banks is only 10%, which, to me, seems like a shockingly no -- low number. So your thoughts on that will be appreciated. And the third one is also on bolt-on. I thought there was -- there were some caps on what you could do as long you were -- as long as you were under a certain state ownership. Could you remind us of those M&amp;A caps?</p><p>KEES C. VAN DIJKHUIZEN: No. I don't think we have real caps there, to answer that question, at the moment. With respect to mortgages, yes, we think that there's a long history in the mortgage area. And of course, we look at also other countries that sometimes are in a bit more already advanced stage with respect to the mortgage market, for instance, Sweden. I think you know a little about that as well. The fintech is much more active already in Sweden today than they are in the Netherlands. So we take that all into account. But still, we think that when interest rates go up, clients, these days in the Netherlands, over 50 % take up a 20, 30 years fixed. I advise my children as well. And then, yes, that is not the place for us. It's not our ideal place. We can do some stuff. We've done some corporate bonds for 20 years and then generate, of course, also 20-years mortgages. But it's -- yes, we also have a different capital regime than insurance companies and the likes. But when the interest rates go up, what clients, we think, are going to do again when they have to take out a mortgage for, say, 3.5% or 4%, they would say, \"Look, it was 2, 1s or even 1 something, so why take again 30 years 4%? Why 20 years? So let's go to 10 years then.\" We think also that insurance companies and pension funds do this at this moment in time because government bonds are not yielding and what have you. So also, their business model is under pressure. They have taken up a lot of mortgages, and they also have that kind of pockets they want to invest and diversify. So we think that actually, going forward, this is -- it will not go back to 75%, banks in that market share, I don't think so. But I think it will go back to the 60s in a couple of years' time.</p><p>ROBIN VAN DEN BROEK: But also on the capital generation, if you have tailwind basically on a shrinking book, can your payout ratio go that high, despite your capital being where you want it to be?</p><p>KEES C. VAN DIJKHUIZEN: Yes. I think that's, of course, also to be discussed with regulators in the end. And of course, they don't like 100%. I don't have to tell you that. But theoretically, of course, you make calculation that could be an outcome. There are also the possibility of buybacks down the road. We have mentioned it for this year's -- well, this year, it will be dividend, around 2018, but this is still an option going forward for the bank. And when the state sells down, we could align with that going forward. That's an option that's also on the table.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Okay.</p><p>TANJA J. A. M. CUPPEN: I answer your second question on compliance risk, and I think it's -- well, you -- here, you outlined it already in your question that policies and procedures are very important in -- element in that, clearly outlining where roles and responsibilities are in this complex area to get it completely right. Well, the challenges are also in the -- well, having the right systems in place throughout the organization and have it all apart, so that's where a lot of our efforts is going. With respect to the expectations of the financial intelligence unit, well, I mentioned already the public-private partnerships and our close cooperation with different parties. And we feel that -- well, we know what they expect from us. And also they -- in these discussions, we learn how to best set our rules and to make our own way of working most effective in terms of identifying the transactions that need to be reported to these units.</p><p>ROBIN VAN DEN BROEK: But the 10% of total, from all the Dutch banks basically, doesn't that seem like a very, very low number?</p><p>TANJA J. A. M. CUPPEN: Sorry, what do you mean by 10% of...</p><p>ROBIN VAN DEN BROEK: So the field basically gave some numbers about suspicious transactions being reported to them. And the banks only contribute 10% of that number.</p><p>TANJA J. A. M. CUPPEN: Yes. So I think -- well, that's hard for me to comment. I also don't know what other banks are doing. But we feel that, well, how we are reporting in accordance with their expectations.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Okay. Farquhar. Does it work, yes?</p><p>FARQUHAR CHARLES MURRAY, PARTNER, INSURANCE AND BANKS, AUTONOMOUS RESEARCH LLP: Farquhar Murray, Autonomous Research. Just 2 questions, Please. Firstly, a bit kind of IT and a risk question coming back to the kind of anti-money laundering discussion, which is, how do you kind of get to what is a reasonable level under the kind of financial supervision act in terms of those kind of looking for those suspicious transactions? I mean -- and maybe, quantitatively, how many are you submitting? And is that a number that the regulator is comfortable with? And then coming back to the IT side, obviously, what was going on at your peer was kind of very obviously not quite right. I mean, what's the kind of approach in terms of random kind of searching that you're applying for those kind of exercise when you do look for suspicious transactions?</p><p>TANJA J. A. M. CUPPEN: So shall I...</p><p>KEES C. VAN DIJKHUIZEN: I can comment on the system piece and then...</p><p>TANJA J. A. M. CUPPEN: Yes. So maybe to comment on your questions, well, of course, there's no -- regulators don't provide a level of where the expectation is in number of transactions, so that's a very difficult question to answer as such. But we are in constant dialogue to make sure that we know where the expectations are and also to make our rules engine smarter and smarter and to be more effective in capturing the right transactions to be reported. So I think that's one element. The other element is that, of course, based on what happened in the European banking industry, we have reviewed all our policies, procedures and way of working to make sure that, in all these areas, we address the concerns that have been found elsewhere. So we basically took a lessons learned from that. Maybe you can tell something about the systems piece?</p><p>KEES C. VAN DIJKHUIZEN: I think on the systems piece, we have continuously invested quite extensively over the last 3 to 4 years in the space to make sure that we have a broad and also quite modern toolset in this space that does capture all the transaction monitoring and transaction filtering, things that you're referring to. Currently, we are running 2 systems in that space that both sort of monitor it. We get 4,000 alerts a month at the moment that are processed by our back office unit. And the relevant transactions that they identify as being truly suspicious are handed over to the authorities as they should be. I would say also, as Tanja was alluding to, I think we have a good collaboration with these authorities, so there is a good feedback loop and them telling us this was really a bad one, so please look more. And then we adjust the rules. Or this one, these were all bad or they were not bad, so please tune your model for that. So I think those feedback loops are also working well right now. So I think based on that dialogue, we feel comfortable that, at least, we're doing reasonably well.</p><p>FARQUHAR CHARLES MURRAY: Just -- how many of those 4,000 go through to the authorities?</p><p>KEES C. VAN DIJKHUIZEN: We don't disclose those specific numbers. And I would say, generally, they do vary sort of month by month, so there's also certain seasonality in it. So you can't just use one number, then I have to give you an average and then what are you going to use that for. So it's much lower, yes, much lower.</p><p>CLIFFORD J. ABRAHAMS, CFO &amp; VICE-CHAIRMAN\u00c2\u00a0OF EXECUTIVE BOARD, ABN AMRO GROUP N.V.: You start with 1 billion of clients, 1 billion of transactions in a year. You have millions of clients. You have thousands, I think, 50,000 in a year or something. And then the amount is really a small single-digit percentage, actually.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Okay. Who's next? Yes, Albert? And then also, in the interest of time, if we can limit the number of questions maybe to one at this point?</p><p>ALBERT PLOEGH, RESEARCH ANALYST, ING GROEP N.V., RESEARCH DIVISION: Yes. I might throw in some questions into one question. It's Albert Ploegh, ING. Yes, on Page 16, you write that due to the strong ROE and a moderate RWA growth, there's further room for dividend payout to rise clearly above 50% in later years. So what do you mean by later years? Now you have also given the '22 -- 2022 targets in cost income and also about it clearly, and a question related to that. You made also a remark earlier that there's preference to return capital to the dividend payout. In other words, dividends also clearly on the slide mentioned. But at the same time, if the Dutch state would decide to do some further sell down somewhere in 2019, in case you do participate, for example, you want to do that also maybe with a buyback, does that -- will it be included in this 50% distribution? I understand you will not go to distribute more than 100% of your profits or capital generation in one year, but could there be an exception in case of there will a sell down, for example?</p><p>KEES C. VAN DIJKHUIZEN: I think that we'll assess it down the road, of course, but we might take action in 2019 in that respect, with respect to sell downs as well. We will also look into dividend because that's also -- we have different kind of investors, actually, who appreciate different types of actions from us, so we take that into account as well. And then in the end, we will see what the total is related to actually the bandwidth, the target range we give. And of course, if we get SREP letters about nonperforming loans, or what have you, that is also taken into account. So it's -- yes, I can't give an easy answer there. But -- and with respect to -- at least not a quantitative at this moment in time, but we do not -- in later years, we mean after 2018, because 2018 has this leverage ratio constraint, which we would merge here. We're actually exploring. We are not yet there, not taken a decision yet, but that's 20 bps. 20 bps is serious money. It's EUR 1 billion. And the 50, the 50 of course -- the 50 bps of clearing is even more. So that will take away, in our view, the leverage ratio constraint, even -- taking not even into account that the Dutch government, presumably, who always has the 4%, has set in their coalition agreement that it will align with respect to leverage ratio to European approach. And we don't think that for European approach our bank will get a 4.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Okay. Who's next? There's a lot of hands.</p><p>KEES C. VAN DIJKHUIZEN: 10 questions, yes.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Benoit here.</p><p>BENOIT PETRARQUE, HEAD OF BENELUX EQUITY RESEARCH, KEPLER CHEUVREUX, RESEARCH DIVISION: Benoit Petrarque from Kepler Cheuvreux. Just one question. So on the cost income ratio, what holds you back to -- that will be more ambitious on cost income? Because, I mean, clearly, if I look at the data alone, number of branches is probably now below 150. Digitalization is very high. I mean, you have even board members and you have supervisory board members coming from where they are nowadays. So what can we expect on the longer end on that trend, let's say, moving towards lower levels?</p><p>KEES C. VAN DIJKHUIZEN: Okay. Well, the first thing that holds us back is that we're always cautious, so we don't over promise. So we under promise and over deliver, that's what we like to do. That's one. Secondly, we might need money for innovation. And we're not going to kill the business model by too stringent cost-income targets. So we want to have some room of maneuver there. In the end, it's also, by the way, a mean to goal. So the goal is the ROE and the CI ratio is the mean. Yes, it's means. It's not the end goal. It's an in-between thing. ROE is what is really important for you guys to get also capital returns.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Next one?</p><p>BART JOORIS, ANALYST, BANQUE DEGROOF PETERCAM S.A., RESEARCH DIVISION: Yes. Bart Jooris, Degroof Petercam. If I can pick up on that. If I'm looking at your outlook for your flattish loan book, you mentioned by yourself, part of a decrease will be from CIB, which are low ROE loans there. Moreover, your cost income needs to improve and you're going to pay out more capital. Why are you not more ambitious on your ROE target then?</p><p>KEES C. VAN DIJKHUIZEN: Well, I am already in discussion in the Netherlands with the Dutch Central Bank governor about 10% to 13%. The Dutch Central Bank sometimes has 8%. This -- with the risk profile of bank these days, I think they have, in a way, a point there in the sense that our risk model is indeed could lead to a lower percentage, but that's -- we see investors asking the 10% plus, and we can deliver the 10% plus. So that's what we do. You have seen that it doesn't mean that we can't go above the 13%. In practice, last year, 14.5%. So it's not that we can't do that. But our target is, more or less, the 10% to 13%, 10% in less good times and 13% in good times. And you can get above it or depends a bit on the economic situation. But to make it a higher target, no, we don't feel comfortable with that.</p><p>BART JOORIS: It's not that you foresee that bolt-on acquisitions could bringing your ROE down.</p><p>KEES C. VAN DIJKHUIZEN: No, that's not the reason.</p><p>JEAN-PIERRE LAMBERT, SVP AND UNITED KINGDOM ANALYST, KEEFE, BRUYETTE &amp; WOODS LIMITED, RESEARCH DIVISION: Yes. Jean-Pierre Lambert from KBW. The question on sustainability, we saw the video, but I would like to understand more what's the contribution to growth of the loan portfolio. Is it negative or is it positive? Because you can have sustainability blocking applications because it doesn't meet your criteria. Or do you see opportunities? And also in terms of staffing, where is the staffing going? Do you have a team of specialists, which is central? Or is it located in the landing area? Is it located in the credit area? And I mean, how do you see that, as a positive or negative for loan growth?</p><p>KEES C. VAN DIJKHUIZEN: We see this as a clear positive for loan growth because if we look at our clients, I was recently with a client in shipping in Rotterdam, you don't have to tell that guy anything about sustainability. He's building a ship for 25 years. He doesn't want to be literally a stranded asset after 5 -- 15 years. He doesn't want it. So they're thinking -- our clients think about sustainability already even more, I would say, sometimes than we are. Commercial real estate clients came to us 5 years ago. Can you help us? So Private Banking, 80%, when we asked, so that's high. So no, it's really in every corner of the bank, and we don't concentrate it -- I mean, the department of sustainability wasn't in the HR arena. And when I became CEO, it's now in strategy and sustainability, so it's now in my domain. But especially what we're going to do now, make it a business case means that it's for the business, guys and girls, so not for me.</p><p>JEAN-PIERRE LAMBERT: And about staffing. Sorry, about staffing, I mean, how many staff you have in sustainability? And do you growing that now?</p><p>KEES C. VAN DIJKHUIZEN: Not many, not many. I mean, it should be done in the business. So I mean, the...</p><p>CHRISTIAN BORNFELD: Well, I think it's a trick question. And given where we're going, I think everybody, most staff, all frontline staff, at least, will be trained and be acting on sustainability as an opportunity. So the central unit is not as important, I think.</p><p>KEES C. VAN DIJKHUIZEN: Like a strategy department, a couple of 10 people, yes.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Yes, next one?</p><p>NICK DAVEY, RESEARCH ANALYST, REDBURN (EUROPE) LIMITED, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Nick Davey from Redburn. I'm going to try and sneak in 2 questions. The first one is to Christian about the sweet spot of 12% to 13% IT cost to income. How long does it take you to get to that sweet spot? And the second part of that is to say that seems to basically explain all of the cost income ratio decline of the group, which leads me to wonder why there aren't efficiencies coming out of the rest of the cost base in the period. And the second question, a shorter one on the flattish fee guidance. I think most banks that stand up on investor days always look for the fee lines to be a generator of revenue growth. So what's leaving you downbeat on fee outlook in the coming shortish turn?</p><p>DIES DONKER: Yes. Can I be -- can we save that one for Clifford because I -- otherwise, it will be very quiet in the afternoon. But the first one...</p><p>CHRISTIAN BORNFELD: The first one, on the sweet spot side, I think when we look at the sweet spot, as I said before, it's a balance of different dynamics. And we've set ourselves a sweet spot and not a target because we think, directionally, that's where we're going. And that's also where we've seen ourselves move over the last 12 months. And we can see some more direction going in that over the coming years. When we will exactly arrive at the sweet spot is something that we need to decide. As Kees was saying, we also are trying to keep our options open that if we need to invest more in innovation, then we need to be able to do that. But with what we know right now, directionally, we're moving to the sweet spot.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Okay. Yes, can we have -- well, 2 more. Kiri? You're in the front. Is there a mic? We need to get some mics. Sorry, So Alicia, you came first.</p><p>KEES C. VAN DIJKHUIZEN: She would like to keep the mic, I think. She would like to keep the mic.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Sorry, I didn't see you. It's difficult to see that you had a mic. Sorry, Alicia. Go ahead.</p><p>ALICIA MARIANNE CHUNG, ANALYST ON THE PAN-EUROPEAN BANKS SECTOR, EXANE BNP PARIBAS, RESEARCH DIVISION: No problem. So just one question for me then, either to Kees or to Tanja. The DNB has come out recently saying that they are starting to look a little bit more implementing new macro prudential measures in the mortgage markets, so whether that's mortgage risk by add-ons or it's LTV caps. On the LTV caps there, there is a possibility that, that could slow down new lending, how do you think about that when you think about lending growth in the mortgage business over the medium term at ABN and what potential impact that could have? I know that's difficult given that they haven't given much guidance there. And then also on the regulatory risk front, in terms of mortgages, clearly, the insurers have of course taken quite a bit of more market share recently, but with Basel IV coming through and being much more penal versus Solvency II, is there not a possibility that actually, they are structurally here to play and that market share might not recede because they are able to just compete much better on margins because their ROEs adjust better? Be useful to have your thoughts.</p><p>TANJA J. A. M. CUPPEN: Yes. So I'm afraid I'm going to refer a big part of your question as well to the afternoon when Frans van der Horst will present on retail and on the mortgage markets and all these developments. What I can comment upon is, of course, Basel IV, we see that coming already for a long time. And well, one of the major step were mentioned by the regulators based on this recent publication is an early phase-in of Basel IV. We feel that will not have a big impact as we are working on this assumption already for quite some time and are prepared for that. So that's what I could say. And I think -- well, the competitive environment, et cetera, I think Frans is the best person to comment on it.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Promise Kiri a last question, yes, before we take a break. It's here at the front. Sorry, here at the front.</p><p>KIRISHANTHAN VIJAYARAJAH, ANALYST, HSBC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Kiri Vijayarajah, HSBC. A question for Tanja. So you did really well on the external EBA stress test, but I'm more curious about that internal stress test you did around sort of trade barriers and Brexit. And I wondered if there's any kind of numbers you can share with us. And I'm particularly interested to how does the impact potentially split between the CIB type of activities versus your domestic commercial clients and sort of better understand where some of those vulnerabilities might be.</p><p>TANJA J. A. M. CUPPEN: Yes. So these, well, internal activities, we don't, well, publish numbers. What I can say is that our CIB clients are better prepared for the implications of Brexit than some of the SME clients in our commercial bank. So the number of clients potentially affected is much larger, but of course, also with smaller exposures. As said, the -- we expect the impact to be overall limited for our portfolio. And we expect the indirect effects to be larger. Also with respect to trade barriers, we see that trade is, well, changing across the globe and going to different locations. So in the end, well, some individual companies can be affected. But if you look overall, you see that, well, the sector is basically reorganizing itself into a different setup. And also because of that, we expect that the implications are quite manageable for our portfolio.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Okay. Thanks very much. That concludes the Q&amp;A for now. We will take a 15-minute break. For those of you on the webcast, you don't need to disconnect. We'll just open it up in about 15 minutes, so that means 11:45, please. Thank you.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>DIES DONKER: Okay. Welcome back, everybody. Thank you for joining us again. The next block, we've got 2 speakers from retail and from Private Banking. We'll start off with Retail Banking, Frans van der Horst, but before I invite him onto the stage, we would like to show you a very short movie.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>FRANS M. R. VAN DER HORST, CEO - RETAIL BANKING, ABN AMRO GROUP N.V.: Good afternoon. I will put this video in perspective in a few minutes. As said, my name is Frans van der Horst, heading retail bank. I have a career of more than 20 years in banking and I switched multiple times between retail roles and IT and operations.</p><p>I've headed the retail bank in, for the Netherlands, quite some years ago. I've been global COO for this retail for 8 years when they were still active in 8 countries. I've been CIO in ABN AMRO and I'm now very excited in this period of time to be heading the retail in ABN AMRO.</p><p>I will talk with you about what we delivered so far. I will address a bit, the short-term revenue pressure that we are facing. I will show you how we deliver differentiating customer experience by enhancing our core offering and accelerating a shift to digital. And I will explain how we can increase customer loyalty and further monetize our customer interface.</p><p>About retail, it's already said by Kees -- next -- as already said by Kees, 5 million customers, on average, 20% market share, concentrated more in the urban areas than in the other sides of the country. The Dutch market is highly efficient, highly concentrated and very mature. We shown a good profitability, the past 10 years. We have more than 7 million apps downloaded with our clients. We have more than 1 billion customer contacts per year, that's 20 million per week, and we are a front-runner in specific digital experiences like video banking.</p><p>In other words, retail is a solid contributor to the results of ABN AMRO. But the revenues are highly depending on interest income. And we have some competition on the mortgage market more than we have seen the last few years. And the deposit side, of course, we know it already declined interest rates to 3 bps. That's all -- that's amongst the average of all the 4 main banks in the Netherlands. And we have some ideas how we can mitigate this. And if you would like to mitigate this, then we use 3 levers: A client-oriented offering; the digital first; and the client interface, the customer interface in the different areas of today.</p><p>If we start talking about the client-oriented offering, then you have to consider that nobody is coming into a branch on a Monday morning shouting around, \"I'm happily buying a mortgage today.\" No. That's not the need that they would like to fulfill. They would like to live in a nice house with their family and their journey starts much earlier than the mortgage process. Christian already pointed that out in the customer journey with the total, broader scope of it. And that's basically what we are also very much doing. We are heavily active, also in the web identifying people that are looking for homes and already popping up and trying to make contact with them in a digital way, in the e-commerce way.</p><p>The majority of meetings with my advisors in the branch network are filled via the e-commerce teams and not via by coincidental people that walk in. And if you want to be really relevant to your customers, we started up with a business target, a very good service, a full scan on the energy savings potential for homeowners. It's partially done by digitally exchanging information about your house, but accompanied by an on-site scan. And the homeowner, our clients, get a full report on all levers they could apply to make their homes more energy efficient, accompanied with investments and savings. And if they say, yes, if you push the button and with a set of specialist partners, it will be executed and delivered. By that, we can improve the shift to sustainability, help our customers in a more -- to live in a more comfortable home and to save energy and the financing option for the investment comes alongside.</p><p>In the digital first, we are focusing heavily on video banking. Why? Because I would like to give my client no reason, whatsoever, to come to a branch anymore. There is no need to do that because we can come to the kitchen table, in his home by video banking. We can do that outside of opening office hours and we can do that even in the weekends. And for my advisors, they are not required to be in the branch, they can do it also from home. And by that, we can come closer to our clients than ever before.</p><p>I will give a somewhat further insights on that one in a minute.</p><p>That's one too quick -- and the value customer interface. Our main apps are fully prepared to integrate third-party accounts. Why? Because we push the loyal usage of our apps and would like our customers, once the PSD 2 Law is past Parliament in the Netherlands, that they would aggregate their third-party accounts in our tool sets, that gives us the data and the loyalty. And yes, it's not about only the banking product and the customers, as I said, in the mortgage use case also. We have a number of concepts, which we can plug-in, API-based, and journeys of retailers and web shops also to give consumers an option to pay at once or to take a consumer loan with instant decision-making in the journey of buying something in those web shows.</p><p>These 3 levers, to a certain extent, do make a shift in a customer behavior. And if you then take the example of mortgages, the next one, please, was already mentioned, a shift towards extremely long fixed interest rate periods. Yes, we will open up and originate to distribute formula early next year to again, be relevant for our clients in that segment also. The first tranche will be EUR 0.75 billion so that we can engage with customers, that's rightly so, as Kees said, take a good decision for long fixed interest rates. Because if you can afford them now, your safeguard it for interest rate peaks in the future. Next to that, it's important that if you are, for instance, in the western parts of the Netherlands where much more demand for houses is there than supply, then it's a difficult period. If you have done a conditional bid, if you then have to wait if the mortgage is granted. That makes also, in a seller's market, those type of bidders get a lower priority. We would like to turn it around. We are experimenting with that in the meantime to give a preapproved mortgage so that you can have that cumbersome period after having done that conditional bid, not necessary anymore. You can do your bidding on that house with a secured mortgage in your back pocket.</p><p>What's not always a sweet spot of everybody in the Netherlands, in the competition, is self-employed people. A large group, which is growing rapidly. Traditionally, we have a lot of experience with income not from fixed labor contracts and out-of-entrepreneurial sources. We will focus more on that one and tailor our product needs also in that direction.</p><p>And the last specific group where we are focusing upon, also from a view of inclusivity in the -- in society is the elderly people. They are basically are forced to live longer in their houses and we have a number of product concepts, life, that can help them to take some value out of that house, to adapt the house to their needs when they are older and/or to pay for a higher health care costs and those type of things.</p><p>And we talked a lot this morning already on, \"Is this book growing or not?\" The result -- the portfolio is the result the production, the redemptions in the portfolio and people that are shopping around and all of a sudden leave you because they would like to take a mortgage elsewhere. And especially if you come from higher interest periods some time ago, then that's a real risk. We have pretty good predictive models in place today where we can detect clients that show that behavior so that we can reach out early in the process to prevent them from leaving us. And that, in total, should help us to balance this book in the coming period.</p><p>The third largest revenue driver is consumer credits. And that one is an interesting one in a sense that we have the biggest web shop in the Netherlands. 1.5 million people in the [EURid] orientation tool is only in the total sales funnel leading to 15,000 credits paid out. And again, the example of Christian, a total customer journey, we identified many paying points in between where people dropped out of the process. By deliberately addressing all those paying points, we were able already to identify a lot of improvement potential, which is realized today. And next to that, the conclusion was, we should rationalize, simplify, modernize and digitize the product portfolio even further and make use of somewhat more sophisticated IT systems which we're in the process of doing so. By doing that, we are able to, at least the last 2 months, already see a first growth in this portfolio after some years of gradual decline. And I'm convinced with that, and also targeting a number of specific segments, that this large revenue driver for us can start to grow again.</p><p>And if you're relying heavily on interest income, and there was already a question in the Q&amp;A session a few minutes ago, fee products. In general, the average fee income in retail is 10% of total. That's not much. I would like to see that increasing. And we took a look -- we have a very good, solid private bank with a lot of knowledge on investment products. And together with Private Banking, we scanned the full product portfolio we have in place for retail customers, for customers that would like to join us digitally, that would start during investments and we concluded that we had something to do. And in Q3, Q4 and Q1 next year, we will deliver a totally new digitized product set, especially targeted to more dynamic, younger clients in the retail area and we are pretty much convinced that we can double the number of new clients in investments for 2019, if you compare it to what we can realize this year, and it's my personal commitment to double that again the year after. And by that, also we can build up again a strong feeder basis for future upstreaming to Private Banking.</p><p>The insurance side is a likewise story. We have a joint venture with Nationale-Nederlanden. We run there a life insurer, a nonlife insurer and a broker. The level of penetration in the clients of retail is close to 11%, you will never reach 100%, of course, but 11% is very much on the low end. Also, with Nationale-Nederlanden, together, we renewed the total product portfolio. Also, debt is -- the last one will be delivered Q1 next year. And the first one we put back in the market was the car insurance a few months ago, 2 months ago, and we immediately saw a premium inflow peak. And I'm convinced, based upon better products, more risk-based considerations into it, more sharing of the data of the bank with the insurer because that's really discriminating, that we can improve significantly here. And by doing these 2 things, my target is to increase the level of 10% fees on total income to 15% in the coming years.</p><p>If you then go back to the second lever, digital first. Digital first, if you take this, and Kees already mentioned it, this number, it's a combination of simple things, like blocking your debit card; unblocking your debit card because you found it back; changing the car under your car insurance but also buying an investment or an insurance product. And 65%, probably this year, we will end up slightly higher. The 70% for next year is definitely not my endpoint. We were able to do this based upon also a lot on video banking. The push there -- when I started in retail, I was curious, is that only for the digital community? Is that only for the younger people? And I joined a number of my advisors in video banking meetings and it struck me many times, I saw on the screen people in their 70s and 80s. And when you then ask them, \"Are you living far away from the office?\" It even struck me more, the answer was, \"No, 3 blocks away.\" Why do you take then this opportunity and not coming to a branch because it's much easier? I don't have to take the bus. I don't have to get out of my house. And the last question I always ask is, \"How did you master these tools like Skype and WebEx that we are using?\" Oh, that was an easy answer because that's their only way to connect with children and grandchildren and they were learned and teach by them. So it's a useful tool, which is broadly used throughout generations. It was a very positive surprise for me.</p><p>This increase in digital sales and services is accompanied by also an increasing customer satisfaction. And the 2, combined, left to the possibility to reduce the number of branches significantly. By far, we have the lowest number of branches in the Netherlands from our competitors. That's not because of the cost program. That's because there is no traffic. That's not because there is no traffic, because there are no interested clients. That's because clients do not have to come to the branch. And that's the reason why we can have this flexibility in our branch network that we don't have to take into account a minimum distance to a client and that we are free to maneuver. And this is one of the things that's very much probably a front-runner position that we have in the Netherlands.</p><p>And if you then take into account the little video with the dog, a full tokenization platform, which is up and running, where we can connect every gadget, be it a -- from Google, be it from Garmin, be it from whatever, we can connect easily to our payment infrastructures that gives joy, gives convenience and it builds up also loyalty. The main banking app, as said, open for aggregation in PSD 2, 2.3 million users, it has the highest functionality levels in the Netherlands according to [Banco Sentinel] and that's accompanied by the biggest online digital financial household tool used in the Netherlands. 500,000 downloads for people that would like to keep track on their income and expenditures, make budgets and the likes. Gives us also a lot of data. That, combined, and I come back to that in a minute, with the peer-to-peer, TCF app and the Swordfish, Tweadle and other concepts which we can put in place and journey from web shops and retailers, gives us a very strong, real footprint in society. And that builds up also the loyalty that we are looking for. This strong mobile footprint is based on convenience and that gives also a strong defense toward fintechs, not only the geographic scope, the smallness of the Netherlands. And by building this loyal customer base, based on being relevant, or making the lives of my customers a bit more easy, give them tools to have insight and oversight, help them to realize their goals, we strengthened the customer interface significantly. And if you then take a life in a customer's day, of a day in a customer's life, then you see that we have multiple pitch points. And we can, of course, reach out to him or her with suggestions and we do that carefully now with some of our own product ideas that we could push forward to them. Of course, important, we keep track of preference of customers and on data privacy laws. But we can also imagine that we can simply see that a change from energy provider would save money for this client, we can do that and all the time, you could develop a fee model out of that also.</p><p>A few words on Tikkie. Tikkie was developed for the typical Dutch situation. You have a lunch together, one pays and the other one would like to get repaid. And that, from a notion, that it should not be limited to known memberships. The only thing you need is a WhatsApp account and a Dutch banking account. That went viral in June '16 and in the meantime, we are close to 5 million active users. And early in the process, probably 9 months ago, I think, that commercial clients knocked on the door of Daphne with the request, \"Can we incorporate Tikkie as a payment process in our payment functionality?\" And why? Because the Dutch customers were asking it. It is so easy to pay with Tikkie that they asked variety of parties to integrate it. So we did. There are different options with which you can integrate it in your payment facilities and we created all of a sudden a fee model.</p><p>The second question these commercial and corporate clients are now putting on our table is, \"Can we make advertising possible in Tikkie?\" Because it's very targeted audience. We can precisely give messages to people that we would like to do. We are considering it. It's not yet done, but that would be a second lever. And over time, we have a number of ideas for further value-added services towards commercial clients by growing this community of Tikkie users. The maximum, by the way, is 10 million because there are no more than 10 million WhatsApp accounts in the Netherlands.</p><p>If I then come to a summary. Retail is and will remain a solid contributor. We will address this revenue pressure. We are focused on customer experience by enhancing the core offering and accelerate our shift to digital. And this enhanced customer loyalty gives us the opportunity to monetize further our already strong customer interface.</p><p>Thank you. With that, I would like to invite Pieter.</p><p>PIETER VAN MIERLO, CEO OF PRIVATE BANKING, ABN AMRO GROUP N.V.: Good morning. Welcome, everyone. My name is Pieter van Mierlo, I'm responsible for the Private Banking activities. And I joined the bank 30 years ago, had several positions in the commercial area and 4 times, I had the position in risk management; 2 times financial restructuring and recovery. And I love this bank and I'm really committed to make a success of the private bank. And I'm very convinced, together with all my colleagues here on the front row, we will really build this future-proof bank.</p><p>My assignment started more than a year ago, in March last year, when Kees asked me to make a real profitable, cost-efficient private bank and concentrate on the strategic Northwest Europe focus.</p><p>I build a new management team and I replaced the country executives. Together with my team, we made a plan called the building one private bank plan, a transformation plan which will take 3 years and in which we really change the organization and I will elaborate on this later on.</p><p>We have a strategy in this private bank, which can be summarized with 3 words: Harmonize, digitize and grow. We will grow the bank organically with profitable growth but we will do it inorganically as well. And the first proof point is the acquisition we did last summer in Belgium. As a private bank, we focus on sustainability and we invite our clients and support our clients to make the green choice in which we contribute to society as a bank as well. I am committed to a very successful transformation of the private bank and improving financial results as well. I'm going to take you through this presentation in which we -- in which I would like to explain who we are as a private bank, what's the strategy and what it will bring us.</p><p>What kind of private bank are we? We are definitely the market leader in the Netherlands and we have strong positions in Germany, France, Belgium and Guernsey. We serve almost 100,000 clients and after the integration of our Belgium acquisition, we have over EUR 200 billion assets under management. We are heavily investing in digital because we have rather old-fashioned operations in Germany and France where we did a great job, together with the teams of Christian. We also developed advanced client portals, which are up and running now in Germany and France and in Belgium and Guernsey, we'll implement this well. We have a so-called open architecture, so the asset managers are not on our own payroll. We select the best asset managers around the globe.</p><p>The number of sustainable funds is increasing and in our discretionary portfolio mandates, as well as in our advisory mandates, we support the clients to make the green choice. As a private bank, we have a very low capital consumption and of course, the private bank is a very important source of the funding of the bank with EUR 67 billion assets under management. Assets under management, of course, liquidity, deposits. Despite our elevated digital investments, our return on equity is currently 23% year-to-date and that's strong and it will improve. So I think we can really say we are a leading cross-border private bank.</p><p>The market in Private Banking is rapidly changing. The digital offerings are getting more important and the demand of our clients are changing. We had quite some backlog outside the Netherlands, which we are developing in the right way. The transformation we started last year in the new team is really a different set up compared to the previous periods. In the private bank, we actually had 2 organizations, a separate Private Banking team for the Dutch organization and the so-called Private Banking international team for the other countries.</p><p>So we move together with the 2 headquarters, made one organization and instead of more country-led approach, we currently have functional steering. So in the PBMT in Amsterdam, we are steering on sales, products and solutions, operations and process and control, together with the country executives and their teams. So all decisions we take in Amsterdam are decisions for the entire private bank and this is the way we can harmonize the private bank. And it works well and the collaboration with the countries is really great.</p><p>The regulatory impact, in fact, today is very high. I think we spent a lot of effort on MiFID II and the remediation of KBC. We started early but it was hard working in the last couple of months. Now we have divested some countries, we can fully concentrate on our current footprint in Western -- Northwest Europe and with the current footprint, I think we have a scalable bank. The transformation is well on track and the cost/income ratio is improving. I expect we have a cost/income ratio below 70% in 2021. And I think we can finalize our current transformation in 2021.</p><p>The acquisition we made last summer in Belgium, with SocGen underpins our growth ambition. We expect to close this transaction in the first quarter 2019. And together with this acquisition, we have an assets under management portfolio in Belgium of EUR 12 billion. So we doubled the portfolio. The footprints of SocGen is comparable to the current organization in Belgium, it's for 90%, the same, so we can realize a lot of synergies. Also, the client portfolio is similar, so it's a really -- a very nice combination we can establish.</p><p>We will start the closing or the -- we will start the migration to the platform next year and we think we can manage this before the end of next year. After having this migration, we will offer our [1PB] product menu cart to the SocGen clients as well, as well as the advanced client portals will be available for those clients. The acquisition is a perfect example of our growth strategy in Northwest Europe. We focus on organic growth especially, but we are open for inorganic growth.</p><p>Kees mentioned yesterday and tomorrow already, the 3 pillar approach. Sustainability, very important for our bank. This started already in 2009 in the private bank. We focus very much on sustainable investments for our clients. And in the period 2009, 2017, we built a portfolio of EUR 8 billion assets under management for our clients. Last year, we reviewed and we set a new ambition level. And the ambition level was to double the assets under management in 3 years to a level of EUR 16 billion. And what happened last year that due to extra focus and a lot of education of the bankers, we were able to move forward with EUR 5 billion. So currently, we already have a portfolio of EUR 13 billion, so quite an achievement.</p><p>We invested a lot of time in educating the bankers. Currently, already 650 bankers are certified with the so-called United NationsPRI certificate. And last week, we signed a partnership with the University of Oxford. Together with Oxford University, we designed an international education program for our bankers. And not only that, we developed a resource program for measuring impact as well. We are also funding chairs in the Netherlands in 2 universities. In the University of Utrecht, we have a chair of social entrepreneurship and at the Erasmus University in Rotterdam, we have a chair for social enterprise. So sustainable investments are very relevant for our clients and in this way, as a bank, we contribute to society.</p><p>As a private bank, we heavily invest in the customer experience. In the Netherlands, we are a front-runner in digital solutions. As Frans already told a few minutes ago, we are working close together and the private bank is lifting up all the experiments and all the new developments of the retail bank. We work close together and of course, the retail bank is also in very important feeder for the private bank. Outside the Netherlands, we were lagging behind. There is a lower adoption rate for digital, so it's hardworking, together with the bankers, to convince clients to make use of the digital solutions.</p><p>In the private bank, every client has a banker and as we do in retail, we tried to convince the other attractive solution, having video banking. And it's going slowly but what we discover is that NPS for video banking is even higher and currently, they're getting more demand because not every conversation is necessary to have it face-to-face. And as Frans said, opening hours, we are changing as well. So more and more clients are having video conversations in the evening.</p><p>In the private bank, we have a segmentation strategy on wealth [bands], source of wealth and stage of life. We have 3 focus segments: Private wealth management for the ultra net -- high net worth individuals. We have a focus on entrepreneurs and enterprise and a life cycle. We also have an academy for the children of our Private Banking clients, the so-called Next Academy. And in the Next Academy, we have trainings available, online trainings for children, to get used to managing your wealth and doing good. We have also classes and we also offer solutions in an international perspective and bringing children together to educate them on having wealth.</p><p>We have a very high client satisfaction and we're working hard on this to keep it at this high level because due to the high client satisfaction, we are able to cross sell and to bring in new clients.</p><p>We work hard on the culture in the private bank to improve the effectiveness of staff, to support the bankers, to make our clients more digital savvy so that they make the choice for the digital solutions and video banking.</p><p>The strategy of the private bank has to do with harmonization and digitalization. And in the Netherlands, we work close together with the retail bank and we are on the same platform.</p><p>Outside the Netherlands, we are moving to one and the same core banking platform. And in the IT environment, the IT platform has almost been finalized. And the first quarter next year, Belgium will be the first country which will be migrated to the new platform. Later that year, SocGen will follow and afterwards, the other countries. And this will be very cost efficient for the private bank because having one and the same platform makes it very easy going in connecting our digital portals to this platform and having upgrades going forward, it's very easy and much more cost efficient.</p><p>The last 1.5 years, a lot of operational processes have been digitized. Especially in Germany and France, we have -- we're able to build those portals, client portals and in the operational processes, we took out about 70% of the manual processes. So this leads, finally, to a reduction of staff of 22% and in the meantime, we took already out 50%.</p><p>Regarding the profit rationalization, we are currently harmonizing the product portfolio and it will take until about 2020 before this process has been done, but we are harmonizing and finally, we'll have the same product menu cart in all countries.</p><p>All countries make use currently of our ABN AMRO investment solutions company in Paris, where we run our discretionary portfolio funds. Specials, we have organized in separate countries. So for example, private equity is concentrated now in Germany. Art, finance and the family office proposition is in France and philanthropy is in the Netherlands. And by doing this, we save a lot of costs, not having all the small teams in all countries will make use of the capabilities of the countries that we sell them.</p><p>We are successful in building a future-proof bank via harmonization and digitization. We apply a so-called safe to invest strategy. And as I already told you, the plan will take place in the year '17 until '21.</p><p>All in all, we will take out 650 FTEs and we almost realized half of it. In total, 22% of the private bank population. The plan is well on track, but there are still a lot to do. The total cost savings will be around EUR 100 million. Despite all the investments we have done so far, we could reduce the cost/income ratio of over 80% until 73% for the last 4 quarters. We have been, for a long time, in the 80s with the cost/income ratio. We're bringing it down to a level of below 70% in the next few years. This will take some time but in 2021, the level will be below 70%. Until that time, we keep the investment level at a high level because we really want to improve our digital solution in the countries, and we really want to optimize our platforms in the private bank.</p><p>I'm very proud to be well on track with the transformation because this process will reduce not only the cost, but brings in better solutions and we become a more attractive private bank for our clients.</p><p>The recent past of the private bank has been dominated with divestments. Last year, we divested Dubai, Singapore, Hong Kong and recently, Luxembourg. Due to the transformation plan we are currently running, we have a lot of reorganizations, which, of course, hampers the commercial activities.</p><p>We work hard on the regulatory requirements regarding MiFID II and we were an early starter regarding remediation plans for KYC. And currently, we are doing quite well because we already finalized the remediation plan in the Netherlands. Recently, we realized this in Guernsey and before the end of the year, the remediation will be finalized for Germany and Belgium. And in the second half next year, France will be done as well. So from that time, we can concentrate fully on commercial activities. So currently, we are freeing up a lot of capacity for cross sell, deep sell and acquisition of new clients. Digitalization and increased demand of video banking will free up a lot of capacity as well, capacity which can be spent on acquisition and cross and deep sell.</p><p>The ambition of the private bank is to migrate more liquidity into securities where we have a preference for DPM because it's easy going banking, very cost efficient and on the other hand, we have very nice cash flows on a quarterly basis. Despite a yearly margin erosion we see, which is calculated in all of our budgets, we expect a continued focus on further profitable growth.</p><p>Allow me to summarize. The strategy of the private bank has to do with harmonize, digitize and grow. We have a transformation plan, which is very well on track. For 50%, it has been realized. And with all the savings we are currently making, we can invest in digital and on the other hand, reduce our cost/income ratio. So I'm very committed, together with my team, to finalize this transformation plan and for sure, I'm convinced we can grow the private bank.</p><p>Thank you very much for your attention. And Frans and I are open now for questions. Thank you very much.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Thank you, Pieter. We have a quick look. Can we start over here with Jos\u00e9?</p><p>JOSEMA COLL, EQUITY ANALYST, GRUPO SANTANDER, RESEARCH DIVISION: I'm left wondering about the future in terms of fees, this is more Private Banking-related question. Once digitalization makes more inroads and the clients are able to jump from one platform to another in just a couple of clicks with PSD 2 and everything that's going to be offered to them, how are you planning on retaining your clients? Because equity products, whatever is going to be offered by pretty much everybody. What's the strategy to retain clients going forward?</p><p>FRANS M. R. VAN DER HORST: So referring to the fees in the private bank?</p><p>JOSEMA COLL: I'm thinking about fees, I'm thinking about help with taxes. I mean, what is the strategy to retain a client other than just the product offering in terms of investments?</p><p>FRANS M. R. VAN DER HORST: What we see is that we are still a very attractive private bank with a high NPS, Net Promoter Score. What we see is that now, we can free up capacity for the commercial work. We see that we are really able to transfer liquidity into securities. And what we see is that transferring execution only into DPM that gives more cash flows because you have the steady cash flows on a quarterly basis. Is that an answer to your question?</p><p>JOSEMA COLL: I guess it's a partial answer to the question. I'm thinking, isn't this something that your competition can offer also? I mean, what's the -- what differentiates ABN from ING in this new strategy?</p><p>PIETER VAN MIERLO: What we see -- especially in the Netherlands, Germany and France, because of the size, we have quite good specialists, very good specialists, I must say. So especially in the Netherlands, what you see because of the size, we can afford ourselves to have very dedicated teams for all the different specialties in Private Banking, for example, estate planning, financial planning, worldwide planning, philanthropy, whatsoever. Because of all those specialists, we are very attractive bank and by mobilizing clients from the other countries to this specific teams in the Netherlands and for example, for private equity in Germany, we are able to build solutions for clients that not everyone can provide.</p><p>JOSEMA COLL: And maybe just one more very specific question. What do you see margins in terms of AUM going over the next few years? Is that part of your cost-to-income target? Are you considering -- do you have in mind where margins could go in the future?</p><p>PIETER VAN MIERLO: Margins are quite stable but in our projection, we have some decline. But currently, they are still stable. And we had quite a discussion last year regarding the green offerings because boosting sustainable funds, we had a discussion on what should be the price level. We didn't give any discount and what we see, it's still attractive and for 80% of the clients, it's their first choice. So all new clients, take for 80% the green portfolios. And having existing clients in new DPM index, they take the green choice as well, which is at the same pricing level as the gray portfolios.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Okay. Next. Sorry, we'll go over here. Let me see, are there questions in the middle, by the way, as well. Go ahead, Marcell.</p><p>MARCELL HOUBEN: First of all, Frans, on the retail business. You said you wanted to grow the fees from 10% to 15% of total revenues. Can you just give us the split of the fees right now? How much of the fees are driven by current account fees? And how much room do you see to increase this current account fees given that one of the highest in Europe? That was the first question. Second one is for Pieter. On the -- I understand that the total private bank is -- an ROE of 23%. But can you give us a little more color in the divisional ROEs per region? Which region do you like scale and do you -- can you -- increase probability on those?</p><p>FRANS M. R. VAN DER HORST: On the first question. The payment fees or the payment-related fees are, to a certain extent, limited based upon the fact that the efficiency in the marketplace but we have, over time, been able to increase them, also because we offer more for that. The digital offering, the availability, the tool set, security, et cetera. So our last price increase was this summer. We constantly look what is possible and what should be logical from also a perspective of the investments that we do in capabilities, availability and those type of things. If you then position them next to the fee incomes out of investments and insurance, then the total of the last 2 is bigger than the first.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Okay. Thank you. Pieter the...</p><p>PIETER VAN MIERLO: Regarding the return on equity, ambition level to have at least 10% in each country. Currently, in the Netherlands, of course, we have a much higher return on equity. But we are improving quite rapidly now because taking out so many FTEs outside the Netherlands, you see the cost/income ratio is rapidly improving. So I think in 2 years from now, we are able to have this hurdle of 10% plus in all countries.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Okay. We have a question on the back.</p><p>ADRIAN CIGHI, EQUITY ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: This is Adrian Cighi from RBC. 2 questions on Retail Banking, please. The clarification on the fee income, is the increase from 10% to 15% included in the group fee income guidance for the plan? And the second one is on the Tikkie. Are you seeing yourself as the natural owner of Tikkie? We've seen other countries where the payment platforms have been sort of divested.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Okay. Should we keep your first question for Clifford who's going to talk about group fees?</p><p>ADRIAN CIGHI: Okay.</p><p>FRANS M. R. VAN DER HORST: That's good for me. Okay.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Unless you insist, Frans.</p><p>FRANS M. R. VAN DER HORST: No. Your question around Tikkie, that's a very good question. It started in June 2016 when 2 developers wanted to make some code to solve this problem and they were allowed to do that in 3, 4 weeks and they basically had the [MVP] ready. And then they asked for a few hundred thousand euros of web marketing budgets to see if they could push a certain set of users. And that was the start of the growth journey that we have seen. It gives us a lot of positive energy because it also gives us a lot of experience in working like a fintech internally and understanding what is important for scaling those type of things. So it's also a very motivational element in the whole IT and retail space that this could be created together and that is also now spread out to the Commercial Banking colleagues, et cetera. So there is, in essence, no logic that I should own it. But as we invented it, we still like to treasure it and see if we can make this platform even more relevant in the Dutch society. And as it has a so huge NPS and it's so driven by people that are using it, show every day based that I think that we are not yet ready with finding further options for further -- yes, exploration, what could be the potential of Tikkie. And that's also the discussions that we have at the moment, how can we speed up further value added service development and the likes. So yes, I know there is some interest in Tikkie as a concept. But for this moment, we are very happy in exploring first, ourselves, whatever is still possible with this very nice creation.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Thank you. We have some questions, one over there, Jean-Pierre, and then the next one is over there.</p><p>JEAN-PIERRE LAMBERT: Yes, Jean-Pierre from KBW. I was wondering, you haven't mentioned Moneyou and it was -- it came out at the IPO as a potential development internationally as a vector for collecting deposits and I was wondering, do you have plans to expand in other countries? Or is it under wrap for the moment?</p><p>FRANS M. R. VAN DER HORST: Moneyou was also on none of the slides of Christian. It's one of our endeavors where we created a full digital cloud-enabled SaaS solution-connected banking platform. And then also there, we try now to experience with what it will take to scale that because we are not the only one in that space. There are more of these type of initiatives. And so at the moment, we are taking a closer look at what can that bring? Can we also use part of this, today's technology to replace elements in the [modern] bank? Can we have opportunities to grow the number of users in the Moneyou payment area significantly? So that's under discussion at this moment.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Okay. Next -- sorry -- yes -- Sorry, the [guy] over there and then we'll go -- hands over here.</p><p>MATTHIAS DE WIT, ANALYST, KEMPEN &amp; CO. N.V., RESEARCH DIVISION: Matthias De Wit from Kempen &amp; Co. Two questions. The first is on Retail Banking. If I look at the mortgage margin, they look quite healthy from an international perspective, also from an ROE and risk reward view. How do you -- how sustainable are they considering that competition is quite heavy nowadays and there are some developments with new entrants like pension funds becoming more aggressive, et cetera? So that's the first question. Secondly is on Private Banking. I was surprised to see NII growing and margins growing like NIM margins in the private banks. So what's exactly happening there? And how do you think about interest margins going forward in the private bank?</p><p>FRANS M. R. VAN DER HORST: Will you start?</p><p>PIETER VAN MIERLO: Yes, I can start, of course. M&amp;A, growing M&amp;A has to do with net new inflows, of course. I think having those attractive sustainable funds, I think it's attractive for clients to switch to the ABN AMRO brand, Bethmann brand or Neuflize brands. I think by moving from execution-only to DPM and advisory mandates, I think we will create more revenues.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Okay. And the question on your NII has been growing, that is also related to that as well as the deposit margins?</p><p>PIETER VAN MIERLO: Deposit margins. Deposit margins are, of course, very low at this moment. We pay 3 basis points on the deposits in general. And with -- when we have consent with clients, we -- in its PWM segment, we even charge on deposits. So currently, we have negative margins for the larger deposits in certain segments.</p><p>DIES DONKER: And Clifford will address that as well at a later point. Yes, Ben?</p><p>BENJAMIN GOY, RESEARCH ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: Benjamin Goy from Deutsche Bank. 2 questions, please. The first one on Retail Banking and you mentioned increasing digitalization in the country but also you're moving to distribute offering as well. So was wondering how you expect this to affect your relationship and also competition with mortgage brokers in the country? And then secondly, on the private bank, bolt-on M&amp;A has been part of the story since the IPO. It's now you did one smaller bolt-on. Just wondering where were you in the past out-bid or do we have more files on the table given regulatory, so to say, cost pressures might increase there, the tendency for you to buy up smaller private banks?</p><p>FRANS M. R. VAN DER HORST: Shall I start on the mortgages part and then I probably try not to forget the question that just was left out. And in the mortgage market, we basically have 3 different formulas. A small one, which has the label Moneyou, which is execution-only, people do it themselves. Florius, which is fully oriented on intermediary sales. That's a standardized, straightforward, highly predictable, highly reliable process. And we have ABN AMRO, and ABN AMRO label is used in 2 ways. It's direct sales, by branch network, by people, by advisors, whatever, and it's used by intermediaries. All mortgage requests, which have a component of more discussing the matter or explaining or not a straightforward income, I don't -- also by intermediary in the ABN AMRO level. So my change in digitalization is not really changing the relationship we have with these brokers. We, for tens of years, work with the ABN AMRO label in a joint effort, partially it's used by brokers and we use it in our direct channels also. And I really do understand, if this is a straightforward client, then it goes into the Florius street. If there has to be something to be discussed, then it goes in the ABN AMRO street. So there, we have a clear distinction and the changes we apply to the direct sales are not really hampering any of the relationship with brokers. And the question that was still there on the margin, yes, as also a case, we are not in the business for pure size alone. We would like to stick to the hurdles. We have a weekly monitoring on prices. Whenever it's necessary, we can change them every day in the week, if necessary. But we would like to safeguard very stable margins and at this moment, we still see stable margins above the hurdle production. And yes, that leaves to -- that leads to a slightly -- yes, declining book at this moment, but I prefer to focus on the return, especially also because of the -- yes, the increase in the house prices we have seen recently. So a little bit cautious there is safeguarded -- safeguarding the margins and the hurdle.</p><p>PIETER VAN MIERLO: Regarding the M&amp;A question. As a private bank, we focus on organic profitable growth and of course, the size of the private bank with EUR 200 billion plus assets under management is fine to have good returns. So it's not necessary to grow it inorganically. We are very glad with the acquisition we could make in Belgium because we had a level below EUR 10 billion and above EUR 10 billion, you make much better results. Going forward, of course, after having finalized the platforms, we will certainly grow the private bank inorganically and currently, we're investigating possibilities, for example, in Germany and France.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Okay. We'll go to that side. Jason and Benoit, too.</p><p>JASON KALAMBOUSSIS, EQUITY ANALYST, KBC SECURITIES NV, RESEARCH DIVISION: Jason Kalamboussis, KBC. The first question is in, how do you say -- I mean, you were talking yesterday on the private clients. You have 110 basis points that you charge. You have your -- with your boiler room in France, 25 basis points that go to -- go there. Do you see these 2 staying relatively stable over the next years? And coming back a bit to the M&amp;A. If you have -- you say that 50%, I think you're pretty much done on the implementation, the transformation. You said, end of '19 you're ready to focus on the commercial side. I mean, should we expect them if we exclude the M&amp;A, we see some stronger growth coming? Or actually, you're relying quite a lot and you're more -- you think that a lot more will come from the M&amp;A integration side that will come?</p><p>PIETER VAN MIERLO: Because we started the KYC remediation program early and have almost finalized it, we freed up a lot of capacity going forward in all countries, except France. So France isn't finalized yet. It will be finalized in the second half of this year. But in all other countries, we free up at least 2 days a week for all bankers. So acquisition is going very well at this moment. So we are really able to grow organically and increase number of clients and transfer liquidity into securities. Regarding the margins, I expect the margins will going down going forward, let's say with 1% or 2% year-on-year, but that's calculated in the budget. So taking out costs and having this slow margin decline, that's something we predicted and we can handle and in the meantime, have the returns we are looking for.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Okay. We've got one more before lunch. Do we have Bruce over there? Sorry.</p><p>BRUCE ALLAN HAMILTON, EQUITY ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: Yes. Can I just ask on Tikkie? So this is a moment to really kind of -- individual to individual, but over time, it sounds like you're saying it's individual to merchant as well. So I mean, how much of the business is disintermediating the existing payments network or card network or ideal, and is that a realistic possibility that you then sort of control it? Just to understand this. Secondly, just on Private Banking. You've given us quite a lot of information on margin, which is super helpful. When people move from cash to investments, what's the step, is it like from 0 to 60 bps, is that the kind of fee step up that you'd be talking about? And in terms of your discretionary mandate penetration, where are we today and where do you anticipate you might get to on a 3-, 4-year view?</p><p>FRANS M. R. VAN DER HORST: On the first question, Tikkie is using, at this moment, iDEAL, to fulfill its payments. That can change also with PSD 2 changes. We can also have another level of connectivity. It's not so much competing with other ways to pay for commercial clients. It's, at this moment, an adding element because -- and you probably won't use it for very big ticket sizes because it's in essence, a very easy-going payment, but you were probably would not try to collect EUR 5,000 or that type of money with this. I mean, that's not fitting there. But the university, for instance, in Groningen, it was the first one who'd knocked on our doors. They had some students that they get -- some money from and it was difficult because mails were not read, calls were not answered, letters were not opened. And then all of a sudden, the student said, \"Bloody hell, send me a Tikkie, then I will pay.\" And that's the reason -- that's the first commercial experience that we had with somebody who was said okay, and it has now great value for me because calling and writing letters and those type of things are much more expensive than sending a WhatsApp. And the level of -- the ratio payment on this WhatsApp was much higher than any other means that they use.</p><p>PIETER VAN MIERLO: And regarding your question, moving liquidity into securities, of course, that's very attractive because interest levels came very -- came down very much. Having the fee income on securities, DPM or advisory mandates, it's much more healthy to have it in the security portfolio and it's more sticky as well.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Okay. Thanks very much. That concludes the Q&amp;A for now. We'll have a break for lunch. If you could be back by 1:30 London time, that's also for the people on the webcast, that would be great. Those on the webcast, no need to disconnect. We'll just reconvene at 1:30 U.K. time. Thank you.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>DIES DONKER: Thanks very much, and thanks for helping us in our time management by being here. For those in the room, we've just asked to turn up the heat a little bit. I'm not sure whether that has to do with the presentations which are still coming, but there were some people who were a little bit cold.</p><p>The next block is Commercial Banking and corporate banking. And I would like to invite Rutger, the Head of Corporate &amp; Institutional Banking, to kick off, please. Thanks.</p><p>RUTGER VAN NOUHUIJS, CEO OF CORPORATE &amp; INSTITUTIONAL BANKING, ABN AMRO GROUP N.V.: Thank you, Dies, and a very good afternoon to you all. My name is Rutger Nouhuijs, and I joined ABN AMRO way back in 1989. I started in Corporate Banking, Natural Resources, and then I moved over to equity capital markets, M&amp;A advisory and client coverage. And since the beginning of 2017, in charge of Corporate &amp; Institutional Banking.</p><p>I like to take you through 3 points today. First of all, I'm going to explain what a great franchise CIB is, with great people and great clients. Second, I'd like to run you through the Q2 announcement but more important, update you on the progress I'm making. And last does not least, explain how we are dealing with Basel IV.</p><p>But before I start, I like to leave 3 commitment with you. First of all, I am committed to further develop sustainable relationships, with multiproduct clients in attractive sectors. My second commitment is that I like to achieve the announced measures in Q2: first of all, reduce capital by EUR 5 billion; secondly, to take out EUR 80 million in costs; and thirdly, to adhere to a strict capital allocation and transform the CIB business model. Last but not least, I'm very committed and keen to deliver on the targets in Basel III, but also to prepare CIB for Basel IV readiness.</p><p>Now let's go to CIB as it stands today. CIB serves over 3,000 clients, with 2,500 people in 3 time zones. And our service is highly valued by our clients. Now let me start in the Netherlands, our natural home position. A great franchise, top 2, strong client feedback, but also being awarded the best Dutch bank in 2018 by Euromoney. And last but not least, our Dutch wholesale clients have asked us to take a presence in the surrounding countries.</p><p>Now the Global Sectors. It is really in the DNA of the Dutch people to be a trading nation and a maritime nation. And therefore, it's very logical that we are present in TCF, Natural Resources and in shipping, Global Transportation &amp; Logistics. And our positions globally are recognized and awarded, like for example, last year, when we won the award of best global trade finance bank by Euromoney.</p><p>On the products side, we clustered all the lending products into structured finance, and we created one distribution hub, Global Markets, serving FX, rates, equity capital markets and debt capital markets. In markets, we achieved the #1 brokerage position, being the #1 Extel broker; and in private equity, great results. Last but not least, ABN AMRO Clearing Bank, top 3 position in the world, serving clients, over 150 exchanges. So if I summarize, CIB has a strong franchise and is highly recognized by our clients.</p><p>Now let's talk about 3 of these clients: in the Netherlands; in Germany; but also a Global Sector client. Sustainable relationships are the key. And we start off with long-term lending commitments, but we leverage those commitments with capital-light cross-sell, generating fee income.</p><p>If I start with the Dutch client. And in the Dutch portfolio, 85% of the portfolio is multiproduct. And this is a typical mid-market case in the Netherlands where we have a long-term lending relationship. And this specific client was acquired by a private equity investor. Now we were able to act on the buy side, generating nice M&amp;A fees. But also important, we cross-sell other products, like the asset base products from Daphne in Commercial Banking. So the return we make on these typical client is well above the 10%.</p><p>Now let's move to Germany. And I know some of you are still skeptical about our European expansion. But I'm going to tell, with this client example, that you can leave your skepticism. Why? Because we have a lean and mean team in Germany, and we are leveraging on the Private Banking platform that Pieter has in Germany.</p><p>Now this is an example of a power and utility company that is also banked by German banks and by the international builder-backed firms. And we were able to start a lending position over there, but we also got a senior syndicate position on the first green bond issued by this client. And I really like that because we can link that to our sustainability pillar. Return on equity, 17%.</p><p>Last but not least, a typical example of a multiproduct TCF client. Because in the Global Sectors, the percentage of multiproduct clients is 50%, and it is my ambition to increase that percentage over 60%. Now this is a typically big client, active in the 3 regions of the world. It starts with a short-term revolving credit facility in order to get the trade income of this client. But interestingly enough, we also, for this client, run an advisory mandate in a sense that we've been able to sell a part of their business in Asia Pacific to a Chinese investor. Return on equity, 14%. To sum up, we make decent returns because of the multiproduct client aspect in all sectors and geographies.</p><p>Now you already know this slide. And I will address the key issues we are facing. And let me take you through the slides. Because most of the sectors and the products through the cycle are above the 10% return on equity, but actually, trade and commodity finance in Global Markets are not. And we will be moving TCF inside this corner, above the 10% return on equity. And I am going to explain later how we're going to do that, and how it's working already.</p><p>Global Markets, that's costly to run. Basically, if you look at the platform in the past, it was way too big for the client flow. And that's a problem for every midsized bank. But there is a clear room for improvement to bring Global Markets to single-digit returns.</p><p>Private Equity, doing very nicely. This morning, we issued a press release where we opened up the private equity funds in the Netherlands for outside investors. And there are 4 investors, led by AlpInvest, who take control of 53% of a relative small part of the portfolio. But the team is really rock-solid, and that's the reason why we decided to also invest back with a minority interest, and that's a good example of locking in profits in this cycle.</p><p>Last but not least, let me take out one example of GTL because shipping today is still generating double-digit returns despite the market. However, we are already preempting the Basel IV situation because asset-based financing is being hit quite severely in a Basel IV environment. And that's exactly the reason why we are taking out capital in the Global Sectors and recycle part of it into more investment-grade or near-investment grade clients, where we cross-sell in other products. To summarize, CIB has a good business through the cycle, but 2 businesses need restructuring measures.</p><p>Now Kees talked about this slide already in the half year results. Now let me update you on the progress that we are making. Because on the reduction of RWAs, we are clearly on track. Since Q1, we already took out EUR 1.5 billion in RWAs. And we are shifting the portfolio, and we've been analyzing all the client portfolios and zoomed into the less attractive clients. And there, we started discussions, which are sometimes difficult, with clients.</p><p>On the cost side, we completed the early announced reorganization in Global Markets. We've been closing geographies and provisions have been taken. And also, we've been calculated the impact on the people side. That has been identified.</p><p>Now last but not least, looking at the transformation of the business model. We decided to centralize coverage, put all lending product into one hub, create one center of excellence in distribution Global Market. And very important, we decided to create one central portfolio management team within structured finance. And we looked at best practices of other banks. And I will talk about that a bit later on in my presentation.</p><p>Now very important is the transformation of the sectors. And let me talk about sustainability and that pillar. Because if you look at the energy portfolio, the CIB team is really committed to drive and engage with our clients on this energy transition. And to give you one example, today, the percentage in the portfolio of renewable energy clients is standing at 7%. And we will triple that percentage in the portfolio over 20% 2 years from now.</p><p>And Tanja, you already elaborated on some of the polluting client segments. We engage with our clients, and we clearly discuss with them that we are no more financing the heavy-polluting F&amp;G-labeled ships. More important, as an important shipping bank, we started the initiative a while ago to really focus on environmentally friendly scrapping of all our ships. To sum up, I'm on track with my plans, and I'm pushing the right buttons, and I expect to deliver our targets in 2020 and 2021.</p><p>I promised you to take you through 2 examples. And first of all, I'd like to address the trade and commodity situation. TCF uses a lot of capital, over EUR 9 billion RWAs, but they failed to create economies of scale, and there are still a long list of clients that are not accretive. And we are taking note. So we identified those clients, and we started the tough discussions with those clients. In TCF, we already reduced EUR 1.3 billion RWAs, if you compare it to Q1 of this year.</p><p>On the diamond portfolio that Tanja talked about, we are derisking that portfolio. Also in Dubai, and let me use that as an example, with 98% of our existing clients, we agreed on repayment schedules. And we introduced a 0-loss mentality, in the sense that we screened the entire portfolio and really are pruning out the most risky clients. But there is still a road ahead.</p><p>Now on the cost side. We have reduced 20 people. We also centralized the noncommercial departments. And let me give you one example. Because there is one mid-office desk in Rotterdam and one in Amsterdam. That didn't make any sense, so we decided to merge that and create cost synergies. But we are also looking at processes within TCF and are implementing a lean analysis, making processes more efficient, taking out costs. And last but not least, the closing of the office of Dubai is done and also, the rep office in Moscow is closed.</p><p>On the transformation of the business model. We moved to less paper and less hassle for our clients. But we also invest in blockchain. And like Christian already mentioned in his slides, the Congo example, which actually is a great example of a blockchain which is completely digitized. It's safer for our clients. It's way more user-friendly, and it is really a classical example of improving your customer experience. So to summarize, I've got one of my best people on this case. It's hard work. But we are and we will keep on delivering and resolve this large chunk of CIBs in the performance.</p><p>Now let's move to markets. Global Markets provides an important service to CIB's multiproduct clients. But not only to CIB clients because we also serve Private Banking clients, and we serve Commercial Banking clients, and retail clients, but also ALM/Treasury. But the financial challenge remains: high costs, low returns due to a limited client flow and too much RWAs, so clear room to improve.</p><p>Now on the reduction of capital, because the team already had done an impressive job, reducing from over EUR 14 billion in 2013 to EUR 7 billion in 2017. And we pushed that further down, already EUR 800 million out since the beginning of this year and EUR 700 million to go by trimming our product offering, and for example, only be a market-maker in Dutch government bonds.</p><p>Now on the cost side. We reduced 40 people and completed the reorganization. So I expect we're going to grab the fruit as of the beginning of 2019. We stopped desks in Brazil, in Norway, but also in the Far East. And on behalf of the whole bank, I'm happy that we are going to make an end and complete the SME derivative file, expected in Q1 of 2019. And that has been a big drag on the costs.</p><p>On the transformation side, we need to increase the flow on the platform, so we are really pushing the people hard to increase the share of the wallet with our clients. But we also use advanced analytics in the trading environment. And as Christian also mentioned and Daphne will show, we started this digital offering of francs. It's a multicurrency platform, but also offering products, FX products for our Commercial Banking clients. To sum up, Global Markets is making great progress and is on track to contribute to CIB's return on equity above the 10%, although I don't expect them to make double-digit returns, but stay in positive single-digit returns.</p><p>This is an important slide because I am going to talk about changing the business model. Because in the past, we too often entered into client lending relationship with a lot of promises of more business down the road, but actually too little coming out of this. And we will do and are doing this already in a different way. Three initiatives: focus on multiproducts; adhering to a strict capital discipline; and increasing capital velocity. And let me take you through those pillars.</p><p>Multiproduct cross-selling. As said, my ambition, especially also looking at the Global Sector, is to increase multiproduct and cross-sell above the 60%. Not only lending, but being very disciplined on cross-sell of at least 2 products. But also scaling back on the Basel IV-affected products because there are still quite a lot of uncommitted lines which we are taking out, as we speak, reducing capital and prepare ourselves for the Basel IV environment already.</p><p>Strict capital discipline. We have introduced a central portfolio management department within structured finance where we control all CIB's loan book. And that is really important because that allows us to steer our capital towards those sectors, and those products and those clients where we can make the best return on capital. And 3 times a week, there is a capital allocation committee where we look at each and every client situation. There is even a tool being developed where we already look at the impact on Basel IV and ask relationship bankers to address any shortcomings in that field.</p><p>Capital velocity. I like to dramatically increase capital rotation by more investor-centric origination approach. And what do I mean with that? If a relationship banker comes up with a loan proposal, the first question is, how can we offload this debt? Who is the ultimate investor? Is that a bank, or is that an insurance company or is that a pension fund? And that is a way to originate, to distribute. But we're also investing in ways to ensure part of the portfolio, and even in central portfolio management, move out parts of the portfolio. And if you realize that today, in between 3% to 5% of the portfolio is being risk distributed, that's a small percentage, and I like to see a big increase of that percentage. We also need to keep in our minds that over 90% of the loan book of CIB will churn before 2022. To sum up, we will increase income over RWAs by generating more fee income with less capital, and we will prepare ourselves for Basel IV.</p><p>Now let's look at the impact of how we are preparing ourselves for Basel IV. But let me start with this graph. This graph shows you the return on equity of CIB in the last couple of years. You saw quite a dramatic improvement in the year-to-date financials, up to 9% -- almost 9.5% return on equity. Now we need to normalize that for the extraordinary Private Equity income that we saw in last year, but we also need to normalize that for other numbers. But I already took you through the way how we are going to increase the returns in CIB to 10% plus.</p><p>Now how are we coping with Basel IV? Because Basel IV is further driving our need to be more capital efficient. And we're doing a few things. First of all, we are timely implementing our new capital-light strategy, basically to optimize our returns under Basel III and prepare ourselves for Basel IV. As said, we are steering capital to those clients, those products, those sectors, which show the best returns. By also generating higher capital velocity through risk distribution in primary markets, like DCM, like underwrites; but also in secondary markets, looking at securitizations, like insurance or sell-downs of part of the portfolio, we are increasing return on the CIB portfolio. And important to acknowledge is the fact that, before 2022, the entire CIB portfolio will be churned. To summarize, in 2021, CIB is well positioned for the introduction of Basel IV.</p><p>Now I come to my last slide. And tonight, Friday evening, when you drive home, I like to -- I like you to remember 3 commitments that I give to you. First of all, I am passionate to further develop sustainable relationship with multiproduct clients and move the capital into attractive sectors. I am fully committed to reduce the capital, reduce RWAs, take out costs, and adhere to a strict discipline in capital allocation. And therefore, my third point is, we will, I will deliver on above 10% ROE target by 2021 under Basel IV, and we'll be ready for Basel IV.</p><p>Thank you very much. And Daphne, may I now invite you on stage for Commercial Banking story. Thank you.</p><p>DAPHNE DE KLUIS, CEO - COMMERCIAL BANKING, ABN AMRO GROUP N.V.: Thank you, Rutger. Hello, everyone. Good afternoon. My name is Daphne de Kluis, and I'm responsible for Commercial Banking. I'm going to tell you about sustainability as a business opportunity.</p><p>I'm already with the bank for over 20 years in different type of jobs. I've been heading the global structured finance unit. Actually, I set it up. I've been heading FR&amp;R, Financial Restructuring &amp; Recovery, during the difficult times. I've been in Romania for 3 years, heading the Commercial Bank. And I'm now in Kees' team, responsible for Commercial Banking.</p><p>Commercial Banking is a leading bank in the Dutch market. We are guided by client intimacy where it matters and efficiency everywhere else. And I'll come back to that. We deliver clear profitable growth, as we already promised you in 2015. We consider sustainability as a real growth opportunity, and I'll demonstrate that to you. And we make good progress in improving our costs and C/I ratio.</p><p>Now first, let's take a closer look at Commercial Banking as a whole. We are leading in the Dutch market in the SME segment. And as I already said, our strategy is based on client intimacy where it matters and efficiency everywhere else. And if I talk about client intimacy, I talk about expertise and bringing value-adds to your clients. If I talk about efficiency, I very much talk about digital, hassle-free and convenience.</p><p>Now I don't have to tell you in detail all the challenges that we have. First of all, Kees already elaborated on that. But furthermore, I believe you are very well aware. Of course, there are clients' needs that are changing, there are technological trends, and of course, the government regulations are also quite intense.</p><p>Now we have a stable base of around 365,000 clients, and that represents almost 25% of the Dutch enterprises. And these are corporates in all kind of sectors of the economy, and the turnover is up to EUR 250 million. And we offer them a broad range of services and products. We have asset-based finance units, and that has a presence also in U.K., Germany and France. And the rest of our offering is mostly tailored to the Netherlands.</p><p>Now how do we achieve this client intimacy? That's very much based on our sector approach. And with this sector approach, we can have a real good, strategic dialogue with our clients. And it makes a very strong and personal contact. Of course, we also have tailored product offerings. And I believe that we stand out from competition because we have integrated this sector approach really across the board in the bank.</p><p>Now course, we also offer our clients -- and Christian and Frans already told you about it, very innovative solutions. And let me explain you a little bit about an offering that we created, which is called New10. New10 is an online tool for commercial loans. And actually, what New10 told us is that it's not so much about getting as soon as possible the funds to a client's account.</p><p>The client wants to know if he can make the investment. So it's much more important to know very quickly \"Can I get the loan or not?\" With New10, within 15 minutes, you know if you can get a loan. And if within 48 hours, it's on your account as long as you distribute the right documents that we need. And we talked a lot about Tikkie also. And actually, Frans, I want to take the opportunity to thank you for that because Tikkie very much is also relevant for our commercial banking clients. We have now over 1,500 clients and is rapidly growing, that are using Tikkie from a commercial perspective. We're a solid contributor to ABN AMRO, and we provide around 20% of gross income. We make the target for ROE. In short, we have a great business. But how are we going to make it even better? We are convinced that accelerating the sustainability shifts is our biggest business opportunity in the coming years.</p><p>We see sustainability as a growth opportunity. And by implementing sustainability in our business model, we really respond both to market and client needs. Our real goal is to facilitate our clients in their transition to a sustainable business model. So it's not only about green, but it is becoming a sustainable business. We're creating a sustainable business as a client, and we call that accelerating the sustainability shifts. Now we see definitely that there are some challenges there, but we also believe that there are a lot of opportunities. And don't get me wrong. This is a real pool. It's a pool for sustainable and circular solutions, and this pool is by our clients. Our analysis shows that 80% of our clients are busy with sustainability, and 70% of them really believe that the bank should play a role there.</p><p>Now if I talk about sustainability, I talk mainly about 2 transitions: first of all, the energy transition from fossil to 0 emission; and secondly, from linear to circular. Now of course, there's also a transition in the social area, social entrepreneurship to social impacts. We're still assessing how our role should be in that space and what type of impact do we want to make. So therefore, I didn't include that in this presentation.</p><p>Now we estimated the market for potential -- for the potential of sustainability. So let me start with energy. We see a market potential of around EUR 14 billion in the SME market in the Netherlands for the coming years up to around 2030. And that's out of a total of EUR 70 billion, and these numbers are based on a Dutch government report regarding the climate agreement. In a circular transition, we see a clear market potential every year of EUR 7 billion. And that's in the Dutch market, and that's out of a total of EUR 66 billion. And that number is based on the analysis of data of the Dutch Central Bureau for Statistics.</p><p>Now I see you think, yes, Daphne, a nice story, but how are you going to capitalize on that? We want to capitalize on that by an engagement strategy. We will proactively approach all of our clients with sustainable propositions, and we want to help facilitate their transition. Now of course, that has to do with clients that are already there in their mindset, but it also very much has to do with helping clients that are not yet there and show them what the possibilities are.</p><p>And this engagement will lead to a number of goals. Kees already told you about our goal in the energy transition. So by 2030, we want a full real estate portfolio to have energy label A. But also we have a goal in the circular transition, and that is that by 2020, we want to finance at least a total of EUR 1 billion circular deals and a number of 100 circular deals.</p><p>So concluding on this, this is actually an impact that we want to make, first of all, on societal return on investment; and secondly, financial return. And we find them both equally important.</p><p>Now allow me to zoom in a little bit extra on the 2 transitions. First, the energy transition. It's all about reducing CO2 emissions. And of course, as a bank, we're in a position to really contribute substantially to that. Take alone our real estate portfolio. That's responsible for 40% of all CO2 emissions in the Netherlands. So by helping our clients to improve the label, of course, we make an impact. But of course, energy transition is not all about real estate.</p><p>So let me give you some other examples. One example is, for example, a company called Vibers. They use elephant grass to make green alternative to plastic. Now we help them to develop growth plans to upscale production. Now of course, this is traditional banking. But this is traditional banking with a different type of player and a different type of risk model.</p><p>Another example that comes to mind is the raising of equity and debt for the Dutch wind farms, and we do that by applying our expertise on project finance. Now of course, we do that very much together with your team, Rutger, but approaching finance expertise and the equity expertise is very well developed.</p><p>And together, we closed the deal in June last year on an offshore wind farm, which is located 50 kilometers off the coast of the Dutch coast. And once that's operational in 2021, the product will deliver clean electricity to at least 800,000 households.</p><p>Now then to circular transition. If I talk about the circular transition, we got very inspired by the concept of product as a service, in other words paying for usage instead of ownership. And I have a very nice example there of a company called HOMIE. And that's a business that rents out washing machines, and it takes care also of the maintenance. And they link the washing machines to the Internet, so they can see what the condition of the washing machine is. And the user pays per load, and he can change his mind at any day to cancel the transaction they have with HOMIE and buy a washing machine. We believe that this is really nice model and a very sustainable model. And of course, we provided them with funding. That is something that we've done for years. But again, this is a very inventive customer that we really want to support. So in both transitions, there are plenty of commercial opportunities for a bank that really embraces sustainability.</p><p>Until now, I talked to you about potential with clients and sustainability, but mostly interest-related transactions. Now of course, we very much also believe in making a diversion in our revenue mix, so we would like to very much increase the fee potential that we have. And we believe we can do that by bringing value-added services to our clients. And Christian already mentioned in his presentation, \"If you want to remain relevant in a changing landscape, then we have to team up with partners.\" And I am extremely convinced that, that is the way forward also for the commercial bank. I've listed a few partnerships that we have today, and I wanted to elaborate on one, which is opportunity network.</p><p>An opportunity network is an example of an added value platform, where our clients -- where we offer our clients the potential to connect with other clients. And it's -- actually, when I go to clients in the Commercial Banking area, it's one of the questions that all of them have, \"Can you please connect me to other clients in the sector?\" And this is a nice way of doing that via a technological platform. And it gets real opportunities for growth, acquisitions, sales and to connect with each other.</p><p>Now what's the revenue model there for us? First of all, we get a fee from clients that get on the platform. And second of all, once they're on the platform and they want to do a deal, if they need any services, financial, M&amp;A or other type of services, we are connected on the platform as well. And we can deliver it there and then.</p><p>Now let's focus on 2 relevant elements from a P&amp;L point of view: top line development and costs. Historically, we've delivered, as promised, a solid profitable growth. And as the slide also demonstrates, we will continue to do so. Future growth is expected to be in line with Dutch GDP, as it has always been. But the good thing about focusing on sustainability is that it will generate more fee income, and I'll try to tell you about it. If we look at 2 examples, one is opportunity network that brings a fee income, but also another opportunity is the Tikkie platform again. And Frans already highlighted, we're very much busy together to see what type of added value we can bring extra on the Tikkie platform.</p><p>Now efficiently, a good -- we want to make good progress in improving our cost and efficiency. And of course, it's extremely important, we are focused on being a future-proof bank, so this is the #1 thing that we need to do. Now as you can see, our cost-to-income ratio is trending down, and this is despite the fact that we have invested a lot in our know-your-customer improvements.</p><p>We've made a number of initiatives over the last couple of years. First of all, we changed the management structure. We had a separate SME offering. We've put a sector-based approach in place, but also we executed on a location strategy. We had 24 offices before, and we're now reduced to 14 offices. We closely work together with our retail colleagues because we want to digitize our offering. We want to create hassle-free banking, which is very good for our customers and also very efficient for us. And we will keep on focusing on this.</p><p>Now concluding. We delivered what we promised during the IPO. We continue to grow our top line, and we continue to manage our cost efficiently. Therefore, we continue to deliver to contribute to the bank. And while doing so, we want to also drive the agenda for the sustainable -- accelerating the sustainable shift of our clients is the goal to help them transition to a sustainable business.</p><p>Now that will help society, but it will also help our financial performance. I hope that I demonstrated to you that sustainability is a real growth opportunity. And with that, I would like to conclude, and I want to ask Rutger to join me at the stage for some Q&amp;A. Thank you.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Thanks very much. Who's first? Yes, Jason?</p><p>JASON KALAMBOUSSIS: First question. I mean, again, it may be for the last meeting, but just as we go through the day, we -- everyone is basically saying that they're a lot more optimistic on the net fee and commission. And it will be nice to address, I mean, in '19, we'll understand that's trended, transitioned in a year for a number of segment, but it looks like there is a lot of optimism coming through throughout all the presentation. So it'd be nice to understand why the outlook is still flattish over the next 2 years, and not just over '19, and then actually seeing some nice growth coming through. So coming back...</p><p>DAPHNE DE KLUIS: Good. I hope that's the worst of it.</p><p>JASON KALAMBOUSSIS: No. The other question, it is to -- just looking at the diamond segment we discussed a bit with Tanja earlier. It is -- you have, I think, a $1 billion exposure. You're in a market where you're dominant. You have a standard charter with the other player. So you're 2 big players there. It is -- I'm trying to understand 2 things. It is, one, how can you bring down your exposure in such a market, where at the end of the day, you could have also a collapse, which maybe is not included in how you approach that market from an impairment perspective? The second is, how do you avoid such areas? What have you done in the organization to avoid going in such segment situations, et cetera? And the third element is, are you confident that, for example, in that area, you do not have structures or anything else that could attract any regulatory tension?</p><p>RUTGER VAN NOUHUIJS: Yes. Great questions. Thanks for asking. And the best proof of the pudding is that we are actually already have been derisking the portfolio quite a bit. And as we speak, we are exiting our office in Dubai, and we agreed with 98% of the existing client base on the repayment schedule. And what we are seeing today is that other local banks are taking over those lending commitments. So that is -- and what we are seeing today. Now let me -- can you repeat your second question?</p><p>JASON KALAMBOUSSIS: Yes. It is -- I was saying that you're in a dominant position. So how can you -- if you try to retract, and especially in the bigger markets, because in Dubai, it's easier, how do you avoid basically an implosion?</p><p>RUTGER VAN NOUHUIJS: Yes, yes. Listen, that derisking takes place in a very controlled way.</p><p>JASON KALAMBOUSSIS: Sorry. If I may say, because at the end of the day, you have done a great job in being trying to earlier on to decrease your exposure. The problem is that you are with another player. And at the end of the day, you know there is no natural -- in Dubai, maybe you have management, but you don't have naturally someone else that can take over the business.</p><p>RUTGER VAN NOUHUIJS: Yes, yes, true. But part of the exposures have been shifting, for example, from our Belgium portfolio to the Middle East portfolio. And apparently, there is local appetite for those clients to be taken over. And that's the way how we manage it.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Okay. Who's next? Omar in the back, if I see you correctly, because it's a bit difficult to -- with all the lights.</p><p>OMAR FALL, ANALYST, BARCLAYS BANK PLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Omar Fall from Barclays. Just on CIB, can you give us even a vague sense of what the equivalent ROE is for the 10% under Basel IV? Just because I'm not sure how meaningful that number is when there is an undisclosed but extremely sizable amount of other RWA inflation going through that business. And as a follow-on to that, what's the plan B in case you don't hit the 10% or whatever the real number is? And how long would we have to wait until you get to that plan B? Is it going to be 2021 as per the target? Or are you likely to be a lot more flexible around what you do with this business? And then just a second question would be -- or third, whatever it is, just on the...</p><p>RUTGER VAN NOUHUIJS: That's a lot of questions.</p><p>OMAR FALL: On the Clearing business, why are you the right owner of that business when it has such a burden from a leverage perspective but makes 2% of group earnings and has no obvious synergy with what you look like?</p><p>RUTGER VAN NOUHUIJS: Yes, okay. Let me start with your last question on the clearing bank. Why is that a good business? Because as I showed you on the slide, and that business is generating a return on equity close to 20%. And as Kees already said in his presentation, if SA-CCR is going to be implemented, and then where we see an uptick of 50 basis points in the leverage ratio, so that is positive. And there are also some synergies between clients because, for example, within trading commodity finance, there are good multiproduct clients where we provide clearing services. So there's actually quite some synergy there. So that's my answer on your Clearing question. Then on the Basel IV question, can you repeat that?</p><p>DIES DONKER: Yes, what's the...</p><p>OMAR FALL: What is the 10% in reality on the Basel IV? And also, what is the plan B for this business if you don't hit 10% or whatever it is on the Basel IV?</p><p>RUTGER VAN NOUHUIJS: Okay. Well, I'll make it easy because I'll leave it to Clifford to talk a bit more. Otherwise, the guy doesn't have any questions. And I promise you, when you drive home tonight, I'll make one commitment to deliver. So there is no plan B. I just deliver.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Who's next? Yes, we've got -- is there a question on that side of the room? Sorry, yes, because we keep walking. Alicia? Then you're next, Marcell.</p><p>ALICIA MARIANNE CHUNG: So just 2 questions for me. Firstly, both ABN and ING in -- at Q3 results talked about seeing some late-cycle behavior in leverage finance and real estate finance. I just wanted to understand a little bit more what exactly are you seeing there? How big is that for you? And what are you doing to constrain lending there? How far would you go in terms of constraining that? And on a similar basis, I mean, that sounds like it's possible that those are maybe the early warning kind of segment where you might start to see late cycle. What other sectors could we be looking out for within CIB and within commercial that might -- where we might start to see some late-cycle behavior as well? And then just to go back on Omar's Basel IV point because I think it is really important, I think it's really good what you're doing in terms of meeting a 10% ROE on Basel III. On my estimates, that would get you to roughly 6% to 7% ROE on a Basel IV basis. So it still is quite far away. So how much -- how long will it take you to get Basel IV-ready? I know you say you are getting Basel IV-ready, but how long will that take you? And what will you be doing to get there?</p><p>RUTGER VAN NOUHUIJS: Yes. Let me start with your last question, and then hand over to Daphne on your question on the sectors and what we see there. How long does it take us to be ready for Basel IV? As I explained in my presentation, the whole portfolio of CIB is churning before 2022. So that allows us to already start progressive repricing as of 2019. And because part of the portfolio will be churning, and that runs longer into the time. So we will be able to look and identify in the entire portfolio where to move best the capital. And that's my answer to your question. So we can -- we already have started today by also identifying clearly with each and every client that enters into the Capital Allocation Committee what is the impact of Basel IV. And some of the situations, we just don't do or we drop. Because if the impact is way too negative, forget about it. So we need to be -- we are very disciplined about that. Now to you, Daphne.</p><p>DAPHNE DE KLUIS: That's actually the same in the commercial bank. We look very much at healthy transactions, and we see the market is, yes, turning again a bit. So it's quite competitive. That starts also in my FR&amp;R heart then because I've seen during other times what can happen. And actually, during a time -- we spend a lot of time with the commercial banking area and, of course, also in other areas to make a better detection system. So we call it detect and act, and that's a way of making sure that we have early warning signs and also discuss these early warning signs with our clients. So that's a way for us to try and take all the market turning again.</p><p>RUTGER VAN NOUHUIJS: And then on the leverage finance question specifically, I refer to Tanja, what she said this morning. We have strict adherence and a cap on that portfolio. And we really adhere to the moderate risk profile, so we're not moving into very covenant-light structures and moderate risk profile.</p><p>DAPHNE DE KLUIS: And the same accounts for real estate, as you've seen in my area.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Marcell?</p><p>MARCELL HOUBEN: One question for Daphne. Can you talk a little about the competitive environment on the Dutch SMEs? Do you see an inflow of new players? Or is it basically the big 3 having an oligopoly position in the market? And how do you -- because you said margins have been relatively stable. How do you expect that to go forward, please?</p><p>DAPHNE DE KLUIS: Yes, yes. We were expecting actually quite some new entrants. And until now, that didn't materialize too much maybe in specific products. So if you look at transaction banking, for example, there we see specific type of players targeting that market. But I think mostly the 3 Dutch banks are still, yes, quite active in the SME market. And your second question on margins. What we've seen over the last couple of years is that it's actually quite stable. And it's also what I expect going forward because now there is a competitive market again. We still keep our margins stable. That is, of course, there's a difference. If you look at the portfolio that -- a legacy portfolio that is longer time there and the new portfolio that you have. But I would say for the coming years, I see that still remaining stable.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Okay. Farqu?</p><p>FARQUHAR CHARLES MURRAY: Just a quick question about both actually on CIB, 2 questions essentially. Firstly, just on the SME file, I mean, obviously, there's penalties and we know what those kind of numbers are. How much administrative cost has been kind of pinned down by that? And what can you do about that once that kind of exercise is finally completed? And secondly, just coming back to leverage on the Basel IV, what's the actual leverage exposure of the CIB business at the moment? And you've given us a bit of outlook about how RWA will develop. I just wonder what the leverage measure might develop in the future.</p><p>RUTGER VAN NOUHUIJS: Okay, yes. I'll leave that question to Clifford. He's already nodding, so that's good news. On the derivative file, we've been taking a lot of provisions already in the past, as you can attract the annual reports and the quarterly reports. For example, in the first 6 months, we took EUR 37 million in additional provisioning there. And we expect to close it all Q1 of this for 2019, and that's where I'd like to leave it.</p><p>FARQUHAR CHARLES MURRAY: Just to come back, my question was actually on the administrative costs, pinned down by that because obviously, there's the kind of penalty component that actually presume either a lot of people have to deal with the actual files. How much of that's pinned down?</p><p>RUTGER VAN NOUHUIJS: That's all taken care of. That's in -- already in our...</p><p>FARQUHAR CHARLES MURRAY: It's in the provision?</p><p>RUTGER VAN NOUHUIJS: Yes, yes, yes.</p><p>DIES DONKER: And it's roughly...</p><p>RUTGER VAN NOUHUIJS: Don't expect there.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Yes. It's roughly EUR 250 million or so of the provisions taken so far for project costs. So that covers, I think, what you were aiming at. Jose?</p><p>JOSEMA COLL: Jos\u00e9 Coll from Santander. My question is on CIB. You're reducing risk-weighted assets, and that you're thinking the 10% ROE under Basel III and taking into account what could happen under Basel IV. But you're going to churn your whole portfolio by 2022 even before right when Basel IV is going to start. So do you have any clue as to what pricing is going to look like for the DCF specialized lending? Because there's high risk-weighted asset inflation coming that way, so maybe you are abandoning clients that are going to be later profitable for others to pick up instead of just going along with them for now until you see some -- you have more clues on what price is going to look like going forward.</p><p>RUTGER VAN NOUHUIJS: Yes, I find it really difficult to look at pricing levels 4 years from now. What I can say is that, today, we are competitive. Our competitors are the Dutch bank and the French banks, and they all are in a level playing field as we are. So I find it hard to say where it's moving. What I can tell you -- because I see many clients and also big trading commodity clients, like I mentioned, and they recognize that it will be changing and that they need to pay high prices, for example, for the standby revolving credit facilities. So that is -- and they are already preempting on that. And that's not because we are the only one saying that. Our colleague competitors are also giving those signals.</p><p>JOSEMA COLL: So sorry, just a quick follow-up. So you're not afraid that you are -- by prioritizing ROE today, you're not giving away future business after Basel IV repricing?</p><p>RUTGER VAN NOUHUIJS: No, no.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Okay. Robin?</p><p>ROBIN VAN DEN BROEK: Yes. Actually, in connection to that question, I was wondering that, I think, on the Basel III, you basically have a competitive advantage in your level playing field, and that's probably why most the French banks and you guys are active in that field. But due to Basel IV, that level playing field might change a little bit. So in connection to that question, aren't you afraid that with this focus on ROE, there might be some competition coming in basically to try to push you out basically?</p><p>RUTGER VAN NOUHUIJS: Not that afraid because what we are doing with the portfolio is to push out the single-product, non-accretive clients and focus on that example that I gave, multi-product, advisory, cash management, debt capital markets. So there's unique long-term relationships that we have with these type of clients. And these clients show that you are able to do -- generate well above the 10% return. And that's where we're moving the entire portfolio, too.</p><p>ROBIN VAN DEN BROEK: And maybe as a follow-up. Can you indicate on your book where Basel IV basically is in a more international perspective, where you are suffering from the RWA inflation and where your peers are not, so where repricing will be quite more challenging basically?</p><p>RUTGER VAN NOUHUIJS: Yes, we have not provided details, but I can tell you, like I already showed on my slide, is that, particularly in asset base financing in these global sectors, that scenario where we are taking capital out for the simple reason that we expect those type of structures being hit hard in Basel IV. And that's the reason why we announced to take capital out of the energy offshore portfolio deep sea supply, but also part of the shipping portfolio.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Okay. Time for 1 or 2 quick ones.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Yes. Mine is a very quick one. You already indicated that 98% of your Dubai diamond clients have prepayment -- a repayment agreement. That should go quick because you said that a lot of local banks have agreed to take over that lending. So should we see that already fourth quarter or first quarter of next year?</p><p>RUTGER VAN NOUHUIJS: Listen, it's -- there are shorter repayments, and there are longer repayment schedule. So it's a mix. So you will see that coming down in the next 2 to 3 years.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Final question, anybody? Is it Omar in the back?</p><p>OMAR FALL: Yes, sorry. Just one more question. At the Q2 results, when you presented the CIB reduction refocusing, you stated that the EUR 5 billion was a net number. What is the gross value of the reduction within the plan?</p><p>RUTGER VAN NOUHUIJS: It's higher than EUR 5 billion. Let me not disclose the exact number. Because, basically, we like to also have some capital into the well-performing Northwestern European businesses and with the multi-product clients. So it's more than EUR 5 billion we're taking out. Let me not disclose the exact number.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Okay. With that, I would like to suggest a very short break of about 15 minutes, and then we'll come back with Clifford Abrahams, our CFO. Thanks.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>CLIFFORD J. ABRAHAMS: It's good to kick off the much-anticipated final presentation of the day. I'm Clifford Abrahams, CFO, and I know you'll be interested in this final session, which focuses on the numbers. You've all waited all day. I will also try and pick up some of the questions we had during the course of the day. It's great to be here in my hometown. I've worked here in London for many years at Morgan Stanley, and then Aviva. And after that, I moved to the Netherlands as CFO of DeltaLloyd, the insurer, and then ABN AMRO last year. Over the past year at ABN AMRO, I've been impressed by the people, by the business and the opportunity.</p><p>So recapping now on strategy. Kees talked this morning about how we've delivered on our promises at IPO. He set out our purpose and priorities banking for better. You've heard also from the executive committee on how they're driving the business. And throughout the day, we've run through the 3 pillars and show how these are being embedded in the business. We're convinced that sustainability is a tangible business opportunity. Daphne described the opportunity she sees in the Commercial Bank. Pieter set out the client demand for sustainable investments. Christian and Frans described how our focus on customer experience improves retention, strengthens cross-sells and delivers lower costs through digital. Future-proof bank is about low cost, but also the capital-efficient model that Rutger is implementing in CIB. We're all convinced that our focus on the 3 pillars will create long-term value for our clients, for our staff, for society and investors.</p><p>So I'd now like to focus on you, our shareholders. We want to drive value for you through our focus on capital generation and return. Kees highlighted our track record at IPO and how we're delivering on our targets. You can see here on the right that since IPO, we've delivered over 11% per annum in capital generation through our book value growth in dividends. This reflects our commitment to the value drivers set out on the left. We want to deliver reliable earnings, show disciplined cost management, maintain moderate risk profile, drive robust ROE with controlled RWAs, ensuring strong capital generation. This, together with a strong and resilient capital position, enables attractive dividends to shareholders.</p><p>So I'll first talk you through our P&amp;L, how we drive reliable earnings and control our costs; and after that, our approach to capital management, how we translate earnings into capital, and then cash for shareholders. So starting with income. On this slide, you see 3 charts regarding net interest income, namely client lending, net interest income and deposit margins on the right. We've delivered good growth in NII in recent years through volume growth and resilient margins. Margins have been strong in margins as we've maintained our pricing discipline through an upswing in the Dutch housing market. And margins have been resilient on deposits as we've steadily reduced our deposit rates in the face of declining rates. These deposit rates are now around 3 basis points, so this process has now run its course. So going forward, we expect to face headwinds on margins from here. So that's challenges on mortgages, reflecting the competition that Frans discussed and pressure on deposit margins, reflecting low market rates.</p><p>We've set out on the right our base view of deposit margins and 2 scenarios. As you can see, we expect some modest further deposit margin pressure in our base scenario with a range around that geared to the time and pace of interest rate rises in Europe.</p><p>Given this margin pressure, we're focused on maintaining pricing discipline in mortgages, selectively growing in profitable segments like consumer lending that Frans set out earlier, as well as originate to distribute to generate fees across the bank. A number of colleagues talked about that earlier today. So consequently, we expect our NII to be modestly lower short term, but pick up after that as rates and volumes normalize. Pressure on NII means we are, of course, focused on fee income, which I've set out on the next slide.</p><p>You can see here on the left that our reported fees have reduced in recent years, reflecting disposals. But our underlying fees have, in fact, been quite resilient. As you've heard, each of our businesses are working hard to grow fee income from here. So you'll recall Frans talked about opportunities from his focus in insurance and investment. In CIB, our transformed business model will in time deliver a less capital-intensive business model and fees for more distribution. And Pieter and Daphne highlighted the opportunities they see in fees.</p><p>So at this point, I'll address the fake news of our fee prospects over time. So we expect in the short-term fees to be fairly flat. And in particular, as Rutger indicated, we're shrinking the corporate bank, which is a material fee contributor. So we're cautious in the short term. But over time, we expect the growth initiatives that the team had talked about to pick up and deliver low single-digit growth in fee income.</p><p>So there's a short-term, long-term time frame to consider. On the right, we've set out other income. So other income has been elevated in recent years, reflecting disposals and private equity gains. Going forward, we expect other income to remain broadly in line with our guidance of EUR 125 million per quarter. So we recognize the pressure on income growth, so we need to stay very focused on costs, which I've set out on the next slide.</p><p>As you've heard today, we've made good progress in our current cost programs. You can see here on the left we've delivered already 2/3 or over EUR 0.6 billion of cost savings from the programs that we announced in 2016. And you can see on the right, these cost savings have enabled us to maintain underlying costs at a little over EUR 5 billion in recent years. So we're well on track to reach our 2020 cost ambition, including the EUR 80 million of additional cost savings in the corporate bank, which we announced in Q2.</p><p>So turning to cost income ratio. We're also very much on track on our cost income ratio target of 56% to 58% in 2020. You've heard today from Kees and Christian our target beyond 2020 to deliver less than 55% cost income ratio in 2022. We need to be realistic about the headwinds to cost income ratio, which I've set out top right, including the significant costs of regulatory change. All banks need to address these headwinds. We've been clear with you on our current initiatives to deliver the 56% to 58% by 2020 and the related cost base of around EUR 5 billion per annum. We also want to be clear on the further measures we will implement to deliver in 2022, less than 55% cost income ratio, whilst reflecting the headwinds.</p><p>These further measures include improved IT cost efficiency through demand, productivity and supply levers, as Christian explained, as well as further product rationalization and process improvement across business lines and support functions, which the team discussed throughout the day. Christian also explained how these measures will support income over time. Now these are all long-term programs, so we need to plan and get on with these now as our current programs are landing and to ensure it's all affordable within our cost income ratio targets.</p><p>So I've explained how we deliver reliable earnings and how we manage our costs and our progress on our targets. I'll now set out how we translate reliable earnings into capital generation and then cash. So I've set out here, how we think about capital and cash dividends, which drives value for shareholders. Up top, I show the 3 key drivers, so robust ROE, well-controlled RWAs and strong capital generation. We're focused on managing each of these carefully, so we can deliver on our commitment of strong cash returns to you in dividends.</p><p>So first, we aim to deliver a robust ROE, the source of capital generation, and this is equivalent to 200 basis points of CET1 capital generation per annum. We focus strictly on our RWAs to ensure our capital requirements remain well controlled. We have and will maintain a strong and resilient capital position under the various regimes, so that's Basel III, Basel IV, the new regime and leverage. And so by doing this, we ensure that our capital generation is available largely for distribution to shareholders. In line with our dividend policy, we will distribute the surplus to you in cash dividends.</p><p>So our overall position is summarized here at the bottom. We're well capitalized on the Basel III and IV, but leverage-constrained in the short term. So while we don't have a material surplus of capital today, our strong capital generation is largely available to distribute to investors as cash dividends over time.</p><p>So I'll now talk through each of the components set out here and noted by the sort of orange boxes as we go through so we're all completely clear. So first, the first driver, our robust ROE. So we're committed to delivering on our ROE target of 10% to 13% per annum. As I mentioned, this generates 200 basis points of capital per annum. You can see on the left that we've consistently delivered this as a group since IPO. But not all businesses are delivering, and Rutger described the necessary measures we're ensuring in CIB to ensure that business delivers, too. So all our businesses are extremely focused on ROE, and they know and we know that each of the businesses needs to deliver under Basel III and, in due course, Basel IV.</p><p>So I'll spend a moment now to talk about CIB, Basel III and Basel IV. So we had a clear plan to deliver over 10% ROE under Basel III in which we set out in August this year and Rutger described in detail.</p><p>At the half year, we reported ROE of around 6% and now for the 3 quarters around 9%. And that benefited from private equity gains, but also we're still challenged with high impairments. So normalized, we're actually not far short of 10% already. And the specific levers we identified at the half year will deliver that over 10% ROE under Basel III. Those levers are costs and reducing capital and moving it from high return -- from low return under Basel III to high return under Basel III.</p><p>The further measures that Rutger identified regarding originated distribute are those levers that will take us to accept returns under Basel IV. So I'll talk a little bit more about this later, but the numbers that Alicia mentioned earlier, 6% or 7% under Basel IV, approximately right. What will lift us above 10% over time under Basel IV are the mitigations and the new business model that Rutger described and that I'll go on to describe in a more detailed level later.</p><p>Finally, pricing will enable us to deliver that in addition. So we have a clear plan to deliver over 10% in a relatively short term under Basel III, and we'll give that business time to deliver under Basel IV, reflecting that we have up to 9 years transition for Basel IV.</p><p>So moving now to RWAs. So I've dealt with ROE, now we're talking about RWAs. So RWAs drive our capital requirements. I've set out here on the left our track record on Basel III RWAs and on the right, how this relates to Basel IV. We had many questions on this at the Q3, so I'll take some time to make sure we're all clear. Basel IV RWA inflation increased during 2018. But going forward, we expect that inflation to stabilize and then reduce, and I'll explain why we believe this is the case now.</p><p>So talking to Basel III on the left. So you can see, our Basel III RWAs have been relatively stable in recent years. So while we see quarterly volatility, the overall picture is improving credit quality, offset by growth in corporate lending volume. Going forward, short term, we expect roughly stable underlying Basel III RWAs as growth in the commercial bank is offset by a reduction in the corporate bank, with moderate growth after that. When we think of underlying Basel III RWAs, as before the effects of TRIM, model changes, data, credit quality changes, all of which do not flow through to Basel IV to underlying reflects business volumes. Kees also mentioned appetite for bolt-on M&amp;A, which may impact these numbers, but won't change the underlying picture. So we expect underlying Basel III RWAs roughly constant.</p><p>So turning to the right on the Basel IV. At year-end last year, we said that our Basel IV RWAs were around 35% higher than Basel III. In fact, that figure has increased now to around 43% at Q3, reflecting some updates to our Basel IV calculations and relative growth in corporate lending since year-end 2017. And at the same time, Basel III, RWAs reduced, reflecting data and credit quality improvements, which don't flow through to Basel IV. So our Basel IV calculations represent estimates, good faith estimates based on our current view of the rules. We shouldn't over analyze these or over interpret them. This is our best view. We will know for sure in 2022 and beyond.</p><p>So currently, we have 43% RWA inflation, which translates today as a Basel IV CET1 ratio of around 13%, and that's before mitigations, which I'll talk about later. So we need to recognize that Basel IV is a new framework, the rules are not clear yet, and we're all learning to work with it. Nonetheless, going forward, we expect a number of factors to lower Basel IV RWA inflation and those are: our commitment to reduce the corporate bank, which is our most capital-intensive business; the effective TRIM and model changes, which will increase our Basel III RWAs; and in particular, our Basel IV mitigations.</p><p>So on the next slide, I'll talk about our approach to ensuring the bank is well-placed for Basel IV. So you see here a rather detailed slide which sets out the work and should demonstrate that we're getting ready for Basel IV now. So our work is focused on a number of themes. Firstly, which I've said at the top, mitigation of RWA inflation. Secondly, ensuring that we reduce our capital-intensive activities to lower RWAs under both Basel III and Basel IV. Thirdly, developing new business models to enhance ROE. And lastly, pricing to deliver targeted returns of 10% to 13% on Basel IV capital requirements after mitigations and over time.</p><p>So first addressing mitigations. So what are mitigations? So we think of mitigations as actions or plans that reduce Basel IV RWAs on the basis of our current business, so our static balance sheet. Our work today has identified initiatives, enabled us to mitigate a total of around 1/5 of the 43% Basel IV impact, bringing us to a Basel IV CET1 ratio of above 13.5% today. So above 13.5%, including those mitigations. We can already implement some of these initiatives, while others are more strategic or will impact our clients, so we want to take our time. But in particular, ensure that we can implement them ahead of the phase in the Basel IV or indeed, even later. The key is that we are confident we can do them.</p><p>I've set out examples above of our Basel III mitigations here at the top. We plan to enhance our data quality to source the specific inputs for Basel IV rather than rely on prudent default data. We don't all have the data all ready for Basel IV because it's a new set of rules. We'll work with our clients on external ratings, which give lower risk rates than our internal ratings, so Basel IV gives an incentive to get external ratings for both banks and issuers.</p><p>We'll also rationalize our products and improve our collateral, tailored to the Basel IV rules. These initiatives are not theoretical ideas but specific initiatives with actual RWA benefits our teams are working on now. But our Basel IV response is not just about mitigations, Rutger explained our approach to reduce CIB RWAs and transform the business model.</p><p>We also see scope to reprice to reflect Basel IV capital requirements now and as we get closer to the phase-in period. So of course, we're staying close to the rules and the regulatory process to address remaining uncertainty to the -- in the regulations. So all in all, we're confident we are on top of our planning and taking the right actions around Basel IV.</p><p>So turning now to our capital position. We've set out our target capital range in terms of Basel III, the current regime, but reflecting our view of the transition to Basel IV. We have updated our target capital range here on the left, Kees mentioned that this morning. As you can see, we expect to maintain our target capital range of 17.5% to 18.5% also for 2019, including Basel IV implementation buffer and subject to SREP. We're currently well-placed in that range of 18.6%, just above this. This position and this buffer enables us to meet the fully loaded Basel IV target early in the phase-in. So we are constrained by the output floor, so the impact of Basel IV on us will actually be at the back end of the phase-in period, so we think we're being prudent, rightly so.</p><p>We explain on the right that we estimate our RWA inflation to increase from 35% to 43%, but with the effect of mitigations offsetting this, we're comfortable maintaining our current target range. So I want to emphasize that these mitigations are before the benefits of the CIB refocus. So our Basel III target range of 17.5% to 18.5% is a simple metric, but it's not a mechanical calculation. So it reflects our judgment around Basel IV rules, timing of the phase-in, confidence in mitigations and timing, TRIM and model changes. And we'll continue to keep this under review as regulations in our business develops, and we'll update you on this annually or in the event of material changes.</p><p>Next, I'll show how we're managing our capital position. I mentioned earlier, we need to manage our capital position with respect to Basel III, Basel IV and leverage. I've set out here our position under the various regimes. And at 18.3%, we're well-placed under Basel III, given the Basel IV buffer, and Tanja explained that our Basel III capital position is resilient under stress. We're also well positioned under Basel IV at around 13% before mitigations and over 13.5% now after mitigations.</p><p>I mentioned earlier the trends in RWAs. We need to be mindful of SREP, provision reviews, industry-wide MPA guidance, which may impact capital, and which Tanja described, and those impacts may impact all 3 of the capital regimes. And in that context, our leverage ratio is currently constraining. Our regulator currently looks for us to maintain at least 4%. And so with 4.1%, we have only limited headroom in the short term. So all in all, we're well positioned for Basel III and Basel IV with leverage currently constraining.</p><p>So what's the outlook for leverage? So you can see on the left that our leverage ratio is currently one of the very lowest among European banks. Kees mentioned we expect our client lending and exposure to be roughly stable short term and grow modestly thereafter, and those drivers will flow through to the exposure measure under the leverage ratio. But we expect 2 developments, set out on the right, to address our constraining leverage over time: to exploring a legal merger of our main bank and holding company to take place during 2019, and this would release around 20 basis points of leverage ratio. The new SA-CCR rules, which we talked about earlier, will remove the constraining effect of the leverage ratio by 2021. And if we can adopt SA-CCR early, we'll have more flexibility on the legal merger. So while leverage ratio currently constrains our capital position and so limits additional dividend payout in the short term, we expect this no longer to be the case in the future.</p><p>So finally, turning to dividend. You can see on the left, we have a good track record of increasing our dividend since IPO. At full year '17, we refreshed our dividend policy to 50% of sustainable profit plus additional distributions. As Kees highlighted, our preference is for additional distributions in cash dividends and at least short term not in buybacks. This way we have more control over the timing. I want to be clear that we will be prudent in our additional dividend payouts, and that prudence reflects: regulatory developments; modest increases in capital requirements, for example, bolt-on acquisitions and in the longer term, balance sheet growth; possible increases in credit risk rates as we pass the best point of the credit cycle. We are ABN AMRO, you'd expect us to be prudent. But we've made good progress on capital and therefore, we've raised the dividend accrual to 60% of our year-to-date profit to provide for dividend flexibility this year. We'll take a final decision with our full year results. Beyond 2018, we are well-placed to consider additional dividend payouts on top of our 50% sustainable profit.</p><p>So in conclusion, at the start of the presentation I highlighted our approach to value creation, how we're committed to delivering on our targets. I explained how we deliver reliable earnings, and that we can continue to deliver, despite short-term headline -- headwinds from low rates. We're well on track with our cost/income ratio target of 2020 and committed to deliver on a more ambitious target for the cost/income ratio for 2022. Tanja explained that we have and will maintain a moderate risk profile.</p><p>I've run through our clear framework for capital and dividend, robust ROE, controlled RWAs and strong capital position. We are preparing well for Basel IV. And with mitigations, we're already above 13.5%, our target for early in the phase-in period. We're also addressing our leverage ratio constraint. And so whilst maintaining our reputation for prudence, we are committed to delivering attractive cash returns to you, our shareholders.</p><p>Thank you for your attention. I'll be pleased take your questions.</p><p>DIES DONKER: There's a lot of hands.</p><p>CLIFFORD J. ABRAHAMS: Put them in. Okay, very good.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Here we go. Who gets -- well, let's -- we'll start here on this side and we'll slowly work that way. Vardhman?</p><p>VARDHMAN JAIN, BANKS ANALYST, MACQUARIE RESEARCH: Firstly, just on the phasing of the 20%. I mean your 20% mitigation factor you're kind of talking to, is there any kind of a particular time frame in terms of how you might -- you're obviously starting now, but should we think of that linearly through the phasing period as kind of reasonable assumption? And then, secondly, just on the legal entity merger, how -- I mean, presumably, this is part of a dialogue with the regulator already, I presume is how advanced and confident are you about achieving that 20 bps?</p><p>CLIFFORD J. ABRAHAMS: Yes. Okay. So on the mitigations, so Basel IV is not in yet, we just know the rules, right? We think we do. We want to be fully loaded compliant early in the phase-in, so that means we need to have a high degree of confidence that mitigations will land early in the phase in. So clearly, if we've done them now, that gives us a high degree of confidence, right? But if we have very clear plans that we're convinced we can achieve or in time we feel we have, call it, a whole bucket of mitigations and we can probability weight it, for example, that gives us confidence around our ability to target early in the phase in. And that's how we're thinking about it, so we're not going to wait for mitigations. We know we can do those. We plan them. We'll plan them over time, and we'll ensure that we can confidently deliver on our target early in the phase in. I think on the legal merger, I think you'd expect us to have done our homework before we've talked about legal merger today. We've said exploring legal merger, so it's a complex thing. And in particular, it's not just the local regulators, regulators around the world that we need to work through as well as other stakeholders. So we're exploring it seriously or we wouldn't have talked about it, but we have some work to do through 2019 to deliver it.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Okay.</p><p>CLIFFORD J. ABRAHAMS: Forest of hands.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Shall we sort of like -- yes, Benoit? And then we'll move the mic, you can move it to Jos\u00e9 and then we'll go over the back.</p><p>CLIFFORD J. ABRAHAMS: We're going to go this way, okay.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Yes. We'll get there.</p><p>CLIFFORD J. ABRAHAMS: Yes.</p><p>BENOIT PETRARQUE: On the Basel IV, can we agree that the kind of 42% risk-related inflation is absolute the worst case you might get? And if I look -- I mean, there's a lot of conservatism from the beginning of the presentation to the end. And for example, I mean, LTVs, you take origination, there will be a lot of amortization of high LTVs going forward. We know that the new production is done at low LTVs. So could you talk about how much impact comes from mortgages? Are you hopeful for deal at European level that actually they won't take the worst case LTV origination, but might take into account indexed valuations? Just to know a bit more about -- beyond a little bit the 20% because it feels that there's more room for...</p><p>CLIFFORD J. ABRAHAMS: Well, I think that -- well, we can't agree that the 43% is the worst case. No, we can't agree with that. So our 43%, we think, is a reasonable estimate. There are risks and opportunities, and we can run through those, but we see a range around it. We're confident enough in our assumptions to give an indication, and we think giving a range is not helpful for Basel IV. And we know that other banks, very few other banks even talk about it. In fact, none outside Benelux. I think the -- in terms of our -- we've been clear the 43% is on a static balance sheet. So I strongly believe the right way to talk about this is the way we have, which is mitigations based on the current static balance sheet, so you're clear on that, and changes to the business model or changes to that static balance sheet, which we flagged in relation to CIB and which you can look at the effect of both. There'll be a little bit of overlap, but fundamentally we think that's the right way to talk about it. And to talk about it all together is confusing. So I think in due time as we get more confident in mitigations, we might bake them into our RWA estimate. If we've actually done them now, then they'll flow through to the estimate. So that's the right way to think about it. I don't think -- the fact that no one's talking about Basel IV other than a few banks, I think that should give you a lot of confidence that it's not an issue. We think it is an issue and we've been open about how we're thinking about it.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Yes, Jose? Yes.</p><p>CLIFFORD J. ABRAHAMS: No, we are going that way.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Oh, go on. Go on. Yes.</p><p>JOSEMA COLL: So you said that after mitigations that you expect to have already done before the phase-in or about the beginning of the phase-in period. For Basel IV, you'd be at -- already at 13.5% fully loaded, Basel IV impact all included. So is it fair to assume that going forward, barring any private equity tuck-in acquisitions, that you're going to distribute via dividends all the excess capital that you generate?</p><p>CLIFFORD J. ABRAHAMS: Yes. Well, I think Kees talked about this earlier. So if we have excess capital that we don't need, we will distribute that to shareholders. But it won't be a mechanical look back, I mean, as Kees -- we're 18.6% today, not 18.5%, and I highlighted some of the themes we'll be thinking about. If we're at the -- if we think credit rates are going to go up or we know their regulatory changes, including were not going to distribute and then go below our range, we've set out our range, we want to operate in that range, and that's how we'll manage it. I think I would take comfort from our commitment to capital generation and our commitment to return rather than a sort of mechanical mathematical approach in how we think about dividend payouts, and we'll take it year by year.</p><p>RAUL SINHA, ANALYST, JP MORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Raul Sinha from JPMorgan. If I can ask, please just on the same theme. Can I just confirm firstly that the timeline for the consideration of additional distributions is annual related to the SREP process? So the next logical time frame for considering additional distributions is going to be full year results 2019, which implies early 2020 is when we should think about additional distributions?</p><p>CLIFFORD J. ABRAHAMS: I think things are changing year-on-year in terms of the rules. I think we've been clear this year. So this year, the focus is dividend payout, we'll make a decision in February regarding that. We've not ruled anything out, I think Kees talked about that early today. We haven't ruled anything out between year-end points. I think while we have a preference for dividend, the natural time to do it is the year-end, but we're reserving our position to consider other means, other times subject to the principles we talked about.</p><p>RAUL SINHA: That's very clear. The second one is on the process of actually returning capital. Is it fair to think that a normal buyback doesn't make sense for ABN AMRO given your free float is obviously lower and a targeted buyback which is linked to the governments take placing makes much more sense and so that's the sort of preferred way?</p><p>CLIFFORD J. ABRAHAMS: So this is the buyback that we've said we'd prefer not to do. It's that buyback?</p><p>RAUL SINHA: Yes. That's the one.</p><p>CLIFFORD J. ABRAHAMS: Okay. I think Kees talked about it, I won't add to Kees' comments earlier.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Pawel? Here, on the front.</p><p>PAWEL DZIEDZIC: Yes. A quick follow-up on the leverage. So if you execute legal merger, it will get you to a point where leverage will no longer be a constraint, and that positions you very well for distribution from 2019 forward. If, for any reason, that doesn't happen, are there any other measures you can optimize or change leverage ratio that you're thinking about right now?</p><p>CLIFFORD J. ABRAHAMS: Yes. I think we're managing leverage quite tightly. You can see it 4.1%, it's tight. I think as we, frankly, accumulate earnings, that helps. And I think you're thinking of dividends, so there's a sort of one-for-one around that. So that's one way. The other way is to manage the balance sheet. I think we've talked about managing -- Rutger talked about that in particular in our confidence in the clearing business, but also our desire to see CIB come down in size. So I'd work that through. But Kees talked about our overall balance sheet, and we don't expect -- we expect to be fairly stable in the short term, reflecting a differential growth among the businesses.</p><p>PAWEL DZIEDZIC: Okay. Maybe just a quick follow-up. You mentioned that balance sheet will be stable or loans will be stable, is that the case also for exposure?</p><p>CLIFFORD J. ABRAHAMS: Yes. I mean, exposure -- and that got some attention after Q3. There's some volatility in exposure and particularly, we see it through the clearing business which is linked to sometimes volatile markets. So it will go up and down, but I don't see the drivers of exposure and on balance sheet lending as fundamentally different.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Okay. Bart?</p><p>BART JOORIS: Bart Jooris, Degroof Petercam. You talked about the P&amp;L but you basically stopped on costs and underneath it there are still 2 moving points that is your impairments. Are you expecting them to stay below through the cycle over the whole period? And then, secondly, there is a tax decrease plan in the Netherlands, what's the impact of that?</p><p>CLIFFORD J. ABRAHAMS: Yes. I think on impairment -- I think Tanja talked about impairments, I don't know where she is -- at the back. I've gotten -- I didn't want to repeat what she said, frankly, she talked about 2019 being below the cycle and, we, like you, don't have a crystal ball beyond 2019. I think on taxes, you'll be aware there's some general reductions anticipated in the Netherlands but also some bank-specific factors going on, which is likely to mitigate or neutralize all that benefit.</p><p>BART JOORIS: And then the second question, if I may. How concerned are you really about a possible SREP increase and the new NPE rules, given your excellent position in NPEs, and also your good performance in the stress test?</p><p>CLIFFORD J. ABRAHAMS: Yes. Look, I think Kees talked about -- I mean we are prudent bunch of people, that's how we run the bank. We don't know what's in our SREP, so we felt it was important to highlight that as a factor between now and year-end. I do think NPE guidance is a real issue, not because we have a lot of NPEs but because there's regulatory change going on.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Okay. We'll go to the back because -- is it Nick?</p><p>STEFAN ROSENOV NEDIALKOV, DIRECTOR, CITIGROUP INC, RESEARCH DIVISION: No. Stefan from Citigroup.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Sorry, Stefan. Sorry.</p><p>STEFAN ROSENOV NEDIALKOV: Stefan from Citi. Two questions on my end. In terms of the leverage ratio constraint, and it's something that I've always wanted to ask you, Clifford. Why did it constraint? You're at 4.1%, you don't have that much excess capital, existing excess capital. So you can go to a 100% payout ratio. You're not growing that much, 0% growth through 2020, 2% thereafter. So you're throwing off capital, you don't need to be paying out the existing excess capital because you're insuring against future Basel IV developments, maybe you find some more data inconsistencies, Basel IV guidance may go up again, et cetera. But you can potentially go to the payout of 70%, 80%, 90%. So what is driving that conservatism? Why do you not give the gift to investors today of saying we'll go to 70% or 80%?</p><p>CLIFFORD J. ABRAHAMS: Yes. Well, we're a bank, right, so we need to be prudent. We're rightly regulated given the history over the last 10, 15 years. 4.1% is okay, but it's -- I can think of many factors that would drive that lower. So if the euro -- if the dollar strengthens, that leverage ratio will go down. Or if there are -- hits to capital, that will affect all those ratios. So I'm not unduly concerned about the leverage ratio, but there's not a lot of headroom there. And we don't want to push all the metrics to their extreme because you lose -- you get into the wrong dialogue with the regulator. What we -- the reason we want to run the balance sheet in a prudent way, aside from being the right way to run a bank, is it means you can have sensible conversations with the regulator about the medium term and not in the short term, why your ratio is not good enough. So yes, you're probably more relaxed about it than I am. I'd like to see that -- I'd like to see that leverage ratio consistently at 4% and not be concerned about what Trump says or what China is doing because the exchange rate is moving around.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Is there another question in the back? If not -- yes, Albert just got the mic. Yes?</p><p>ALBERT PLOEGH: Yes. A few questions as well. First of all, on the NHG or the government guaranteed mortgages. Is it basically in a binary kind of discussions that will be yes or no or is there some middle ground outcome as well -- possible. Of course, you've probably seen my question coming, if it will be no, what would be the implication on that 35...</p><p>CLIFFORD J. ABRAHAMS: Yes. I think you should speak to Benoit. He's probably more relaxed about NHG. So that's not in our estimate because we feel that we get the benefit of the sovereign guarantee and that should -- in a Basel III, that should flow through to Basel IV. So I think our view is that, that -- it's more of a local matter because it's a local guarantee and the intention of that guarantee is that -- it is a sovereign guarantee. But as the rules are set out, it's not completely clear. And currently, we've not baked it into our assumption. And the way we think about it into our capital planning is that we aim to be fully loaded compliant early in the phase-in. And if there is some screw up around NHG, then we still have the phase-in period to get to where -- the position we need to be, not because we think that's going to happen but we don't then have a sort of gun to our head. At the end of the period, we've failed to get there and we're embarrassed and we lose control of the dividend. So that's how we're thinking about those sorts of risks.</p><p>ALBERT PLOEGH: And maybe one small question on the countercyclical buffer. I mean, there's an earlier question raised as well on the Dutch mortgage market, the overrating. Yes, did you maybe expect that Dutch Central Bank could impose a higher countercyclical buffer or is that...</p><p>CLIFFORD J. ABRAHAMS: I don't know. It's speculative. You have your views, I mean, we think the current 13.5% is quite full -- we talked about it over dinner -- compared to other banks around Europe. But equally, regulators are looking at all the banks at this point in the cycle, frankly, in the same way you guys are, and thinking, hmmm, ROEs are good, capital is good, shouldn't we expect more cap return? And that may affect their thinking around required buffers.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Okay. I think, next -- first, we'll go to Omar and then we'll go here.</p><p>OMAR FALL: Sorry, just on the merger of the holdco and the bank. Just to understand, so it's excess 81 above requirements at the bank that currently don't count at consolidated level. Does that mean that the 81 shortfall of 60 or 70 bps that you currently have as an add-on to the MDA trigger, does that go away as part of this merger? And then the other question, and sorry if I missed this, are there any setup costs associated with this that we need to be aware of for next year potentially?</p><p>CLIFFORD J. ABRAHAMS: Yes. So the short answer is yes to the first part of your question. And the setup costs, I think they're not material to the group. It's a -- it would be a meaningful kind of legal regulatory activity, but not material to a group of our size. We put -- as you know, I think, we put a presentation out on the web at the end of last year when the [ABN] Q&amp;A came in, and that sets things out in quite a lot of detail based on the Q3 balance sheet last year. So you can work through the calculations there.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Robin?</p><p>ROBIN VAN DEN BROEK: And still, the setup cost is?</p><p>DIES DONKER: Sorry?</p><p>CLIFFORD J. ABRAHAMS: I think they're modest. I said they're modest. I mean...</p><p>ROBIN VAN DEN BROEK: Modest, ah, sorry.</p><p>CLIFFORD J. ABRAHAMS: Yes, they're not material to the group. It's a legal -- it's a sort of legal regulatory thing.</p><p>ROBIN VAN DEN BROEK: I wanted to talk a little bit more about originate to distribute, I mean...</p><p>CLIFFORD J. ABRAHAMS: Sorry.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Yes. Sorry...</p><p>ROBIN VAN DEN BROEK: I wanted to talk a little bit more about the originate to distribute model because I think Matthias pointed out correctly that your mortgage margin imbalance is higher compared to Europe. I guess originate to distribute would open the market up to more players. Can you talk a little bit about how fees would outweigh maybe margin detriments in that part of the book? I mean, we haven't heard any details about your thinking there, which will be helpful. And the second question is, sorry to come back on capital return, but ASR, who you are probably very familiar with. In the sell-down process of the states, they indicated quite clearly that they can't do more capital return on the capital they generate in a certain year. Is that, for you, also a way of thinking that if you want to participate in the state sell-down, you basically can't set your payout ratio too high because that would limit your participation basically? If you set it at 80%, you only have 20% of capital generation to put in the share buyback.</p><p>CLIFFORD J. ABRAHAMS: Right. Okay. So on mortgages, I mean our mortgage book is $150 billion on balance sheet and we earn a return on that capital. I think Frans talked about our initial thinking in terms of size. I think we're hopeful that, that will go up. I think, as CFO, I feel that's a good thing to do. It's the right thing for clients and distribution. I think it will -- we'll earn a margin on it so it will help absorb overheads. But we're not going to make a huge amount of money on it, at least in the short term in terms of materiality to the group P&amp;L. But it's -- I think it's the right thing to do for the business, particularly at this point of the cycle. And it's -- I see it as an attractive asset management-type business, so high ROE but very low capital because it's effectively a margin business.</p><p>ROBIN VAN DEN BROEK: Yes. But also, if insurance companies would get less appetite in the market, they can still originate to distribute as well, they can still open up the market and basically kill your margin.</p><p>CLIFFORD J. ABRAHAMS: Yes, but they are doing that. They are doing that, not killing our margin. But they are -- the insurers, a number of them are full up and they're effectively running the mortgage business as an asset management business, and we can do that. But we have, frankly, we feel we have better platform in terms of processing, we have better brands, so we feel we can participate in that business and that's the opportunity to look for.</p><p>ROBIN VAN DEN BROEK: But thus far, the insurance companies have not reallocated it basically to external -- it's more putting it on the insurance balance sheet, they haven't...</p><p>CLIFFORD J. ABRAHAMS: I'm not sure that's the case, but turning now -- we can talk about this afterwards. On the payout, is this sort of a -- I don't know how to answer that question because we had it earlier, is sort of what are you going to do -- how are you going to pay out more than 100% of your earnings, was the sort of question. And we talked about our prudence around that, some of the factors. So I think it's premature. I'd point you to what I said and what Kees said earlier about buybacks.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Okay. Conscious of time, so Marcell. And then we've got one more over there. Yes, Marcell, go ahead.</p><p>MARCELL HOUBEN: Clifford, I'm going to give it one more try here on the capital return, I'm sorry. I think the language is a little bit changed regarding the buyback -- regarding the placement, overhang or the government overhang. Earlier, this year you said it was a key target to reduce the overhang as quickly as possible. It seems that the message or at least the communication towards dividends has increased over buybacks. Is that the case?</p><p>CLIFFORD J. ABRAHAMS: No, it has. I mean we've said, I think in February, we were clear that we were -- it was 50% plus additional distributions, dividends or buybacks. At Q3, we said we had a preference for dividends, so that's definitely changed. We've been clear in the short term our preferences for dividends, and you see we have accrued 60%. So we put our money where our mouth is, albeit subject to the final position at year-end. And I think we didn't want any confusion around dividends and buybacks short term. But at a later date, I'll just refer you to what Kees said earlier about buybacks.</p><p>MARCELL HOUBEN: Okay. Have you...</p><p>DIES DONKER: A short one.</p><p>MARCELL HOUBEN: Sorry. Have you started the discussion with the DNB, rather the ECB regarding the buyback approval process because it's a cumbersome approach.</p><p>CLIFFORD J. ABRAHAMS: We don't comment on our dialogue with regulators, but I'd say that any -- a buyback approval is a 3-month formal process.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Okay. Yes, we have one more? Two more.</p><p>NICK DAVEY: Nick Davey from Redburn. A couple of questions, please.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Nick, can you keep it short, please? Yes?</p><p>CLIFFORD J. ABRAHAMS: Keep them short.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Go on.</p><p>NICK DAVEY: Interest rates. How sensitive? Good or bad? And the second one, well, I have to choose my words more carefully. This may be a CEO or CFO question, but in terms of financial remuneration incentives for the top managers in the group, for as long as the government is on the register, do you think you have the right remuneration incentives in place to get this plan delivered to its maximum?</p><p>CLIFFORD J. ABRAHAMS: Yes. I completely agree. That is a CEO question. So you can -- we'll see, maybe afterwards we can both talk to Kees about that. I think on interest rates, there is some sensitivity there, which is why we set that out, and I wouldn't get your ruler out on that chart, but it's indicative. And we expect interest rates in Europe to pick up at the end of next year and that will -- we think set the low point in terms of deposit margin pressure. If rates stayed where they are today, over time, or went lower, that would be a big issue for us as well as other banks. So we're are being open about it. I think in terms of -- if interest rates moved up quicker, then that would be helpful for our NII, and you probably wouldn't see that modestly lower that we've talked -- that Kees and I talked about today. I hope that gives you a feel.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Thanks, Nick. One short question from Alicia and then we'll...</p><p>ALICIA MARIANNE CHUNG: Yes. Just one question for me. First part is on...</p><p>DIES DONKER: Okay.</p><p>CLIFFORD J. ABRAHAMS: I'm happy to stay afterwards.</p><p>ALICIA MARIANNE CHUNG: This one's a quick one. You talked about restructuring cost for 2018 of about $50 million. What can we expect going forward after that? Would it be fair to assume roughly the same for 2019, 2020, 2021 or more? Then the second question is just -- sorry, going back to share buybacks, just a little bit about the logistics of it whether it happens or not over the medium term. You mentioned the 3-month ECB approval process. Is there also an expiration date on that? Once it's done, do you end up becoming having a sort of circular reference where you have to keep going back for approval or...</p><p>CLIFFORD J. ABRAHAMS: Yes. Okay. So I think the -- so on the costs, we thought it was helpful to highlight the 50 given where we are in the year, we're in November. We do expect further cost to deliver the ambition that we set out and we'd expect that to be part of our overall cost target because we include everything in our cost numbers. So the 56% to 58% is including restructuring cost. I think on buyback, a couple of points which is, I would highlight we don't have a preference for buybacks in the short term just so we're completely -- if we weren't clear, hopefully, we're clear on that. So for the buyback that we don't have a preference to do, that one. Look, you've demonstrated it, it's a bit complicated, isn't it? So you've got -- you would have to go over the ECB, get approval, and then I think one of the colleagues here talked about timing it with a sell-down. So that's a judgment for another group of people, reasonably, that would reflect the priorities at that time where the markets were. So there's some complexity around that, which is why we have a preference short term for dividends.</p><p>DIES DONKER: Okay. Thanks very much, Clifford. Thanks to all of you. We're nearly at the end. But I would like Kees to come onstage and have some key takeaways for you to think about when you drive home tonight.</p><p>KEES C. VAN DIJKHUIZEN: Well, of course, we're in London, so I don't think you'd drive, you take the tube, presumably or train, it's also more sustainable, so it's good. Thank you very much for having been here. I hope we have conveyed the message. Well, first of all, we've shown the team. I think that was also part of the meaning of this. We've guided you upfront, not much new targets -- well, we delivered there. And I also think that we have at least shown to you that our updated strategy, actually what it means in several business lines. And we've also shown, I think, that we are -- I'll put it this way, I heard it during lunch I think, much more advanced IT-wise than some people thought. So that is good news as well, I would say, also reflected in the retail area. You've heard a lot of fee initiatives, I think that's also something which some people said -- well, we didn't know that, so that's good news to say also.</p><p>So I'd like to thank you very much. We will, as we did last time since IPO, we will deliver also in the coming years. We are cautious, we are ABN AMRO and so we rather deliver than to talk too much about what we -- we won't overpromise, that's for sure, but we will certainly deliver on the stuff we've promised to you.

In retrospect, this statement might seem na\u00efve. But early adopters\u2014both developers and users\u2014truly saw the internet as a decentralising and democratising force, while traditional media at the time scoffed at it as nothing more than a hipster sub-cultural obsession. That being said, was that utopia ever within grasp? What if the internet was never a post-racial, egalitarian space to begin with, and only recently did its many problems balloon out of proportion due to its pervasive presence in our lives?    In Lurking: How A Person Became A User (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2020), author Joanne McNeil prods at this question as she charts a history of the internet from the early days of AOL forums and CompuServe chat rooms to today's Facebook and WhatsApp, from the vantage point of an early user.     As a 'lurker' in the early 1990s\u2014which in internet parlance is a silent observer who explores the conventions and norms of an online community before deciding to actively engage\u2014McNeil witnessed the internet when it was compartmentalised like walled gardens, and the primary objective of AOL (the first ever ISP) was to keep its users engaged solely with its own content. Back then, a person's identity online was plastic. Tethered only to a username, the chance to reinvent one's image on the internet seemed limitless.    However, after the dotcom crash paved the way for surveillance capitalism to become the modus operandi in Silicon Valley, online visibility was forcefully tied to the user's real-life identity under the guise of authentication. But authenticity, taken to its logical limits, becomes an act of totalisation. Google has assigned a user identification number to every single human being on earth. Facebook, in classical Orwellian fashion, refuses to acknowledge those who do not use its platform by calling them \"unregistered\" users. And with visibility on the internet now fastened to a person on the ground, cases of online harassment and exploitation are skyrocketing.    This book is notoriously difficult to pigeonhole. At times it reads like an autobiography; other times it is historical, socio-political, and philosophical, all the while providing a critique of the internet. It tries to shoehorn so many things into its 300-page breadth that several key points were bound to suffer from under-analysis. The author exacerbates the problem by constantly employing '90s East Coast metaphors, and not the ones accessible to a larger global readership, like Seinfeld or Friends .       However, as she volleys past Friendster and Myspace in the early 2000s and arrives at present-day internet, she hones her critical tone to a near-perfect pitch. She presciently points out that stringent regulation can only accomplish so much when the individual shares such a lopsided asymmetry of power in favour of the tech giants. Similarly, promises of self-regulation by the Silicon Valley executives can only yield superficial changes rather than address deeply ingrained structural problems. Breaking up social media behemoths without de-commodification of the user can only serve as a stopgap, while nationalisation would augur a Big Brother-esque scenario in which government bodies like CIA would have access to users' personal data.    She occasionally gives vent to her resentment at the traditional media for not intervening earlier with sharp criticism of the Big Tech. But how much of the fault lies with the news media is open to debate. Any critical piece in, say, the NY times would have been counteracted by scores of blog posts and YouTube motivational videos that slavishly celebrate the genius of the near-mythical \"entrepreneur\" (think of the millennial obsession with Elon Musk). In any case, it is unrealistic to expect hard-hitting analyses of Silicon Valley unicorns when the angel investors that back them also own all the major media outlets. These companies succeeded with their anti-competitive practices because proper regulatory bodies that could have checked them from the outset failed to emerge as surveillance capitalism rode the coattails of early '80s neoliberal economic policies. Blaming it all on the press reveals the obvious blind spots in McNeil's analysis. Her enduring achievement, however, is demonstrating that the present-day internet is basically the white cis-male monoculture foregrounded to the mainstream, especially after the dotcom crash purged all other alternative avenues like Caf\u00e9 Los Negros. The meandering tone of the book might be an issue for the casual reader. Otherwise, it is worth a read.

Then tell of Big Technology's fall.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Somewhere an epic tale is taking shape, and it goes something like this: Once, we found ourselves in a garden of information. Facts would set the world free. But too late we discovered that rumor, falsehood, and molten hatred could course along the pathways meant for truth. Age-old human impulses proved as adaptable as cockroaches, and have planted their flag in our new digital utopia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Heightened by misgivings over the 2016 election, the backlash against Big Technology is now in full swing. The coming year promises new efforts to hold it to account, as Congress considers antitrust action and privacy initiatives, and Americans fret over the misuse of their personal data.</p><p>Until our great epic arrives, the growing spate of books on the Internet's dark side will have to do. In \"The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power,\" Shoshana Zuboff lays important groundwork, conceding that her exhaustive study is just an \"initial mapping\" of the terrain.</p><p>An emerita professor at Harvard Business School, Zuboff began studying the rise of surveillance capitalism (her coinage) in 2006. Today, her alarm is palpable. In her estimation, virtually all of us are now imprisoned in a digital cage. A new, unprecedented form of power has entered the world. Promising greater connection, it concentrates might among a small number of companies. These companies have not naturally advanced the world toward the democratization of knowledge; instead, their formidable power serves commercial ends, through the manipulation of human behavior. Americans caught in this Faustian snare can either be defensive or pretend nothing is happening, but they cannot escape. If Zuboff is right, only a new era of progressive reform can save us.</p><p>Like most writers on what Big Tech has wrought, she ponders its prime movers, describing their mind-set as \"radical indifference.\" In \"The Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America,\" Margaret O'Mara identifies an anti-authoritarian streak among the founders, tracing their mentality to post-Vietnam disillusionment. Her wonderfully accessible history of Big Technology spans 50-plus years, and brings home just how extraordinary the rise of the digital world has been.</p><p>As O'Mara notes, the key players combined disdain for authority with an entrepreneurial fervor. Both fell nicely into the political slipstream of the Reagan years. Yet as she also demonstrates, to a large but underappreciated extent, government aided the rise of Silicon Valley. By opening the Internet to commercial activity in the early 1990s, it provided a crucial foothold. As tech companies grew, politicians hung back from intervening, partly because they did not understand what they were regulating.</p><p>Big Tech was tightly controlled by a coterie whose heedless, white male ethos masqueraded as the free market. Nevertheless, O'Mara tends to give these titans the benefit of the doubt: Geeks caught up in designing cool stuff could not be expected to reckon with \"bad actors\" exploiting their creations.</p><p>Journalist Noam Cohen suggests, to the contrary, that today's tech billionaires have simply been masters at letting themselves off the hook. If anything unites them, it is their shared belief in their own benevolence. In \"The Know-it-Alls: The Rise of Silicon Valley as a Political Powerhouse and Social Wrecking Ball,\" Cohen presents a digital-age rogue's gallery.</p><p>Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and others figure in a set of interlinked portraits illustrating how Big Tech's disruptive dream darkened, infecting the world with a libertarian outlook that has been great for winners but destructive for almost everyone else. Amid Cohen's hard-nosed cast is Netscape founder Marc Andreessen, still evidently resentful toward his upbringing in small-town Wisconsin. Cohen wonders, not altogether facetiously, whether the world is being made to answer for Andreessen's years of chopping wood and suffering through gym class.</p><p>New Yorker writer Andrew Marantz presents the Big Tech players as, primarily, naive optimists. In \"Anti-social: Online Extremists, Techno-Utopians, and the Hijacking of the American Conversation,\" he probes the destructive forces unleashed by their creations.</p><p>For years, online social networks have been used to promote a white nationalist agenda. Intrigued, Marantz entered the world of right-wing extremists and returned a changed man. While outlets such as Twitter and Facebook have begun to crack down, their overlords still seek cover in a First-Amendment absolutism.</p><p>The most disheartening aspect of Marantz's journey may be the fierce animosity toward mainstream news organizations he encountered along the way. Thanks partly to algorithms that tap into \"high arousal emotions,\" we seem locked in an inane contest between \"globalist elites\" and \"the real Americans.\" Marantz has turned into a reluctant institutionalist, defending the role of traditional media in what may be an emerging form of conservatism. In the meantime, he and others are creating a vital chronicle of an unprecedented era.</p><p>M.J.

Hannah Wiley here, back in your inboxes and excited to bring you end-of-session madness updates.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Senate kicks off its floor session at 10 a.m.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">'TRUST STUDENTS'</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A coalition of student activists gathered in support of a bill to increase access to abortion care on college campuses yesterday at the Capitol. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Trust students, and pass SB 24,\" they called out, as music pumped across the West lawn and pink balloons decorated their signs. Joining them were pro-choice advocacy groups like NARAL and university alumni who shared personal stories to support the bill. </p><p>\"I was forced to go to an off-campus provider for care because my student health center did not provide medication abortion on campus. That's not how it should be. That's not reproductive equity and that's certainly not reproductive justice,\" said Zoe Murray, a 23-year-old University of CaliforniaSanta Barbara alum who said she had an abortion her sophomore year.</p><p>Joining Murray and the activists was Senate Bill 24 author Sen. Connie Leyva, D-Chino, Senate President Pro Tem Toni Atkins, D-San Diego, and Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis. </p><p>The bill would by January 2023 require the University of California and California State University systems to offer medication abortion at on-campus clinics and would establish the College Student Health Center Sexual and Reproductive Health Preparation Fund. </p><p>Advocates for the measure say it's important college women have close access to care so they don't miss work or class, or risk facing criticism and stigma while in an unfamiliar community.</p><p>\"We know that right now, access to having an abortion is under attack across this country. We know that California is always a leader on things that matter. We will continue to lead,\" Leyva said. </p><p>SB 24 is Leyva's third attempt to get the bill passed, after Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed similar legislation. </p><p>\"According to a study sponsored by supporters of this legislation, the average distance to abortion providers in campus communities varies from five to seven miles, not an unreasonable distance,\" he wrote in his veto message, included in the bill analysis. \"Because the services required by this bill are widely available off campus, this bill is not necessary.\"</p><p>But the trio of powerful lawmakers on Tuesday said the legislation would empower California students who might need help affording and having access to reproductive services. </p><p>\"In my life, I was a businesswoman, I was a United States ambassador, and I'm the first woman ever elected lieutenant governor of California,\" Kounalakis said. \"I am keenly aware that in my life, I would not have been able to do these things had I not had control over my own reproductive choices. This is the key element of liberating women.\" </p><p>MARCH FIRST, LEGISLATE LATER</p><p>On the heels of California's 13th lawsuit challenging President Donald Trump's immigration policies, Capitol lawmakers are marching this morning to protest White House decisions that affect immigrants. </p><p>Remind me -- Last month, Gov. Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Xavier Becerra sued to block Trump's \"public charge\" rule, which would make it harder for immigrants seeking a green card to get one if they're likely to use public benefits. </p><p>The duo announced days later that they'd take the administration to court over its decision to circumvent a 1997 law that prohibits the detention of migrant children for longer than 20 days. </p><p>Previously, California sued the federal government in order to protect its sanctuary state policies, block Trump's so-called Muslim travel ban, halt border wall construction and kill the inclusion of a citizenship question on the 2020 Census. </p><p>The group of legislators, including Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon, Assemblymembers Rob Bonta, David Chiu, Mike Gipson, Lorena Gonzalez, Shirley Weber and state Sens. Ben Allen and Marie Elena Durazo, plan to march near the Capitol.</p><p>They're scheduled to start at 9:00 this morning on the North steps and will march to the John Moss Federal Building. </p><p>JOIN 'EM</p><p>A group of Republican Assemblymen plan to introduce a joint resolution that urges Attorney General Xavier Becerra to partner with other attorneys general in the fight against the \"monopolistic powers of giant tech companies.\" </p><p>The joint resolution is supported by Common Sense Media, a nonprofit tech advocacy group, and calls on Becerra to enforce federal antitrust laws that regulate big tech, according to a press statement. The resolution targets Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Amazon, and asks Becerra to uphold federal action to increase competition, keep prices down and remove barriers to market entry in the tech sector. </p><p>\"Federal antitrust laws are ill-equipped to take on modern monopolies that quash competition and innovation without increasing prices,\" said Assemblyman Jordan Cunningham, R-San Luis Obispo County, who is behind a package of privacy bills that take aim at large tech companies. </p><p>\"It is our hope that Congress continues to push forward, but we need action here at the state level as well. We encourage Attorney General Becerra to work with other attorneys general to investigate and collect evidence, and provide that information to the Legislature to inform our next steps to amend California's antitrust statutes.\"</p><p>HAPPY BIRTHDAY!</p><p>Sept. 1 -- Assemblyman Bill Quirk, D-Hayward</p><p>Sept. 2 -- Sen.

By reporting on an anti-Trump free speech non-profit group's study, The Hollywood Reporter acknowledged that the apple of its journalistic eye has been in bed with Chinese government censors. According to THR and PEN America, Hollywood studios 'self-censor' their films for the Chinese government in order to get major money at the Chinese box office. </p><p>Perhaps there's some growing worry about this on the left as well. Hey, The Hollywood Reporter could have taken the Washington Post route and called the Chinese Communist Party[2] 'a ticket to a better future.' THR waved[3] around what they called an 'explosive report[4]' by PEN America about Chinese censorship's influence on the American film industry, that the group published on Wednesday, August 5. The outlet admitted that it is damning enough to 'put Hollywood on the defensive.' The non-profit group[5], dedicated to protecting freedom of expression in American media, detailed 'how the major studios and A-list directors increasingly are making decisions \u2014 including cast, plot, dialogue and settings \u2014 'based on an effort to avoid antagonizing Chinese officials.'' The study cited classic examples of this occurring, whereby a classic Top Gun[6] flight patch on Tom Cruise's jacket had Taiwanese symbols removed from it in the film's upcoming sequel to appease the Chinese government, or when Disney Studios[7] remained silent on their Mulan remake actress' social media support for authoritarian Chinese government in their standoff with Hong Kong freedom fighters. Oh yes, we wouldn't want the CCP feeling guilty about any of that, would we? PEN America cited several reasons why Hollywood studios prostrate so heavily before Chinese censors, with the main one being money, obviously. The Chinese box office is the second biggest in the world, so Hollywood makes billions[8] of dollars with movies like Avengers: Endgame debuting in China. The study wrote 'appeasement means profits. American movies earned $2.6 billion in China in 2019, with Disney's Avengers: Endgame pulling in $614 million there alone.' This 'growing phenomenon of self-censorship among the studios' also helps them acquire extra perks such as 'better release dates, preferential advertising arrangements and a more friendly relationship with Chinese investors and regulators.' It's starting to seem like our first place box office is playing second fiddle to the real market dominator. PEN America deputy director of free expression policy and research, James Tager, the report's author, stated, 'Our biggest concern is that Hollywood is increasingly normalizing preemptive self-censorship in anticipation of what the Beijing censor is looking for.' At some point, Hollywood's values might mirror those of the world's largest Communist regime. It's hard for lefties to commend Disney for being 'woke,' when a lesbian scene[9] from the latest Star Wars movie was shot in such a way that allowed it to be pulled for Chinese screenings, for example. THR also clarified that it just so happens to be coincidental that PEN America is taking a hard stance on Chinese propaganda in Hollywood like the Trump administration[10], saying that PEN America is 'no friend of the Trump administration.' The outlet mentioned a 2018 lawsuit[11] from the non-profit against 'President Trump in federal court in an effort to prevent him from using the machinery of the government to retaliate or threaten reprisals against journalists and media outlets for coverage he dislikes.' Perhaps more and more anti-Trumpgroups are waking up to the dangers China poses throughout the world. THR mentioned USC Professor Stan Rosen's warning to Hollywood that this 'perfect storm' of censorship criticism will continue to get louder. 'It's going to get harder and harder for Hollywood to not respond,' he told the outlet.

By reporting on an anti-Trump free speech non-profit group's study, The Hollywood Reporter acknowledged that the apple of its journalistic eye has been in bed with Chinese government censors. According to THR and PEN America, Hollywood studios 'self-censor' their films for the Chinese government in order to get major money at the Chinese box office.Perhaps there's some growing worry about this on the left as well. </p><p>Hey, The Hollywood Reporter could have taken the Washington Post route and called the Chinese Communist Party[2] 'a ticket to a better future.'THR waved[3] around what they called an 'explosive report[4]' by PEN America about Chinese censorship's influence on the American film industry, that the group published on Wednesday, August 5. The outlet admitted that it is damning enough to 'put Hollywood on the defensive.'The non-profit group[5], dedicated to protecting freedom of expression in American media, detailed 'how the major studios and A-list directors increasingly are making decisions   including cast, plot, dialogue and settings   'based on an effort to avoid antagonizing Chinese officials.''The study cited classic examples of this occurring, whereby a classic Top Gun[6] flight patch on Tom Cruise's jacket had Taiwanese symbols removed from it in the film's upcoming sequel to appease the Chinese government, or when Disney Studios[7] remained silent on their Mulan remake actress' social media support for authoritarian Chinese government in their standoff with Hong Kong freedom fighters.Oh yes, we wouldn't want the CCP feeling guilty about any of that, would we?PEN America cited several reasons why Hollywood studios prostrate so heavily before Chinese censors, with the main one being money, obviously. The Chinese box office is the second biggest in the world, so Hollywood makes billions[8] of dollars with movies like Avengers: Endgame debuting in China. The study wrote 'appeasement means profits. American movies earned $2.6 billion in China in 2019, with Disney's Avengers: Endgame pulling in $614 million there alone.'This 'growing phenomenon of self-censorship among the studios' also helps them acquire extra perks such as 'better release dates, preferential advertising arrangements and a more friendly relationship with Chinese investors and regulators.' It's starting to seem like our first place box office is playing second fiddle to the real market dominator.PEN America deputy director of free expression policy and research, James Tager, the report's author, stated, 'Our biggest concern is that Hollywood is increasingly normalizing preemptive self-censorship in anticipation of what the Beijing censor is looking for.' At some point, Hollywood's values might mirror those of the world's largest Communist regime. It's hard for lefties to commend Disney for being 'woke,' when a lesbian scene[9] from the latest Star Wars movie was shot in such a way that allowed it to be pulled for Chinese screenings, for example.THR also clarified that it just so happens to be coincidental that PEN America is taking a hard stance on Chinese propaganda in Hollywood like the Trump administration[10], saying that PEN America is 'no friend of the Trump administration.' The outlet mentioned a 2018 lawsuit[11] from the non-profit against 'President Trump in federal court in an effort to prevent him from using the machinery of the government to retaliate or threaten reprisals against journalists and media outlets for coverage he dislikes.'Perhaps more and more anti-Trumpgroups are waking up to the dangers China poses throughout the world. THR mentioned USC Professor Stan Rosen's warning to Hollywood that this 'perfect storm' of censorship criticism will continue to get louder. 'It's going to get harder and harder for Hollywood to not respond,' he told the outlet.

The imaginary Central American migrant  Caravan, the one you've been told over and over doesn't exist, and if you  don't believe it, you're immoral, well turns out it does exist. It's a  physical reality. And, in fact, it's here. It's at the U.S. border.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A breakaway group from the Caravan has made its way to Tijuana. They didn't  walk, as you were told they were doing. They were driven. And now, members  are climbing over the border fence there. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The migrants were able to reach this country, thanks to the assistance of  organizations whose explicit purpose is getting people into this country  legally or not. Trace Gallagher has more details on what's going on  tonight. Trace?</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Tucker, right now, there are two  primary Central American caravans in Mexico making their way north that  include anywhere from 4,000 to 7,000 people. The first of the major  caravans is expected to arrive at the U.S. border sometime late next week.</p><p>But as you say, some 350 migrants have now arrived at the border in  Tijuana. Dozens of them scaled the fence and taunted Border Patrol  officers. Others stood at the fence or hung out on the beach. But they want  their presence known to both the Border Patrol and the media.</p><p>Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING SPANISH).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING SPANISH).</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GALLAGHER: Yes. Catracho is slang for Honduran. There are reports these  migrants broke from the main Caravan about four or five days ago and took  buses north. Impossible to tell exactly how many are from the Caravan  because the Border Patrol tells us Central American migrants sometimes  arrive in droves every single day at the U.S. border.</p><p>We certainly know that many of these migrants are being coached by groups  like Pueblo Sin Fronteras or People Without Borders, a Chicago-based  immigration advocacy group. In fact, even Left-leaning news organizations  like the L.A. Times and Washington Post have reported that members of  Pueblo Sin Fronteras are embedded with the Caravan.</p><p>And our sources tell us these types of groups are guiding the migrants. For  example, Mexico has offered most of these people both asylum and jobs. And  yet, they continue heading north. Also, they could move toward the U.S.  border in Texas. </p><p>But instead, they go the long way, hundreds of miles out of their way  toward Tijuana. And that's because the goal is to get to California, take  advantage of the State's sanctuary laws and the benefits that go along with  that.</p><p>Of course, once thousands begin arriving in the next few weeks, sympathetic  groups will be at the border to greet them. Tucker?</p><p>CARLSON: Trace Gallagher, thanks for that update. Appreciate it. </p><p>Well the images you just saw are embarrassing and awkward for the liars  you've been watching on television for the past month, the ones who've been  lecturing you that the Caravan doesn't exist and telling you that  everything is just fine at the border.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIANNA MARIE KEILAR, SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, ANCHOR, CNN: The  President, along with his favorite TV network, were beating the drum on the  looming so-called Invasion as they put it--</p><p>SAM STEIN, THE DAILY BEAST POLITICS EDITOR, MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR: The  programming on the Caravan was propaganda. It was political campaign  motivated propaganda.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And the state-run--</p><p>BILL MAHER, REAL TIME WITH BILL MAHER HOST, HBO: Trump is like a racist  Paul Revere, you know. The migrants are coming! The migrants are coming!</p><p>He keeps calling it an invasion. Yes, an invasion of strollers.</p><p>ANDERSON HAYS COOPER, AUTHOR, PRIMARY ANCHOR, ANDERSON COOPER 360 , CNN: He  made news by ratcheting up the Caravan scare talk and the troop numbers he  believes are needed to meet this alleged threat.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: The so-called invasion. So, people are streaming over the border  illegally, what would you call it? I don't know. You're not allowed to call  it anything, actually. </p><p>This is a recurring theme on the Left. Don't believe your own eyes. You're  too dumb to trust your own senses. Listen to the smart kids. They know  best. There's no crisis on the border even as hundreds of thousands of  people stream into this country every year illegally, there's no illegal  immigration crisis.</p><p>Yes, there are 22 million people living here illegally. It's not a crisis.  It's not real. They'll tell you that on a loop endlessly until the day they  retake power, at which point they'll say the crisis is real. In fact, it's  so enormous we can only solve it by granting blanket amnesty to all the  people here illegally.</p><p>There are 22 million, after all. What else can we do? This is a metaphor  really for the Left's entire program, which is built entirely on denying  reality. They deny the reality of illegal immigration. They deny the  reality of terrorism. They deny the reality of biological gender. </p><p>And woe to the person who raises his hand and tries to insert reality into  the conversation. They don't want that. When you have a program built  entirely on denial and deception, it is not surprising you're also against  free speech. You can't afford to have an honest conversation. </p><p>We'd like to have an honest conversation. That's why we're speaking tonight  to Bryan Dean Wright. He's a Democrat and a former CIA Officer, and he  joins us on set. So, I think there are arguments in favor of letting these  people in, even illegally. That - that's a real position.</p><p>BRYAN DEAN WRIGHT, FORMER CIA OPS OFFICER, OPINION WRITER: Sure.</p><p>CARLSON: And maybe you can make the case it's good for America, it's good  for our economy, maybe you think it's bad for America and you want it  anyway. I mean there are all kinds of arguments. But what's not an argument  is telling me that I'm a racist for acknowledging the reality of what is  happening and that's the position I'm seeing on television.</p><p>WRIGHT: You're correct. So, here's what we should be starting with this  conversation, facts, which--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>WRIGHT: --we typically don't, right? So, the facts tell us that first  generation immigrants are a net drain on our economy, second and then (ph)  eventually third generation become net contributors. That's the fact,  right?</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>WRIGHT: Secondarily, we know that the folks who are coming across the  border, 1,000 to 2,000 people each day, again, having kids then in a year  or two years down the road, we're talking hundreds of thousands of people  all told that those folks are - are initially, anyway, a burden to our  economy.</p><p>Now, whether or not they contribute something many years down the road,  that is an open question. We should be able to have this conversation  irrespective--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>WRIGHT: --of our party affiliation, and come to a conclusion where we say,  \"Look, we need to have a thoughtful, strong border, prevent some of these  folks from coming across. And if we don't, shame on us, as a country.\"</p><p>CARLSON: Well, I agree with that. I mean I do think, as you just said, that  this is in many ways an economic question. And I don't understand how you  can look at the projections for what automation is about to do to our  economy, eliminating a huge percentage of all low-skilled labor, all low- skilled labor in this country, and see what we need is more low-skilled  labor. How can you make that argument?</p><p>WRIGHT: You can't. The top 10 jobs that we see immigrants take, both legal  and illegal, make less than 20 bucks an hour, which, by the way, the Obama  Administration said, jobs earning less than 20 bucks an hour are going to  be automated into obsolescence.</p><p>So, the argument that we need an increasing number of poorly qualified, you  know, folks who don't speak English, don't have the--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>WRIGHT: --skillsets that really we need for, the common (ph) economy, well  frankly, the one that's already here that's a - that's a silly argument. It  just it doesn't hold water.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I always want to believe the best about people and that they  have honorable motives. And I think most people do have honorable motives.  But if you can't even marshal an economic argument in favor of your - of  your immigration policy, I'm left believing maybe it's only about getting  more votes for your party.</p><p>WRIGHT: How cynical?</p><p>CARLSON: I don't want to be cynical. I just don't - I just don't see--</p><p>WRIGHT: Well--</p><p>CARLSON: --any other rationale.</p><p>WRIGHT: Look - look, I - I appreciate the argument. I think you're - you  may be correct. There are definitely some parts of the party, make no  mistake about it, they want open borders. </p><p>I mean just the other day, I think, it was yesterday, in fact, Senator  Gillibrand from New York was buddy-buddy with the guy, Sean McElwee who  wants to remove the border between the United States and Mexico, all right? </p><p>So, there is an element within this country, not just the activist  community but, in fact, within the - the Left of this nation, my own party,  I - I hate to say, who want open borders. </p><p>And that, of course, then feeds into this issue well - well what, not only  how do we take care of them but, ultimately, who are they going to vote  for? And that that there is a - a play there that I think one could - could  argue this is a political play. This is about vote. So, I think it's fair  to have that - that concern and that fear.</p><p>CARLSON: If I hear one more moron on cable news cry racism when somebody  tries to have an honest conversation about what this means, I swear I'm  getting rid of my television. I mean that.</p><p>WRIGHT: I don't blame you.</p><p>CARLSON: I can't - can't handle it, no.</p><p>WRIGHT: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Bryan Dean Wright, thank you very much.</p><p>WRIGHT: Always a pleasure.</p><p>CARLSON: Great to see you.</p><p>Well the Florida recount continues tonight. Democrats are battling to  change the results by any means necessary. That will not surprise you. The  details might though, and we have them after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well the recount continues tonight in this country's least  competent vote-counting state. The upside of all of this Florida recount  stuff by the way is a man named Craig Patrick. This is the third night in a  row we've had him on, and we're always grateful to see him. Political  Editor, Chief Investigator for WTVT Fox in Tampa Bay, he joins us with a  recap. </p><p>Craig, what is happening?</p><p>CRAIG PATRICK, WTVT FOX TAMPA BAY POLITICAL EDITOR AND CHIEF INVESTIGATOR:  We have more dueling gaffes, once again, focused on South Florida,  predominantly Democrats. </p><p>I'll start with the good news for Senator Bill Nelson. We now know that the  Democratic Party did, in fact, rally his supporters to make sure they get  their mail-in ballots fixed if there are problems and finalized before the  deadline.</p><p>The bad news for Bill Nelson is that they got the dates mixed up and they  gave the wrong deadline telling people that you've got until Thursday,  November 8th. The election was Tuesday, November 6th. </p><p>And the evidence for this is leading to the work of the Democratic Party of  Florida, sending out these government forms writing in the wrong date,  effectively confusing people and leaving, maybe, a lot of Democrats to say,  \"Oh Gilligan (ph).\" </p><p>And this is something that seems to have affected voters specifically in  Broward County and three other counties. So, stop and think about that for  a moment. </p><p>You have the Democratic Party, apparently, one, sabotaging conceivably Bill  Nelson, two, disenfranchising their own voters in this blunder, three,  shooting themselves in the foot, four, trying to orchestrate this deadline  rush not knowing what the deadline was and, five, conceivably breaking  election law, all in one fell swoop.</p><p>This is something that the state has sent over to the feds to investigate.  We'll see how that works out. One other blunder that stands out that has  risen to the surface, you have continuing woes in Palm Beach County in  Southeast Florida, where you have faulty voting machines.</p><p>Apparently, when they get stressed, they are old, they're aging to the  point where they spit out erroneous results, which is causing the Election  Managers there to recount votes that had already been recounted. </p><p>We're calling them the Monty Python machines because they - you feed them  through, it's OK, one, two, five, no, no, three. And with this, you have  Palm Beach County now racing the clock along with Broward County.</p><p>In other news, Governor Rick Scott, under pressure to recuse himself from  certifying the results of the - of his own disputed race, has done that.  He's moving on to - to Washington now. </p><p>And Mitch McConnell introduced him as the new Senator from Florida, which  is premature. It is presumptuous. But it is also increasingly likely as  well because while Bill Nelson has filed all of these legal challenges,  time is running out. </p><p>And if you look at the math, even if Nelson prevails on every single one,  which would seem to be a reach there just does not appear to be enough  ballots to get him where he needs to be unless there is some kind of big  machine malfunction, which based on the things we've seen is not  inconceivable but we'll find out one way or the other about that, most  likely by our deadline of the machine recount--</p><p>CARLSON: It's - it's unbelievable.</p><p>PATRICK: --tomorrow afternoon.</p><p>CARLSON: It's--</p><p>PATRICK: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --it's been 18 years. You'd think it would be running like a Swiss  Canton by now, but it's Florida. Craig, thank you very much for that  update. Appreciate it.</p><p>PATRICK: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Rubio has been raising alarm over the State of Florida's election  irregularities for quite some time, and he joins us tonight on set.  Senator, thanks very much--</p><p>MARCO ANTONIO RUBIO, JUNIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR FOR THE STATE OF FLORIDA,  REPUBLICAN PARTY MEMBER: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: --for coming on.</p><p>RUBIO: Thanks for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I - I know you're a Senator, represents the State of Florida--</p><p>RUBIO: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --and you're pro-Florida. But as objectively as you can, what is  the core problem with elections in Florida as of now (ph)?</p><p>RUBIO: Well actually there isn't. I mean 65 of 67 counties did it right.  You know, Miami-Dade County is right on the border of Broward, 60 percent  voted for Democrats in the Senate race and the governor's race, they got  all their votes in on time. </p><p>And then they did their recount on time. It is largely focused on two  counties and one, in particular, Broward County, where you have an inept  and incompetent Elections Director who's done this in the past.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>RUBIO: And so, when someone, you know, a perfect example is these  provisional ballots, right, it's people that show up and vote. You don't  show up in the system. They let you vote but they put your vote in an  envelope, and then they make sure - they verify you.</p><p>She decided to take 205 of them and count them on her own without  submitting them the right way to this provisional - to the Canvassing  Board. When that was discovered, she said, \"All right, I'll give it to the  Canvassing Board.\" </p><p>But she had already separated the ballots from the envelopes. They found 20  of them to be invalid. But then there - there's no way to match the ballots  to the envelope when you separate them. So then, she submitted 205 votes to  the state out of that batch, 20 of them, at least 20 of them, are invalid  votes.</p><p>Now she claims that they're not part of the count, which contradicts what  her lawyer said a few days ago. So, when someone that incompetent is  sitting on thousands of ballots, we don't know how many they are, she's not  regularly reporting them, of course, we're going to be concerned about that  and, of course, we're going to be concerned about the - the reporting.</p><p>And the second state of play is it's now lawyer time. Lawyers are arguing  to the state that - to the judge, they're trying to get a federal judge to  do two things. One, throw out state law when it comes to voter intent. </p><p>They're going to do a manual recount in the Senate race of all the ballots  that either didn't vote in the Senate race or double-voted. And there's a  very specific law for what voter intent is. You know, if you - if you  circle Rick Scott or Bill Nelson, that's fine. But you have to have done it  throughout the ballot.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>RUBIO: The machine won't read it. They want to throw out that standard and  just let it be, I don't know what.</p><p>CARLSON: Can you change the standard after the voters cast votes (ph)?</p><p>RUBIO: That's my concern. I mean, look, if you say there was a problem with  the lawsuit (ph), the legislature is there for. But to have a judge come in  and announce that Florida law, after the election we're going to change the  rules in hopes of influencing the outcome, that, to me, is stealing the  election.</p><p>And then, they also want to force them to count every mail ballot, even the  ones in which the signature didn't match, the signature on file for the  voter. These are the two fundamental arguments before--</p><p>CARLSON: But just to ask (ph)--</p><p>RUBIO: --federal court.</p><p>CARLSON: --is that the requirement that the signature has to match?</p><p>RUBIO: Of course, yes, I mean--</p><p>CARLSON: So, if that's the existing requirement, how can they argue it's no  longer the requirement?</p><p>RUBIO: Because they're saying it's an arbitrary standard and who's making  the decision--</p><p>CARLSON: But that was the standard on Election Day, right?</p><p>RUBIO: Correct. And I think that's what I'm hoping, a reasonable judge, no  matter how activist it might be, would argue that's a good point. You  should have raised it before the election, and that's something for the  legislature to fix. But we're not going to change the rules of the election  after the election to influence the outcome, because if you do it, it's  stealing an election.</p><p>CARLSON: Amazing. So, I want to ask you about the question of nationalism.  The President described himself as a nationalist recently. He was attacked  by the leader of France for doing that. You recently published a Wall  Street Journal op-ed defending the idea of nationalism.</p><p>RUBIO: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Why is nationalism a necessary concept in modern America?</p><p>RUBIO: Well, American nationalism.</p><p>CARLSON: Of course.</p><p>RUBIO: What is our identity? Our identity is not a common race, ethnicity.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>RUBIO: In fact, America is a de facto rejection of that. It is  fundamentally premised on this notion. We are all children of God. We are  born with God - we're all created equal by our Creator. And we are given  equal rights to life, liberty, and to pursue happiness. </p><p>That is our national identity. It is deeply rooted in morals and in values.  It, in fact, explains everything this nation has done internationally and  domestically. We should be proud of that identity. We should defend that  national identity.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>RUBIO: Number two, I think most of the viewers watching this program would  be shocked to think that my job is to represent Belgium or my job is to  represent - I don't have nothing - I have nothing against Belgium. I always  pick on Belgium or Luxembourg. They have their own system of government.  That doesn't mean I need to be hostile towards them.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>RUBIO: And it may be in our national interest to work with them. I think  NATO was in our national interest and is. I think a lot of our alliances  are built on that. And, in fact, our national - our national - our national  identity as a nation that believes in the equality of all people is what  has caused us to defend democracy and feed hungry--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>RUBIO: --people all over the world. We should be proud of that. But, as a  government leader, my fundamental obligation, first and foremost, is to  work on behalf of the American people. And most of the time, if not all the  time, we can do that without hurting other people around the world.</p><p>CARLSON: It's hard to know what the argument against what you just said  might be. Why would people--</p><p>RUBIO: Well--</p><p>CARLSON: --object? No, I sincerely because--</p><p>RUBIO: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --it's important to understand what - what the objections are.  What do you think they could be--</p><p>RUBIO: Well, there are two.</p><p>CARLSON: --willing to do (ph)?</p><p>RUBIO: One is they ascribe to nationalism, sort of the nationalism of the  Nazis or somebody else. That's ethnic and racial nationalism. I'm not  talking about ethnic nationalism.</p><p>CARLSON: Of course, not.</p><p>RUBIO: I'm talking about a national identity that actually is completely  relevant to your ethnicity. In fact, you didn't (ph) have to be born here.  If you come here legally, you can be a U.S. citizen. It's one of the great  things about America. Some of the people who love America are the most are  the people who are Americans by choice, they--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>RUBIO: --because they know what life is like in another country. Then  there's another school of thought that \"No, we are citizens of the  international community, and we have obligations to the rest of the world,\"  which I would agree within the confines of our national interest. </p><p>In fact, I've always argued that the best thing for the world is a strong  and prosperous America because our values infuse our decision-making and -  and - and so much of what we do. So, there are people that actually - I  think that's what Macron was arguing. </p><p>And that is that France's obligations under him anyways are not just for  the - to the French people, but to the sort of amorphous international  community, which I'm not against. I've defended international organizations  so long as they are in the national interest of the United States.</p><p>CARLSON: Because that's the country you represent.</p><p>RUBIO: Yes. I mean I swore an allegiance to the oath. I swore an oath to  the Constitution of the United States. I work for the American people. And  I believe I can do so while still being strong allies of Japan, strong  allies of Great - Great Britain, strong allies of--</p><p>CARLSON: Of course.</p><p>RUBIO: --our countries around - all these countries around the world,  especially when our interests intersect.</p><p>CARLSON: I think this is a vital conversation and I'm glad that we're  having it and I'm glad you're--</p><p>RUBIO: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: --articulating it so clearly. Thank you, Senator.</p><p>RUBIO: Thank you for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: Well there's a battle over free speech going on in Washington  right now. Good. We're for free speech. The question is, are the people who  claim they're defending free speech actually defenders of speech? #Basta  (ph), whatever that means. We'll investigate the assault on free speech  after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: In the past couple of days, you've heard a lot of huffing and  puffing about free speech and freedom of the press, and how those freedoms  are currently imperiled by the White House. </p><p>And to be clear, we are for free speech, unfettered, absolute free speech,  the kind of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment, and ratified  consistently by the Supreme Court. We've defended that kind of free speech  almost every night here for the past two years.</p><p>Many others, mostly on the Left, have attacked speech. So, we know who's  for free speech and who's against it. And we cannot help but notice that  some of free speech's greatest enemies are now posing as its defenders, all  of a sudden.</p><p>Take CNN, for example. It was CNN that almost single-handedly led the  campaign to have broadcaster Alex Jones banished from the internet on the  grounds that they didn't like what Jones had to say. Ultimately, CNN  succeeded in doing that. </p><p>The network convinced every major tech platform to ban Jones and his outlet  Infowars. You don't have to like Alex Jones to see that as a terrifying  loss for free speech because it was exactly that. But CNN was not done  trying to silence its critics.</p><p>Last year, the cable network threatened an anonymous Reddit user for  creating an anti-CNN meme. CNN threatened to expose his identity and ruin  his life if it ever was criticized by him again. Now, CNN is claiming to  defend free speech only when it's their speech.</p><p>You'll notice by the way that CNN did not object when the government  threatened to imprison employees of the cable channel RT, if they didn't  register as foreign agents. Yes, RT is owned by a foreign government, so is  the BBC.</p><p>Until last year, much of the New York Times was owned by a foreign  national. This is true of other news organizations, none of which has ever  registered as a foreign agent. But because RT is owned by Russia, which the  Left believes got Donald Trump elected, it is fine with CNN if they are  bullied and silenced.</p><p>So, call CNN what you will but don't pretend they are defenders of the  First Amendment. They are not.</p><p>Victor Davis Hanson is a Fellow at the Hoover Institution and a close  watcher of all this. He joins us tonight. So, I just want to be clear,  we're always for free speech, especially speech that's offensive, even by  obnoxious White House Correspondents.</p><p>But to see a channel that has lobbied against the right of others to say  what they think is true to all of a sudden emerge as this defender of the  First Amendment is nauseating.</p><p>VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, HOOVER INSTITUTION SENIOR FELLOW, AMERICAN CLASSICIST,  MILITARY HISTORIAN, COLUMNIST, FARMER: Yes. I - I think when people saw the  suit, they asked themselves was there anything in the past that Jim Acosta  had said negatively that got him kicked out and the answer was no. Was  there anybody MSNBC, did they get kicked out? The answer's no.</p><p>Do other CNN reporters get kicked out? No, they have passes. So, it was a  particular type of behavior. And I mean if you're arguing a case before the  Supreme Court, you can't go in there and take pictures or - or interrupt  the justice, they'll kick you out. And if you do it another time they'll  say we don't want you pleading the case before the Supreme Court.</p><p>He - Jim Acosta can't go in there barefooted, and say, I want to express  myself. There are certain protocols and norms of behavior and he's violated  them. That's one issue. And then, it's not - this is sort of a psychodrama,  Tucker.</p><p>I mean we - remember that the prior Administration monitored 20 AP  reporters and Fox's own James Rosen. Nobody filed a suit on behalf of James  Rosen from CNN, and said, \"My God, we only learned in 2013 that three years  ago the man was being surveilled by the Attorney General. This is a  violation of press freedom.\" We didn't hear that.</p><p>CARLSON: And - and you're not hearing CNN say anything about the voices  being silenced now online by the big tech companies--</p><p>HANSON: No, you've not.</p><p>CARLSON: --because they have unfashionable views. Can you, as a  philosophical matter, support free speech in some cases but not in others?</p><p>HANSON: I don't think you can. And then we get to another - we - if we want  to talk about ethics and the protocols of the White House, see, CNN, 93  percent of their coverage according to Shorenstein is bias, and Trump had  no problem with that. </p><p>He has no problem when the CNN host Kathy Griffin holds a decapitated  facsimile of his head. They have no problem when Anderson Cooper uses  obscenity or Rez - Reza Aslan says he's a piece of crap or people that are  guests and panelists say that he's a Russian asset or agent or they invoke  the Holocaust for comparison or people say that he's radicalized more  people than ISIS, remember that? </p><p>And they have these stories they keep running, you know, that Scaramucci  has involved with a Russian hedge fund, false, that Trump knew in advance  of the Russian meeting, that Donald Trump Jr. had access to the WikiLeaks.</p><p>I remember when CNN was just explaining to us as a matter of fact that  James Comey within a matter of hours was going to go into a Congressional  testimony and swear that Donald Trump had mischaracterized their private  meeting about whether he was subject to prosecution (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: Well it does - doesn't make sense though (ph)--</p><p>HANSON: --it was all--</p><p>CARLSON: --because they--</p><p>HANSON: --it was all false.</p><p>CARLSON: --CNN has argued that others should lose their voice, should be  silenced--</p><p>HANSON: Yes, yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --because they're \"conspiracy theorists.\"</p><p>HANSON: Theorists.</p><p>CARLSON: But you're listing conspiracy theories that they have promulgated  on their air.</p><p>HANSON: Yes. And they're also arguing that their type of behavior should  not be subject to public scrutiny, but only Donald Trump's could (ph),  protocol, manners, politeness. </p><p>And that's what Trump's argument is it's not the content, it's not the  prejudice, it's not the unprofessionalism in the past, it's this particular  time you went over the edge, and you disrupted. You were rude. You took  over a - an optional press conference, nothing in the Constitution that  says he has to have a press conference.</p><p>I can remember President Reagan saying, \"I can't hear you.\" And when - when  somebody yells to Donald Trump, he runs over and talks. So, it's not only  hypocritical on their fact (ph) but it's a - it's a journalistic  organization that has violated the ethos of reporting and journalism then  calling the kettle black and saying you can't do this, this is against  White House--</p><p>CARLSON: I know.</p><p>HANSON: --protocol.</p><p>CARLSON: It's a - it's a shame--</p><p>HANSON: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --to see a buffoon elevated to--</p><p>HANSON: It is.</p><p>CARLSON: --martyr status. But look, now that CNN's on the side of free  speech, I'm sure they'll be advocating for the right--</p><p>HANSON: I wish they have.</p><p>CARLSON: --of all people to say what they need.</p><p>HANSON: They could have sued in 2013 on the behalf of Fox and--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>HANSON: --and the - and the AP.</p><p>CARLSON: Victor Davis Hanson, a man with a long memory.</p><p>HANSON: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: And we appreciate that.</p><p>HANSON: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you.</p><p>Well there used to be dozens of pro-Second Amendment Democrats in the  Congress. There aren't anymore. Now the party is increasingly calling for  disarming the public. Does the public want that? That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Anyway if (ph) Democrats is entering the Congress, of course, one  of their top interests, they say, one of their top public policy  priorities, disarming the population. </p><p>Just a decade ago, about a quarter of candidates backed by the NRA were, in  fact, Democrats. Now, the number of NRA-backed House Democrats is three.  Meanwhile, a new poll of Democrats in early primary states says their top  issue after single-payer healthcare is repealing the Second Amendment in  order to ban guns.</p><p>Richard Goodstein is a lawyer, a former adviser to Bill and Hillary Clinton  and she - he joins us tonight. Richard, thanks for coming on.</p><p>RICHARD GOODSTEIN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, POLITICAL CONSULTANT, FORMER  CLINTON ADVISER: Sure.</p><p>CARLSON: So, is this really the time, as the country's becoming more  chaotic, to disarm the population?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes. So, I can't really speak for these people who respond to  this poll. I can tell you what Nancy Pelosi is talking about, what House  Democrats are talking about, which is background checks, which 90-percent  plus of the public supports, which got 54 votes in the Senate when it was  Toomey and Manchin, putting a bill to require gun background--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. OK. You know what I mean (ph)--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --checks.</p><p>CARLSON: --we've been through this a million times but--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --but if - if Democrats polled and it seems like a legitimate poll  say their number two issue after socialized medicine is repealing the  Second Amendment, preparatory to disarming the population. You know, there  are going to be calls for that. </p><p>If the people, voters want it, you know, their - their representatives will  call for it. Is this the time? And should it make us, the rest of us, a  little nervous as America's getting crazier, obviously, to disarm normal  people?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes. Again, I just don't buy the notion that that was a legit  poll that even a quarter of Democrats think repealing the Second Amendment.  I--</p><p>CARLSON: What do you think of that?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: What - what I think the Democrats are saying is look, is what  Justice Scalia said in the famous Heller decision, the one case that really  went to the Supreme Court where he said, \"A person has a right to a handgun  to protect their home. Period.\" And that legitimate regulation of guns in  terms of places that they can't be taken, schools, places that, you know,  conditions on their sale--</p><p>CARLSON: But we have all those laws already. I mean--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: But I'm saying those are--</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --so, no one's talking about repealing that.</p><p>CARLSON: No, no. People are and let's be - I mean let's stop lying just for  a second--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --you're not going to stop mass shootings really unless you take  all the guns away. That's the truth. And everyone knows it. I mean,  honestly.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: So, that's kind of the goal, and everyone really knows that. And  I'm just wondering like what's the argument here? So, if you're arguing  simultaneously that the police are racist, they can't be trusted, which  Beto and lots of other candidates have argued, and also the population  can't be trusted to defend itself or have firearms, what are you really  saying?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: I think what Democrats are saying and, frankly, Republicans wish  they had been saying it because the ones backed by the NRA, Barbara  Comstock, Mike Coffman in Colorado lost to Democrats saying, \"We want  background check laws, and so forth.\"</p><p>And what they're saying is that things have gotten out of whack. The United  States is unique in the world. It's not a mental health problem. There are  mental health problems everywhere else in the world. But we have this  horrible gun problem here. So--</p><p>CARLSON: No, but actually we don't because most Americans are not a threat  to anybody. And this is what makes me nervous is a small percentage of  people commit the overwhelming majority of shootings. But we're not  thinking clearly about how to disarm them. </p><p>All these laws apply to me. I pose no threat to anyone, and I really want  to be able to defend myself. I know you do too. So, why not leave me out of  it and normal people out of it who pose no conceivable threat and focus on  the potential threats? But no one's ever - no one's ever up for doing that.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: We all have to be disarmed.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Of course.</p><p>CARLSON: Why?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Well again, no one's talking about disarming anybody.</p><p>CARLSON: No, they are no, no--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: What Nancy - well - well - what - what - what-- </p><p>CARLSON: --no, we (ph)--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --elected officials are saying is we should have background  checks, so lunatics--</p><p>CARLSON: --no, but that's not all--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --don't have the--</p><p>CARLSON: --no, but--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --access to guns.</p><p>CARLSON: --but the - the most - the most recent shooting and many of these  shootings have been committed by people who went through background checks.  Stephen Paddock went through a background check. The latest shooter in,  obviously, who we just saw in California went through a background check.  The truth is it's not just background checks, which nobody really opposes.  It's--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: No (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --limiting the kind of firearms you can buy, limiting the size of  the magazines you can use, limiting the kinds of ammunition you can  purchase. These are laws, restrictions that affect normal people who should  be able to--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --defend themselves. Why is that?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Look, when you say that nobody really opposes, when you get  Republican leaders here please ask them--</p><p>CARLSON: No, it's irrelevant (ph)--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --to affirm that that (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --we already have--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --they don't - well it's relevant (ph) look--</p><p>CARLSON: --but hold on--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --never we had (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --we even (ph) have background - I mean let's be serious.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Background checks are - I buy guns, so I know.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: They're in place. You go through them when you buy a gun. Why  would a magazine restriction or an ammo restriction or a so-called assault  rifle restriction apply to me? What isn't - why am I not trusted to buy any  kind of gun I want? I'm confused, honestly.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Well, again, the analogy I would use is to the ways we basically  made cars safer. There used to be a lot more fatalities on the road, and we  instituted things like seatbelts and - and airbags and other things,  vehicles that could basically crush without crushing the passenger. And -  and background checks is the first way to go--</p><p>CARLSON: No, no, but - but then - then why - no, sincere question though.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: The assault rifle ban, a gun that looks scary should be banned,  OK? That's the position and a lot of candidates (ph) say they should be  confiscated. Why should my right to buy that gun be abridged? Why can't I  be--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: It's not being--</p><p>CARLSON: --no, it is though.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Well no one's being - if you object to being--</p><p>CARLSON: --no (ph), but why shouldn't I be able to buy that gun? I'm an  American citizen. I don't pose a threat to anybody. Why can't I have that  gun?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: I - I think the concern is that people get their hands on  assault weapons who commit these crimes. If you want to use your assault  weapon on a range, guess what? Go to a range and keep your gun there and  use it there.</p><p>CARLSON: Well maybe I want it in my house. And why - I - I don't  understand. So, what--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: You want assault (ph) weapons--</p><p>CARLSON: --what you're saying is--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --to defend your house.</p><p>CARLSON: --no, what you're saying is we don't trust the population of the  country. We don't think you're autonomous. We don't think you ought to be  able to make these decisions for yourself. We just don't trust you. And I'm  saying, why would I ever vote for someone who wouldn't trust me to have an  AR-15 at home, honestly?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Well - well, again, it's like saying we didn't trust people to  drive without seatbelts or airbags and so forth. But we instituted things  that were going to make people safer. What we're saying is it'd be--</p><p>CARLSON: No. But you don't use a car to defend yourself and you do use a  firearm to defend yourself, and why wouldn't you trust--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Cars kill people.</p><p>CARLSON: --no, why wouldn't you trust? There are 330 million people in the  country. Hundreds of millions of them pose no conceivable threat to  anybody.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: So, why can't we think of a law that spares them these  regulations? Is anybody even trying to think of that?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Of course, they are but the--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, really? Who?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --well, but again, we're - we're taking it step up step. We're  taking it step by step.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, we are.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: I mean a - ask any suburban mother, that's the problem  politically is that these people that--</p><p>CARLSON: I don't care about the politics.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --that you lost last time are going to be lost--</p><p>CARLSON: I'm just telling you--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --because they don't want more guns in school.</p><p>CARLSON: --the Left is making this country chaotic and scary--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --and simultaneously trying to keep me from defending myself. And  that's not--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: The voters just happen not to buy (ph) what--</p><p>CARLSON: --going to happen.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --you just said.</p><p>CARLSON: I don't care.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: And - and that's why the Democrats won this time (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: I don't care.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: OK.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. We'll see.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Richard, thank you.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Amazon is getting billions of taxpayer dollars to expand into two  of America's richest cities. It's corporate welfare. The Democratic Party  is all on board. And anyone who questions it could be investigated by an  incoming Committee Chairman. What's going on? We'll get to that in just a  minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well Florida isn't the only state with a high-stakes recount in  progress. Just to the north, in Georgia, Democrat Stacey Abrams (ph) has  refused to concede in the Governor's race. Legal challenges are flying  everywhere. </p><p>Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown says that if Abrams is not declared the  winner, then almost by definition Republicans, quote, stole the race. Lisa  Boothe of Independent Women's Voice has been following this for us.</p><p>LISA BOOTHE, FOX NEWS CO-HOST, OUTNUMBERED, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE  SENIOR FELLOW: Hi, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: She joins us now with an update. Hey, Lisa?</p><p>BOOTHE: Oh, and Hillary Clinton is also saying that if a - that it would  not be - it's not a fair race if Stacey Abrams doesn't win that somehow  this race is not fair. Mind you, Brian Kemp is up by 55,000 votes and  Stacey Abrams would need 18,000 to force a runoff and 16,000 to force a  recount. </p><p>There is only one county that has not certified the results of the  election. That's Gwinnett County. A 158 out of the 159 counties have  certified the results of the election. So, she is not going to find those  numbers. She is not going to be Governor of Georgia. </p><p>Yet, she refuses to concede. And now, we have Democrats like Sherrod Brown  and Hillary Clinton making up excuses and saying that somehow there's voter  suppression or something is awry if Stacey Abrams does not win this  election.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I mean, presumably, the goal is to infuriate Democrats in the  state of Florida sufficient that they come out to vote in 2020. I mean  there - I got to be thinking long-term, right?</p><p>BOOTHE: Yes. I think what's - well I think Stacey Abrams is actually  looking ahead at 2020, a possible run - run against Senator Perdue. So, I  think that's why she's trying to hang in there. But it's sort of ridiculous  to have Hillary Clinton be saying this because you essentially have two  losers being sore losers with Hillary Clinton and Stacey Abrams. </p><p>Of course, we know Hillary Clinton still refuses to accept the results of  the 2016 election and that voters just weren't that into her, didn't want  her, didn't elect her, and it's Russia's fault, and everyone else's fault.  I mean she literally wrote a book blaming everything else, but herself, for  her own election loss. So, it looks like the Democrats are the sore losers  and refuse to accept the results of the election.</p><p>CARLSON: Amazing. I don't think there's a substantive case they're making,  it doesn't sound like. Lisa Boothe, thank you for that update--</p><p>BOOTHE: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: --and all of them.</p><p>BOOTHE: Appreciate it.</p><p>CARLSON: Well elements of the Right and the Left have finally found  something they can agree on, at least for the moment, opposing corporate  welfare for Amazon. Jeff Bezos' colossus is getting billions in taxpayer  subsidies to open new headquarters in New York and Northern Virginia, and  that's not all.</p><p>As part of the deal for Amazon, the Commonwealth of Virginia is promising  to warn the company about any Freedom of Information requests it receives  about Amazon. </p><p>Kieran Lalor is the Republican in the New YorkAssembly. He sent a letter  to the Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo questioning the wisdom of this  deal, and he joins us tonight.</p><p>So, this is a little bit confusing considering that New York City has a lot  of infrastructure needs, for example. You'd think Amazon, run by the  richest guy in the world would be bringing something to the table. But  instead, the taxpayers of New York are paying him to come? How does this  work?</p><p>KIERAN MICHAEL LALOR, NEW YORK ASSEMBLYMAN, ENTREPRENEUR, AUTHOR: You  know,  it - it's incredible. It's guaranteed to be a boondoggle. What - what we're  seeing here is the most powerful, richest person in the world going to be  subsidized by regular people. We know that Amazon in - in some cases,  destroys other companies that can't compete--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>LALOR: --destroys jobs. It's one thing if that happens in our free  enterprise system. But it's yet - it's another thing to subsidize that, and  as some of the very people whose jobs and businesses are going to be  destroyed to subsidize this monster, Amazon.</p><p>CARLSON: Well Amazon is a monopoly. So, by definition, I - I think it's the  enemy of the - of the free market. Who cut this deal for the State of New  York?</p><p>LALOR: You know, it's fascinating. Governor Cuomo is giving about $1.7  billion with a B in state dollars. De Blasio is giving another billion  dollars in New York City money. And it's interesting because if this was a  good deal, Governor Cuomo stood for election just eight days ago, why  didn't he announce this or - or get word of this--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>LALOR: --out before the election? If this was a good deal, he certainly  would have done that. He knows this is a bad deal. And you know what's  interesting? You have Liberals like Cuomo and de Blasio, and what they're  doing is they're introducing a bizarro form of supply-side economics. </p><p>They're saying lower taxes, lower business costs create jobs. But we're not  going to do real supply-side economics where everybody gets a tax cut and  everybody gets to compete. We're going to - we're going to pick one winner  and let everybody else think while one big ship gets to rise.</p><p>CARLSON: Well it's such a good point. Is it weird to see self-described  Liberals acting as the servants of the richest man in the world?</p><p>LALOR: Yes. It - it is. It is very strange. But I'll - I'll give them a  little bit of credit. You know, we live in a divided time here in the  United States. They have unified the Left and the Right. The New York Times  is against this. The conservative New York Post editorial page is against  this. </p><p>The - the darling of the Left, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York City  Liberal, is against it. Upstate conservatives like me are against it.  Unions are against it. Business organizations are against it. The only ones  who seem to be for it are Amazon, Cuomo, and De Blasio.</p><p>CARLSON: In the State of Virginia, as bad as everything you've just  described is, in the State of Virginia, the Democratic State of Virginia,  run by Liberals, they have agreed to warn Amazon if news organizations file  Freedom of Information request trying to learn about Amazon. I don't think  I've ever seen anything that corrupt. Is there a justification--</p><p>LALOR: You know, that reminds me--</p><p>CARLSON: --for that?</p><p>Interviewee: --that reminds me of the Gilded Age where - where some of the  companies have become more powerful than the United States government.  That's scary stuff--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>LALOR: --right there. But I'll give - I'll give Virginia one thing. They're  getting the same number of promised jobs and they're paying one-third the  price. We're paying over $1.5 billion for about 25,000 jobs from New York  State. </p><p>Virginia's paying a half a billion, they're getting the same number of  jobs. That was one of my top questions for Governor Cuomo in my letter  today. I'd love to see the answer to that.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I mean how can you get the answer? And what can you do about  it? I mean you're a lawmaker in the State. Cuomo's not King. Can you undo  this deal?</p><p>LALOR: You know, we've had a long string of horrible economic development  deals in New York State in the six years that I've been in the legislature,  and it's very difficult to get job creation numbers. </p><p>You know, they can say, \"Oh, we're going to create so this number jobs.\"  But when you ask them, \"Well, OK, how many have you created? What's the  benchmark? Where are we, one year, two years, three years in?\" you have to  file a FOIA request, newspapers have to file a FOIA request, it's very  difficult to get information now. </p><p>He's here to cut the ribbon. When this boondoggle fails, he'll be long gone  and he'll be out of politics or running for something else, and he won't be  here to pick up the pieces, but regular New Yorkers will.</p><p>CARLSON: You got to wonder too about the location of this deal. So, people  who visit New York think it's a very rich place because New York City is  the financial capital of the world. But Upstate New York, parts of it are,  have a lot of poverty, real poverty. Americans suffering, no jobs, high  drug abuse rate, I mean you're very aware--</p><p>LALOR: Yes. It's dying, it's dying, I should say (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --well, so it's dying. That's exactly right. It's a beautiful  place with great people and it's dying. But Amazon did not choose to help  revitalize that part of the state. But they moved to the richest part of  the state. What does that tell you?</p><p>LALOR: You know, and - and, I don't want to say $25,000 or every (ph) drop  in the bucket. But if it could be a drop in the bucket, New York City, the  metropolis of New York City is a drop in the bucket. If you situated this  facility in the middle of Central New York or--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>LALOR: --the northern part of the Hudson Valley, you would save an entire  region. You would revitalize an entire region and save, you know, what was  once a thriving part of our manufacturing base. But to put it here--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>LALOR: --in New York City. Here's a point, I also would like Governor Cuomo  to answer. How do you know they weren't coming anyway? New York City is the  media capital. It's the financial capital. It has one of the most educated  dynamic workforces. </p><p>Wouldn't they be coming here anyway? I mean they're not going to go to  Peoria, right? They're going to come to New York City. So, did we just get  played?</p><p>And another thing. The - the headquarters was supposed to be one second  headquarters. Then it got put to two second headquarters, one in Virginia,  one in New York.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>LALOR: I'd like to know, did Cuomo reduce his - his bid when the  headquarters got split in two?</p><p>CARLSON: I hope you find out.</p><p>LALOR: Governor Cuomo did you--</p><p>CARLSON: If you find out--</p><p>LALOR: I'm trying, I'm trying.</p><p>CARLSON: --the answer to that, come back Assemblyman because we want to  know.</p><p>LALOR: I will. I will.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you.</p><p>LALOR: All right.</p><p>CARLSON: New York should be proud to have you.</p><p>Well tonight's an anniversary for our show. We're sentimental. We mark all  anniversaries. We'll tell you what it is, after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well tonight marks the second anniversary of this show. Since we  can't take the show out to dinner to celebrate, instead, we're going to  show you a clip of what it first looked like when it launched at 7:00  Eastern two years ago tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: That's it, the first episode of TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. We'll be  back every weeknight. What's the show going to be about? You can judge for  yourself. But here's the basic theme of it. People in power tend to lie,  not because they want to but because they can't help themselves. </p><p>That's human nature. The more power people have, the bigger the temptation  to misuse it. The press is supposed to be the watchdog against all of this  and it worked fine for a couple of centuries. Then the press decided they  had more in common with certain politicians than with readers or viewers,  and that's when it fell apart.</p><p>We're going to get back to basics here. We're going to hold the powerful  accountable, pierce pomposity, translate doublespeak, mock smugness and  barbecue nonsense, every night, hope you'll watch.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: So they made me get a haircut before - before the first show. I  totally forgot until I just saw it. </p><p>People in power tend to lie. That was the theme then. That's the theme  tonight. That will always be the theme because that is always true whether  the show's at 7 o'clock or 9 o'clock or now at 8 o'clock, we intend to  stick to those promises and tell the truth, regardless.</p><p>Thank you, by the way, for making this show pretty successful more than we  ever thought it would be. Your loyalty has meant everything and made all  the difference. We appreciate it.</p><p>That's it for us tonight. We'll be back tomorrow, the show that is the  sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink. Good night from  Washington. </p><p>Sean Hannity, live from New York City.</p><p>SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST, HANNITY: All right. First, congratulations on  two years.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you.</p><p>HANNITY: You deserve all it - all of it. You're right. We - we don't have  this job without those great audience. That is all true.</p><p>CARLSON: That's for sure. That is true.</p><p>HANNITY: All right, one thing I got to add, this is your second-year  anniversary. When you get in your 23rd years, there's a little bit of this  white stuff that's going to start sneaking in. I'm just warning you just  (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, no, no. Crease and (ph) formula--</p><p>HANNITY: Congratulations.</p><p>CARLSON: That's where I'm going.</p><p>HANNITY: All right, Tucker, thanks and--</p><p>CARLSON: Thanks, Sean.</p><p>HANNITY: --all the best, as always.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

The imaginary Central American migrant  Caravan, the one you've been told over and over doesn't exist, and if you  don't believe it, you're immoral, well turns out it does exist. It's a  physical reality. And, in fact, it's here. It's at the U.S. border.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A breakaway group from the Caravan has made its way to Tijuana. They didn't  walk, as you were told they were doing. They were driven. And now, members  are climbing over the border fence there. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The migrants were able to reach this country, thanks to the assistance of  organizations whose explicit purpose is getting people into this country  legally or not. Trace Gallagher has more details on what's going on  tonight. Trace?</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Tucker, right now, there are two  primary Central American caravans in Mexico making their way north that  include anywhere from 4,000 to 7,000 people. The first of the major  caravans is expected to arrive at the U.S. border sometime late next week.</p><p>But as you say, some 350 migrants have now arrived at the border in  Tijuana. Dozens of them scaled the fence and taunted Border Patrol  officers. Others stood at the fence or hung out on the beach. But they want  their presence known to both the Border Patrol and the media.</p><p>Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING SPANISH).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING SPANISH).</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GALLAGHER: Yes. Catracho is slang for Honduran. There are reports these  migrants broke from the main Caravan about four or five days ago and took  buses north. Impossible to tell exactly how many are from the Caravan  because the Border Patrol tells us Central American migrants sometimes  arrive in droves every single day at the U.S. border.</p><p>We certainly know that many of these migrants are being coached by groups  like Pueblo Sin Fronteras or People Without Borders, a Chicago-based  immigration advocacy group. In fact, even Left-leaning news organizations  like the L.A. Times and Washington Post have reported that members of  Pueblo Sin Fronteras are embedded with the Caravan.</p><p>And our sources tell us these types of groups are guiding the migrants. For  example, Mexico has offered most of these people both asylum and jobs. And  yet, they continue heading north. Also, they could move toward the U.S.  border in Texas. </p><p>But instead, they go the long way, hundreds of miles out of their way  toward Tijuana. And that's because the goal is to get to California, take  advantage of the State's sanctuary laws and the benefits that go along with  that.</p><p>Of course, once thousands begin arriving in the next few weeks, sympathetic  groups will be at the border to greet them. Tucker?</p><p>CARLSON: Trace Gallagher, thanks for that update. Appreciate it. </p><p>Well the images you just saw are embarrassing and awkward for the liars  you've been watching on television for the past month, the ones who've been  lecturing you that the Caravan doesn't exist and telling you that  everything is just fine at the border.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIANNA MARIE KEILAR, SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, ANCHOR, CNN: The  President, along with his favorite TV network, were beating the drum on the  looming so-called Invasion as they put it--</p><p>SAM STEIN, THE DAILY BEAST POLITICS EDITOR, MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR: The  programming on the Caravan was propaganda. It was political campaign  motivated propaganda.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And the state-run--</p><p>BILL MAHER, REAL TIME WITH BILL MAHER HOST, HBO: Trump is like a racist  Paul Revere, you know. The migrants are coming! The migrants are coming!</p><p>He keeps calling it an invasion. Yes, an invasion of strollers.</p><p>ANDERSON HAYS COOPER, AUTHOR, PRIMARY ANCHOR, ANDERSON COOPER 360 , CNN: He  made news by ratcheting up the Caravan scare talk and the troop numbers he  believes are needed to meet this alleged threat.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: The so-called invasion. So, people are streaming over the border  illegally, what would you call it? I don't know. You're not allowed to call  it anything, actually. </p><p>This is a recurring theme on the Left. Don't believe your own eyes. You're  too dumb to trust your own senses. Listen to the smart kids. They know  best. There's no crisis on the border even as hundreds of thousands of  people stream into this country every year illegally, there's no illegal  immigration crisis.</p><p>Yes, there are 22 million people living here illegally. It's not a crisis.  It's not real. They'll tell you that on a loop endlessly until the day they  retake power, at which point they'll say the crisis is real. In fact, it's  so enormous we can only solve it by granting blanket amnesty to all the  people here illegally.</p><p>There are 22 million, after all. What else can we do? This is a metaphor  really for the Left's entire program, which is built entirely on denying  reality. They deny the reality of illegal immigration. They deny the  reality of terrorism. They deny the reality of biological gender. </p><p>And woe to the person who raises his hand and tries to insert reality into  the conversation. They don't want that. When you have a program built  entirely on denial and deception, it is not surprising you're also against  free speech. You can't afford to have an honest conversation. </p><p>We'd like to have an honest conversation. That's why we're speaking tonight  to Bryan Dean Wright. He's a Democrat and a former CIA Officer, and he  joins us on set. So, I think there are arguments in favor of letting these  people in, even illegally. That - that's a real position.</p><p>BRYAN DEAN WRIGHT, FORMER CIA OPS OFFICER, OPINION WRITER: Sure.</p><p>CARLSON: And maybe you can make the case it's good for America, it's good  for our economy, maybe you think it's bad for America and you want it  anyway. I mean there are all kinds of arguments. But what's not an argument  is telling me that I'm a racist for acknowledging the reality of what is  happening and that's the position I'm seeing on television.</p><p>WRIGHT: You're correct. So, here's what we should be starting with this  conversation, facts, which--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>WRIGHT: --we typically don't, right? So, the facts tell us that first  generation immigrants are a net drain on our economy, second and then (ph)  eventually third generation become net contributors. That's the fact,  right?</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>WRIGHT: Secondarily, we know that the folks who are coming across the  border, 1,000 to 2,000 people each day, again, having kids then in a year  or two years down the road, we're talking hundreds of thousands of people  all told that those folks are - are initially, anyway, a burden to our  economy.</p><p>Now, whether or not they contribute something many years down the road,  that is an open question. We should be able to have this conversation  irrespective--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>WRIGHT: --of our party affiliation, and come to a conclusion where we say,  \"Look, we need to have a thoughtful, strong border, prevent some of these  folks from coming across. And if we don't, shame on us, as a country.\"</p><p>CARLSON: Well, I agree with that. I mean I do think, as you just said, that  this is in many ways an economic question. And I don't understand how you  can look at the projections for what automation is about to do to our  economy, eliminating a huge percentage of all low-skilled labor, all low- skilled labor in this country, and see what we need is more low-skilled  labor. How can you make that argument?</p><p>WRIGHT: You can't. The top 10 jobs that we see immigrants take, both legal  and illegal, make less than 20 bucks an hour, which, by the way, the Obama  Administration said, jobs earning less than 20 bucks an hour are going to  be automated into obsolescence.</p><p>So, the argument that we need an increasing number of poorly qualified, you  know, folks who don't speak English, don't have the--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>WRIGHT: --skillsets that really we need for, the common (ph) economy, well  frankly, the one that's already here that's a - that's a silly argument. It  just it doesn't hold water.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I always want to believe the best about people and that they  have honorable motives. And I think most people do have honorable motives.  But if you can't even marshal an economic argument in favor of your - of  your immigration policy, I'm left believing maybe it's only about getting  more votes for your party.</p><p>WRIGHT: How cynical?</p><p>CARLSON: I don't want to be cynical. I just don't - I just don't see--</p><p>WRIGHT: Well--</p><p>CARLSON: --any other rationale.</p><p>WRIGHT: Look - look, I - I appreciate the argument. I think you're - you  may be correct. There are definitely some parts of the party, make no  mistake about it, they want open borders. </p><p>I mean just the other day, I think, it was yesterday, in fact, Senator  Gillibrand from New York was buddy-buddy with the guy, Sean McElwee who  wants to remove the border between the United States and Mexico, all right? </p><p>So, there is an element within this country, not just the activist  community but, in fact, within the - the Left of this nation, my own party,  I - I hate to say, who want open borders. </p><p>And that, of course, then feeds into this issue well - well what, not only  how do we take care of them but, ultimately, who are they going to vote  for? And that that there is a - a play there that I think one could - could  argue this is a political play. This is about vote. So, I think it's fair  to have that - that concern and that fear.</p><p>CARLSON: If I hear one more moron on cable news cry racism when somebody  tries to have an honest conversation about what this means, I swear I'm  getting rid of my television. I mean that.</p><p>WRIGHT: I don't blame you.</p><p>CARLSON: I can't - can't handle it, no.</p><p>WRIGHT: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Bryan Dean Wright, thank you very much.</p><p>WRIGHT: Always a pleasure.</p><p>CARLSON: Great to see you.</p><p>Well the Florida recount continues tonight. Democrats are battling to  change the results by any means necessary. That will not surprise you. The  details might though, and we have them after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well the recount continues tonight in this country's least  competent vote-counting state. The upside of all of this Florida recount  stuff by the way is a man named Craig Patrick. This is the third night in a  row we've had him on, and we're always grateful to see him. Political  Editor, Chief Investigator for WTVT Fox in Tampa Bay, he joins us with a  recap. </p><p>Craig, what is happening?</p><p>CRAIG PATRICK, WTVT FOX TAMPA BAY POLITICAL EDITOR AND CHIEF INVESTIGATOR:  We have more dueling gaffes, once again, focused on South Florida,  predominantly Democrats. </p><p>I'll start with the good news for Senator Bill Nelson. We now know that the  Democratic Party did, in fact, rally his supporters to make sure they get  their mail-in ballots fixed if there are problems and finalized before the  deadline.</p><p>The bad news for Bill Nelson is that they got the dates mixed up and they  gave the wrong deadline telling people that you've got until Thursday,  November 8th. The election was Tuesday, November 6th. </p><p>And the evidence for this is leading to the work of the Democratic Party of  Florida, sending out these government forms writing in the wrong date,  effectively confusing people and leaving, maybe, a lot of Democrats to say,  \"Oh Gilligan (ph).\" </p><p>And this is something that seems to have affected voters specifically in  Broward County and three other counties. So, stop and think about that for  a moment. </p><p>You have the Democratic Party, apparently, one, sabotaging conceivably Bill  Nelson, two, disenfranchising their own voters in this blunder, three,  shooting themselves in the foot, four, trying to orchestrate this deadline  rush not knowing what the deadline was and, five, conceivably breaking  election law, all in one fell swoop.</p><p>This is something that the state has sent over to the feds to investigate.  We'll see how that works out. One other blunder that stands out that has  risen to the surface, you have continuing woes in Palm Beach County in  Southeast Florida, where you have faulty voting machines.</p><p>Apparently, when they get stressed, they are old, they're aging to the  point where they spit out erroneous results, which is causing the Election  Managers there to recount votes that had already been recounted. </p><p>We're calling them the Monty Python machines because they - you feed them  through, it's OK, one, two, five, no, no, three. And with this, you have  Palm Beach County now racing the clock along with Broward County.</p><p>In other news, Governor Rick Scott, under pressure to recuse himself from  certifying the results of the - of his own disputed race, has done that.  He's moving on to - to Washington now. </p><p>And Mitch McConnell introduced him as the new Senator from Florida, which  is premature. It is presumptuous. But it is also increasingly likely as  well because while Bill Nelson has filed all of these legal challenges,  time is running out. </p><p>And if you look at the math, even if Nelson prevails on every single one,  which would seem to be a reach there just does not appear to be enough  ballots to get him where he needs to be unless there is some kind of big  machine malfunction, which based on the things we've seen is not  inconceivable but we'll find out one way or the other about that, most  likely by our deadline of the machine recount--</p><p>CARLSON: It's - it's unbelievable.</p><p>PATRICK: --tomorrow afternoon.</p><p>CARLSON: It's--</p><p>PATRICK: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --it's been 18 years. You'd think it would be running like a Swiss  Canton by now, but it's Florida. Craig, thank you very much for that  update. Appreciate it.</p><p>PATRICK: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Rubio has been raising alarm over the State of Florida's election  irregularities for quite some time, and he joins us tonight on set.  Senator, thanks very much--</p><p>MARCO ANTONIO RUBIO, JUNIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR FOR THE STATE OF FLORIDA,  REPUBLICAN PARTY MEMBER: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: --for coming on.</p><p>RUBIO: Thanks for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I - I know you're a Senator, represents the State of Florida--</p><p>RUBIO: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --and you're pro-Florida. But as objectively as you can, what is  the core problem with elections in Florida as of now (ph)?</p><p>RUBIO: Well actually there isn't. I mean 65 of 67 counties did it right.  You know, Miami-Dade County is right on the border of Broward, 60 percent  voted for Democrats in the Senate race and the governor's race, they got  all their votes in on time. </p><p>And then they did their recount on time. It is largely focused on two  counties and one, in particular, Broward County, where you have an inept  and incompetent Elections Director who's done this in the past.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>RUBIO: And so, when someone, you know, a perfect example is these  provisional ballots, right, it's people that show up and vote. You don't  show up in the system. They let you vote but they put your vote in an  envelope, and then they make sure - they verify you.</p><p>She decided to take 205 of them and count them on her own without  submitting them the right way to this provisional - to the Canvassing  Board. When that was discovered, she said, \"All right, I'll give it to the  Canvassing Board.\" </p><p>But she had already separated the ballots from the envelopes. They found 20  of them to be invalid. But then there - there's no way to match the ballots  to the envelope when you separate them. So then, she submitted 205 votes to  the state out of that batch, 20 of them, at least 20 of them, are invalid  votes.</p><p>Now she claims that they're not part of the count, which contradicts what  her lawyer said a few days ago. So, when someone that incompetent is  sitting on thousands of ballots, we don't know how many they are, she's not  regularly reporting them, of course, we're going to be concerned about that  and, of course, we're going to be concerned about the - the reporting.</p><p>And the second state of play is it's now lawyer time. Lawyers are arguing  to the state that - to the judge, they're trying to get a federal judge to  do two things. One, throw out state law when it comes to voter intent. </p><p>They're going to do a manual recount in the Senate race of all the ballots  that either didn't vote in the Senate race or double-voted. And there's a  very specific law for what voter intent is. You know, if you - if you  circle Rick Scott or Bill Nelson, that's fine. But you have to have done it  throughout the ballot.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>RUBIO: The machine won't read it. They want to throw out that standard and  just let it be, I don't know what.</p><p>CARLSON: Can you change the standard after the voters cast votes (ph)?</p><p>RUBIO: That's my concern. I mean, look, if you say there was a problem with  the lawsuit (ph), the legislature is there for. But to have a judge come in  and announce that Florida law, after the election we're going to change the  rules in hopes of influencing the outcome, that, to me, is stealing the  election.</p><p>And then, they also want to force them to count every mail ballot, even the  ones in which the signature didn't match, the signature on file for the  voter. These are the two fundamental arguments before--</p><p>CARLSON: But just to ask (ph)--</p><p>RUBIO: --federal court.</p><p>CARLSON: --is that the requirement that the signature has to match?</p><p>RUBIO: Of course, yes, I mean--</p><p>CARLSON: So, if that's the existing requirement, how can they argue it's no  longer the requirement?</p><p>RUBIO: Because they're saying it's an arbitrary standard and who's making  the decision--</p><p>CARLSON: But that was the standard on Election Day, right?</p><p>RUBIO: Correct. And I think that's what I'm hoping, a reasonable judge, no  matter how activist it might be, would argue that's a good point. You  should have raised it before the election, and that's something for the  legislature to fix. But we're not going to change the rules of the election  after the election to influence the outcome, because if you do it, it's  stealing an election.</p><p>CARLSON: Amazing. So, I want to ask you about the question of nationalism.  The President described himself as a nationalist recently. He was attacked  by the leader of France for doing that. You recently published a Wall  Street Journal op-ed defending the idea of nationalism.</p><p>RUBIO: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Why is nationalism a necessary concept in modern America?</p><p>RUBIO: Well, American nationalism.</p><p>CARLSON: Of course.</p><p>RUBIO: What is our identity? Our identity is not a common race, ethnicity.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>RUBIO: In fact, America is a de facto rejection of that. It is  fundamentally premised on this notion. We are all children of God. We are  born with God - we're all created equal by our Creator. And we are given  equal rights to life, liberty, and to pursue happiness. </p><p>That is our national identity. It is deeply rooted in morals and in values.  It, in fact, explains everything this nation has done internationally and  domestically. We should be proud of that identity. We should defend that  national identity.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>RUBIO: Number two, I think most of the viewers watching this program would  be shocked to think that my job is to represent Belgium or my job is to  represent - I don't have nothing - I have nothing against Belgium. I always  pick on Belgium or Luxembourg. They have their own system of government.  That doesn't mean I need to be hostile towards them.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>RUBIO: And it may be in our national interest to work with them. I think  NATO was in our national interest and is. I think a lot of our alliances  are built on that. And, in fact, our national - our national - our national  identity as a nation that believes in the equality of all people is what  has caused us to defend democracy and feed hungry--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>RUBIO: --people all over the world. We should be proud of that. But, as a  government leader, my fundamental obligation, first and foremost, is to  work on behalf of the American people. And most of the time, if not all the  time, we can do that without hurting other people around the world.</p><p>CARLSON: It's hard to know what the argument against what you just said  might be. Why would people--</p><p>RUBIO: Well--</p><p>CARLSON: --object? No, I sincerely because--</p><p>RUBIO: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --it's important to understand what - what the objections are.  What do you think they could be--</p><p>RUBIO: Well, there are two.</p><p>CARLSON: --willing to do (ph)?</p><p>RUBIO: One is they ascribe to nationalism, sort of the nationalism of the  Nazis or somebody else. That's ethnic and racial nationalism. I'm not  talking about ethnic nationalism.</p><p>CARLSON: Of course, not.</p><p>RUBIO: I'm talking about a national identity that actually is completely  relevant to your ethnicity. In fact, you didn't (ph) have to be born here.  If you come here legally, you can be a U.S. citizen. It's one of the great  things about America. Some of the people who love America are the most are  the people who are Americans by choice, they--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>RUBIO: --because they know what life is like in another country. Then  there's another school of thought that \"No, we are citizens of the  international community, and we have obligations to the rest of the world,\"  which I would agree within the confines of our national interest. </p><p>In fact, I've always argued that the best thing for the world is a strong  and prosperous America because our values infuse our decision-making and -  and - and so much of what we do. So, there are people that actually - I  think that's what Macron was arguing. </p><p>And that is that France's obligations under him anyways are not just for  the - to the French people, but to the sort of amorphous international  community, which I'm not against. I've defended international organizations  so long as they are in the national interest of the United States.</p><p>CARLSON: Because that's the country you represent.</p><p>RUBIO: Yes. I mean I swore an allegiance to the oath. I swore an oath to  the Constitution of the United States. I work for the American people. And  I believe I can do so while still being strong allies of Japan, strong  allies of Great - Great Britain, strong allies of--</p><p>CARLSON: Of course.</p><p>RUBIO: --our countries around - all these countries around the world,  especially when our interests intersect.</p><p>CARLSON: I think this is a vital conversation and I'm glad that we're  having it and I'm glad you're--</p><p>RUBIO: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: --articulating it so clearly. Thank you, Senator.</p><p>RUBIO: Thank you for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: Well there's a battle over free speech going on in Washington  right now. Good. We're for free speech. The question is, are the people who  claim they're defending free speech actually defenders of speech? #Basta  (ph), whatever that means. We'll investigate the assault on free speech  after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: In the past couple of days, you've heard a lot of huffing and  puffing about free speech and freedom of the press, and how those freedoms  are currently imperiled by the White House. </p><p>And to be clear, we are for free speech, unfettered, absolute free speech,  the kind of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment, and ratified  consistently by the Supreme Court. We've defended that kind of free speech  almost every night here for the past two years.</p><p>Many others, mostly on the Left, have attacked speech. So, we know who's  for free speech and who's against it. And we cannot help but notice that  some of free speech's greatest enemies are now posing as its defenders, all  of a sudden.</p><p>Take CNN, for example. It was CNN that almost single-handedly led the  campaign to have broadcaster Alex Jones banished from the internet on the  grounds that they didn't like what Jones had to say. Ultimately, CNN  succeeded in doing that. </p><p>The network convinced every major tech platform to ban Jones and his outlet  Infowars. You don't have to like Alex Jones to see that as a terrifying  loss for free speech because it was exactly that. But CNN was not done  trying to silence its critics.</p><p>Last year, the cable network threatened an anonymous Reddit user for  creating an anti-CNN meme. CNN threatened to expose his identity and ruin  his life if it ever was criticized by him again. Now, CNN is claiming to  defend free speech only when it's their speech.</p><p>You'll notice by the way that CNN did not object when the government  threatened to imprison employees of the cable channel RT, if they didn't  register as foreign agents. Yes, RT is owned by a foreign government, so is  the BBC.</p><p>Until last year, much of the New York Times was owned by a foreign  national. This is true of other news organizations, none of which has ever  registered as a foreign agent. But because RT is owned by Russia, which the  Left believes got Donald Trump elected, it is fine with CNN if they are  bullied and silenced.</p><p>So, call CNN what you will but don't pretend they are defenders of the  First Amendment. They are not.</p><p>Victor Davis Hanson is a Fellow at the Hoover Institution and a close  watcher of all this. He joins us tonight. So, I just want to be clear,  we're always for free speech, especially speech that's offensive, even by  obnoxious White House Correspondents.</p><p>But to see a channel that has lobbied against the right of others to say  what they think is true to all of a sudden emerge as this defender of the  First Amendment is nauseating.</p><p>VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, HOOVER INSTITUTION SENIOR FELLOW, AMERICAN CLASSICIST,  MILITARY HISTORIAN, COLUMNIST, FARMER: Yes. I - I think when people saw the  suit, they asked themselves was there anything in the past that Jim Acosta  had said negatively that got him kicked out and the answer was no. Was  there anybody MSNBC, did they get kicked out? The answer's no.</p><p>Do other CNN reporters get kicked out? No, they have passes. So, it was a  particular type of behavior. And I mean if you're arguing a case before the  Supreme Court, you can't go in there and take pictures or - or interrupt  the justice, they'll kick you out. And if you do it another time they'll  say we don't want you pleading the case before the Supreme Court.</p><p>He - Jim Acosta can't go in there barefooted, and say, I want to express  myself. There are certain protocols and norms of behavior and he's violated  them. That's one issue. And then, it's not - this is sort of a psychodrama,  Tucker.</p><p>I mean we - remember that the prior Administration monitored 20 AP  reporters and Fox's own James Rosen. Nobody filed a suit on behalf of James  Rosen from CNN, and said, \"My God, we only learned in 2013 that three years  ago the man was being surveilled by the Attorney General. This is a  violation of press freedom.\" We didn't hear that.</p><p>CARLSON: And - and you're not hearing CNN say anything about the voices  being silenced now online by the big tech companies--</p><p>HANSON: No, you've not.</p><p>CARLSON: --because they have unfashionable views. Can you, as a  philosophical matter, support free speech in some cases but not in others?</p><p>HANSON: I don't think you can. And then we get to another - we - if we want  to talk about ethics and the protocols of the White House, see, CNN, 93  percent of their coverage according to Shorenstein is bias, and Trump had  no problem with that. </p><p>He has no problem when the CNN host Kathy Griffin holds a decapitated  facsimile of his head. They have no problem when Anderson Cooper uses  obscenity or Rez - Reza Aslan says he's a piece of crap or people that are  guests and panelists say that he's a Russian asset or agent or they invoke  the Holocaust for comparison or people say that he's radicalized more  people than ISIS, remember that? </p><p>And they have these stories they keep running, you know, that Scaramucci  has involved with a Russian hedge fund, false, that Trump knew in advance  of the Russian meeting, that Donald Trump Jr. had access to the WikiLeaks.</p><p>I remember when CNN was just explaining to us as a matter of fact that  James Comey within a matter of hours was going to go into a Congressional  testimony and swear that Donald Trump had mischaracterized their private  meeting about whether he was subject to prosecution (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: Well it does - doesn't make sense though (ph)--</p><p>HANSON: --it was all--</p><p>CARLSON: --because they--</p><p>HANSON: --it was all false.</p><p>CARLSON: --CNN has argued that others should lose their voice, should be  silenced--</p><p>HANSON: Yes, yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --because they're \"conspiracy theorists.\"</p><p>HANSON: Theorists.</p><p>CARLSON: But you're listing conspiracy theories that they have promulgated  on their air.</p><p>HANSON: Yes. And they're also arguing that their type of behavior should  not be subject to public scrutiny, but only Donald Trump's could (ph),  protocol, manners, politeness. </p><p>And that's what Trump's argument is it's not the content, it's not the  prejudice, it's not the unprofessionalism in the past, it's this particular  time you went over the edge, and you disrupted. You were rude. You took  over a - an optional press conference, nothing in the Constitution that  says he has to have a press conference.</p><p>I can remember President Reagan saying, \"I can't hear you.\" And when - when  somebody yells to Donald Trump, he runs over and talks. So, it's not only  hypocritical on their fact (ph) but it's a - it's a journalistic  organization that has violated the ethos of reporting and journalism then  calling the kettle black and saying you can't do this, this is against  White House--</p><p>CARLSON: I know.</p><p>HANSON: --protocol.</p><p>CARLSON: It's a - it's a shame--</p><p>HANSON: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --to see a buffoon elevated to--</p><p>HANSON: It is.</p><p>CARLSON: --martyr status. But look, now that CNN's on the side of free  speech, I'm sure they'll be advocating for the right--</p><p>HANSON: I wish they have.</p><p>CARLSON: --of all people to say what they need.</p><p>HANSON: They could have sued in 2013 on the behalf of Fox and--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>HANSON: --and the - and the AP.</p><p>CARLSON: Victor Davis Hanson, a man with a long memory.</p><p>HANSON: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: And we appreciate that.</p><p>HANSON: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you.</p><p>Well there used to be dozens of pro-Second Amendment Democrats in the  Congress. There aren't anymore. Now the party is increasingly calling for  disarming the public. Does the public want that? That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Anyway if (ph) Democrats is entering the Congress, of course, one  of their top interests, they say, one of their top public policy  priorities, disarming the population. </p><p>Just a decade ago, about a quarter of candidates backed by the NRA were, in  fact, Democrats. Now, the number of NRA-backed House Democrats is three.  Meanwhile, a new poll of Democrats in early primary states says their top  issue after single-payer healthcare is repealing the Second Amendment in  order to ban guns.</p><p>Richard Goodstein is a lawyer, a former adviser to Bill and Hillary Clinton  and she - he joins us tonight. Richard, thanks for coming on.</p><p>RICHARD GOODSTEIN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, POLITICAL CONSULTANT, FORMER  CLINTON ADVISER: Sure.</p><p>CARLSON: So, is this really the time, as the country's becoming more  chaotic, to disarm the population?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes. So, I can't really speak for these people who respond to  this poll. I can tell you what Nancy Pelosi is talking about, what House  Democrats are talking about, which is background checks, which 90-percent  plus of the public supports, which got 54 votes in the Senate when it was  Toomey and Manchin, putting a bill to require gun background--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. OK. You know what I mean (ph)--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --checks.</p><p>CARLSON: --we've been through this a million times but--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --but if - if Democrats polled and it seems like a legitimate poll  say their number two issue after socialized medicine is repealing the  Second Amendment, preparatory to disarming the population. You know, there  are going to be calls for that. </p><p>If the people, voters want it, you know, their - their representatives will  call for it. Is this the time? And should it make us, the rest of us, a  little nervous as America's getting crazier, obviously, to disarm normal  people?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes. Again, I just don't buy the notion that that was a legit  poll that even a quarter of Democrats think repealing the Second Amendment.  I--</p><p>CARLSON: What do you think of that?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: What - what I think the Democrats are saying is look, is what  Justice Scalia said in the famous Heller decision, the one case that really  went to the Supreme Court where he said, \"A person has a right to a handgun  to protect their home. Period.\" And that legitimate regulation of guns in  terms of places that they can't be taken, schools, places that, you know,  conditions on their sale--</p><p>CARLSON: But we have all those laws already. I mean--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: But I'm saying those are--</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --so, no one's talking about repealing that.</p><p>CARLSON: No, no. People are and let's be - I mean let's stop lying just for  a second--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --you're not going to stop mass shootings really unless you take  all the guns away. That's the truth. And everyone knows it. I mean,  honestly.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: So, that's kind of the goal, and everyone really knows that. And  I'm just wondering like what's the argument here? So, if you're arguing  simultaneously that the police are racist, they can't be trusted, which  Beto and lots of other candidates have argued, and also the population  can't be trusted to defend itself or have firearms, what are you really  saying?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: I think what Democrats are saying and, frankly, Republicans wish  they had been saying it because the ones backed by the NRA, Barbara  Comstock, Mike Coffman in Colorado lost to Democrats saying, \"We want  background check laws, and so forth.\"</p><p>And what they're saying is that things have gotten out of whack. The United  States is unique in the world. It's not a mental health problem. There are  mental health problems everywhere else in the world. But we have this  horrible gun problem here. So--</p><p>CARLSON: No, but actually we don't because most Americans are not a threat  to anybody. And this is what makes me nervous is a small percentage of  people commit the overwhelming majority of shootings. But we're not  thinking clearly about how to disarm them. </p><p>All these laws apply to me. I pose no threat to anyone, and I really want  to be able to defend myself. I know you do too. So, why not leave me out of  it and normal people out of it who pose no conceivable threat and focus on  the potential threats? But no one's ever - no one's ever up for doing that.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: We all have to be disarmed.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Of course.</p><p>CARLSON: Why?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Well again, no one's talking about disarming anybody.</p><p>CARLSON: No, they are no, no--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: What Nancy - well - well - what - what - what-- </p><p>CARLSON: --no, we (ph)--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --elected officials are saying is we should have background  checks, so lunatics--</p><p>CARLSON: --no, but that's not all--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --don't have the--</p><p>CARLSON: --no, but--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --access to guns.</p><p>CARLSON: --but the - the most - the most recent shooting and many of these  shootings have been committed by people who went through background checks.  Stephen Paddock went through a background check. The latest shooter in,  obviously, who we just saw in California went through a background check.  The truth is it's not just background checks, which nobody really opposes.  It's--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: No (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --limiting the kind of firearms you can buy, limiting the size of  the magazines you can use, limiting the kinds of ammunition you can  purchase. These are laws, restrictions that affect normal people who should  be able to--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --defend themselves. Why is that?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Look, when you say that nobody really opposes, when you get  Republican leaders here please ask them--</p><p>CARLSON: No, it's irrelevant (ph)--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --to affirm that that (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --we already have--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --they don't - well it's relevant (ph) look--</p><p>CARLSON: --but hold on--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --never we had (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --we even (ph) have background - I mean let's be serious.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Background checks are - I buy guns, so I know.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: They're in place. You go through them when you buy a gun. Why  would a magazine restriction or an ammo restriction or a so-called assault  rifle restriction apply to me? What isn't - why am I not trusted to buy any  kind of gun I want? I'm confused, honestly.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Well, again, the analogy I would use is to the ways we basically  made cars safer. There used to be a lot more fatalities on the road, and we  instituted things like seatbelts and - and airbags and other things,  vehicles that could basically crush without crushing the passenger. And -  and background checks is the first way to go--</p><p>CARLSON: No, no, but - but then - then why - no, sincere question though.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: The assault rifle ban, a gun that looks scary should be banned,  OK? That's the position and a lot of candidates (ph) say they should be  confiscated. Why should my right to buy that gun be abridged? Why can't I  be--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: It's not being--</p><p>CARLSON: --no, it is though.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Well no one's being - if you object to being--</p><p>CARLSON: --no (ph), but why shouldn't I be able to buy that gun? I'm an  American citizen. I don't pose a threat to anybody. Why can't I have that  gun?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: I - I think the concern is that people get their hands on  assault weapons who commit these crimes. If you want to use your assault  weapon on a range, guess what? Go to a range and keep your gun there and  use it there.</p><p>CARLSON: Well maybe I want it in my house. And why - I - I don't  understand. So, what--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: You want assault (ph) weapons--</p><p>CARLSON: --what you're saying is--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --to defend your house.</p><p>CARLSON: --no, what you're saying is we don't trust the population of the  country. We don't think you're autonomous. We don't think you ought to be  able to make these decisions for yourself. We just don't trust you. And I'm  saying, why would I ever vote for someone who wouldn't trust me to have an  AR-15 at home, honestly?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Well - well, again, it's like saying we didn't trust people to  drive without seatbelts or airbags and so forth. But we instituted things  that were going to make people safer. What we're saying is it'd be--</p><p>CARLSON: No. But you don't use a car to defend yourself and you do use a  firearm to defend yourself, and why wouldn't you trust--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Cars kill people.</p><p>CARLSON: --no, why wouldn't you trust? There are 330 million people in the  country. Hundreds of millions of them pose no conceivable threat to  anybody.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: So, why can't we think of a law that spares them these  regulations? Is anybody even trying to think of that?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Of course, they are but the--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, really? Who?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --well, but again, we're - we're taking it step up step. We're  taking it step by step.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, we are.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: I mean a - ask any suburban mother, that's the problem  politically is that these people that--</p><p>CARLSON: I don't care about the politics.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --that you lost last time are going to be lost--</p><p>CARLSON: I'm just telling you--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --because they don't want more guns in school.</p><p>CARLSON: --the Left is making this country chaotic and scary--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --and simultaneously trying to keep me from defending myself. And  that's not--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: The voters just happen not to buy (ph) what--</p><p>CARLSON: --going to happen.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --you just said.</p><p>CARLSON: I don't care.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: And - and that's why the Democrats won this time (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: I don't care.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: OK.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. We'll see.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Richard, thank you.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Amazon is getting billions of taxpayer dollars to expand into two  of America's richest cities. It's corporate welfare. The Democratic Party  is all on board. And anyone who questions it could be investigated by an  incoming Committee Chairman. What's going on? We'll get to that in just a  minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well Florida isn't the only state with a high-stakes recount in  progress. Just to the north, in Georgia, Democrat Stacey Abrams (ph) has  refused to concede in the Governor's race. Legal challenges are flying  everywhere. </p><p>Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown says that if Abrams is not declared the  winner, then almost by definition Republicans, quote, stole the race. Lisa  Boothe of Independent Women's Voice has been following this for us.</p><p>LISA BOOTHE, FOX NEWS CO-HOST, OUTNUMBERED, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE  SENIOR FELLOW: Hi, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: She joins us now with an update. Hey, Lisa?</p><p>BOOTHE: Oh, and Hillary Clinton is also saying that if a - that it would  not be - it's not a fair race if Stacey Abrams doesn't win that somehow  this race is not fair. Mind you, Brian Kemp is up by 55,000 votes and  Stacey Abrams would need 18,000 to force a runoff and 16,000 to force a  recount. </p><p>There is only one county that has not certified the results of the  election. That's Gwinnett County. A 158 out of the 159 counties have  certified the results of the election. So, she is not going to find those  numbers. She is not going to be Governor of Georgia. </p><p>Yet, she refuses to concede. And now, we have Democrats like Sherrod Brown  and Hillary Clinton making up excuses and saying that somehow there's voter  suppression or something is awry if Stacey Abrams does not win this  election.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I mean, presumably, the goal is to infuriate Democrats in the  state of Florida sufficient that they come out to vote in 2020. I mean  there - I got to be thinking long-term, right?</p><p>BOOTHE: Yes. I think what's - well I think Stacey Abrams is actually  looking ahead at 2020, a possible run - run against Senator Perdue. So, I  think that's why she's trying to hang in there. But it's sort of ridiculous  to have Hillary Clinton be saying this because you essentially have two  losers being sore losers with Hillary Clinton and Stacey Abrams. </p><p>Of course, we know Hillary Clinton still refuses to accept the results of  the 2016 election and that voters just weren't that into her, didn't want  her, didn't elect her, and it's Russia's fault, and everyone else's fault.  I mean she literally wrote a book blaming everything else, but herself, for  her own election loss. So, it looks like the Democrats are the sore losers  and refuse to accept the results of the election.</p><p>CARLSON: Amazing. I don't think there's a substantive case they're making,  it doesn't sound like. Lisa Boothe, thank you for that update--</p><p>BOOTHE: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: --and all of them.</p><p>BOOTHE: Appreciate it.</p><p>CARLSON: Well elements of the Right and the Left have finally found  something they can agree on, at least for the moment, opposing corporate  welfare for Amazon. Jeff Bezos' colossus is getting billions in taxpayer  subsidies to open new headquarters in New York and Northern Virginia, and  that's not all.</p><p>As part of the deal for Amazon, the Commonwealth of Virginia is promising  to warn the company about any Freedom of Information requests it receives  about Amazon. </p><p>Kieran Lalor is the Republican in the New YorkAssembly. He sent a letter  to the Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo questioning the wisdom of this  deal, and he joins us tonight.</p><p>So, this is a little bit confusing considering that New York City has a lot  of infrastructure needs, for example. You'd think Amazon, run by the  richest guy in the world would be bringing something to the table. But  instead, the taxpayers of New York are paying him to come? How does this  work?</p><p>KIERAN MICHAEL LALOR, NEW YORK ASSEMBLYMAN, ENTREPRENEUR, AUTHOR: You  know,  it - it's incredible. It's guaranteed to be a boondoggle. What - what we're  seeing here is the most powerful, richest person in the world going to be  subsidized by regular people. We know that Amazon in - in some cases,  destroys other companies that can't compete--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>LALOR: --destroys jobs. It's one thing if that happens in our free  enterprise system. But it's yet - it's another thing to subsidize that, and  as some of the very people whose jobs and businesses are going to be  destroyed to subsidize this monster, Amazon.</p><p>CARLSON: Well Amazon is a monopoly. So, by definition, I - I think it's the  enemy of the - of the free market. Who cut this deal for the State of New  York?</p><p>LALOR: You know, it's fascinating. Governor Cuomo is giving about $1.7  billion with a B in state dollars. De Blasio is giving another billion  dollars in New York City money. And it's interesting because if this was a  good deal, Governor Cuomo stood for election just eight days ago, why  didn't he announce this or - or get word of this--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>LALOR: --out before the election? If this was a good deal, he certainly  would have done that. He knows this is a bad deal. And you know what's  interesting? You have Liberals like Cuomo and de Blasio, and what they're  doing is they're introducing a bizarro form of supply-side economics. </p><p>They're saying lower taxes, lower business costs create jobs. But we're not  going to do real supply-side economics where everybody gets a tax cut and  everybody gets to compete. We're going to - we're going to pick one winner  and let everybody else think while one big ship gets to rise.</p><p>CARLSON: Well it's such a good point. Is it weird to see self-described  Liberals acting as the servants of the richest man in the world?</p><p>LALOR: Yes. It - it is. It is very strange. But I'll - I'll give them a  little bit of credit. You know, we live in a divided time here in the  United States. They have unified the Left and the Right. The New York Times  is against this. The conservative New York Post editorial page is against  this. </p><p>The - the darling of the Left, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York City  Liberal, is against it. Upstate conservatives like me are against it.  Unions are against it. Business organizations are against it. The only ones  who seem to be for it are Amazon, Cuomo, and De Blasio.</p><p>CARLSON: In the State of Virginia, as bad as everything you've just  described is, in the State of Virginia, the Democratic State of Virginia,  run by Liberals, they have agreed to warn Amazon if news organizations file  Freedom of Information request trying to learn about Amazon. I don't think  I've ever seen anything that corrupt. Is there a justification--</p><p>LALOR: You know, that reminds me--</p><p>CARLSON: --for that?</p><p>Interviewee: --that reminds me of the Gilded Age where - where some of the  companies have become more powerful than the United States government.  That's scary stuff--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>LALOR: --right there. But I'll give - I'll give Virginia one thing. They're  getting the same number of promised jobs and they're paying one-third the  price. We're paying over $1.5 billion for about 25,000 jobs from New York  State. </p><p>Virginia's paying a half a billion, they're getting the same number of  jobs. That was one of my top questions for Governor Cuomo in my letter  today. I'd love to see the answer to that.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I mean how can you get the answer? And what can you do about  it? I mean you're a lawmaker in the State. Cuomo's not King. Can you undo  this deal?</p><p>LALOR: You know, we've had a long string of horrible economic development  deals in New York State in the six years that I've been in the legislature,  and it's very difficult to get job creation numbers. </p><p>You know, they can say, \"Oh, we're going to create so this number jobs.\"  But when you ask them, \"Well, OK, how many have you created? What's the  benchmark? Where are we, one year, two years, three years in?\" you have to  file a FOIA request, newspapers have to file a FOIA request, it's very  difficult to get information now. </p><p>He's here to cut the ribbon. When this boondoggle fails, he'll be long gone  and he'll be out of politics or running for something else, and he won't be  here to pick up the pieces, but regular New Yorkers will.</p><p>CARLSON: You got to wonder too about the location of this deal. So, people  who visit New York think it's a very rich place because New York City is  the financial capital of the world. But Upstate New York, parts of it are,  have a lot of poverty, real poverty. Americans suffering, no jobs, high  drug abuse rate, I mean you're very aware--</p><p>LALOR: Yes. It's dying, it's dying, I should say (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --well, so it's dying. That's exactly right. It's a beautiful  place with great people and it's dying. But Amazon did not choose to help  revitalize that part of the state. But they moved to the richest part of  the state. What does that tell you?</p><p>LALOR: You know, and - and, I don't want to say $25,000 or every (ph) drop  in the bucket. But if it could be a drop in the bucket, New York City, the  metropolis of New York City is a drop in the bucket. If you situated this  facility in the middle of Central New York or--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>LALOR: --the northern part of the Hudson Valley, you would save an entire  region. You would revitalize an entire region and save, you know, what was  once a thriving part of our manufacturing base. But to put it here--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>LALOR: --in New York City. Here's a point, I also would like Governor Cuomo  to answer. How do you know they weren't coming anyway? New York City is the  media capital. It's the financial capital. It has one of the most educated  dynamic workforces. </p><p>Wouldn't they be coming here anyway? I mean they're not going to go to  Peoria, right? They're going to come to New York City. So, did we just get  played?</p><p>And another thing. The - the headquarters was supposed to be one second  headquarters. Then it got put to two second headquarters, one in Virginia,  one in New York.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>LALOR: I'd like to know, did Cuomo reduce his - his bid when the  headquarters got split in two?</p><p>CARLSON: I hope you find out.</p><p>LALOR: Governor Cuomo did you--</p><p>CARLSON: If you find out--</p><p>LALOR: I'm trying, I'm trying.</p><p>CARLSON: --the answer to that, come back Assemblyman because we want to  know.</p><p>LALOR: I will. I will.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you.</p><p>LALOR: All right.</p><p>CARLSON: New York should be proud to have you.</p><p>Well tonight's an anniversary for our show. We're sentimental. We mark all  anniversaries. We'll tell you what it is, after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CARLSON: Well tonight marks the second anniversary of this show. Since we  can't take the show out to dinner to celebrate, instead, we're going to  show you a clip of what it first looked like when it launched at 7:00  Eastern two years ago tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: That's it, the first episode of TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. We'll be  back every weeknight. What's the show going to be about? You can judge for  yourself. But here's the basic theme of it. People in power tend to lie,  not because they want to but because they can't help themselves. </p><p>That's human nature. The more power people have, the bigger the temptation  to misuse it. The press is supposed to be the watchdog against all of this  and it worked fine for a couple of centuries. Then the press decided they  had more in common with certain politicians than with readers or viewers,  and that's when it fell apart.</p><p>We're going to get back to basics here. We're going to hold the powerful  accountable, pierce pomposity, translate doublespeak, mock smugness and  barbecue nonsense, every night, hope you'll watch.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: So they made me get a haircut before - before the first show. I  totally forgot until I just saw it. </p><p>People in power tend to lie. That was the theme then. That's the theme  tonight. That will always be the theme because that is always true whether  the show's at 7 o'clock or 9 o'clock or now at 8 o'clock, we intend to  stick to those promises and tell the truth, regardless.</p><p>Thank you, by the way, for making this show pretty successful more than we  ever thought it would be. Your loyalty has meant everything and made all  the difference. We appreciate it.</p><p>That's it for us tonight. We'll be back tomorrow, the show that is the  sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink. Good night from  Washington. </p><p>Sean Hannity, live from New York City.</p><p>SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST, HANNITY: All right. First, congratulations on  two years.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you.</p><p>HANNITY: You deserve all it - all of it. You're right. We - we don't have  this job without those great audience. That is all true.</p><p>CARLSON: That's for sure. That is true.</p><p>HANNITY: All right, one thing I got to add, this is your second-year  anniversary. When you get in your 23rd years, there's a little bit of this  white stuff that's going to start sneaking in. I'm just warning you just  (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, no, no. Crease and (ph) formula--</p><p>HANNITY: Congratulations.</p><p>CARLSON: That's where I'm going.</p><p>HANNITY: All right, Tucker, thanks and--</p><p>CARLSON: Thanks, Sean.</p><p>HANNITY: --all the best, as always.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

The imaginary Central American migrant Caravan, the one you've been told over and over doesn't exist, and if you don't believe it, you're immoral, well turns out it does exist. It's a physical reality. And, in fact, it's here. It's at the U.S. border.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A breakaway group from the Caravan has made its way to Tijuana. They didn't walk, as you were told they were doing. They were driven. And now, members are climbing over the border fence there.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The migrants were able to reach this country, thanks to the assistance of organizations whose explicit purpose is getting people into this country legally or not. Trace Gallagher has more details on what's going on tonight. Trace?</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Tucker, right now, there are two primary Central American caravans in Mexico making their way north that include anywhere from 4,000 to 7,000 people. The first of the major caravans is expected to arrive at the U.S. border sometime late next week.</p><p>But as you say, some 350 migrants have now arrived at the border in Tijuana. Dozens of them scaled the fence and taunted Border Patrol officers. Others stood at the fence or hung out on the beach. But they want their presence known to both the Border Patrol and the media.</p><p>Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING SPANISH).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING SPANISH).</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GALLAGHER: Yes. Catracho is slang for Honduran. There are reports these migrants broke from the main Caravan about four or five days ago and took buses north. Impossible to tell exactly how many are from the Caravan because the Border Patrol tells us Central American migrants sometimes arrive in droves every single day at the U.S. border.</p><p>We certainly know that many of these migrants are being coached by groups like Pueblo Sin Fronteras or People Without Borders, a Chicago-based immigration advocacy group. In fact, even Left-leaning news organizations like the L.A. Times and Washington Post have reported that members of Pueblo Sin Fronteras are embedded with the Caravan.</p><p>And our sources tell us these types of groups are guiding the migrants. For example, Mexico has offered most of these people both asylum and jobs. And yet, they continue heading north. Also, they could move toward the U.S. border in Texas.</p><p>But instead, they go the long way, hundreds of miles out of their way toward Tijuana. And that's because the goal is to get to California, take advantage of the State's sanctuary laws and the benefits that go along with that.</p><p>Of course, once thousands begin arriving in the next few weeks, sympathetic groups will be at the border to greet them. Tucker?</p><p>CARLSON: Trace Gallagher, thanks for that update. Appreciate it.</p><p>Well the images you just saw are embarrassing and awkward for the liars you've been watching on television for the past month, the ones who've been lecturing you that the Caravan doesn't exist and telling you that everything is just fine at the border.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIANNA MARIE KEILAR, SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, ANCHOR, CNN: The President, along with his favorite TV network, were beating the drum on the looming so-called Invasion as they put it--</p><p>SAM STEIN, THE DAILY BEAST POLITICS EDITOR, MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR: The programming on the Caravan was propaganda. It was political campaign motivated propaganda.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And the state-run--</p><p>BILL MAHER, REAL TIME WITH BILL MAHER HOST, HBO: Trump is like a racist Paul Revere, you know. The migrants are coming! The migrants are coming!</p><p>He keeps calling it an invasion. Yes, an invasion of strollers.</p><p>ANDERSON HAYS COOPER, AUTHOR, PRIMARY ANCHOR, ANDERSON COOPER 360 , CNN: He made news by ratcheting up the Caravan scare talk and the troop numbers he believes are needed to meet this alleged threat.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: The so-called invasion. So, people are streaming over the border illegally, what would you call it? I don't know. You're not allowed to call it anything, actually.</p><p>This is a recurring theme on the Left. Don't believe your own eyes. You're too dumb to trust your own senses. Listen to the smart kids. They know best. There's no crisis on the border even as hundreds of thousands of people stream into this country every year illegally, there's no illegal immigration crisis.</p><p>Yes, there are 22 million people living here illegally. It's not a crisis. It's not real. They'll tell you that on a loop endlessly until the day they retake power, at which point they'll say the crisis is real. In fact, it's so enormous we can only solve it by granting blanket amnesty to all the people here illegally.</p><p>There are 22 million, after all. What else can we do? This is a metaphor really for the Left's entire program, which is built entirely on denying reality. They deny the reality of illegal immigration. They deny the reality of terrorism. They deny the reality of biological gender.</p><p>And woe to the person who raises his hand and tries to insert reality into the conversation. They don't want that. When you have a program built entirely on denial and deception, it is not surprising you're also against free speech. You can't afford to have an honest conversation.</p><p>We'd like to have an honest conversation. That's why we're speaking tonight to Bryan Dean Wright. He's a Democrat and a former CIA Officer, and he joins us on set. So, I think there are arguments in favor of letting these people in, even illegally. That - that's a real position.</p><p>BRYAN DEAN WRIGHT, FORMER CIA OPS OFFICER, OPINION WRITER: Sure.</p><p>CARLSON: And maybe you can make the case it's good for America, it's good for our economy, maybe you think it's bad for America and you want it anyway. I mean there are all kinds of arguments. But what's not an argument is telling me that I'm a racist for acknowledging the reality of what is happening and that's the position I'm seeing on television.</p><p>WRIGHT: You're correct. So, here's what we should be starting with this conversation, facts, which--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>WRIGHT: --we typically don't, right? So, the facts tell us that first generation immigrants are a net drain on our economy, second and then (ph) eventually third generation become net contributors. That's the fact, right?</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>WRIGHT: Secondarily, we know that the folks who are coming across the border, 1,000 to 2,000 people each day, again, having kids then in a year or two years down the road, we're talking hundreds of thousands of people all told that those folks are - are initially, anyway, a burden to our economy.</p><p>Now, whether or not they contribute something many years down the road, that is an open question. We should be able to have this conversation irrespective--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>WRIGHT: --of our party affiliation, and come to a conclusion where we say, \"Look, we need to have a thoughtful, strong border, prevent some of these folks from coming across. And if we don't, shame on us, as a country.\"</p><p>CARLSON: Well, I agree with that. I mean I do think, as you just said, that this is in many ways an economic question. And I don't understand how you can look at the projections for what automation is about to do to our economy, eliminating a huge percentage of all low-skilled labor, all low- skilled labor in this country, and see what we need is more low-skilled labor. How can you make that argument?</p><p>WRIGHT: You can't. The top 10 jobs that we see immigrants take, both legal and illegal, make less than 20 bucks an hour, which, by the way, the Obama Administration said, jobs earning less than 20 bucks an hour are going to be automated into obsolescence.</p><p>So, the argument that we need an increasing number of poorly qualified, you know, folks who don't speak English, don't have the--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>WRIGHT: --skillsets that really we need for, the common (ph) economy, well frankly, the one that's already here that's a - that's a silly argument. It just it doesn't hold water.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I always want to believe the best about people and that they have honorable motives. And I think most people do have honorable motives. But if you can't even marshal an economic argument in favor of your - of your immigration policy, I'm left believing maybe it's only about getting more votes for your party.</p><p>WRIGHT: How cynical?</p><p>CARLSON: I don't want to be cynical. I just don't - I just don't see--</p><p>WRIGHT: Well--</p><p>CARLSON: --any other rationale.</p><p>WRIGHT: Look - look, I - I appreciate the argument. I think you're - you may be correct. There are definitely some parts of the party, make no mistake about it, they want open borders.</p><p>I mean just the other day, I think, it was yesterday, in fact, Senator Gillibrand from New York was buddy-buddy with the guy, Sean McElwee who wants to remove the border between the United States and Mexico, all right?</p><p>So, there is an element within this country, not just the activist community but, in fact, within the - the Left of this nation, my own party, I - I hate to say, who want open borders.</p><p>And that, of course, then feeds into this issue well - well what, not only how do we take care of them but, ultimately, who are they going to vote for? And that that there is a - a play there that I think one could - could argue this is a political play. This is about vote. So, I think it's fair to have that - that concern and that fear.</p><p>CARLSON: If I hear one more moron on cable news cry racism when somebody tries to have an honest conversation about what this means, I swear I'm getting rid of my television. I mean that.</p><p>WRIGHT: I don't blame you.</p><p>CARLSON: I can't - can't handle it, no.</p><p>WRIGHT: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Bryan Dean Wright, thank you very much.</p><p>WRIGHT: Always a pleasure.</p><p>CARLSON: Great to see you.</p><p>Well the Florida recount continues tonight. Democrats are battling to change the results by any means necessary. That will not surprise you. The details might though, and we have them after the break.</p><p>CARLSON: Well the recount continues tonight in this country's least competent vote-counting state. The upside of all of this Florida recount stuff by the way is a man named Craig Patrick. This is the third night in a row we've had him on, and we're always grateful to see him. Political Editor, Chief Investigator for WTVT Fox in Tampa Bay, he joins us with a recap.</p><p>Craig, what is happening?</p><p>CRAIG PATRICK, WTVT FOX TAMPA BAY POLITICAL EDITOR AND CHIEF INVESTIGATOR: We have more dueling gaffes, once again, focused on South Florida, predominantly Democrats.</p><p>I'll start with the good news for Senator Bill Nelson. We now know that the Democratic Party did, in fact, rally his supporters to make sure they get their mail-in ballots fixed if there are problems and finalized before the deadline.</p><p>The bad news for Bill Nelson is that they got the dates mixed up and they gave the wrong deadline telling people that you've got until Thursday, November 8th. The election was Tuesday, November 6th.</p><p>And the evidence for this is leading to the work of the Democratic Party of Florida, sending out these government forms writing in the wrong date, effectively confusing people and leaving, maybe, a lot of Democrats to say, \"Oh Gilligan (ph).\"</p><p>And this is something that seems to have affected voters specifically in Broward County and three other counties. So, stop and think about that for a moment.</p><p>You have the Democratic Party, apparently, one, sabotaging conceivably Bill Nelson, two, disenfranchising their own voters in this blunder, three, shooting themselves in the foot, four, trying to orchestrate this deadline rush not knowing what the deadline was and, five, conceivably breaking election law, all in one fell swoop.</p><p>This is something that the state has sent over to the feds to investigate. We'll see how that works out. One other blunder that stands out that has risen to the surface, you have continuing woes in Palm Beach County in Southeast Florida, where you have faulty voting machines.</p><p>Apparently, when they get stressed, they are old, they're aging to the point where they spit out erroneous results, which is causing the Election Managers there to recount votes that had already been recounted.</p><p>We're calling them the Monty Python machines because they - you feed them through, it's OK, one, two, five, no, no, three. And with this, you have Palm Beach County now racing the clock along with Broward County.</p><p>In other news, Governor Rick Scott, under pressure to recuse himself from certifying the results of the - of his own disputed race, has done that. He's moving on to - to Washington now.</p><p>And Mitch McConnell introduced him as the new Senator from Florida, which is premature. It is presumptuous. But it is also increasingly likely as well because while Bill Nelson has filed all of these legal challenges, time is running out.</p><p>And if you look at the math, even if Nelson prevails on every single one, which would seem to be a reach there just does not appear to be enough ballots to get him where he needs to be unless there is some kind of big machine malfunction, which based on the things we've seen is not inconceivable but we'll find out one way or the other about that, most likely by our deadline of the machine recount--</p><p>CARLSON: It's - it's unbelievable.</p><p>PATRICK: --tomorrow afternoon.</p><p>CARLSON: It's--</p><p>PATRICK: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --it's been 18 years. You'd think it would be running like a Swiss Canton by now, but it's Florida. Craig, thank you very much for that update. Appreciate it.</p><p>PATRICK: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Rubio has been raising alarm over the State of Florida's election irregularities for quite some time, and he joins us tonight on set. Senator, thanks very much--</p><p>MARCO ANTONIO RUBIO, JUNIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR FOR THE STATE OF FLORIDA, REPUBLICAN PARTY MEMBER: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: --for coming on.</p><p>RUBIO: Thanks for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I - I know you're a Senator, represents the State of Florida--</p><p>RUBIO: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --and you're pro-Florida. But as objectively as you can, what is the core problem with elections in Florida as of now (ph)?</p><p>RUBIO: Well actually there isn't. I mean 65 of 67 counties did it right. You know, Miami-Dade County is right on the border of Broward, 60 percent voted for Democrats in the Senate race and the governor's race, they got all their votes in on time.</p><p>And then they did their recount on time. It is largely focused on two counties and one, in particular, Broward County, where you have an inept and incompetent Elections Director who's done this in the past.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>RUBIO: And so, when someone, you know, a perfect example is these provisional ballots, right, it's people that show up and vote. You don't show up in the system. They let you vote but they put your vote in an envelope, and then they make sure - they verify you.</p><p>She decided to take 205 of them and count them on her own without submitting them the right way to this provisional - to the Canvassing Board. When that was discovered, she said, \"All right, I'll give it to the Canvassing Board.\"</p><p>But she had already separated the ballots from the envelopes. They found 20 of them to be invalid. But then there - there's no way to match the ballots to the envelope when you separate them. So then, she submitted 205 votes to the state out of that batch, 20 of them, at least 20 of them, are invalid votes.</p><p>Now she claims that they're not part of the count, which contradicts what her lawyer said a few days ago. So, when someone that incompetent is sitting on thousands of ballots, we don't know how many they are, she's not regularly reporting them, of course, we're going to be concerned about that and, of course, we're going to be concerned about the - the reporting.</p><p>And the second state of play is it's now lawyer time. Lawyers are arguing to the state that - to the judge, they're trying to get a federal judge to do two things. One, throw out state law when it comes to voter intent.</p><p>They're going to do a manual recount in the Senate race of all the ballots that either didn't vote in the Senate race or double-voted. And there's a very specific law for what voter intent is. You know, if you - if you circle Rick Scott or Bill Nelson, that's fine. But you have to have done it throughout the ballot.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>RUBIO: The machine won't read it. They want to throw out that standard and just let it be, I don't know what.</p><p>CARLSON: Can you change the standard after the voters cast votes (ph)?</p><p>RUBIO: That's my concern. I mean, look, if you say there was a problem with the lawsuit (ph), the legislature is there for. But to have a judge come in and announce that Florida law, after the election we're going to change the rules in hopes of influencing the outcome, that, to me, is stealing the election.</p><p>And then, they also want to force them to count every mail ballot, even the ones in which the signature didn't match, the signature on file for the voter. These are the two fundamental arguments before--</p><p>CARLSON: But just to ask (ph)--</p><p>RUBIO: --federal court.</p><p>CARLSON: --is that the requirement that the signature has to match?</p><p>RUBIO: Of course, yes, I mean--</p><p>CARLSON: So, if that's the existing requirement, how can they argue it's no longer the requirement?</p><p>RUBIO: Because they're saying it's an arbitrary standard and who's making the decision--</p><p>CARLSON: But that was the standard on Election Day, right?</p><p>RUBIO: Correct. And I think that's what I'm hoping, a reasonable judge, no matter how activist it might be, would argue that's a good point. You should have raised it before the election, and that's something for the legislature to fix. But we're not going to change the rules of the election after the election to influence the outcome, because if you do it, it's stealing an election.</p><p>CARLSON: Amazing. So, I want to ask you about the question of nationalism. The President described himself as a nationalist recently. He was attacked by the leader of France for doing that. You recently published a Wall Street Journal op-ed defending the idea of nationalism.</p><p>RUBIO: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Why is nationalism a necessary concept in modern America?</p><p>RUBIO: Well, American nationalism.</p><p>CARLSON: Of course.</p><p>RUBIO: What is our identity? Our identity is not a common race, ethnicity.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>RUBIO: In fact, America is a de facto rejection of that. It is fundamentally premised on this notion. We are all children of God. We are born with God - we're all created equal by our Creator. And we are given equal rights to life, liberty, and to pursue happiness.</p><p>That is our national identity. It is deeply rooted in morals and in values. It, in fact, explains everything this nation has done internationally and domestically. We should be proud of that identity. We should defend that national identity.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>RUBIO: Number two, I think most of the viewers watching this program would be shocked to think that my job is to represent Belgium or my job is to represent - I don't have nothing - I have nothing against Belgium. I always pick on Belgium or Luxembourg. They have their own system of government. That doesn't mean I need to be hostile towards them.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>RUBIO: And it may be in our national interest to work with them. I think NATO was in our national interest and is. I think a lot of our alliances are built on that. And, in fact, our national - our national - our national identity as a nation that believes in the equality of all people is what has caused us to defend democracy and feed hungry--</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>RUBIO: --people all over the world. We should be proud of that. But, as a government leader, my fundamental obligation, first and foremost, is to work on behalf of the American people. And most of the time, if not all the time, we can do that without hurting other people around the world.</p><p>CARLSON: It's hard to know what the argument against what you just said might be. Why would people--</p><p>RUBIO: Well--</p><p>CARLSON: --object? No, I sincerely because--</p><p>RUBIO: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --it's important to understand what - what the objections are. What do you think they could be--</p><p>RUBIO: Well, there are two.</p><p>CARLSON: --willing to do (ph)?</p><p>RUBIO: One is they ascribe to nationalism, sort of the nationalism of the Nazis or somebody else. That's ethnic and racial nationalism. I'm not talking about ethnic nationalism.</p><p>CARLSON: Of course, not.</p><p>RUBIO: I'm talking about a national identity that actually is completely relevant to your ethnicity. In fact, you didn't (ph) have to be born here. If you come here legally, you can be a U.S. citizen. It's one of the great things about America. Some of the people who love America are the most are the people who are Americans by choice, they--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>RUBIO: --because they know what life is like in another country. Then there's another school of thought that \"No, we are citizens of the international community, and we have obligations to the rest of the world,\" which I would agree within the confines of our national interest.</p><p>In fact, I've always argued that the best thing for the world is a strong and prosperous America because our values infuse our decision-making and - and - and so much of what we do. So, there are people that actually - I think that's what Macron was arguing.</p><p>And that is that France's obligations under him anyways are not just for the - to the French people, but to the sort of amorphous international community, which I'm not against. I've defended international organizations so long as they are in the national interest of the United States.</p><p>CARLSON: Because that's the country you represent.</p><p>RUBIO: Yes. I mean I swore an allegiance to the oath. I swore an oath to the Constitution of the United States. I work for the American people. And I believe I can do so while still being strong allies of Japan, strong allies of Great - Great Britain, strong allies of--</p><p>CARLSON: Of course.</p><p>RUBIO: --our countries around - all these countries around the world, especially when our interests intersect.</p><p>CARLSON: I think this is a vital conversation and I'm glad that we're having it and I'm glad you're--</p><p>RUBIO: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: --articulating it so clearly. Thank you, Senator.</p><p>RUBIO: Thank you for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: Well there's a battle over free speech going on in Washington right now. Good. We're for free speech. The question is, are the people who claim they're defending free speech actually defenders of speech? #Basta (ph), whatever that means. We'll investigate the assault on free speech after the break.</p><p>CARLSON: In the past couple of days, you've heard a lot of huffing and puffing about free speech and freedom of the press, and how those freedoms are currently imperiled by the White House.</p><p>And to be clear, we are for free speech, unfettered, absolute free speech, the kind of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment, and ratified consistently by the Supreme Court. We've defended that kind of free speech almost every night here for the past two years.</p><p>Many others, mostly on the Left, have attacked speech. So, we know who's for free speech and who's against it. And we cannot help but notice that some of free speech's greatest enemies are now posing as its defenders, all of a sudden.</p><p>Take CNN, for example. It was CNN that almost single-handedly led the campaign to have broadcaster Alex Jones banished from the internet on the grounds that they didn't like what Jones had to say. Ultimately, CNN succeeded in doing that.</p><p>The network convinced every major tech platform to ban Jones and his outlet Infowars. You don't have to like Alex Jones to see that as a terrifying loss for free speech because it was exactly that. But CNN was not done trying to silence its critics.</p><p>Last year, the cable network threatened an anonymous Reddit user for creating an anti-CNN meme. CNN threatened to expose his identity and ruin his life if it ever was criticized by him again. Now, CNN is claiming to defend free speech only when it's their speech.</p><p>You'll notice by the way that CNN did not object when the government threatened to imprison employees of the cable channel RT, if they didn't register as foreign agents. Yes, RT is owned by a foreign government, so is the BBC.</p><p>Until last year, much of the New York Times was owned by a foreign national. This is true of other news organizations, none of which has ever registered as a foreign agent. But because RT is owned by Russia, which the Left believes got Donald Trump elected, it is fine with CNN if they are bullied and silenced.</p><p>So, call CNN what you will but don't pretend they are defenders of the First Amendment. They are not.</p><p>Victor Davis Hanson is a Fellow at the Hoover Institution and a close watcher of all this. He joins us tonight. So, I just want to be clear, we're always for free speech, especially speech that's offensive, even by obnoxious White House Correspondents.</p><p>But to see a channel that has lobbied against the right of others to say what they think is true to all of a sudden emerge as this defender of the First Amendment is nauseating.</p><p>VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, HOOVER INSTITUTION SENIOR FELLOW, AMERICAN CLASSICIST, MILITARY HISTORIAN, COLUMNIST, FARMER: Yes. I - I think when people saw the suit, they asked themselves was there anything in the past that Jim Acosta had said negatively that got him kicked out and the answer was no. Was there anybody MSNBC, did they get kicked out? The answer's no.</p><p>Do other CNN reporters get kicked out? No, they have passes. So, it was a particular type of behavior. And I mean if you're arguing a case before the Supreme Court, you can't go in there and take pictures or - or interrupt the justice, they'll kick you out. And if you do it another time they'll say we don't want you pleading the case before the Supreme Court.</p><p>He - Jim Acosta can't go in there barefooted, and say, I want to express myself. There are certain protocols and norms of behavior and he's violated them. That's one issue. And then, it's not - this is sort of a psychodrama, Tucker.</p><p>I mean we - remember that the prior Administration monitored 20 AP reporters and Fox's own James Rosen. Nobody filed a suit on behalf of James Rosen from CNN, and said, \"My God, we only learned in 2013 that three years ago the man was being surveilled by the Attorney General. This is a violation of press freedom.\" We didn't hear that.</p><p>CARLSON: And - and you're not hearing CNN say anything about the voices being silenced now online by the big tech companies--</p><p>HANSON: No, you've not.</p><p>CARLSON: --because they have unfashionable views. Can you, as a philosophical matter, support free speech in some cases but not in others?</p><p>HANSON: I don't think you can. And then we get to another - we - if we want to talk about ethics and the protocols of the White House, see, CNN, 93 percent of their coverage according to Shorenstein is bias, and Trump had no problem with that.</p><p>He has no problem when the CNN host Kathy Griffin holds a decapitated facsimile of his head. They have no problem when Anderson Cooper uses obscenity or Rez - Reza Aslan says he's a piece of crap or people that are guests and panelists say that he's a Russian asset or agent or they invoke the Holocaust for comparison or people say that he's radicalized more people than ISIS, remember that?</p><p>And they have these stories they keep running, you know, that Scaramucci has involved with a Russian hedge fund, false, that Trump knew in advance of the Russian meeting, that Donald Trump Jr. had access to the WikiLeaks.</p><p>I remember when CNN was just explaining to us as a matter of fact that James Comey within a matter of hours was going to go into a Congressional testimony and swear that Donald Trump had mischaracterized their private meeting about whether he was subject to prosecution (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: Well it does - doesn't make sense though (ph)--</p><p>HANSON: --it was all--</p><p>CARLSON: --because they--</p><p>HANSON: --it was all false.</p><p>CARLSON: --CNN has argued that others should lose their voice, should be silenced--</p><p>HANSON: Yes, yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --because they're \"conspiracy theorists.\"</p><p>HANSON: Theorists.</p><p>CARLSON: But you're listing conspiracy theories that they have promulgated on their air.</p><p>HANSON: Yes. And they're also arguing that their type of behavior should not be subject to public scrutiny, but only Donald Trump's could (ph), protocol, manners, politeness.</p><p>And that's what Trump's argument is it's not the content, it's not the prejudice, it's not the unprofessionalism in the past, it's this particular time you went over the edge, and you disrupted. You were rude. You took over a - an optional press conference, nothing in the Constitution that says he has to have a press conference.</p><p>I can remember President Reagan saying, \"I can't hear you.\" And when - when somebody yells to Donald Trump, he runs over and talks. So, it's not only hypocritical on their fact (ph) but it's a - it's a journalistic organization that has violated the ethos of reporting and journalism then calling the kettle black and saying you can't do this, this is against White House--</p><p>CARLSON: I know.</p><p>HANSON: --protocol.</p><p>CARLSON: It's a - it's a shame--</p><p>HANSON: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --to see a buffoon elevated to--</p><p>HANSON: It is.</p><p>CARLSON: --martyr status. But look, now that CNN's on the side of free speech, I'm sure they'll be advocating for the right--</p><p>HANSON: I wish they have.</p><p>CARLSON: --of all people to say what they need.</p><p>HANSON: They could have sued in 2013 on the behalf of Fox and--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>HANSON: --and the - and the AP.</p><p>CARLSON: Victor Davis Hanson, a man with a long memory.</p><p>HANSON: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: And we appreciate that.</p><p>HANSON: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you.</p><p>Well there used to be dozens of pro-Second Amendment Democrats in the Congress. There aren't anymore. Now the party is increasingly calling for disarming the public. Does the public want that? That's next.</p><p>CARLSON: Anyway if (ph) Democrats is entering the Congress, of course, one of their top interests, they say, one of their top public policy priorities, disarming the population.</p><p>Just a decade ago, about a quarter of candidates backed by the NRA were, in fact, Democrats. Now, the number of NRA-backed House Democrats is three. Meanwhile, a new poll of Democrats in early primary states says their top issue after single-payer healthcare is repealing the Second Amendment in order to ban guns.</p><p>Richard Goodstein is a lawyer, a former adviser to Bill and Hillary Clinton and she - he joins us tonight. Richard, thanks for coming on.</p><p>RICHARD GOODSTEIN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, POLITICAL CONSULTANT, FORMER CLINTON ADVISER: Sure.</p><p>CARLSON: So, is this really the time, as the country's becoming more chaotic, to disarm the population?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes. So, I can't really speak for these people who respond to this poll. I can tell you what Nancy Pelosi is talking about, what House Democrats are talking about, which is background checks, which 90-percent plus of the public supports, which got 54 votes in the Senate when it was Toomey and Manchin, putting a bill to require gun background--</p><p>CARLSON: OK. OK. You know what I mean (ph)--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --checks.</p><p>CARLSON: --we've been through this a million times but--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --but if - if Democrats polled and it seems like a legitimate poll say their number two issue after socialized medicine is repealing the Second Amendment, preparatory to disarming the population. You know, there are going to be calls for that.</p><p>If the people, voters want it, you know, their - their representatives will call for it. Is this the time? And should it make us, the rest of us, a little nervous as America's getting crazier, obviously, to disarm normal people?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes. Again, I just don't buy the notion that that was a legit poll that even a quarter of Democrats think repealing the Second Amendment. I--</p><p>CARLSON: What do you think of that?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: What - what I think the Democrats are saying is look, is what Justice Scalia said in the famous Heller decision, the one case that really went to the Supreme Court where he said, \"A person has a right to a handgun to protect their home. Period.\" And that legitimate regulation of guns in terms of places that they can't be taken, schools, places that, you know, conditions on their sale--</p><p>CARLSON: But we have all those laws already. I mean--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: But I'm saying those are--</p><p>CARLSON: OK.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --so, no one's talking about repealing that.</p><p>CARLSON: No, no. People are and let's be - I mean let's stop lying just for a second--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --you're not going to stop mass shootings really unless you take all the guns away. That's the truth. And everyone knows it. I mean, honestly.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: So, that's kind of the goal, and everyone really knows that. And I'm just wondering like what's the argument here? So, if you're arguing simultaneously that the police are racist, they can't be trusted, which Beto and lots of other candidates have argued, and also the population can't be trusted to defend itself or have firearms, what are you really saying?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: I think what Democrats are saying and, frankly, Republicans wish they had been saying it because the ones backed by the NRA, Barbara Comstock, Mike Coffman in Colorado lost to Democrats saying, \"We want background check laws, and so forth.\"</p><p>And what they're saying is that things have gotten out of whack. The United States is unique in the world. It's not a mental health problem. There are mental health problems everywhere else in the world. But we have this horrible gun problem here. So--</p><p>CARLSON: No, but actually we don't because most Americans are not a threat to anybody. And this is what makes me nervous is a small percentage of people commit the overwhelming majority of shootings. But we're not thinking clearly about how to disarm them.</p><p>All these laws apply to me. I pose no threat to anyone, and I really want to be able to defend myself. I know you do too. So, why not leave me out of it and normal people out of it who pose no conceivable threat and focus on the potential threats? But no one's ever - no one's ever up for doing that.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: We all have to be disarmed.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Of course.</p><p>CARLSON: Why?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Well again, no one's talking about disarming anybody.</p><p>CARLSON: No, they are no, no--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: What Nancy - well - well - what - what - what--</p><p>CARLSON: --no, we (ph)--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --elected officials are saying is we should have background checks, so lunatics--</p><p>CARLSON: --no, but that's not all--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --don't have the--</p><p>CARLSON: --no, but--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --access to guns.</p><p>CARLSON: --but the - the most - the most recent shooting and many of these shootings have been committed by people who went through background checks. Stephen Paddock went through a background check. The latest shooter in, obviously, who we just saw in California went through a background check. The truth is it's not just background checks, which nobody really opposes. It's--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: No (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --limiting the kind of firearms you can buy, limiting the size of the magazines you can use, limiting the kinds of ammunition you can purchase. These are laws, restrictions that affect normal people who should be able to--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: --defend themselves. Why is that?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Look, when you say that nobody really opposes, when you get Republican leaders here please ask them--</p><p>CARLSON: No, it's irrelevant (ph)--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --to affirm that that (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --we already have--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --they don't - well it's relevant (ph) look--</p><p>CARLSON: --but hold on--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --never we had (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --we even (ph) have background - I mean let's be serious.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Background checks are - I buy guns, so I know.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: They're in place. You go through them when you buy a gun. Why would a magazine restriction or an ammo restriction or a so-called assault rifle restriction apply to me? What isn't - why am I not trusted to buy any kind of gun I want? I'm confused, honestly.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Well, again, the analogy I would use is to the ways we basically made cars safer. There used to be a lot more fatalities on the road, and we instituted things like seatbelts and - and airbags and other things, vehicles that could basically crush without crushing the passenger. And - and background checks is the first way to go--</p><p>CARLSON: No, no, but - but then - then why - no, sincere question though.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: The assault rifle ban, a gun that looks scary should be banned, OK? That's the position and a lot of candidates (ph) say they should be confiscated. Why should my right to buy that gun be abridged? Why can't I be--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: It's not being--</p><p>CARLSON: --no, it is though.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Well no one's being - if you object to being--</p><p>CARLSON: --no (ph), but why shouldn't I be able to buy that gun? I'm an American citizen. I don't pose a threat to anybody. Why can't I have that gun?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: I - I think the concern is that people get their hands on assault weapons who commit these crimes. If you want to use your assault weapon on a range, guess what? Go to a range and keep your gun there and use it there.</p><p>CARLSON: Well maybe I want it in my house. And why - I - I don't understand. So, what--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: You want assault (ph) weapons--</p><p>CARLSON: --what you're saying is--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --to defend your house.</p><p>CARLSON: --no, what you're saying is we don't trust the population of the country. We don't think you're autonomous. We don't think you ought to be able to make these decisions for yourself. We just don't trust you. And I'm saying, why would I ever vote for someone who wouldn't trust me to have an AR-15 at home, honestly?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Well - well, again, it's like saying we didn't trust people to drive without seatbelts or airbags and so forth. But we instituted things that were going to make people safer. What we're saying is it'd be--</p><p>CARLSON: No. But you don't use a car to defend yourself and you do use a firearm to defend yourself, and why wouldn't you trust--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Cars kill people.</p><p>CARLSON: --no, why wouldn't you trust? There are 330 million people in the country. Hundreds of millions of them pose no conceivable threat to anybody.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: So, why can't we think of a law that spares them these regulations? Is anybody even trying to think of that?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Of course, they are but the--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, really? Who?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --well, but again, we're - we're taking it step up step. We're taking it step by step.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, we are.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: I mean a - ask any suburban mother, that's the problem politically is that these people that--</p><p>CARLSON: I don't care about the politics.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --that you lost last time are going to be lost--</p><p>CARLSON: I'm just telling you--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --because they don't want more guns in school.</p><p>CARLSON: --the Left is making this country chaotic and scary--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --and simultaneously trying to keep me from defending myself. And that's not--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: The voters just happen not to buy (ph) what--</p><p>CARLSON: --going to happen.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --you just said.</p><p>CARLSON: I don't care.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: And - and that's why the Democrats won this time (ph).</p><p>CARLSON: I don't care.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: OK.</p><p>CARLSON: OK. We'll see.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Richard, thank you.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Amazon is getting billions of taxpayer dollars to expand into two of America's richest cities. It's corporate welfare. The Democratic Party is all on board. And anyone who questions it could be investigated by an incoming Committee Chairman. What's going on? We'll get to that in just a minute.</p><p>CARLSON: Well Florida isn't the only state with a high-stakes recount in progress. Just to the north, in Georgia, Democrat Stacey Abrams (ph) has refused to concede in the Governor's race. Legal challenges are flying everywhere.</p><p>Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown says that if Abrams is not declared the winner, then almost by definition Republicans, quote, stole the race. Lisa Boothe of Independent Women's Voice has been following this for us.</p><p>LISA BOOTHE, FOX NEWS CO-HOST, OUTNUMBERED, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE SENIOR FELLOW: Hi, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: She joins us now with an update. Hey, Lisa?</p><p>BOOTHE: Oh, and Hillary Clinton is also saying that if a - that it would not be - it's not a fair race if Stacey Abrams doesn't win that somehow this race is not fair. Mind you, Brian Kemp is up by 55,000 votes and Stacey Abrams would need 18,000 to force a runoff and 16,000 to force a recount.</p><p>There is only one county that has not certified the results of the election. That's Gwinnett County. A 158 out of the 159 counties have certified the results of the election. So, she is not going to find those numbers. She is not going to be Governor of Georgia.</p><p>Yet, she refuses to concede. And now, we have Democrats like Sherrod Brown and Hillary Clinton making up excuses and saying that somehow there's voter suppression or something is awry if Stacey Abrams does not win this election.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I mean, presumably, the goal is to infuriate Democrats in the state of Florida sufficient that they come out to vote in 2020. I mean there - I got to be thinking long-term, right?</p><p>BOOTHE: Yes. I think what's - well I think Stacey Abrams is actually looking ahead at 2020, a possible run - run against Senator Perdue. So, I think that's why she's trying to hang in there. But it's sort of ridiculous to have Hillary Clinton be saying this because you essentially have two losers being sore losers with Hillary Clinton and Stacey Abrams.</p><p>Of course, we know Hillary Clinton still refuses to accept the results of the 2016 election and that voters just weren't that into her, didn't want her, didn't elect her, and it's Russia's fault, and everyone else's fault. I mean she literally wrote a book blaming everything else, but herself, for her own election loss. So, it looks like the Democrats are the sore losers and refuse to accept the results of the election.</p><p>CARLSON: Amazing. I don't think there's a substantive case they're making, it doesn't sound like. Lisa Boothe, thank you for that update--</p><p>BOOTHE: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: --and all of them.</p><p>BOOTHE: Appreciate it.</p><p>CARLSON: Well elements of the Right and the Left have finally found something they can agree on, at least for the moment, opposing corporate welfare for Amazon. Jeff Bezos' colossus is getting billions in taxpayer subsidies to open new headquarters in New York and Northern Virginia, and that's not all.</p><p>As part of the deal for Amazon, the Commonwealth of Virginia is promising to warn the company about any Freedom of Information requests it receives about Amazon.</p><p>Kieran Lalor is the Republican in the New York Assembly. He sent a letter to the Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo questioning the wisdom of this deal, and he joins us tonight.</p><p>So, this is a little bit confusing considering that New York City has a lot of infrastructure needs, for example. You'd think Amazon, run by the richest guy in the world would be bringing something to the table. But instead, the taxpayers of New York are paying him to come? How does this work?</p><p>KIERAN MICHAEL LALOR, NEW YORK ASSEMBLYMAN, ENTREPRENEUR, AUTHOR: You know, it - it's incredible. It's guaranteed to be a boondoggle. What - what we're seeing here is the most powerful, richest person in the world going to be subsidized by regular people. We know that Amazon in - in some cases, destroys other companies that can't compete--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>LALOR: --destroys jobs. It's one thing if that happens in our free enterprise system. But it's yet - it's another thing to subsidize that, and as some of the very people whose jobs and businesses are going to be destroyed to subsidize this monster, Amazon.</p><p>CARLSON: Well Amazon is a monopoly. So, by definition, I - I think it's the enemy of the - of the free market. Who cut this deal for the State of New York?</p><p>LALOR: You know, it's fascinating. Governor Cuomo is giving about $1.7 billion with a B in state dollars. De Blasio is giving another billion dollars in New York City money. And it's interesting because if this was a good deal, Governor Cuomo stood for election just eight days ago, why didn't he announce this or - or get word of this--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>LALOR: --out before the election? If this was a good deal, he certainly would have done that. He knows this is a bad deal. And you know what's interesting? You have Liberals like Cuomo and de Blasio, and what they're doing is they're introducing a bizarro form of supply-side economics.</p><p>They're saying lower taxes, lower business costs create jobs. But we're not going to do real supply-side economics where everybody gets a tax cut and everybody gets to compete. We're going to - we're going to pick one winner and let everybody else think while one big ship gets to rise.</p><p>CARLSON: Well it's such a good point. Is it weird to see self-described Liberals acting as the servants of the richest man in the world?</p><p>LALOR: Yes. It - it is. It is very strange. But I'll - I'll give them a little bit of credit. You know, we live in a divided time here in the United States. They have unified the Left and the Right. The New York Times is against this. The conservative New York Post editorial page is against this.</p><p>The - the darling of the Left, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York City Liberal, is against it. Upstate conservatives like me are against it. Unions are against it. Business organizations are against it. The only ones who seem to be for it are Amazon, Cuomo, and De Blasio.</p><p>CARLSON: In the State of Virginia, as bad as everything you've just described is, in the State of Virginia, the Democratic State of Virginia, run by Liberals, they have agreed to warn Amazon if news organizations file Freedom of Information request trying to learn about Amazon. I don't think I've ever seen anything that corrupt. Is there a justification--</p><p>LALOR: You know, that reminds me--</p><p>CARLSON: --for that?</p><p>Interviewee: --that reminds me of the Gilded Age where - where some of the companies have become more powerful than the United States government. That's scary stuff--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>LALOR: --right there. But I'll give - I'll give Virginia one thing. They're getting the same number of promised jobs and they're paying one-third the price. We're paying over $1.5 billion for about 25,000 jobs from New York State.</p><p>Virginia's paying a half a billion, they're getting the same number of jobs. That was one of my top questions for Governor Cuomo in my letter today. I'd love to see the answer to that.</p><p>CARLSON: So, I mean how can you get the answer? And what can you do about it? I mean you're a lawmaker in the State. Cuomo's not King. Can you undo this deal?</p><p>LALOR: You know, we've had a long string of horrible economic development deals in New York State in the six years that I've been in the legislature, and it's very difficult to get job creation numbers.</p><p>You know, they can say, \"Oh, we're going to create so this number jobs.\" But when you ask them, \"Well, OK, how many have you created? What's the benchmark? Where are we, one year, two years, three years in?\" you have to file a FOIA request, newspapers have to file a FOIA request, it's very difficult to get information now.</p><p>He's here to cut the ribbon. When this boondoggle fails, he'll be long gone and he'll be out of politics or running for something else, and he won't be here to pick up the pieces, but regular New Yorkers will.</p><p>CARLSON: You got to wonder too about the location of this deal. So, people who visit New York think it's a very rich place because New York City is the financial capital of the world. But Upstate New York, parts of it are, have a lot of poverty, real poverty. Americans suffering, no jobs, high drug abuse rate, I mean you're very aware--</p><p>LALOR: Yes. It's dying, it's dying, I should say (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: --well, so it's dying. That's exactly right. It's a beautiful place with great people and it's dying. But Amazon did not choose to help revitalize that part of the state. But they moved to the richest part of the state. What does that tell you?</p><p>LALOR: You know, and - and, I don't want to say $25,000 or every (ph) drop in the bucket. But if it could be a drop in the bucket, New York City, the metropolis of New York City is a drop in the bucket. If you situated this facility in the middle of Central New York or--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>LALOR: --the northern part of the Hudson Valley, you would save an entire region. You would revitalize an entire region and save, you know, what was once a thriving part of our manufacturing base. But to put it here--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>LALOR: --in New York City. Here's a point, I also would like Governor Cuomo to answer. How do you know they weren't coming anyway? New York City is the media capital. It's the financial capital. It has one of the most educated dynamic workforces.</p><p>Wouldn't they be coming here anyway? I mean they're not going to go to Peoria, right? They're going to come to New York City. So, did we just get played?</p><p>And another thing. The - the headquarters was supposed to be one second headquarters. Then it got put to two second headquarters, one in Virginia, one in New York.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>LALOR: I'd like to know, did Cuomo reduce his - his bid when the headquarters got split in two?</p><p>CARLSON: I hope you find out.</p><p>LALOR: Governor Cuomo did you--</p><p>CARLSON: If you find out--</p><p>LALOR: I'm trying, I'm trying.</p><p>CARLSON: --the answer to that, come back Assemblyman because we want to know.</p><p>LALOR: I will. I will.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you.</p><p>LALOR: All right.</p><p>CARLSON: New York should be proud to have you.</p><p>Well tonight's an anniversary for our show. We're sentimental. We mark all anniversaries. We'll tell you what it is, after the break.</p><p>CARLSON: Well tonight marks the second anniversary of this show. Since we can't take the show out to dinner to celebrate, instead, we're going to show you a clip of what it first looked like when it launched at 7:00 Eastern two years ago tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: That's it, the first episode of TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. We'll be back every weeknight. What's the show going to be about? You can judge for yourself. But here's the basic theme of it. People in power tend to lie, not because they want to but because they can't help themselves.</p><p>That's human nature. The more power people have, the bigger the temptation to misuse it. The press is supposed to be the watchdog against all of this and it worked fine for a couple of centuries. Then the press decided they had more in common with certain politicians than with readers or viewers, and that's when it fell apart.</p><p>We're going to get back to basics here. We're going to hold the powerful accountable, pierce pomposity, translate doublespeak, mock smugness and barbecue nonsense, every night, hope you'll watch.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: So they made me get a haircut before - before the first show. I totally forgot until I just saw it.</p><p>People in power tend to lie. That was the theme then. That's the theme tonight. That will always be the theme because that is always true whether the show's at 7 o'clock or 9 o'clock or now at 8 o'clock, we intend to stick to those promises and tell the truth, regardless.</p><p>Thank you, by the way, for making this show pretty successful more than we ever thought it would be. Your loyalty has meant everything and made all the difference. We appreciate it.</p><p>That's it for us tonight. We'll be back tomorrow, the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink. Good night from Washington.</p><p>Sean Hannity, live from New York City.</p><p>SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST, HANNITY: All right. First, congratulations on two years.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you.</p><p>HANNITY: You deserve all it - all of it. You're right. We - we don't have this job without those great audience. That is all true.</p><p>CARLSON: That's for sure. That is true.</p><p>HANNITY: All right, one thing I got to add, this is your second-year anniversary. When you get in your 23rd years, there's a little bit of this white stuff that's going to start sneaking in. I'm just warning you just (ph)--</p><p>CARLSON: Oh, no, no. Crease and (ph) formula--</p><p>HANNITY: Congratulations.</p><p>CARLSON: That's where I'm going.</p><p>HANNITY: All right, Tucker, thanks and--</p><p>CARLSON: Thanks, Sean.</p><p>HANNITY: --all the best, as always.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

The imaginary Central American migrant  Caravan, the one you've been told over and over doesn't exist, and if you  don't believe it, you're immoral, well turns out it does exist. It's a  physical reality. And, in fact, it's here. It's at the U.S. border.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> A breakaway group from the Caravan has made its way to Tijuana. They didn't  walk, as you were told they were doing. They were driven. And now, members  are climbing over the border fence there. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The migrants were able to reach this country, thanks to the assistance of  organizations whose explicit purpose is getting people into this country  legally or not. Trace Gallagher has more details on what's going on  tonight. Trace?</p><p> TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Tucker, right now, there are two  primary Central American caravans in Mexico making their way north that  include anywhere from 4,000 to 7,000 people. The first of the major  caravans is expected to arrive at the U.S. border sometime late next week.</p><p> But as you say, some 350 migrants have now arrived at the border in  Tijuana. Dozens of them scaled the fence and taunted Border Patrol  officers. Others stood at the fence or hung out on the beach. But they want  their presence known to both the Border Patrol and the media.</p><p> Watch this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING SPANISH).</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (SPEAKING SPANISH).</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GALLAGHER: Yes. Catracho is slang for Honduran. There are reports these  migrants broke from the main Caravan about four or five days ago and took  buses north. Impossible to tell exactly how many are from the Caravan  because the Border Patrol tells us Central American migrants sometimes  arrive in droves every single day at the U.S. border.</p><p> We certainly know that many of these migrants are being coached by groups  like Pueblo Sin Fronteras or People Without Borders, a Chicago-based  immigration advocacy group. In fact, even Left-leaning news organizations  like the L.A. Times and Washington Post have reported that members of  Pueblo Sin Fronteras are embedded with the Caravan.</p><p> And our sources tell us these types of groups are guiding the migrants. For  example, Mexico has offered most of these people both asylum and jobs. And  yet, they continue heading north. Also, they could move toward the U.S.  border in Texas. </p><p> But instead, they go the long way, hundreds of miles out of their way  toward Tijuana. And that's because the goal is to get to California, take  advantage of the State's sanctuary laws and the benefits that go along with  that.</p><p> Of course, once thousands begin arriving in the next few weeks, sympathetic  groups will be at the border to greet them. Tucker?</p><p> CARLSON: Trace Gallagher, thanks for that update. Appreciate it. </p><p> Well the images you just saw are embarrassing and awkward for the liars  you've been watching on television for the past month, the ones who've been  lecturing you that the Caravan doesn't exist and telling you that  everything is just fine at the border.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BRIANNA MARIE KEILAR, SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, ANCHOR, CNN: The  President, along with his favorite TV network, were beating the drum on the  looming so-called Invasion as they put it--</p><p> SAM STEIN, THE DAILY BEAST POLITICS EDITOR, MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR: The  programming on the Caravan was propaganda. It was political campaign  motivated propaganda.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And the state-run--</p><p> BILL MAHER, REAL TIME WITH BILL MAHER HOST, HBO: Trump is like a racist  Paul Revere, you know. The migrants are coming! The migrants are coming!</p><p> He keeps calling it an invasion. Yes, an invasion of strollers.</p><p> ANDERSON HAYS COOPER, AUTHOR, PRIMARY ANCHOR, ANDERSON COOPER 360 , CNN: He  made news by ratcheting up the Caravan scare talk and the troop numbers he  believes are needed to meet this alleged threat.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: The so-called invasion. So, people are streaming over the border  illegally, what would you call it? I don't know. You're not allowed to call  it anything, actually. </p><p> This is a recurring theme on the Left. Don't believe your own eyes. You're  too dumb to trust your own senses. Listen to the smart kids. They know  best. There's no crisis on the border even as hundreds of thousands of  people stream into this country every year illegally, there's no illegal  immigration crisis.</p><p> Yes, there are 22 million people living here illegally. It's not a crisis.  It's not real. They'll tell you that on a loop endlessly until the day they  retake power, at which point they'll say the crisis is real. In fact, it's  so enormous we can only solve it by granting blanket amnesty to all the  people here illegally.</p><p> There are 22 million, after all. What else can we do? This is a metaphor  really for the Left's entire program, which is built entirely on denying  reality. They deny the reality of illegal immigration. They deny the  reality of terrorism. They deny the reality of biological gender. </p><p> And woe to the person who raises his hand and tries to insert reality into  the conversation. They don't want that. When you have a program built  entirely on denial and deception, it is not surprising you're also against  free speech. You can't afford to have an honest conversation. </p><p> We'd like to have an honest conversation. That's why we're speaking tonight  to Bryan Dean Wright. He's a Democrat and a former CIA Officer, and he  joins us on set. So, I think there are arguments in favor of letting these  people in, even illegally. That - that's a real position.</p><p> BRYAN DEAN WRIGHT, FORMER CIA OPS OFFICER, OPINION WRITER: Sure.</p><p> CARLSON: And maybe you can make the case it's good for America, it's good  for our economy, maybe you think it's bad for America and you want it  anyway. I mean there are all kinds of arguments. But what's not an argument  is telling me that I'm a racist for acknowledging the reality of what is  happening and that's the position I'm seeing on television.</p><p> WRIGHT: You're correct. So, here's what we should be starting with this  conversation, facts, which--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> WRIGHT: --we typically don't, right? So, the facts tell us that first  generation immigrants are a net drain on our economy, second and then (ph)  eventually third generation become net contributors. That's the fact,  right?</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> WRIGHT: Secondarily, we know that the folks who are coming across the  border, 1,000 to 2,000 people each day, again, having kids then in a year  or two years down the road, we're talking hundreds of thousands of people  all told that those folks are - are initially, anyway, a burden to our  economy.</p><p> Now, whether or not they contribute something many years down the road,  that is an open question. We should be able to have this conversation  irrespective--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> WRIGHT: --of our party affiliation, and come to a conclusion where we say,  \"Look, we need to have a thoughtful, strong border, prevent some of these  folks from coming across. And if we don't, shame on us, as a country.\"</p><p> CARLSON: Well, I agree with that. I mean I do think, as you just said, that  this is in many ways an economic question. And I don't understand how you  can look at the projections for what automation is about to do to our  economy, eliminating a huge percentage of all low-skilled labor, all low- skilled labor in this country, and see what we need is more low-skilled  labor. How can you make that argument?</p><p> WRIGHT: You can't. The top 10 jobs that we see immigrants take, both legal  and illegal, make less than 20 bucks an hour, which, by the way, the Obama  Administration said, jobs earning less than 20 bucks an hour are going to  be automated into obsolescence.</p><p> So, the argument that we need an increasing number of poorly qualified, you  know, folks who don't speak English, don't have the--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> WRIGHT: --skillsets that really we need for, the common (ph) economy, well  frankly, the one that's already here that's a - that's a silly argument. It  just it doesn't hold water.</p><p> CARLSON: So, I always want to believe the best about people and that they  have honorable motives. And I think most people do have honorable motives.  But if you can't even marshal an economic argument in favor of your - of  your immigration policy, I'm left believing maybe it's only about getting  more votes for your party.</p><p> WRIGHT: How cynical?</p><p> CARLSON: I don't want to be cynical. I just don't - I just don't see--</p><p> WRIGHT: Well--</p><p> CARLSON: --any other rationale.</p><p> WRIGHT: Look - look, I - I appreciate the argument. I think you're - you  may be correct. There are definitely some parts of the party, make no  mistake about it, they want open borders. </p><p> I mean just the other day, I think, it was yesterday, in fact, Senator  Gillibrand from New York was buddy-buddy with the guy, Sean McElwee who  wants to remove the border between the United States and Mexico, all right? </p><p> So, there is an element within this country, not just the activist  community but, in fact, within the - the Left of this nation, my own party,  I - I hate to say, who want open borders. </p><p> And that, of course, then feeds into this issue well - well what, not only  how do we take care of them but, ultimately, who are they going to vote  for? And that that there is a - a play there that I think one could - could  argue this is a political play. This is about vote. So, I think it's fair  to have that - that concern and that fear.</p><p> CARLSON: If I hear one more moron on cable news cry racism when somebody  tries to have an honest conversation about what this means, I swear I'm  getting rid of my television. I mean that.</p><p> WRIGHT: I don't blame you.</p><p> CARLSON: I can't - can't handle it, no.</p><p> WRIGHT: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: Bryan Dean Wright, thank you very much.</p><p> WRIGHT: Always a pleasure.</p><p> CARLSON: Great to see you.</p><p> Well the Florida recount continues tonight. Democrats are battling to  change the results by any means necessary. That will not surprise you. The  details might though, and we have them after the break.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: Well the recount continues tonight in this country's least  competent vote-counting state. The upside of all of this Florida recount  stuff by the way is a man named Craig Patrick. This is the third night in a  row we've had him on, and we're always grateful to see him. Political  Editor, Chief Investigator for WTVT Fox in Tampa Bay, he joins us with a  recap. </p><p> Craig, what is happening?</p><p> CRAIG PATRICK, WTVT FOX TAMPA BAY POLITICAL EDITOR AND CHIEF INVESTIGATOR:  We have more dueling gaffes, once again, focused on South Florida,  predominantly Democrats. </p><p> I'll start with the good news for Senator Bill Nelson. We now know that the  Democratic Party did, in fact, rally his supporters to make sure they get  their mail-in ballots fixed if there are problems and finalized before the  deadline.</p><p> The bad news for Bill Nelson is that they got the dates mixed up and they  gave the wrong deadline telling people that you've got until Thursday,  November 8th. The election was Tuesday, November 6th. </p><p> And the evidence for this is leading to the work of the Democratic Party of  Florida, sending out these government forms writing in the wrong date,  effectively confusing people and leaving, maybe, a lot of Democrats to say,  \"Oh Gilligan (ph).\" </p><p> And this is something that seems to have affected voters specifically in  Broward County and three other counties. So, stop and think about that for  a moment. </p><p> You have the Democratic Party, apparently, one, sabotaging conceivably Bill  Nelson, two, disenfranchising their own voters in this blunder, three,  shooting themselves in the foot, four, trying to orchestrate this deadline  rush not knowing what the deadline was and, five, conceivably breaking  election law, all in one fell swoop.</p><p> This is something that the state has sent over to the feds to investigate.  We'll see how that works out. One other blunder that stands out that has  risen to the surface, you have continuing woes in Palm Beach County in  Southeast Florida, where you have faulty voting machines.</p><p> Apparently, when they get stressed, they are old, they're aging to the  point where they spit out erroneous results, which is causing the Election  Managers there to recount votes that had already been recounted. </p><p> We're calling them the Monty Python machines because they - you feed them  through, it's OK, one, two, five, no, no, three. And with this, you have  Palm Beach County now racing the clock along with Broward County.</p><p> In other news, Governor Rick Scott, under pressure to recuse himself from  certifying the results of the - of his own disputed race, has done that.  He's moving on to - to Washington now. </p><p> And Mitch McConnell introduced him as the new Senator from Florida, which  is premature. It is presumptuous. But it is also increasingly likely as  well because while Bill Nelson has filed all of these legal challenges,  time is running out. </p><p> And if you look at the math, even if Nelson prevails on every single one,  which would seem to be a reach there just does not appear to be enough  ballots to get him where he needs to be unless there is some kind of big  machine malfunction, which based on the things we've seen is not  inconceivable but we'll find out one way or the other about that, most  likely by our deadline of the machine recount--</p><p> CARLSON: It's - it's unbelievable.</p><p> PATRICK: --tomorrow afternoon.</p><p> CARLSON: It's--</p><p> PATRICK: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: --it's been 18 years. You'd think it would be running like a Swiss  Canton by now, but it's Florida. Craig, thank you very much for that  update. Appreciate it.</p><p> PATRICK: Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: Rubio has been raising alarm over the State of Florida's election  irregularities for quite some time, and he joins us tonight on set.  Senator, thanks very much--</p><p> MARCO ANTONIO RUBIO, JUNIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR FOR THE STATE OF FLORIDA,  REPUBLICAN PARTY MEMBER: Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: --for coming on.</p><p> RUBIO: Thanks for having me.</p><p> CARLSON: So, I - I know you're a Senator, represents the State of Florida--</p><p> RUBIO: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: --and you're pro-Florida. But as objectively as you can, what is  the core problem with elections in Florida as of now (ph)?</p><p> RUBIO: Well actually there isn't. I mean 65 of 67 counties did it right.  You know, Miami-Dade County is right on the border of Broward, 60 percent  voted for Democrats in the Senate race and the governor's race, they got  all their votes in on time. </p><p> And then they did their recount on time. It is largely focused on two  counties and one, in particular, Broward County, where you have an inept  and incompetent Elections Director who's done this in the past.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> RUBIO: And so, when someone, you know, a perfect example is these  provisional ballots, right, it's people that show up and vote. You don't  show up in the system. They let you vote but they put your vote in an  envelope, and then they make sure - they verify you.</p><p> She decided to take 205 of them and count them on her own without  submitting them the right way to this provisional - to the Canvassing  Board. When that was discovered, she said, \"All right, I'll give it to the  Canvassing Board.\" </p><p> But she had already separated the ballots from the envelopes. They found 20  of them to be invalid. But then there - there's no way to match the ballots  to the envelope when you separate them. So then, she submitted 205 votes to  the state out of that batch, 20 of them, at least 20 of them, are invalid  votes.</p><p> Now she claims that they're not part of the count, which contradicts what  her lawyer said a few days ago. So, when someone that incompetent is  sitting on thousands of ballots, we don't know how many they are, she's not  regularly reporting them, of course, we're going to be concerned about that  and, of course, we're going to be concerned about the - the reporting.</p><p> And the second state of play is it's now lawyer time. Lawyers are arguing  to the state that - to the judge, they're trying to get a federal judge to  do two things. One, throw out state law when it comes to voter intent. </p><p> They're going to do a manual recount in the Senate race of all the ballots  that either didn't vote in the Senate race or double-voted. And there's a  very specific law for what voter intent is. You know, if you - if you  circle Rick Scott or Bill Nelson, that's fine. But you have to have done it  throughout the ballot.</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> RUBIO: The machine won't read it. They want to throw out that standard and  just let it be, I don't know what.</p><p> CARLSON: Can you change the standard after the voters cast votes (ph)?</p><p> RUBIO: That's my concern. I mean, look, if you say there was a problem with  the lawsuit (ph), the legislature is there for. But to have a judge come in  and announce that Florida law, after the election we're going to change the  rules in hopes of influencing the outcome, that, to me, is stealing the  election.</p><p> And then, they also want to force them to count every mail ballot, even the  ones in which the signature didn't match, the signature on file for the  voter. These are the two fundamental arguments before--</p><p> CARLSON: But just to ask (ph)--</p><p> RUBIO: --federal court.</p><p> CARLSON: --is that the requirement that the signature has to match?</p><p> RUBIO: Of course, yes, I mean--</p><p> CARLSON: So, if that's the existing requirement, how can they argue it's no  longer the requirement?</p><p> RUBIO: Because they're saying it's an arbitrary standard and who's making  the decision--</p><p> CARLSON: But that was the standard on Election Day, right?</p><p> RUBIO: Correct. And I think that's what I'm hoping, a reasonable judge, no  matter how activist it might be, would argue that's a good point. You  should have raised it before the election, and that's something for the  legislature to fix. But we're not going to change the rules of the election  after the election to influence the outcome, because if you do it, it's  stealing an election.</p><p> CARLSON: Amazing. So, I want to ask you about the question of nationalism.  The President described himself as a nationalist recently. He was attacked  by the leader of France for doing that. You recently published a Wall  Street Journal op-ed defending the idea of nationalism.</p><p> RUBIO: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: Why is nationalism a necessary concept in modern America?</p><p> RUBIO: Well, American nationalism.</p><p> CARLSON: Of course.</p><p> RUBIO: What is our identity? Our identity is not a common race, ethnicity.</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> RUBIO: In fact, America is a de facto rejection of that. It is  fundamentally premised on this notion. We are all children of God. We are  born with God - we're all created equal by our Creator. And we are given  equal rights to life, liberty, and to pursue happiness. </p><p> That is our national identity. It is deeply rooted in morals and in values.  It, in fact, explains everything this nation has done internationally and  domestically. We should be proud of that identity. We should defend that  national identity.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> RUBIO: Number two, I think most of the viewers watching this program would  be shocked to think that my job is to represent Belgium or my job is to  represent - I don't have nothing - I have nothing against Belgium. I always  pick on Belgium or Luxembourg. They have their own system of government.  That doesn't mean I need to be hostile towards them.</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> RUBIO: And it may be in our national interest to work with them. I think  NATO was in our national interest and is. I think a lot of our alliances  are built on that. And, in fact, our national - our national - our national  identity as a nation that believes in the equality of all people is what  has caused us to defend democracy and feed hungry--</p><p> CARLSON: Right.</p><p> RUBIO: --people all over the world. We should be proud of that. But, as a  government leader, my fundamental obligation, first and foremost, is to  work on behalf of the American people. And most of the time, if not all the  time, we can do that without hurting other people around the world.</p><p> CARLSON: It's hard to know what the argument against what you just said  might be. Why would people--</p><p> RUBIO: Well--</p><p> CARLSON: --object? No, I sincerely because--</p><p> RUBIO: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: --it's important to understand what - what the objections are.  What do you think they could be--</p><p> RUBIO: Well, there are two.</p><p> CARLSON: --willing to do (ph)?</p><p> RUBIO: One is they ascribe to nationalism, sort of the nationalism of the  Nazis or somebody else. That's ethnic and racial nationalism. I'm not  talking about ethnic nationalism.</p><p> CARLSON: Of course, not.</p><p> RUBIO: I'm talking about a national identity that actually is completely  relevant to your ethnicity. In fact, you didn't (ph) have to be born here.  If you come here legally, you can be a U.S. citizen. It's one of the great  things about America. Some of the people who love America are the most are  the people who are Americans by choice, they--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> RUBIO: --because they know what life is like in another country. Then  there's another school of thought that \"No, we are citizens of the  international community, and we have obligations to the rest of the world,\"  which I would agree within the confines of our national interest. </p><p> In fact, I've always argued that the best thing for the world is a strong  and prosperous America because our values infuse our decision-making and -  and - and so much of what we do. So, there are people that actually - I  think that's what Macron was arguing. </p><p> And that is that France's obligations under him anyways are not just for  the - to the French people, but to the sort of amorphous international  community, which I'm not against. I've defended international organizations  so long as they are in the national interest of the United States.</p><p> CARLSON: Because that's the country you represent.</p><p> RUBIO: Yes. I mean I swore an allegiance to the oath. I swore an oath to  the Constitution of the United States. I work for the American people. And  I believe I can do so while still being strong allies of Japan, strong  allies of Great - Great Britain, strong allies of--</p><p> CARLSON: Of course.</p><p> RUBIO: --our countries around - all these countries around the world,  especially when our interests intersect.</p><p> CARLSON: I think this is a vital conversation and I'm glad that we're  having it and I'm glad you're--</p><p> RUBIO: Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: --articulating it so clearly. Thank you, Senator.</p><p> RUBIO: Thank you for having me.</p><p> CARLSON: Well there's a battle over free speech going on in Washington  right now. Good. We're for free speech. The question is, are the people who  claim they're defending free speech actually defenders of speech? #Basta  (ph), whatever that means. We'll investigate the assault on free speech  after the break.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: In the past couple of days, you've heard a lot of huffing and  puffing about free speech and freedom of the press, and how those freedoms  are currently imperiled by the White House. </p><p> And to be clear, we are for free speech, unfettered, absolute free speech,  the kind of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment, and ratified  consistently by the Supreme Court. We've defended that kind of free speech  almost every night here for the past two years.</p><p> Many others, mostly on the Left, have attacked speech. So, we know who's  for free speech and who's against it. And we cannot help but notice that  some of free speech's greatest enemies are now posing as its defenders, all  of a sudden.</p><p> Take CNN, for example. It was CNN that almost single-handedly led the  campaign to have broadcaster Alex Jones banished from the internet on the  grounds that they didn't like what Jones had to say. Ultimately, CNN  succeeded in doing that. </p><p> The network convinced every major tech platform to ban Jones and his outlet  Infowars. You don't have to like Alex Jones to see that as a terrifying  loss for free speech because it was exactly that. But CNN was not done  trying to silence its critics.</p><p> Last year, the cable network threatened an anonymous Reddit user for  creating an anti-CNN meme. CNN threatened to expose his identity and ruin  his life if it ever was criticized by him again. Now, CNN is claiming to  defend free speech only when it's their speech.</p><p> You'll notice by the way that CNN did not object when the government  threatened to imprison employees of the cable channel RT, if they didn't  register as foreign agents. Yes, RT is owned by a foreign government, so is  the BBC.</p><p> Until last year, much of the New York Times was owned by a foreign  national. This is true of other news organizations, none of which has ever  registered as a foreign agent. But because RT is owned by Russia, which the  Left believes got Donald Trump elected, it is fine with CNN if they are  bullied and silenced.</p><p> So, call CNN what you will but don't pretend they are defenders of the  First Amendment. They are not.</p><p> Victor Davis Hanson is a Fellow at the Hoover Institution and a close  watcher of all this. He joins us tonight. So, I just want to be clear,  we're always for free speech, especially speech that's offensive, even by  obnoxious White House Correspondents.</p><p> But to see a channel that has lobbied against the right of others to say  what they think is true to all of a sudden emerge as this defender of the  First Amendment is nauseating.</p><p> VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, HOOVER INSTITUTION SENIOR FELLOW, AMERICAN CLASSICIST,  MILITARY HISTORIAN, COLUMNIST, FARMER: Yes. I - I think when people saw the  suit, they asked themselves was there anything in the past that Jim Acosta  had said negatively that got him kicked out and the answer was no. Was  there anybody MSNBC, did they get kicked out? The answer's no.</p><p> Do other CNN reporters get kicked out? No, they have passes. So, it was a  particular type of behavior. And I mean if you're arguing a case before the  Supreme Court, you can't go in there and take pictures or - or interrupt  the justice, they'll kick you out. And if you do it another time they'll  say we don't want you pleading the case before the Supreme Court.</p><p> He - Jim Acosta can't go in there barefooted, and say, I want to express  myself. There are certain protocols and norms of behavior and he's violated  them. That's one issue. And then, it's not - this is sort of a psychodrama,  Tucker.</p><p> I mean we - remember that the prior Administration monitored 20 AP  reporters and Fox's own James Rosen. Nobody filed a suit on behalf of James  Rosen from CNN, and said, \"My God, we only learned in 2013 that three years  ago the man was being surveilled by the Attorney General. This is a  violation of press freedom.\" We didn't hear that.</p><p> CARLSON: And - and you're not hearing CNN say anything about the voices  being silenced now online by the big tech companies--</p><p> HANSON: No, you've not.</p><p> CARLSON: --because they have unfashionable views. Can you, as a  philosophical matter, support free speech in some cases but not in others?</p><p> HANSON: I don't think you can. And then we get to another - we - if we want  to talk about ethics and the protocols of the White House, see, CNN, 93  percent of their coverage according to Shorenstein is bias, and Trump had  no problem with that. </p><p> He has no problem when the CNN host Kathy Griffin holds a decapitated  facsimile of his head. They have no problem when Anderson Cooper uses  obscenity or Rez - Reza Aslan says he's a piece of crap or people that are  guests and panelists say that he's a Russian asset or agent or they invoke  the Holocaust for comparison or people say that he's radicalized more  people than ISIS, remember that? </p><p> And they have these stories they keep running, you know, that Scaramucci  has involved with a Russian hedge fund, false, that Trump knew in advance  of the Russian meeting, that Donald Trump Jr. had access to the WikiLeaks.</p><p> I remember when CNN was just explaining to us as a matter of fact that  James Comey within a matter of hours was going to go into a Congressional  testimony and swear that Donald Trump had mischaracterized their private  meeting about whether he was subject to prosecution (ph)--</p><p> CARLSON: Well it does - doesn't make sense though (ph)--</p><p> HANSON: --it was all--</p><p> CARLSON: --because they--</p><p> HANSON: --it was all false.</p><p> CARLSON: --CNN has argued that others should lose their voice, should be  silenced--</p><p> HANSON: Yes, yes.</p><p> CARLSON: --because they're \"conspiracy theorists.\"</p><p> HANSON: Theorists.</p><p> CARLSON: But you're listing conspiracy theories that they have promulgated  on their air.</p><p> HANSON: Yes. And they're also arguing that their type of behavior should  not be subject to public scrutiny, but only Donald Trump's could (ph),  protocol, manners, politeness. </p><p> And that's what Trump's argument is it's not the content, it's not the  prejudice, it's not the unprofessionalism in the past, it's this particular  time you went over the edge, and you disrupted. You were rude. You took  over a - an optional press conference, nothing in the Constitution that  says he has to have a press conference.</p><p> I can remember President Reagan saying, \"I can't hear you.\" And when - when  somebody yells to Donald Trump, he runs over and talks. So, it's not only  hypocritical on their fact (ph) but it's a - it's a journalistic  organization that has violated the ethos of reporting and journalism then  calling the kettle black and saying you can't do this, this is against  White House--</p><p> CARLSON: I know.</p><p> HANSON: --protocol.</p><p> CARLSON: It's a - it's a shame--</p><p> HANSON: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: --to see a buffoon elevated to--</p><p> HANSON: It is.</p><p> CARLSON: --martyr status. But look, now that CNN's on the side of free  speech, I'm sure they'll be advocating for the right--</p><p> HANSON: I wish they have.</p><p> CARLSON: --of all people to say what they need.</p><p> HANSON: They could have sued in 2013 on the behalf of Fox and--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> HANSON: --and the - and the AP.</p><p> CARLSON: Victor Davis Hanson, a man with a long memory.</p><p> HANSON: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: And we appreciate that.</p><p> HANSON: Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: Thank you.</p><p> Well there used to be dozens of pro-Second Amendment Democrats in the  Congress. There aren't anymore. Now the party is increasingly calling for  disarming the public. Does the public want that? That's next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: Anyway if (ph) Democrats is entering the Congress, of course, one  of their top interests, they say, one of their top public policy  priorities, disarming the population. </p><p> Just a decade ago, about a quarter of candidates backed by the NRA were, in  fact, Democrats. Now, the number of NRA-backed House Democrats is three.  Meanwhile, a new poll of Democrats in early primary states says their top  issue after single-payer healthcare is repealing the Second Amendment in  order to ban guns.</p><p>Richard Goodstein is a lawyer, a former adviser to Bill and Hillary Clinton  and she - he joins us tonight. Richard, thanks for coming on.</p><p>RICHARD GOODSTEIN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, POLITICAL CONSULTANT, FORMER  CLINTON ADVISER: Sure.</p><p> CARLSON: So, is this really the time, as the country's becoming more  chaotic, to disarm the population?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes. So, I can't really speak for these people who respond to  this poll. I can tell you what Nancy Pelosi is talking about, what House  Democrats are talking about, which is background checks, which 90-percent  plus of the public supports, which got 54 votes in the Senate when it was  Toomey and Manchin, putting a bill to require gun background--</p><p> CARLSON: OK. OK. You know what I mean (ph)--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --checks.</p><p> CARLSON: --we've been through this a million times but--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: --but if - if Democrats polled and it seems like a legitimate poll  say their number two issue after socialized medicine is repealing the  Second Amendment, preparatory to disarming the population. You know, there  are going to be calls for that. </p><p> If the people, voters want it, you know, their - their representatives will  call for it. Is this the time? And should it make us, the rest of us, a  little nervous as America's getting crazier, obviously, to disarm normal  people?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes. Again, I just don't buy the notion that that was a legit  poll that even a quarter of Democrats think repealing the Second Amendment.  I--</p><p> CARLSON: What do you think of that?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: What - what I think the Democrats are saying is look, is what  Justice Scalia said in the famous Heller decision, the one case that really  went to the Supreme Court where he said, \"A person has a right to a handgun  to protect their home. Period.\" And that legitimate regulation of guns in  terms of places that they can't be taken, schools, places that, you know,  conditions on their sale--</p><p> CARLSON: But we have all those laws already. I mean--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: But I'm saying those are--</p><p> CARLSON: OK.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --so, no one's talking about repealing that.</p><p> CARLSON: No, no. People are and let's be - I mean let's stop lying just for  a second--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: --you're not going to stop mass shootings really unless you take  all the guns away. That's the truth. And everyone knows it. I mean,  honestly.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: So, that's kind of the goal, and everyone really knows that. And  I'm just wondering like what's the argument here? So, if you're arguing  simultaneously that the police are racist, they can't be trusted, which  Beto and lots of other candidates have argued, and also the population  can't be trusted to defend itself or have firearms, what are you really  saying?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: I think what Democrats are saying and, frankly, Republicans wish  they had been saying it because the ones backed by the NRA, Barbara  Comstock, Mike Coffman in Colorado lost to Democrats saying, \"We want  background check laws, and so forth.\"</p><p> And what they're saying is that things have gotten out of whack. The United  States is unique in the world. It's not a mental health problem. There are  mental health problems everywhere else in the world. But we have this  horrible gun problem here. So--</p><p> CARLSON: No, but actually we don't because most Americans are not a threat  to anybody. And this is what makes me nervous is a small percentage of  people commit the overwhelming majority of shootings. But we're not  thinking clearly about how to disarm them. </p><p> All these laws apply to me. I pose no threat to anyone, and I really want  to be able to defend myself. I know you do too. So, why not leave me out of  it and normal people out of it who pose no conceivable threat and focus on  the potential threats? But no one's ever - no one's ever up for doing that.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: We all have to be disarmed.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Of course.</p><p> CARLSON: Why?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Well again, no one's talking about disarming anybody.</p><p> CARLSON: No, they are no, no--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: What Nancy - well - well - what - what - what-- </p><p> CARLSON: --no, we (ph)--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --elected officials are saying is we should have background  checks, so lunatics--</p><p> CARLSON: --no, but that's not all--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --don't have the--</p><p> CARLSON: --no, but--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --access to guns.</p><p> CARLSON: --but the - the most - the most recent shooting and many of these  shootings have been committed by people who went through background checks.  Stephen Paddock went through a background check. The latest shooter in,  obviously, who we just saw in California went through a background check.  The truth is it's not just background checks, which nobody really opposes.  It's--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: No (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: --limiting the kind of firearms you can buy, limiting the size of  the magazines you can use, limiting the kinds of ammunition you can  purchase. These are laws, restrictions that affect normal people who should  be able to--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: --defend themselves. Why is that?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Look, when you say that nobody really opposes, when you get  Republican leaders here please ask them--</p><p> CARLSON: No, it's irrelevant (ph)--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --to affirm that that (ph)--</p><p> CARLSON: --we already have--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --they don't - well it's relevant (ph) look--</p><p> CARLSON: --but hold on--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --never we had (ph)--</p><p> CARLSON: --we even (ph) have background - I mean let's be serious.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: Background checks are - I buy guns, so I know.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: They're in place. You go through them when you buy a gun. Why  would a magazine restriction or an ammo restriction or a so-called assault  rifle restriction apply to me? What isn't - why am I not trusted to buy any  kind of gun I want? I'm confused, honestly.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Well, again, the analogy I would use is to the ways we basically  made cars safer. There used to be a lot more fatalities on the road, and we  instituted things like seatbelts and - and airbags and other things,  vehicles that could basically crush without crushing the passenger. And -  and background checks is the first way to go--</p><p> CARLSON: No, no, but - but then - then why - no, sincere question though.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: The assault rifle ban, a gun that looks scary should be banned,  OK? That's the position and a lot of candidates (ph) say they should be  confiscated. Why should my right to buy that gun be abridged? Why can't I  be--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: It's not being--</p><p> CARLSON: --no, it is though.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Well no one's being - if you object to being--</p><p> CARLSON: --no (ph), but why shouldn't I be able to buy that gun? I'm an  American citizen. I don't pose a threat to anybody. Why can't I have that  gun?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: I - I think the concern is that people get their hands on  assault weapons who commit these crimes. If you want to use your assault  weapon on a range, guess what? Go to a range and keep your gun there and  use it there.</p><p> CARLSON: Well maybe I want it in my house. And why - I - I don't  understand. So, what--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: You want assault (ph) weapons--</p><p> CARLSON: --what you're saying is--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --to defend your house.</p><p> CARLSON: --no, what you're saying is we don't trust the population of the  country. We don't think you're autonomous. We don't think you ought to be  able to make these decisions for yourself. We just don't trust you. And I'm  saying, why would I ever vote for someone who wouldn't trust me to have an  AR-15 at home, honestly?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Well - well, again, it's like saying we didn't trust people to  drive without seatbelts or airbags and so forth. But we instituted things  that were going to make people safer. What we're saying is it'd be--</p><p> CARLSON: No. But you don't use a car to defend yourself and you do use a  firearm to defend yourself, and why wouldn't you trust--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Cars kill people.</p><p> CARLSON: --no, why wouldn't you trust? There are 330 million people in the  country. Hundreds of millions of them pose no conceivable threat to  anybody.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: So, why can't we think of a law that spares them these  regulations? Is anybody even trying to think of that?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Of course, they are but the--</p><p> CARLSON: Oh, really? Who?</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --well, but again, we're - we're taking it step up step. We're  taking it step by step.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes, we are.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: I mean a - ask any suburban mother, that's the problem  politically is that these people that--</p><p> CARLSON: I don't care about the politics.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --that you lost last time are going to be lost--</p><p> CARLSON: I'm just telling you--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --because they don't want more guns in school.</p><p> CARLSON: --the Left is making this country chaotic and scary--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: --and simultaneously trying to keep me from defending myself. And  that's not--</p><p>GOODSTEIN: The voters just happen not to buy (ph) what--</p><p> CARLSON: --going to happen.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: --you just said.</p><p> CARLSON: I don't care.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: And - and that's why the Democrats won this time (ph).</p><p> CARLSON: I don't care.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: OK.</p><p> CARLSON: OK. We'll see.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: Richard, thank you.</p><p>GOODSTEIN: Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: Amazon is getting billions of taxpayer dollars to expand into two  of America's richest cities. It's corporate welfare. The Democratic Party  is all on board. And anyone who questions it could be investigated by an  incoming Committee Chairman. What's going on? We'll get to that in just a  minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: Well Florida isn't the only state with a high-stakes recount in  progress. Just to the north, in Georgia, Democrat Stacey Abrams (ph) has  refused to concede in the Governor's race. Legal challenges are flying  everywhere. </p><p> Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown says that if Abrams is not declared the  winner, then almost by definition Republicans, quote, stole the race. Lisa  Boothe of Independent Women's Voice has been following this for us.</p><p> LISA BOOTHE, FOX NEWS CO-HOST, OUTNUMBERED, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE  SENIOR FELLOW: Hi, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: She joins us now with an update. Hey, Lisa?</p><p> BOOTHE: Oh, and Hillary Clinton is also saying that if a - that it would  not be - it's not a fair race if Stacey Abrams doesn't win that somehow  this race is not fair. Mind you, Brian Kemp is up by 55,000 votes and  Stacey Abrams would need 18,000 to force a runoff and 16,000 to force a  recount. </p><p> There is only one county that has not certified the results of the  election. That's Gwinnett County. A 158 out of the 159 counties have  certified the results of the election. So, she is not going to find those  numbers. She is not going to be Governor of Georgia. </p><p> Yet, she refuses to concede. And now, we have Democrats like Sherrod Brown  and Hillary Clinton making up excuses and saying that somehow there's voter  suppression or something is awry if Stacey Abrams does not win this  election.</p><p> CARLSON: So, I mean, presumably, the goal is to infuriate Democrats in the  state of Florida sufficient that they come out to vote in 2020. I mean  there - I got to be thinking long-term, right?</p><p> BOOTHE: Yes. I think what's - well I think Stacey Abrams is actually  looking ahead at 2020, a possible run - run against Senator Perdue. So, I  think that's why she's trying to hang in there. But it's sort of ridiculous  to have Hillary Clinton be saying this because you essentially have two  losers being sore losers with Hillary Clinton and Stacey Abrams. </p><p> Of course, we know Hillary Clinton still refuses to accept the results of  the 2016 election and that voters just weren't that into her, didn't want  her, didn't elect her, and it's Russia's fault, and everyone else's fault.  I mean she literally wrote a book blaming everything else, but herself, for  her own election loss. So, it looks like the Democrats are the sore losers  and refuse to accept the results of the election.</p><p> CARLSON: Amazing. I don't think there's a substantive case they're making,  it doesn't sound like. Lisa Boothe, thank you for that update--</p><p> BOOTHE: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p> CARLSON: --and all of them.</p><p> BOOTHE: Appreciate it.</p><p> CARLSON: Well elements of the Right and the Left have finally found  something they can agree on, at least for the moment, opposing corporate  welfare for Amazon. Jeff Bezos' colossus is getting billions in taxpayer  subsidies to open new headquarters in New York and Northern Virginia, and  that's not all.</p><p> As part of the deal for Amazon, the Commonwealth of Virginia is promising  to warn the company about any Freedom of Information requests it receives  about Amazon. </p><p> Kieran Lalor is the Republican in the New York Assembly. He sent a letter  to the Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo questioning the wisdom of this  deal, and he joins us tonight.</p><p> So, this is a little bit confusing considering that New York City has a lot  of infrastructure needs, for example. You'd think Amazon, run by the  richest guy in the world would be bringing something to the table. But  instead, the taxpayers of New York are paying him to come? How does this  work?</p><p> KIERAN MICHAEL LALOR, NEW YORK ASSEMBLYMAN, ENTREPRENEUR, AUTHOR: You  know,  it - it's incredible. It's guaranteed to be a boondoggle. What - what we're  seeing here is the most powerful, richest person in the world going to be  subsidized by regular people. We know that Amazon in - in some cases,  destroys other companies that can't compete--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> LALOR: --destroys jobs. It's one thing if that happens in our free  enterprise system. But it's yet - it's another thing to subsidize that, and  as some of the very people whose jobs and businesses are going to be  destroyed to subsidize this monster, Amazon.</p><p> CARLSON: Well Amazon is a monopoly. So, by definition, I - I think it's the  enemy of the - of the free market. Who cut this deal for the State of New  York?</p><p> LALOR: You know, it's fascinating. Governor Cuomo is giving about $1.7  billion with a B in state dollars. De Blasio is giving another billion  dollars in New York City money. And it's interesting because if this was a  good deal, Governor Cuomo stood for election just eight days ago, why  didn't he announce this or - or get word of this--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> LALOR: --out before the election? If this was a good deal, he certainly  would have done that. He knows this is a bad deal. And you know what's  interesting? You have Liberals like Cuomo and de Blasio, and what they're  doing is they're introducing a bizarro form of supply-side economics. </p><p> They're saying lower taxes, lower business costs create jobs. But we're not  going to do real supply-side economics where everybody gets a tax cut and  everybody gets to compete. We're going to - we're going to pick one winner  and let everybody else think while one big ship gets to rise.</p><p> CARLSON: Well it's such a good point. Is it weird to see self-described  Liberals acting as the servants of the richest man in the world?</p><p> LALOR: Yes. It - it is. It is very strange. But I'll - I'll give them a  little bit of credit. You know, we live in a divided time here in the  United States. They have unified the Left and the Right. The New York Times  is against this. The conservative New York Post editorial page is against  this. </p><p> The - the darling of the Left, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York City  Liberal, is against it. Upstate conservatives like me are against it.  Unions are against it. Business organizations are against it. The only ones  who seem to be for it are Amazon, Cuomo, and De Blasio.</p><p> CARLSON: In the State of Virginia, as bad as everything you've just  described is, in the State of Virginia, the Democratic State of Virginia,  run by Liberals, they have agreed to warn Amazon if news organizations file  Freedom of Information request trying to learn about Amazon. I don't think  I've ever seen anything that corrupt. Is there a justification--</p><p> LALOR: You know, that reminds me--</p><p> CARLSON: --for that?</p><p> Interviewee: --that reminds me of the Gilded Age where - where some of the  companies have become more powerful than the United States government.  That's scary stuff--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> LALOR: --right there. But I'll give - I'll give Virginia one thing. They're  getting the same number of promised jobs and they're paying one-third the  price. We're paying over $1.5 billion for about 25,000 jobs from New York  State. </p><p>Virginia's paying a half a billion, they're getting the same number of  jobs. That was one of my top questions for Governor Cuomo in my letter  today. I'd love to see the answer to that.</p><p> CARLSON: So, I mean how can you get the answer? And what can you do about  it? I mean you're a lawmaker in the State. Cuomo's not King. Can you undo  this deal?</p><p> LALOR: You know, we've had a long string of horrible economic development  deals in New York State in the six years that I've been in the legislature,  and it's very difficult to get job creation numbers. </p><p> You know, they can say, \"Oh, we're going to create so this number jobs.\"  But when you ask them, \"Well, OK, how many have you created? What's the  benchmark? Where are we, one year, two years, three years in?\" you have to  file a FOIA request, newspapers have to file a FOIA request, it's very  difficult to get information now. </p><p> He's here to cut the ribbon. When this boondoggle fails, he'll be long gone  and he'll be out of politics or running for something else, and he won't be  here to pick up the pieces, but regular New Yorkers will.</p><p> CARLSON: You got to wonder too about the location of this deal. So, people  who visit New York think it's a very rich place because New York City is  the financial capital of the world. But Upstate New York, parts of it are,  have a lot of poverty, real poverty. Americans suffering, no jobs, high  drug abuse rate, I mean you're very aware--</p><p> LALOR: Yes. It's dying, it's dying, I should say (ph)--</p><p> CARLSON: --well, so it's dying. That's exactly right. It's a beautiful  place with great people and it's dying. But Amazon did not choose to help  revitalize that part of the state. But they moved to the richest part of  the state. What does that tell you?</p><p> LALOR: You know, and - and, I don't want to say $25,000 or every (ph) drop  in the bucket. But if it could be a drop in the bucket, New York City, the  metropolis of New York City is a drop in the bucket. If you situated this  facility in the middle of Central New York or--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> LALOR: --the northern part of the Hudson Valley, you would save an entire  region. You would revitalize an entire region and save, you know, what was  once a thriving part of our manufacturing base. But to put it here--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> LALOR: --in New York City. Here's a point, I also would like Governor Cuomo  to answer. How do you know they weren't coming anyway? New York City is the  media capital. It's the financial capital. It has one of the most educated  dynamic workforces. </p><p> Wouldn't they be coming here anyway? I mean they're not going to go to  Peoria, right? They're going to come to New York City. So, did we just get  played?</p><p> And another thing. The - the headquarters was supposed to be one second  headquarters. Then it got put to two second headquarters, one in Virginia,  one in New York.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> LALOR: I'd like to know, did Cuomo reduce his - his bid when the  headquarters got split in two?</p><p> CARLSON: I hope you find out.</p><p> LALOR: Governor Cuomo did you--</p><p> CARLSON: If you find out--</p><p> LALOR: I'm trying, I'm trying.</p><p> CARLSON: --the answer to that, come back Assemblyman because we want to  know.</p><p> LALOR: I will. I will.</p><p> CARLSON: Thank you.</p><p> LALOR: All right.</p><p> CARLSON: New York should be proud to have you.</p><p> Well tonight's an anniversary for our show. We're sentimental. We mark all  anniversaries. We'll tell you what it is, after the break.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CARLSON: Well tonight marks the second anniversary of this show. Since we  can't take the show out to dinner to celebrate, instead, we're going to  show you a clip of what it first looked like when it launched at 7:00  Eastern two years ago tonight.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: That's it, the first episode of TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. We'll be  back every weeknight. What's the show going to be about? You can judge for  yourself. But here's the basic theme of it. People in power tend to lie,  not because they want to but because they can't help themselves. </p><p> That's human nature. The more power people have, the bigger the temptation  to misuse it. The press is supposed to be the watchdog against all of this  and it worked fine for a couple of centuries. Then the press decided they  had more in common with certain politicians than with readers or viewers,  and that's when it fell apart.</p><p> We're going to get back to basics here. We're going to hold the powerful  accountable, pierce pomposity, translate doublespeak, mock smugness and  barbecue nonsense, every night, hope you'll watch.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CARLSON: So they made me get a haircut before - before the first show. I  totally forgot until I just saw it. </p><p> People in power tend to lie. That was the theme then. That's the theme  tonight. That will always be the theme because that is always true whether  the show's at 7 o'clock or 9 o'clock or now at 8 o'clock, we intend to  stick to those promises and tell the truth, regardless.</p><p> Thank you, by the way, for making this show pretty successful more than we  ever thought it would be. Your loyalty has meant everything and made all  the difference. We appreciate it.</p><p> That's it for us tonight. We'll be back tomorrow, the show that is the  sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink. Good night from  Washington. </p><p> Sean Hannity, live from New York City.</p><p> SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST, HANNITY: All right. First, congratulations on  two years.</p><p> CARLSON: Thank you.</p><p> HANNITY: You deserve all it - all of it. You're right. We - we don't have  this job without those great audience. That is all true.</p><p> CARLSON: That's for sure. That is true.</p><p> HANNITY: All right, one thing I got to add, this is your second-year  anniversary. When you get in your 23rd years, there's a little bit of this  white stuff that's going to start sneaking in. I'm just warning you just  (ph)--</p><p> CARLSON: Oh, no, no. Crease and (ph) formula--</p><p> HANNITY: Congratulations.</p><p> CARLSON: That's where I'm going.</p><p> HANNITY: All right, Tucker, thanks and--</p><p> CARLSON: Thanks, Sean.</p><p> HANNITY: --all the best, as always.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

The interviews lasted roughly 90 minutes and interviewees were asked how big a portion of their revenue Amazon sales make up, three merchants told Bloomberg. Experts told Bloomberg the length of the interviews and the number of staff assigned to them indicate the FTC is in the early stages of an official probe into Amazon. </p><p>Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[1]  A new report from Bloomberg[2] appears to indicate that the Federal Trade Commission ramping up an investigation into Amazon over its marketplace. Attorneys and at least one economist have been conducting lengthy, in-depth interviews with small businesses that sell their products through Amazon, three of the merchants interviewed told Bloomberg. They were specifically asked how much of their revenue comes from Amazon sales as opposed to other e-commerce sites including Walmart and eBay, and the interviews lasted roughly 90 minutes. Vox reported in June[3] that the FTC had started speaking to the company's competitors[4] to gain some insight into its business practices. It did not name who these competitors were, and noted that these talks did not necessarily mean a full-blown investigation was underway.

Both Amazon and the FTC declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg, and neither were immediately available for comment when contacted by Business Insider. Amazon is far from the only tech company to be put under an antitrust microscope. The FTC opened an investigation into Facebook in June[6], and earlier this week 50 state attorneys general announced a probe into Google[7]. Amazon is also already the subject of an antitrust investigation by the EU[8], officially announced in July.NOW WATCH: 5 things wrong with Apple's lightning cable[9]See Also: These 2 websites will

The Left always wantsmore. They are theOliver Twist[1]of regulations. </p><p>So let's not hand them the keys to DC next Tuesday, eh? Simplistically but accurately speaking, the Internet was privatized in the 1990s. A Republican Congress wrote a telecommunications bill - basically leaving it regulation-free. Which Democrat President Bill Clintonsigned[2]into law. So the baseline for regulation was - none. A concept that, of course, never sat well with the Left. Once it became clear how incredible and incredibly huge the Internet could and would be - the Left started looking for ways to dig government's hooks into it - so it could then begin reeling it in. Because there was simply no way We the People should be allowed to have that much speech and economic freedom. The overarching grab-bag power grab - was the very awfulNetwork Neutrality[3]. A phrase and conceptcoined[4]by Marxist college professor - please pardon the redundancy - Tim Wu in 2003. The Left then spent the next half-decade trying to get Congress to pass a law imposing Net Neutrality. That was a huge no-go - even after the Democrats took the majorities in 2006. Then came the very unfortunate Barack Obama Administration. Which unilaterally imposed Net Neutrality in2010[5]- which the courtsdumped[6]. So it imposed an even worse, more virulent strain of Net Neutrality in2015[7]- which the ensuing Donald Trump Administration thankfullyundid[8]. But you're noticing the Left's Oliver Twist-ian regulatory ratchet upward - always upward. It's never less regs - always more. Speaking of Leftists and regulatory insanity - behold California. Which in September passed alaw[9]imposing Net Neutrality - that makes Obama's second Net Neutrality look like very thin gruel indeed. (Please forgive the continued Twist-ian references.) Upward - always upward. Every Internet Service Provider (ISP) on, I believe, Planet Earth -sued[10]California. Asdid[11]the Trump Administration. The Administration in fact - got California to stand down on the law's imposition until its case is settled. About which Trump Administration Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Ajit Pai rightlynoted[12]: 'I am pleased that California has agreed not to enforce its onerous Internet regulations. This substantial concession reflects the strength of the case made by the United States earlier this month. It also demonstrates, contrary to the claims of the law's supporters, that there is no urgent problem that these regulations are needed to address.' The lack of urgency of Net Neutrality being demonstrated by - nigh the entire history of the Internet being Net Neutrality-free. All the while it has become a free speech-free market Xanadu - and the greatest and fastest growing thing in the history of humanity. Like when anything is new, when the Internet was new - it was like being in an unlit, pitch black room full of coffee tables. We didn't really know where we were going - or what to do. But we knew what not to do - when we banged our shin on a table. 'Well, let's not do that again.' Two-plus decades later - we have a much better idea of the Internet landscape. We better know what requires some government. (See: Dealing with Big Tech companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon's MASSIVE abuses of their MASSIVE power.) What could maybe use some government. And what absolutely does not need any government at all. Net Neutrality is definitively in the latter category. It is a massive new imposition - of a whole lot of additional government.

The Left always wantsmore. They are theOliver Twist[1]of regulations. </p><p>So let's not hand them the keys to DC next Tuesday, eh? Simplistically but accurately speaking, the Internet was privatized in the 1990s. A Republican Congress wrote a telecommunications bill - basically leaving it regulation-free. Which Democrat President Bill Clintonsigned[2]into law. So the baseline for regulation was - none. A concept that, of course, never sat well with the Left. Once it became clear how incredible and incredibly huge the Internet could and would be - the Left started looking for ways to dig government's hooks into it - so it could then begin reeling it in. Because there was simply no way We the People should be allowed to have that much speech and economic freedom. The overarching grab-bag power grab - was the very awfulNetwork Neutrality[3]. A phrase and conceptcoined[4]by Marxist college professor - please pardon the redundancy - Tim Wu in 2003. The Left then spent the next half-decade trying to get Congress to pass a law imposing Net Neutrality. That was a huge no-go - even after the Democrats took the majorities in 2006. Then came the very unfortunate Barack Obama Administration. Which unilaterally imposed Net Neutrality in2010[5]- which the courtsdumped[6]. So it imposed an even worse, more virulent strain of Net Neutrality in2015[7]- which the ensuing Donald Trump Administration thankfullyundid[8]. But you're noticing the Left's Oliver Twist-ian regulatory ratchet upward - always upward. It's never less regs - always more. Speaking of Leftists and regulatory insanity - behold California. Which in September passed alaw[9]imposing Net Neutrality - that makes Obama's second Net Neutrality look like very thin gruel indeed. (Please forgive the continued Twist-ian references.) Upward - always upward. Every Internet Service Provider (ISP) on, I believe, Planet Earth -sued[10]California. Asdid[11]the Trump Administration. The Administration in fact - got California to stand down on the law's imposition until its case is settled. About which Trump Administration Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Ajit Pai rightlynoted[12]: 'I am pleased that California has agreed not to enforce its onerous Internet regulations. This substantial concession reflects the strength of the case made by the United States earlier this month. It also demonstrates, contrary to the claims of the law's supporters, that there is no urgent problem that these regulations are needed to address.' The lack of urgency of Net Neutrality being demonstrated by - nigh the entire history of the Internet being Net Neutrality-free. All the while it has become a free speech-free market Xanadu - and the greatest and fastest growing thing in the history of humanity. Like when anything is new, when the Internet was new - it was like being in an unlit, pitch black room full of coffee tables. We didn't really know where we were going - or what to do. But we knew what not to do - when we banged our shin on a table. 'Well, let's not do that again.' Two-plus decades later - we have a much better idea of the Internet landscape. We better know what requires some government. (See: Dealing with Big Tech companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon's MASSIVE abuses of their MASSIVE power.) What could maybe use some government. And what absolutely does not need any government at all. Net Neutrality is definitively in the latter category. It is a massive new imposition - of a whole lot of additional government. All of which we have spent the last quarter century - demonstrating is completely unnecessary.

This substantial concession reflects the strength of the case made by the United States earlier this month. It also demonstrates, contrary to the claims of the law's supporters, that there is no urgent problem that these regulations are needed to address.\"<br/>The lack of urgency of Net Neutrality being demonstrated by - nigh the entire history of the Internet being Net Neutrality-free.\u00a0 All the while it has become a free speech-free market Xanadu - and the greatest and fastest growing thing in the history of humanity.<br/>Like when anything is new, when the Internet was new - it was like being in an unlit, pitch black room full of coffee tables.\u00a0 We didn't really know where we were going - or what to do.<br/>But we knew what not to do - when we banged our shin on a table.\u00a0 \"Well, let's not do that again.\"<br/>Two-plus decades later - we have a much better idea of the Internet landscape.<br/>We better know what requires some government.\u00a0 (See: Dealing with Big Tech companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon's MASSIVE abuses of their MASSIVE power.)<br/>What could maybe use some government.<br/>And what absolutely does not need any government at all.<br/>Net Neutrality is definitively in the latter category.<br/>It is a massive new imposition - of a whole lot of additional government.<br/>All of which we have spent the last quarter century - demonstrating is completely unnecessary.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-40848</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WC8-PRS1-JCMP-50M5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"619\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 Heartland Institute, USA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Heartland Institute</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 29, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>InfoTech &amp;

Simplistically but accurately speaking, the Internet was privatized in the 1990s. A Republican Congress wrote a telecommunications bill - basically leaving it regulation-free. Which Democrat President Bill Clintonsigned[2]into law. So the baseline for regulation was - none. A concept that, of course, never sat well with the Left. Once it became clear how incredible and incredibly huge the Internet could and would be - the Left started looking for ways to dig government's hooks into it - so it could then begin reeling it in. Because there was simply no way We the People should be allowed to have that much speech and economic freedom. The overarching grab-bag power grab - was the very awfulNetwork Neutrality[3]. A phrase and conceptcoined[4]by Marxist college professor - please pardon the redundancy - Tim Wu in 2003. The Left then spent the next half-decade trying to get Congress to pass a law imposing Net Neutrality. That was a huge no-go - even after the Democrats took the majorities in 2006. Then came the very unfortunate Barack Obama Administration. Which unilaterally imposed Net Neutrality in2010[5]- which the courtsdumped[6]. So it imposed an even worse, more virulent strain of Net Neutrality in2015[7]- which the ensuing Donald Trump Administration thankfullyundid[8]. But you're noticing the Left's Oliver Twist-ian regulatory ratchet upward - always upward. It's never less regs - always more. Speaking of Leftists and regulatory insanity - behold California. Which in September passed alaw[9]imposing Net Neutrality - that makes Obama's second Net Neutrality look like very thin gruel indeed. (Please forgive the continued Twist-ian references.) Upward - always upward. Every Internet Service Provider (ISP) on, I believe, Planet Earth -sued[10]California. Asdid[11]the Trump Administration. The Administration in fact - got California to stand down on the law's imposition until its case is settled. About which Trump Administration Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Ajit Pai rightlynoted[12]: 'I am pleased that California has agreed not to enforce its onerous Internet regulations. This substantial concession reflects the strength of the case made by the United States earlier this month. It also demonstrates, contrary to the claims of the law's supporters, that there is no urgent problem that these regulations are needed to address.' The lack of urgency of Net Neutrality being demonstrated by - nigh the entire history of the Internet being Net Neutrality-free. All the while it has become a free speech-free market Xanadu - and the greatest and fastest growing thing in the history of humanity. Like when anything is new, when the Internet was new - it was like being in an unlit, pitch black room full of coffee tables. We didn't really know where we were going - or what to do. But we knew what not to do - when we banged our shin on a table. 'Well, let's not do that again.' Two-plus decades later - we have a much better idea of the Internet landscape. We better know what requires some government. (See: Dealing with Big Tech companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon's MASSIVE abuses of their MASSIVE power.) What could maybe use some government. And what absolutely does not need any government at all. Net Neutrality is definitively in the latter category. It is a massive new imposition - of a whole lot of additional government. All of which we have spent the last quarter century - demonstrating is completely unnecessary.

They are the Oliver Twist of regulations.</p><p>So let's not hand them the keys to DC next Tuesday, eh?</p><p>Simplistically but accurately speaking, the Internet was privatized in the 1990s. A Republican Congress wrote a telecommunications bill basically leaving it regulation-free. Which Democrat President Bill Clinton signed into law.</p><p>So the baseline for regulation was none. A concept that, of course, never sat well with the Left.</p><p>Once it became clear how incredible and incredibly huge the Internet could and would be the Left started looking for ways to dig government's hooks into it so it could then begin reeling it in.</p><p>Because there was simply no way We the People should be allowed to have that much speech and economic freedom.</p><p>The overarching grab-bag power grab was the very awful Network Neutrality. A phrase and concept coined by Marxist college professor please pardon the redundancy Tim Wu in 2003.</p><p>The Left then spent the next half-decade trying to get Congress to pass a law imposing Net Neutrality. That was a huge no-go even after the Democrats took the majorities in 2006.</p><p>Then came the very unfortunate <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>Administration. Which unilaterally imposed Net Neutrality in 2010 which the courts dumped. So it imposed an even worse, more virulent strain of Net Neutrality in 2015 which the ensuing <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>Administration thankfully undid.</p><p>But you're noticing the Left's Oliver Twist-ian regulatory ratchet upward always upward. It's never less regs always more.</p><p>Speaking of Leftists and regulatory insanity behold California. Which in September passed a law imposing Net Neutrality that makes Obama's second Net Neutrality look like very thin gruel indeed. (Please forgive the continued Twist-ian references.) Upward always upward.</p><p>Every Internet Service Provider (ISP) on, I believe, Planet Earth suedCalifornia. As did the <person><nameText>Trump Administration.</nameText></person></p><p>The Administration in fact got California to stand down on the law's imposition until its case is settled. About which <person><nameText>Trump Administration </nameText></person>Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Ajit Pai rightly noted:</p><p>\"I am pleased that California has agreed not to enforce its onerous Internet regulations. This substantial concession reflects the strength of the case made by the United States earlier this month. It also demonstrates, contrary to the claims of the law's supporters, that there is no urgent problem that these regulations are needed to address.\"</p><p>The lack of urgency of Net Neutrality being demonstrated by nigh the entire history of the Internet being Net Neutrality-free. All the while it has become a free speech-free market Xanadu and the greatest and fastest growing thing in the history of humanity.</p><p>Like when anything is new, when the Internet was new it was like being in an unlit, pitch black room full of coffee tables. We didn't really know where we were going or what to do.</p><p>But we knew what not to do when we banged our shin on a table. \"Well, let's not do that again.\"</p><p>Two-plus decades later we have a much better idea of the Internet landscape.</p><p>We better know what requires some government. (See: Dealing with Big Tech companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon's MASSIVE abuses of their MASSIVE power.)</p><p>What could maybe use some government.</p><p>And what absolutely does not need any government at all.</p><p>Net Neutrality is definitively in the latter category.</p><p>It is a massive new imposition of a whole lot of additional government.</p><p>All of which we have spent the last quarter century demonstrating is completely unnecessary.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1122487629</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TM1-26X1-DYTH-G12F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"641\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 29, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
